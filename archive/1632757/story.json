She took good care of him though she accidentally sat on him before almost killing him. Karina helped with a little experimental machine that not just healed back his whole body, but made it far stronger than before. After that, Joana took him to school and one of those days Cynthia caught her off-guard just to find a tiny version of the boy she wanted for herself. She took him away and tortured him though also teased him tempting him to leave his girlfriend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoana and Karina had to think a plan to get him back, but to make things worse; Lillian and Claire had heard what they were talking about and the plan of getting Blake back became a four-sided hunting competition between Joana and Karina, versus Lillian versus Claire or all versus Cynthia... Blake had been caught and tortured briefly, by Lillian just to be caught by Claire who though didn't torture him teased him continuously and repeatedly offered him to abandon Joana and go out with her which he refused stating they were just friends though long time ones. Blake could appeal to her heart knowing that even if she wanted him she loved him enough to let him go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe let her know that he could spend time with her, but just as friends. Claire was saddened because Joana would not let her spend much time with him. After all they had had several fights over him. Claire remembered how she needed at least 6 years to get Blake to be just a good friend and Blake was Joana's boyfriend in 3 years. In the end, Claire loved him enough to let him go and gave him back to Joana who was surprised at first; but understood that she was not like Cynthia. As Blake's friend, she could not keep him knowing she was keeping him away from the girl he truly loved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that, they went on some adventures and got into trouble trying to find Blaze. They failed at finding him, but Blaze appeared before them instead. He tried to kill them all, but something prevented him from doing so and that mysterious thing forced Blaze to unshrink Blake instead. Blaze and Blake had a very violent and epic duel where it was shown how far a mortal could go. Blake could deal damage to Blaze and after getting severely hurt, Blaze left saying that Blake was not ready yet...that he still had to reach full power. The mysterious force healed Blake and teleported him with all of his friends back at Joana's department. The last thing they could see was a golden light shaped as a man with two extended feathered wings...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2 years later<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake and Joana live together and go to last grade of high school. Lillian, knowing she betrayed Joana, avoided her as much as possible. Blake kept his promise of spending time with Claire who was quite lonely without him and even began to be friends with Joana. After 2 years, they even joked about their past rivalry despite that certain tension between them still existed...</span></div></div>",

Joana saw that Blake hurried out and seems to know why. She went toward the school's gym where Blake was training by lifting weight. She left and hung out with her friends (near the school at a near cafeteria) for about an hour. She went to the gym again, but found no one; she was beginning to worry and searched for him for about half of an hour until she got to the nearby woods where she heard a crashing sound a feared the worst. She ran toward the sound and much to her amazement and her dismay Blake was practicing his fighting (Blake's style is street fight) breaking several standing planks with single punches, kicks, and moving at an amazing speed almost inhuman if not inhuman already. Blake seemed to move as fast as the wind and about of 50 planks were shattered in matter of minutes. After he took a breath, Joana walked toward him and he said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I knew you were here minutes ago...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Blake! You had me worried! I thought that...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I'm fine. Nothing has happened, yet...\"- Blake interrupted Joana<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You think he'll come back?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I know he will, and I better be ready for that...\"- Blake assured, he somehow, not just thought it, he knew it, he felt that his enemy would come back...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"But, Blake... it's been two years...\"- Joana said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Yeah, but I still have to improve, and don't complain, it's not like I neglected you\"- Blake replied, and Joana blushed<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake wiped himself off with a towel and put his black shirt on and his leather jacket back on, then he said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I'm done for today, I guess that's you wanted to hear\"- Joana hugged and kissed him, then, she said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Yes, I wanted to hear that. By the way...how the hell do you fight like that? your moves were awesome! you looked more like a superhero than a 18 years old boy\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Huh? It was nothing, Karina's machine enhanced my body... you know...And...I'm no superhero...one minute!? a boy?! You still call me a boy?! I'm 18, ma'am\"- Blake said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You could be 30 or any age, but you will be always my little boy\"- Joana hugged him tightly<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Of course... just because when you were born TV was white &amp; black you think everyone's young\"- Blake laughed at his joke, and Joana blushed, pretending to be mad, knocked him on the head playfully and said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I'm not THAT old, I'm just a year older than you\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Okay, okay\"- Blake said, and began to walk, after some seconds he felt that someone threw him down, he tried to move and he looked around, just to find that Joana tackled him<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"That's for calling me old\"- she joked and helped him up<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was no harm and Blake wasn't damaged, but he got scared instead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Don't do that again... I thought Blaze had appeared\"- She laughed and kissed him again<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You have to do something if you want me to forgive you\"- she said, still joking<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Like what?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You have to teach me to fight like you\"- Blake blushed at this, and answered<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You don't need to fight\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I could help you fighting Blaze\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I don't mean to be rude or anything, but he'd mop the floor with you, and then he'd kick your butt, though that wouldn't hurt you so much...anyway, I don't want your butt to get kicked\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Are you saying I'm weak?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"No, you're strong... though I learned that by the bad way\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Bad way?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Yeah... after saving you from that bully the first day, you tried to squeeze the life out of me...\"- Joana hugged him as strongly as she could and said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Aren't you a strong boy? It's not like you were gonna break\"- She had no answer and Blake said, with a suffocate-sounding voice<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"...can't...breathe...\"- Joana slapped him playfully (not the violent SMACKS we see when a girl hits a pervert)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Anyway... Blaze is no human... I thought he was just a martial artist but when I fought him for the first time... he's far stronger that I can imagine... To a degree science can't explain... He's simply above all human abilities... I can't let you fight such a beast...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"But, the second time, you fought at his same level... I remember, he got real damage\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"He didn't fight seriously; he fought exactly like the first time. I don't know how powerful can he really be, he hasn't shown his full power yet. I can't let you run such risk. Besides that, Blaze's only after me, you don't have anything to worry about\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Don't talk like that, I worry about you\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Well...you get my point... If I die, it's just over...\"- Blake said. There was a silence, then, Joana asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Tell me... how strong do you think I am? do you think I'm the damsel in distress?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You're not the damsel in distress...and... I guess you're strong... you kicked Cinthya's ass two years ago, and Marylyn\u2019s before that\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Do you think I could defeat Karina or Claire?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I would bet, but it wouldn't that easy. Karina is like me, and has good fighting skills, I should remind you that when I got my normal size again, Blaze had taken down all of my friends* and Karina was the only one who could still stand up against him. But maybe because she's lighter you could pin her down, but you'd have a hard time there. And about you vs Claire, well, you know some of my moves by watching me, but she's watched me twice the time you have, though you practice sports and have a nice condition. She doesn't but she's strong too, she even once defeated Karina% though she supposedly didn't knew anything about fighting, and has almost Chun-Li legs type#. You two are almost at the same level\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"OK, whatever, let's go home\"- She said, grabbing his hand<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size25\" style=\"\"><b>*The ones who fought Blaze that day were: Ayrton, Ferdinand, Daniel, Caesar, Gustave, Anthony, Karina and even Joana. the guys were slightly better than average and the ones who resisted for most were in order: Karina, Ferdinand, Ayrton and Joana herself. Rest of the guys were taken down with few hits as Blaze was fighting at the level that overwhelmed Blake the first time. I'll describe the guys later...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n%Blake met first Karina as an enemy/rival, and few days later met Claire as a friend, when all of them were 9. One of those days, Karina attacked Blake and Claire engaged her, surprisingly, defeating her, even when she had no fighting skills she used her physical advantage to beat her. Also Claire convinced her that Blake wasn't a bad guy. (The difference is that when Claire fought Karina, she immobilized her, while when fought Blaze, was a real fight, proving with this that she was the second strongest after Blake)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n#In a quick comparison, requested by some readers, A quick description of the girls: <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire: Asian eyes, black hair, fair skin, big boobs (C-cups, well, according to my friends. She's never told what is her size exactly... at least not that I know) and thighs though Claire's aren't so muscular, and in fact, Claire is 3/4 japanese. She was actually nicknamed 'Chun-Li' at first because she beat up a bully at 5th grade, and her asian looks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoana: Brown wavy hair, fair skin, borwn-hazel eyes, bigger boobs (D-cups), bigger butt. Her body is soft but well-toned, as she plays volleyball and basketball regularly. Joana is fully Spanish -not latino like Blake-</b></font></span></div></div>",

When he woke up, he saw the department was lonely, and all lights turned off, except by the ones in his room. He thought<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Hmm... Joana must've gone out with her friends, I guess I should do the same... though, I'm tired, maybe I'll stay' He noticed that all was silent, and took a quick look at his pets. All the three were sleeping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'OK... I guess I should sleep too' He suddenly felt the wind moving, and felt that there was someone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'This... this isn't right... will it be possible?' He turned around and saw nothing, he heard some footsteps but no one was there, though he looked out of the corner of his eye and noticed long white hair, which vanished. Blake shouted<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Stop playing around Blaze!! I know you're here, so show up and let's do this for once!!\"- Blake had clenched his fists, and adrenaline was running through his veins. He was ready for the worst, he was ready for the fight. No one showed up and Blake, angry, said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Damn weirdo...\"- He walked toward the kitchen, where he heard the last footsteps, he thought that Blaze might try to kill him, but after seeing how powerful he was, it made no sense using a knife. He entered the kitchen and saw nothing, he thought<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Is my mind toying with me?' Then, he felt two arms wrap around him from behind, immobilizing his arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What the Hell?!\"- He had no answer, but felt breathing on the back of his neck<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Why...ARE...you...SO...close...to...ME?!!...Get away from me!!\"- He had no answer, and even when Blake struggled, he couldn't wriggle out his arms not even a bit, the wrapping around him was very strong<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Damn!! He's strong...' Blake was growing more annoyed<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Will you kill me or what?

Let me go weirdo!! I don't want to end up in whatever your frickin' mind is thniking about!! You hear me!! If you try to do anything weird I swear I'm gonna cut your throat off...\"- Blake, though angry, was kind of distracting his enemy while thinking up a strategy, he was determining his whole environment, and found strange that only could feel the arms, and the breathing felt at a lower level of his neck, like Blaze had gotten short or something...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Blaze got shorter? Nah... I must've grown up. He said he didn't age...' Blake slightly could wriggle out his arms without Blaze to know, or maybe he did but was teasing him, in a quick rough move, Blake wriggled out his arms and released his neck. He quickly turned around in a guard stance and looked at Blaze, with his long white hair covering his eyes...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Hah!! Now I'm gonna...kick...your...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Blake looked a little lower...and fell down face first onto the ground. His right eye had a tic</span></div></div>",

Kagome had been busy with the archery range business and Ryan had been busy in the company working on new game ideas which a few of them came from his friend, Ryan who had been on Iron Chef to test his cooking skills.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyan\u2019s writing changed since Ray and Kari took their job and his writing was about them, but training had never stopped him because he could always beat Ray with his mind games and the inner power seals were on his mind because they were always his trump card. He formed the dark oblivion keyblade to add it to his collection that is in the master keyblade and he summoned a dark clone to use it in training for a future battle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChiharu and Ryan started working as a teachers for ninja swordsmen and women, but that business was slow till their old friends that they met at the park wanted to learn from them. Speaking of friends, all of the friends that they have made during their adventures have been living their own lives, but they will always come to have a reunion of their own. Like when they met both ryans or just one of them, the wedding anniversary, and the kids birthday which their dragon friends; Senna and Samu with Eragon and his wife, Saphira, they came to see them every once in a while to see how are they doing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo both Ryans, there are twin inner power seals and it's likely that the kids got it because they use it for training against them. Now the personal job of killing true monsters of the Ryans was slow because the lesser ones changed quickly and ones beyond that were killed like the others. Both Ryans been thinking about giving the job to their kids, but they have seen blood longer than the kids have lived. They couldn\u2019t do that to them because Kari\u2019s demonic power is saving her and Ray from trouble; but Ray hasn\u2019t been giving off any sign of darkness because he would have to fight it sooner or later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey have been traveling for some time to before going back home till they needed another vacation from the grind. Kari has been doing schoolwork with Ray so they know how to help each other out there, but the issue of love will lose their grasp. She always has been training with Ray on their combos with their powers and they will soon have inner power seal along with the twin power seals. The twin power seals will be their trump card and the legend of a fusion power seal is quite an interesting idea to try out for their fathers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow Ray is smart like his father and he has been spending time with to learn to make weapons for Kari or himself. He has built his car that is a classic muscle car, which his father\u2019s car is a classic hotrod and they plays for fun well as competition before Kari comes over to take him away. Ray is the strong supportive type around Kari when she is having some trouble that is not in their job description. Ray and Kari have been practicing driving so they can take his car out for a spin and all three cars have no license plates because they would be tracked down. They wanted no special treatment because it wouldn\u2019t be fair and their parents agreed with them. Both kids have been playing with their fathers and their powers at a young age so they won\u2019t be freaking out when their own powers reveal themselves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMost young, little girls wanted to be a fairy princess, which is cute for Halloween; but Ryan K. took Kagome with Kari to the queen of fairies while Ryan Shinonome took Chiharu with Ray to where he becomes the beast prince. Kari had fairy training while ray had dragon training; both Ryans have a set of powers from kings and there are a few queens in the family, but Kagome and Chiharu are the only ones who don\u2019t have a royal bloodline. Both Ryans were fine with it and their kids still loved them even though they are still human. Kagome is still using the bow that Ryan had made for her long ago and Chiharu still uses her ninja suit that her lover made for her.</span></div></div>",

Ray and his father were working on his second car to get both on the system like his father's hot rod and motorcycle, but he was having a problem with the system itself so his father took a look at it and they fix it together. The archery range and the training school really had business on the weekend; the holidays didn't help either since kids were taking lessons and wanted to have some fun or other people wanted to test their skills, but business is business.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKari had been helping with her father at the company trying to find some bugs in some of the new games that needed to hit the shelves just before he leaves on vacation, which is a race against the clock. In the morning, they had solved most of the bugs that were typical and they had one left so they went to take a break to get some fresh air. They started talking about her having a boyfriend, but he isn't like most normal fathers. He was watching her necklace that made for her as a birthday present and the other one was a gift for Ray so he would know she is \"dodging the bullet,\" but he wasn't going to push on the issue because they had to go back to work soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Kari and Ray have been doing very well in school without their father's influence and their hero job is getting easier for now, but they are not the cocky type who underestimates their opponents. The crimes must be waiting for something to happen like Ray and Kari doing a disappearing act with their parents. That won't happen unless they go on vacation and they asked their father's siblings to take over for them since they are staying here because Aunty Rei is still teaching at Ryan's old high school where everything started for them and Uncle Kaz is working as a school coach at a college.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey have been watching both their brother and Ryan doing the job plenty of times, but they know the \"easier said than done\" saying. Aunt Elizabeth who is Ray's aunt is working as an inventor/scientist and they were getting a visit from their dragon friends before they leave in a few weeks. When the dragon portal opened, the dragons twins came to tackle them and the older dragon pair come to see them while they were getting up.</span></div></div>",

The grass waved with the wind, and the sky got darker...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake felt a sudden change in wind and stood in a fighting stance. Birds flew away, anticipating the violent fight that was about to happen there. Blaze appeared all of sudden from thin air, and began to walk slowly toward Blake<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"This is so epic. The duel between good and evil, saint against sinner. Isn't it ironical that you're the one with black hair and dressed in black while I've got the white hair I'm dressed in white?\"- Blaze said. Blake remained silent, but kept the fighting stance<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Oh. You're eager aren't you?\"- Blaze said in a cocky way<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"It seems this is the only way we can solve this\"- Blake answered coldly<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I'm agree with you there, then, shall we begin the business?\"- <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he said that, they both dashed toward each other, Blake got the first hit. They began to attack each other with powerful blows, and Blake blocked most of Blaze's hits, and counter attacked with a powerful kick, right in stomach. Blaze got distracted for a moment, which was enough for Blake to connect several punches and an air kick right into his face. Blaze fell down but grabbed Blake's leg and threw him down as well. More thunders were heard and more bolts flashed violently, seeming to tear off the sky. They were kicking and hitting at inhuman speeds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey quickly got up and the fight continued. They fought like there was nothing else in the world. Many times, Blake's and Blaze's fists impacted each other, as well as their knees, feet, and even forehead (which left them both dizzy for a moment) Blaze tried to grab Blake's throat but he countered by moving around, immobilizing his left arm, and then Blake did a surprising move: he moved his whole body upwards, standing on his hands, on Blaze's shoulders, and quickly, with a spin, he twisted Blaze's neck, and as quickly as that, he let go off of his hands and while being mid air upside down he connected a powerful kick, and after that, he quickly spun again, landing his right elbow right in Blaze's face, and spun around connecting a round kick again in his face, and Blake performed a final upward somersault which kicked Blaze's chin, and before landing he bent Blaze's spine backward, and it cracked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake dashed backward a bit and stood in guard stance. For the first time Blake could see how much damage could he cause, as he never used his full strength against the bullies at school (limiting himself to human reasonable stats) Blaze was twisted, bent backward and his face nearly completely disfigured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Maybe I overdid it, but that's better than losing. Two years of training were a success' Blake thought, but looked how Blaze bent forward and his spine cracked again, and seemed to be back again in its place<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'What? But I broke his spine!! That's a mortal wound' Blake thought, and Blaze's voice was heard laughing, not his regular voice, but a demonic one sounded. Then Blaze's face regained its form and his neck seemed to recover its position, he even cracked it twice by moving it sideways.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, behind some bushes...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Awesome!!\"- Ayrton exclaimed<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Yeah!!

I guess...Yeah, this is incredible... the last time he could barely hit him, and now is kicking his ass\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"But don't celebrate yet guys\"- Ferdinand said, and pointed out at Blaze, who was recovering back<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Bah.

And why are we here watching? You guys should go help him\"- Claire said after the laugh ended<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What he doesn't know won't hurt him\"- Joana said, and Carlos added<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Don't worry Claire, everything is under control.

A slight flaming purple shine was seen around him. And Blaze's eyes, which most of time weren't visible, glowed in bright red, also, his long fangs were visible for a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake stood in there and showed no fear, instead he connected another powerful punch in Blaze's stomach, making him to spite out blood. And Blake punched him several more times, and kicked him a lot also, he threw him to the ground and then Blaze rolled away<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"It seems you've gotten rusty\"- Blaze grunted and tried to hit him, which failed, as Blake dodged it and countered with an elbow hit in the back of Blaze's neck. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"That's a definitive I'm Rick James bitch\"- Caesar said while hiding behind the bushes<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Blake and Blaze stared angrily at each other for about 10 seconds, then, they disappeared<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What?!\"- Joana exclaimed and then felt the ground shaking, but they were kind of regular tremors. Each separate tremor was distinguishable. Claire asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What the hell is going on there?\"- Before anyone said anything they noticed how the dust was rising up along grass pieces and rocks, and that appeared circular voids in the ground, and appeared long marks in the ground. Karina took from her purse a kind of strange binoculars and after looking through it, she said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Look, the long lines have a shoe pattern\"- Joana looked through it and asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Since when Blake's invisible?\"- Karina didn't answer but adjusted the binoculars by pressing some of the strange buttons and said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Look now\"- Joana did so and gasped, then Karina pressed another button and a little screen was visible, showing them an incredible fight. Then Karina explained<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Blake and Blaze are fighting faster than our eyes can see, that's why we can't see them with bare eye. The marks are evidencing the tremendous power we're witnessing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake and Blaze were hitting each other way more violently than before, fists and knees clashed against each other. They were moving at an incredible speed and the hits connected shook the ground, to the point that even a tree's branch broke and fell down. Most of Blake's friends were -&gt; O.O<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome school's windows broke as well as other buildings' nearby, or at least formed cracks.The ground began to break and large pieces of the ground emerged slightly. Karina said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"It seems Blake is now as strong as Blaze if not stronger already\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"That's a lot of power...\"- Joana said<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a more violent hit, which was a double punching (Blake's fist hit Blaze's face and Blaze's hit Blake's face, at once. The ground formed a bigger void and the two fighters dashed away from each other, being visible to the naked eye again. Now Blake's friends could appreciate how much damage they both had dealt. Blake (who had previously taken off his leather jacket) had his black shirt almost torn off, and so his sport shirt (white) was. His black jeans also showed damage. Blake's body had some wounds, but Blaze was the one who looked the most damaged. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze was wearing a light gray jacket, and a white shirt under it, as well as white jeans and tennis shoes. He said defiantly<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"It seems you didn't waste your time. That's good, but now, I'm through playing games\"-</span></div></div>",

Blake felt nothing and said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What was that for?\"- Suddenly, he felt like a hundred hits in his whole body all of sudden<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"That is called god speed\"- As he finished the phrase, Blake punched him in the face and they engaged in battle again. This time Blaze was blocking more of Blake's hits and after a powerful impact, they stared at each other in guard stances<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen they resumed the fight, moving at super fast speed again. Blaze dodged Blake's punches and, grabbing him by the face, hurling him against the ground, then, threw him away and ran toward him, punching him while Blake was being thrown, and smashed him against an old wall, which partially collapsed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you can understand, Joana screamed and was about to cry. Karina said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Wait here\"- As she went walking toward Blaze<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What are you doing? Are you crazy?\"- The guys said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Blake's not the only one who trained. I enhanced myself with a bigger version of the healing machine also\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"WHAT?!\"- Joana couldn't believe she had undergone the same procedure as Blake<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKarina said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Hehehe...Finally I'll get to test the effects on myself\"- And when Blaze noticed her, she said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Hey!! Remember me?!\"- As she ran forward and hit him with a strong kick, after that, she began to kick him faster and with stronger kicks, she easily connected 20 kicks at him, after throwing him down to the ground. Blaze got up and said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Yeah, dumb blonde, and don't think I'll go easy\"- Blaze moved again at god speed but Karina did a backward kick, which hit right the target, Blaze's face <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Why you?!!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I call it fast reflexes\"- She said as she punched him (though her best hit was kicking) <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze had a hard time against her, finding out that she was almost as strong as Blake. But he overpowered her and after a violent combat, he could pin her down and grab her by the neck. He also punched her in stomach, and decided to taunt her by slowly sliding his hand on her thigh<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You'd be a good servant. Not all succubus have those muscular thighs\"- He whispered and then, roughly, threw her away. Ayrton, who witnessed the whole scene, enraged, went furious and said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Hey you bastard!! That's my girlfriend you idiot!!\"- And so, the guys fought Blaze, but didn't last longer than 5 minutes. Blaze defeated them rather easily. The only one left was Joana who decided to go away before the guys engaged Blaze, but, due to his god speed, he appeared before her and said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What do we have here? Nothing less than Blake's girlfriend\"- Joana tried to get away in the opposite direction but Blaze immediately appeared before her again<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You disappointed me. You were supposed to unawarely kill Blake, but you didn't\"- <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I won't hurt my boyfriend\"-, Joana said firmly, though she was fearing that Blake was dead now...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You're brave. I see why Blake chose you\"- He taunted, and after looking a bit down, he added<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"And I just found out two more reasons for him to choosing you\"- Joana was growing angry by his perverted acting<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I guess latinos have good taste in females, not even our succubus are that gorgeous\"- He said as he caressed Joana's hair. She wanted to punch him but decided to be smart and plan something. Karina and the guys were defeated. Blake was under lots of rubble, it didn't seem to be a good day...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze continued teasing her and finally, the last straw was when Blaze licked her right cheek. Joana punched him in stomach with all her might, and Blaze, angry, pushed her away, sending her against a tree. And suddenly, a sound was heard. Blake had emerged from the rubble and looked at the scene. He was completely furious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze aimed his hand at him, and a beam of darkness came out, impacting Blake and exploded at contact. Joana cried when saw that, but after the smoke vanished, a golden light was visible. And the golden light was shaped as a man with feathered wings, it was standing before them and suddenly vanished. Blake was standing there, completely intact by the beam, and the wind began to swirl around him. Blake's hair kept waving up and his eyes went white. His veins became slightly more visible. He grunted and dashed toward Blaze<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze dashed towards him and Blaze connected a hit at Blake's forehead, with no effect as Blake punched him and threw him down. Then lifted him up, punched his stomach several times and hurled him against the ground. Blaze muttered<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Yes...this is what I'm looking for...you're almost ready...\"- He looked up to see the wild raging version of Blake, who had no mercy and hit him as much as possible. Blaze retaliated with powerful punches and kicks, and they seemed to be at the same level again, though Blake seemed to be stronger. Blaze jumped very high (about 10 meters) and in his left hand charged a darkness beam, but before he could even aim it, Blake appeared in front of him and performed an upward kick, Blaze released the uncharged beam on Blake and the explosion sent them both away. He said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Finally got what I wanted\"- He got up and walked toward Blake, who was now very weakened, and reverted to his normal state. Blake tried to get up but Blaze aimed his hand at him and blasted an invisible power. Then, Blake's whole body was tied up with purple electric bolts. Then, it levitated, making him to stand upright, with hands behind his back, just his face was free. Blaze walked near him and said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Finally, though you could use a bit more of training, but we'll do that once you're my mind slave\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What?! I'm not gonna be your frickin' slave Blaze!!\"- Blaze slapped him and tightened the wrappings around Blake, then said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You will do as I wish. You're mine. Now, let's get going, I have many business to do\"- </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Both families are driving in a long tunnel portal and they are listening to their favorite music, but both Ryans stopped their cars because they felt that something was wrong. They noticed that a portal was showing a very violent fight, with a black haired boy dressed in black against a white haired boy, dressed in gray and white. They noticed that both guys had a great life force inside of them, as the sensing directed toward them, the ryans also noticed that they fought at god speed at times.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey didn't know for sure who was the good one and the evil one or why were they fighting, so they watched it to determine whom were they going to help, as their combat was making a great energy disturbance, and the ground showed the damage caused by two great powers clashing continuously. Chiharu and Kagome, however, had a feeling that the black haired one was the good one, as the other had an evil presence, and their fighting style was even different. They saw how ruthless were the white haired boy\u2019s attacks, also, after some minutes, noticed the red eyes glowing and the fangs, unmistakable signs of demonic nature.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I hadn't seen someone fight like that besides us for a long time\"- Ryan K. said<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey continued to watch the fight and looked at how suddenly the white haired one rose his power and sent flying away the other. That their friends who were hiding behind bushes engaged him being all of them taken down easily, then a good-looking girl was left. The white haired one referred to her as his opponent's girlfriend, and after teasing her, sent her away, knocking her out against a tree. Chiharu and Kagome gasped<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"That's enough. We've got a job to do\"- Ryan s. said<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo the Ryans told them to change their plans because of that and go to help those people. While changing destiny and adjusting the car\u2019s equipment, they felt another dark presence to arise, and noticed that the boy whose girlfriend was sent away was furious and had a different appearance, iris and pupil-less eyes, and wind swirling around him. The fight between they both was quick, as soon, after an explosion, the new dark presence vanished as the black haired boy ran out of energy. The white haired one said that he owned him and that they had business to do. It seemed that he wanted his opponent for something describing him as almost ready... for what? They didn't know.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe engines roared like thunder and they charged into the new world with the trouble. While this was going on, Blake was being held by Blaze sensed an unknown presence, and so did Blaze, but didn't pay attention to it; he was enjoying strangling him without even touching him, by tightening the purple energy bolts that were wrapped around Blake..<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey see a portal open a few feet away with three cars coming through, and Ryan H. with the rest of his family and friends. They saw them so he used the flash step to break Blaze's grip on Blake. Ryan sent Blaze flying several feet in the air and he asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You OK?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I guess I'm fine. But who are you?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"The introductions will have to wait.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChiharu found a girl in the bushes so she went to speak with her about this mess and Ryan told the kids to fight Blaze while they were dealing this mess, but remember not to mess with him too much. The kids were waiting for Blaze to show up so that their parents were healing Blake's friends while Kagome went to look for Joana who is against a tree knocked out. Claire and Chiharu came over to watch over them as Ryan Kasshi is healing with his magic and Ryan is getting a case of his fruit drinks for them to get their strength back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell blaze came back so Kari and Ray are using their combo moves on him, but Ryan went to help Kagome with Joana who laid next to Blake who is drinking the flask of fruit drink. Ryan is watching the fight with Blake till Blaze powered up by using his demonic voice. Then he went to take over, but Claire pulled Karina over for her injuries to be healed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~How strong are they, who are they, and why are they here?~ blake thought<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKari and Ray had taken some damage from him so Ryan s. is using his inner power seal with his flash step, and the girls went to get the kids.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyan s. started using his mind games on Blaze sooner than later. He sensed that this guy Blake was somewhat like him, though he had a weird presence, a mixture of light and darkness, having slightly more tendency to darkness, probably because it's easier to let the rage take control, as the power they witnessed before was mostly dark. However, he felt that Blake was a good guy and probably himself had too much to deal with as his own nature. Blake was watching the fight and they can feel the force of Ryan's s. power, but he is only playing with Blaze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Blaze, since you like to mess with people; I will do the same thing to you\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyan called Blake over to watch his friends and girlfriend since he went to get a drink from using too much energy.</span></div></div>",

She also was afraid of losing him, and she felt a bit bad because the day before she joked pretending to be Blaze. On the other hand, she was really impressed by Blake's fighting skills.He had gotten really strong since his last fight against Blaze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNone of them could sleep for the moment, and she said, playful<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Hey Blake, isn't it amazing?, those cool people are about our age and are already married\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Don't even think about it\"- Blake said, eyes still closed, trying to sleep<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Awww...why not? wouldn't you like me as your wife?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Two reasons: Joana, we're too young, well, at least I am. And, no, because the next thing you're gonna want to talk about is children\"- Joana blushed. Blake was right<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Why not? Not necessarily now but at some point I'd like to have a baby, maybe when we become about 30's\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You don't know what are you talking about...\"- Blake replied<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What do you have against parenting?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I don't want to... I just don't feel like spending my whole life raising another person...\"- Joana stared at him, he opened an eye and noticed it, he sighed. Joana asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Is it because of what happened in your childhood?\"- Joana had hit the nail. Blake said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Let's say I don't have a precisely good example of how to be a parent... after my father died Lilith* threw me out of her house\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"But your father was a good, he died to save you\"- Joana said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Whatever. Still, I won't give you a child, so, you know it. I don't want another dude with half of my DNA stealing my money and life itself\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Aww. It isn't that bad? Have you seen Ryan's children?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Which one?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Both\"- Joana answered<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Argh...\"- Joana was looking at her with puppy eyes, and he knew he wouldn't sleep unless he gave an answer<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Maybe a girl, but only a girl. I won't accept other dude with my blood...\"- Joana smiled and they slept. What she wanted was to heal Blake's wounds, not just the physical, but also the wounds others can't see, except for the people who know him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*NOTE: After the deep maltreat Blake had to endure and, being smart, noticing that she hated him. He never called her mother, nor mom, nor anything like that. To Blake, she's just a bitch. (James was the one who took care about him, to the point that Lilith never nursed newborn Blake). The only one who had ever a similar title to Blake was his grandmother, who he called Mama Irma when very young (Mother/Mom Irma in Spanish, or just Mom, though later he'd call her just Irma or Grandma)</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The next day morning, at school, lunch time...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n[NOTE: There were some TV's at the cafeteria, which always were tuned to local channel and had the news most of time]<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone were shocked by the previous day events, though nobody knew what was really. Many people described it as a signal of apocalypse, and even in the news scientists didn't have an explanation. Their city wasn't in a seismic zone, the tremors didn't make sense, and the storm formed from thin air, there wasn't anything abnormal until it happened. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA scientist said that he could show some abnormalities that his colleagues didn't notice, what this scientist was saying in TV caught Blake and friends attention (being them the only ones who knew what happened really)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"As I'm showing you... here appeared two immense energy fields, which were very concentrated by the way, they appeared out of nothing. Their appearance it's exactly timed with the beginning of Yesterday's events, and as you see, I filmed my radar readings. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fields moved very close to each other and kept moving, some times forward, some times backward, in an erratic way. It seems that those energy masses collided several times as my other radars indicate, and these shocks coincided with the tremors. After several minutes, one of the two energy masses suddenly increased, and then, the points marked by the radar kept flickering around the map for a long time, each collision preceding the more severe tremors\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Hmph... another dude who will attribute this to aliens or ghosts\"- Blake said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Even some windows broke by the vibrations of impact, also, we can see here that the energy projected a segment, which would be a beam or a bolt towards the other, and that preceded the unexplainable explosion. I initially thought, as my colleagues, that it was a strange magnetic storm, but here's the part the scientist community finds controversial. \"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I think it's a mad scientist\"- Ayrton said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"A new multiple radar developed by myself showed impressive results: The flickering I spoke about before, wasn't that, it were the same energy masses moving extremely fast, although no faster than sound, and, my newest discovery: These energy masses weren't just random magnetic fields, they were organic energy fields, as shown with my Biological Energy Measurement Device, which has successfully been able to detect biological energy in any living being, it measured unprecedented levels... in chronological order...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoana and Claire gasped, Karina said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"It's possible. Reading the vital energy would require a very sensitive machine that could read multiple types of energy manifestations, and compile them with a complex algorithm, converting it through a coefficient into a numeric value\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"How the hell do you know that?\"- Caesar said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I made one myself, it's part of the binoculars we used yesterday...\"- Everyone suddenly fell face-first onto the floor<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Yeah!! At last someone's made a thing like Radditz's scouter!!\"- Ferdinand said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"But I guess that it's no good news if that guy developed one like this, also, we'd have to see how exact it was\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"The levels registered by the radar are the following [The scientist showed a screen]:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnit A - 176        Unit B - 170, here was when they appeared out of nothing<br>\r\nUnit A - 1,788     Unit B - 1,526. here was when the tremors began<br>\r\nUnit A -  2,112     Unit B - 2,714, here was when the sonic speed collisions began<br>\r\nAfter that, Unit A field disappeared from map for a while, and we detected other energy field<br>\r\nUnit C - 1,725, which lasted for little time<br>\r\nThen, suddenly, Unit A reappeared...<br>\r\nUnit A - ???? Syntax error... The true value couldn't be calculated but the last measurement before giving error was of 2999!!! My radar had never detected such fields before and we weren't prepared for such high levels, but I speculate that it surpassed the 3,000 BEU (Biological Energy Units)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe radar broke after that last reading and stopped working, though it still registered several high energy fields that appeared all of sudden, 6 more at the very least...but I can't assure about those since the radar broke. Currently, is undergoing repairs. But what I say is that there are no living beings that can handle such energy levels. In the name of science we must locate those sources of power, as they might be dangerous if it's a hostile being\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Aren't you worried Blake?\"- <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Not very much, nobody will pay attention to that crazy freak\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Hey, Karina, how exact were those guy's readings?\"- Asked Ferdinand. Karina was O.O, and she answered<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Practically 100%, being the only difference that he used a binary algorithm and I used a decimal one, results are the same...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Oh My God...\"- Gustave said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Hey, how much was the last reading?\"- Claire wondered<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"It reached 3,200\"- Most of them got the O_o face<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"One minute, why didn't your scanner break as the mad guy's?\"- Joana asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I guess that because I made it myself, not with pieces made in China\"- Everyone laughed at that<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What will we do now?\"- Ayrton asked to Blake, who wasn the only one who wasn't fearing for his life, though he'd be the one the scientist would look for<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"By now, eat our lunch...don't act different, that would make you suspicious, just keep it as nothing happened, nothing will suspect from ordinary students\"- Blake said as he relaxed, Joana hugged him tightly and said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Blake! I don't want them to take you away from me...\"- She noticed Blake grunted and said with faltering strangled-sounding voice<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Can't...breathe...release...me...\"- Joana released him and blushed, Blake said, after taking a deep breath<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Maybe I got stronger than before, but you still have strenght enough to kill 20 people with a single arm...\"- All of them laughed<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Maybe she can beat Blaze, with a single slap she can send him to China\"- Ayrton joked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"He'd come back anyway\"- Claire said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Not with the Chinese police, it's the worst\"- Ferdinand replied, all of them laughed again<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Guys, Chinese police won't attack Blaze by professional courtesy\"- They laugh again<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bell rang and they went to the last four classes left...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n12:20 PM, end of classes for today...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake and his friends left the school and wondered what to do...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n[END NOTE: Unit A - Blake, Unit B - Blaze, Unit C - Karina, just to let you know]</span></div></div>",

Monsters not like dragons or any other creature that we know, but true monsters like several humans that we killed to save that world and we had been in two wars already.\"- he said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Well, the first war was to stop a monster in his tracks and Ryan over there had to kill him for a friend, but the second was a distraction for him to go back in time to prevent a broken heart of a certain wizard.\"- he added<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Wait a minute, go back time! you can do that?,\"- Anthony asked him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Yes, I can with my sword of the timewinds,\"- Ryan K. said with a certain look on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"But you will have to know what you are doing before you left your time period so you won't mess with the timeline and it will age you for sure,\"- he added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Trust me, I have done at least once to help a friend to undo a mistake and it will take alot out of you when you come back to your time,\"- Ryan S. said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Oh, that reminds me because I heard that we were called young so just to clear things up; the kids are 16 years old and the four of us are 19 years old.

During that journey, I traveled to gained knowledge to learn not for power and I stopped in an Indian tribe where I trained to use my flowing blade, which is like ray's sky blade. While I was staying there, I had a partner who had a sparrow blade and she was a great partner. Soon after I completed my training, I left the tribe with their knowledge and the blade from my partner so I continued on my travels till I somehow I got into Ryan K.'s world as the president of cyber castlevania,\"- he finished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"But my firestarter is the most surprising because that power was the one inside me,\"- he added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"We have stories to tell, but there is training to be done here and we have some stuff with us so we can't be tracked.\"- he said</span></div></div>",

Blake also noticed his turtle D'Artagnan being held by the twins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I guess Rocky and the cats can be trained to fight, as they already have done in past when I was in trouble, but... what would do D'Artagnan? He's fast for being a turtle, and in fact is strong*, but, in a serious fight, I guess the only thing he could do would be to biting someone's finger...\"- Blake wondered<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You'll see\"- Ryan s. said smiling<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe said that they are going to start training and they will be joining the rest of the group so they headed outside to the cars that has the equipment that will help covers their tracks. They needed to go in the forest for the training because using the same spot is not a good idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Let's see here where is it?\"- Ryan S. asked himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you looking for?\" Claire asked him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Something to help us train without getting someone's attention.\"- he answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Something like what?\"- Karina asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"A generator that creates a magnetic field and an illusion barrier.\"- he told her while still looking for it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I know I put it in here before we left the house or did I put it under the cases,\"- he said while using his magic to lift the cases to find the door, which revealed the generator.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"So that is where I put it.\"- he said as he was pulling it out of the trunk revealing a small electronic tower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"That is the tower that you were looking for?\"- Ayrton asked him surprised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Yeah which is kind of funny because you were giving the impression that it would be bigger and we need the started case from the fight,\"- he was thinking out-loud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Here let me help.\"- Blake said wanted to help by carry the case of fruit drinks and Joana was given the generator.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKarina was looking at the generator while Joana was holding it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"That was made by my twin sister who is an inventor also a scientist.\"- Ryan S. said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"We should get going if training is going to start and I still have some surprises to pull out of my hat.\"- he added<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"There is a clearing about a mile from here.\"- Blake called out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I guess that is where we should be going now.\" Ryan S. said after locking up his car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey started walking to the forest clearing and Ryan S. is talking with Blake about his pets while the others were talking. Soon they got to the clearing and Joana handed Ryan the generator, but they needed to back away from this because of the barrier around itself since only he or one of the others can touch it. Once the generator gave a life signal, he set it on the ground and it started to trigger the barrier and the magnetic field.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"The field is masking the barrier and our energy so we can go full power without setting something off,\"- Ryan S. said after setting the barrier to look like a normal forest clearing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyan S. told Blake to set the drinks on the tree stump in the center of the clearing and he is thinking about something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~How should we start their training? Blake has triggered his dark power by getting angry and he has to trigger his light powers though we are not sure how would he would do it. Maybe his feelings for Joana would help there; nobody could tell certainly since Blake is different to anyone else we have met or seen. We will train him to learn his light powers while the others are training. He might be a challenge.~ ryan thought<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Okay, here is how training is going to start: Blake is training with Ryan k. and myself, Karina with Joana against Chiharu with Kagome, and finally the twins with the kids against Blake's pets,\"- Ryan H. told them while walking to the pets with a smile on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"But how could they fight?\"- Blake asked him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Well, I know a spell to turn animals into anthros and the spell is beast magic so I have to be in my beast state\"- Ryan answered while showing his mark of the king<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Anthros?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Humanoid versions of them, but they will retain their way to be as well as their memories, and they will still be the same pets you know and love. The difference is that they'll be much more useful and can talk.\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"OK then...\"- Blake thought that it would be weird, but cool at the same time<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn orb of light came from the mark on ryan\u2019s s. arm so he grabbed it and he pulled out a sword before putting it on his back. He crushed the orb in order to focus as he is gaining his beast traits, which is a panther/puma mix and they are shocked to see this form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Hey I'm still me and I'm going to start to chant the spell so stay back.\"- ryan s. said<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyan S. is talking with Rocky, Max, Tabitha, and D'Artagnan to inform them that they will be fighting alongside Blake, but first Ryan S. started to glow a golden color as his king of the beast spirit appeared and he spoke the words where the four pets standing are starting to glow the same color.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"The spell is working so I need to add more juice,\"- Ryan said dealing with the strain and the glow is getting brighter<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes, the pets started to change into their anthro forms and they are changing quickly as Ryan is showing that he is getting drained. When the four are their anthro form, ryan fell to the ground from the power drain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Finished\"- ryan said and all of them surrounded him while Chiharu went to him a drink<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake is looking at his pets who are looking at him with those eyes that he knows so well and they hugged him, but Ryan started to stand up without help and he took the drink from Chiharu. He released his beast state so the sword with the orb went back into the mark and he wanted to speak with the pets about how they are feeling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size25\" style=\"\"><b>*A particular trait of D'Artagnan is that he doesn't slither on ground as most of turtles and other reptiles do (you know, most of them walk but with their bellies always on ground). D'Artagnan moves pretty fast for a turtle; when he walks he rises up his body above the ground and Blake noticed that his legs seemed to be longer than an average turtle's legs, but his neck was longer and more flexible. Blake could compare this because most of his friends had red-eared turtles, from which yellow are a rare variant. D'Artagnan is the only one who takes sunbathes every day and enjoys it, extending fully his neck, other turtles when contact sunlight just go to a nearby shadow.</b></font></span></div></div>",

They can feel the energy coming from him as he is building it up and they find it shocking while Ryan S. can see a faint glow. The energy that Ryan K. was gathering is almost ready and the glow is getting brighter quickly so Ryan s. got up with a smile. Ryan k. started to bend back while raising his arms into the air and he became his super saiyan form, but he quickly released it because the training has to be done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Okay, there is training to be done so get into your groups,\"- Ryan K. said they followed his orders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"For those who are not fighting, will be put on either cheering or refreshment duty,\"- Ryan S. said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Blake we are going first since you need to trigger your light powers without being angry and you might be a challenge that we happily accept\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey got into their fighting stances and both Ryans went at the same time to attack Blake, but he blocked then countered.

Both Ryans taught their wives to fight if they were not around to protect them or if the kids got hurt. Blake is sitting next to his pets while the Ryans are next to their kids. Karina and Chiharu are going at it while Kagome is getting inside Joana's head<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Joana, do you know why Blake doesn't teach you to fight?\"- Kagome asked her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Because he wants to keep me safe.\"- she answered back<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"No, it\u2019s because you can't fight back or you're weak.\"- Kagome said with a smile on her face<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoana is mad enough to start running for a punch in the face, but she saw that coming and she dodged then countered. While this is going on, ryan s. is talking with blake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"So, Blake why don't you teach her to fight or at least protect herself till you can get to her?\"- ryan s. asked him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Because she doesn't need to fight.\"- he answered<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"No that's not it\u2019s because you want to do things yourself.\"- he said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I've done the same thing\"- he added<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he continued, he stopped them because they needed to hear him and they went to get a drink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"It was after the reunion tournament that I took Chiharu to my realm to see my dreams and I felt something coming toward us. Ryan and Kagome came to see me fight darkheart, my darkness, and I told them to stay back because I wanted to do this myself. I said that Chiharu was the light in my darkness and that was when my saving light keyblade and my gauntlet bracelets started to react.\"- he said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"After the glow faded, I became an armored angel with twin keyblades and I had three modes; protective friend, angel sword, and angel keyblade and my darkness faded away. But my darkness was against me till a certain battle on a world that would have been the third war I think because the king there was only part of the problem and there was a bigger pest that Ryan and I used ourselves to destroy.\"- he added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"My brother and I had the same problem except we had inner demons to fight and both of are killed.\"- Ryan K. said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"My brother's inner demon was killed when we were young then my was killed when a future Ryan s. came to get our team for a trip to the future and that future was not pretty at all so we saw the future Kagome, kazi and rei, and myself.\"- he added<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Since it was my future self, I went to speak with him so the others came then we went inside the castle till my inner demon came in and the rest was history.\"- he finished<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRay and Kari had worried looks because their fathers have to deal with that so they have to do the same and the Ryans saw their faces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Okay that is enough sad faces from the both of you and I know that we kept this problem in the dark, but we didn't want it to happen to you both like it did us.\"- Ryan k. said to their kids<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What if it does happen?\"- Kari asked her father worried<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Then call on your friends and solve it together besides you have us on your side, but there some things that must be done alone just not all of it.\"- he answered back<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"When I first encountered my inner demon, I took it to the realm of demons where the king demon lives then I had Kagome to shoot me with an arrow to hurt it and I told her about my special ability of self-resurrection which helps in fights and fool you opponent.\"- he said looking away<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Having guys that could beat me up badly made up my mind about that, I couldn't allow that to happen to her. Even when I wasn't her boyfriend, long ago...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Hey! It seems you have a story there\"- Ryan S. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I guess...well, they're in fact several stories, but the point is that at least thrice I've been beaten up badly, by extreme disadvantage...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Don't make remember that, it's just sad\"- Joana said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I know..\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I'll tell you what happened\"- Karina said to Ryans and their families<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Joana's brother, Chris...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"The little idiot, please...\"- Joana said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Well, the little idiot... whatever, often gets in trouble, most of times for videogames, money, stuff, and money... he gets a lot of debts, and usually gets debts from very bad people, and because he usually can't pay, they threaten to beat him up, but once, he had a debt over 150 bucks and the bully, Ivan, took revenge at our school, since he was on secondary as us\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I don't remember that day...\"- Rocky scratched his head, and Max told him<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You do!! It was the day Joana brought Master*, and he was almost dead, it was the first time we saw her...\"- Tabitha remained silent, while Rocky nodded, remembering<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Ivan appeared all of sudden in lunch time, and demanded Joana violently to pay her brother's debts, she said she didn't know and either, she had no money, thinking it was a minor debt, as usual. Ivan attempted to punch her, and even I closed my eyes, but I heard no scream and when Joana and I opened our eyes, we saw Blake had rushed just in time, taking the hit himself. He had no time for blocking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake stood firmly, and told him to stop and leave. Ivan of course wouldn't agree to that, and as he said, he wanted to fight Blake anyway, because everyone talked about him in school as it was becoming known that every bully that got in his way or threatened Joana got their ass kicked by him, and that Blake defeated every guy he fought\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Yeah, that was a critical year as freshmen\"- Ayrton said, who was Blake's best male friend who knows him since 1st grade at 6 years, though Blake was 5 at that time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Before it began Ayrton asked Blake if he thought he was able to beat Ivan, which Blake answered that he didn't know, that he admitted there was a high disadvantage and low likeliness of him beating Ivan. He said those words with a serious tone, instead of his typical carefree attitude. Everyone were watching because both Blake's reputation and Ivan's, the whole school agreed that there was nobody who could ever dare to fight Ivan, and the few ones who tried got sent to hospital for a month at the very least.  At first, Blake connected several blows and dodged Ivan's, He was putting up a good fight, but at least I realized that Blake wasn't hitting him as much as he could have done, in fact, he was focusing on immobilizing him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake had been keeping distance, taking advantage of Ivan's lack of speed, but Ivan somehow learned Blake's weakness...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What was it?\"- Ray asked, curious<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"It's sitting next to me\"- Karina said, and before she continued Joana glared at her<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Hey! It's true, you and me know that Blake could have won that fight\"- Joana sighed and bowed down<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"As I was saying, Ivan changed tactics, and decided to attack Joana, which Blake prevented by holding him from behind and trying to strangle him. Fatal mistake. Ivan had him where he wanted, and after throwing him forward, a carnage began. Ivan hit Blake in every part of his body, and hurled him against the ground, sent him against a tree and even used body slams on him. You'll understand Blake got his life's worst beating, and after all that, which was about 20 minutes, he was left laying on the floor, completely helpless, with no more strength to face Ivan or to even stand up\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA tear slipped on Joana's cheek when remembering, the images of that day were horrible. Blake wiped it off and whispered to her ear<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Don't cry. that's in the past. You know I'd do anything to protect you...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"After such disaster, me and the guys engaged Ivan in battle, but... if we lasted 10 minutes that was much...\"- Karina said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"And after Joana ran away, but got cornered by Ivan, who again tried to punch her, Blake suddenly appeared, and took that hit again, making him to spit out blood. Ivan tried to throw him away and Blake punched him with all his might, then, Blake immobilized Ivan by blocking his arms and bent him backwards Then, he said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Joana, Run away, now!!' Joana was hesitating, and this is when Blake gave his first hint of having feelings for her...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake blushed and replied <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"T-That's not true!... I mean... I was just protecting her... as a friend...\"- Joana stared at him sweetly, and said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You can't lie silly\"- And kissed him. Nobody noticed but Tabitha protracted her claws and quickly retracted them again<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Just a friend?\"- Kari asked, and giggled<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"They weren't together at that time. Joana was in love with him but Blake was keeping things as just friends. Only I've seen the hints in Blake's behavior, though nor the guys nor Joana realized about it\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Hey!\"- The mentioned ones exclaimed<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Admit it, you only annoyed Blake because I told you she was in love with him, and you Joana, don't deny you had a crush on him because you were ALL DAY thinking about him, to the point I got fed up some times... And always were distressing yourself about what you said, what you did, what would he think, and the weird moments you had with him like when you tried to wake him up while he was sleeping on a tree's branch#. Remember? You broke it, he fell down and what's more, you fell on him...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"That was embarrassing...\"- Joana said, blushing. Blake laughed and caressed her hair<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"And you wasted that chance, he was under you, couldn't get away, so close to you...you had him where you wanted, didn't you?\"- Karine joked. Joana's face glowed bright red. Karina continued<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Well, whatever, that was the moment Blake's attitude touched more Joana's heart, and it kind of moved us too, Blake said, desperate<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I can't stop him for longer. I can't fight anymore. Just leave before this bastard gets you, go to somewhere safe'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn that instant she and me realized that Blake had been trying to buy time for Joana to escape, at the cost of his own life<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIvan broke Blake's hold and after some punches, threw him in front of her, completely knocked out, bleeding and with severe damage, barely breathing, totally helpless. Blake, before falling unconscious, said with difficulty<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I-I'm sorry...I can't...stop him...anymore...'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd that was Joana's epic moment: She stood in front of Ivan, crying, she told him to stop, which he didn't, and she hit him in stomach... but with such a force that Ivan got knocked out, there, with a single hit. Not even Blake nor me nor anyone could damage Ivan very much and she did it with a single blow...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoana laughed nervously and blushed, Karina finished<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Everyone at school thought about it twice before messing with her or Blake again... and even girls did so because EVERYONE knew at school that Blake was Joana's, or would be some day. Except Blake himself... We didn't tell Blake who defeated Ivan because it was already difficult to get him to trust her, it'd be more if he knew that she had such strength\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake remained silent and blushed<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I already knew. I barely survived her hugs, and hugged me pretty often...ouch...\"- Blake said, joking<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What happened after that?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size25\" style=\"\"><b>*Blake's pets refer to Blake as Master mostly, though they know his name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n#Until 9th grade, Blake used to sleep on an old tree's branch (the tree itself was 50+ years old at the very least). The tree was near their classroom and was pretty big. He rested on it to read or just to think. He spent so much time there that people called it his tree, as well as himself. After 9th grade someone paid by school cut it down. It was a really sad day.</b></font></span></div></div>",

Again, Blake kept preventing Ivan from attacking Joana, but this time Ivan didn't deal as much damage as in the past...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I told you Karina, after Blake gets beaten up, becomes stronger\"- Ayrton said -\"I've seen it many times\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Isn't that strange?\"- Claire asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I guess that it was a little hint of Blake's powers\"- Ryan S. said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"The second time Ivan fought Blake, he threw him away and Joana tried to protect Blake like the first time, but Ivan slapped her off, and Blake got into that weird state that he used to fight Blaze. I've seen that strange state very few times. Blake usually doesn't get that angry, and passed some years before doing it again. More or less, to my knowledge, Blake has used that state three times<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Fighting Alexander, his cousin and before Blaze, his nemesis. We were about 6 or 7 at that time at 2nd grade<br>\r\n-Ivan, second fight, at 8th grade<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd the third was in early high school, mid 12th grade, against a guy called Albert, who is somewhat like Ivan but worse. The difference was that Joana wasn't involved at all and Blake got angry after Albert had massacred his friends, including Ayrton...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Specially Ayrton\"- Ferdinand said, which was followed by a knock behind his head<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You got your ass kicked that day too\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Yeah, I know. That was a hell of a day\"- Ferdinand replied<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"But, at least to my point of view, Blake gets into his dark state rather easily since Blaze appeared, I'm not sure exactly why, I had the theory that Blaze's own darkness influenced Blake, or maybe the fact he always threatens Joana and us...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Well, as Karina told you, I kept from involving Joana in my own problems...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"But honey! I want to help you too, and I want you to be ok\"- Joana said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Anyway, I though that since I taught Claire and failed, it wouldn't be worth it...\"- Suddenly everyone looked at Claire, and Joana shouted at Blake<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"YOU WHAT?!!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I taught Claire to fight. That was very long ago...\"- Joana glared at Claire, she gulped<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Don't look at me like that, we left that old rivalry in past, remember?\"- Claire sounded like begging for her life. There began an argument between the girls... with shoutings about Blake, and some other things related...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFerdinand whispered to the Ryans and their families<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Those two are in love with Blake, and sometimes, Joana feels a bit jealous of her because she knows Blake for a longer time. And Claire felt jealous of her because Blake spent more time with her, and by the fact Joana is who asked him out in the end.They used to be enemies but kind of befriended about 2 years ago. And no matter what they say, Claire still wants Blake for herself\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that argument...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Well, as I was saying, I've taught to certain person who I better don't mention, and it didn't help very much, I still had to help her...\"- Blake said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You mean you really think I'm weak?\"- Joana asked, sad<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"No! But I wanted you out of my problems, there's no need for more harm. But, with the current look of things, I guess I have to...\"- Joana almost tackled him when ran to hug him<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"And you say you're weak...\"- Blake said</span></div></div>",

Ryan S. was watching the time because he had an idea for them which would be funny to see and he started to smoke a small fire as he started to walk back to the others. They were just finishing up so it had to be close to 5:30.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Good day of training so the fun will begin soon, but we have to bring the cars here because it would be easier and I need to recharge the tower till the fun starts so we will come back here in two hours.\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Oh, no catfights with Blake involved because the fights will be used in training or dealing with blaze.\"- Ryan K. looking at Claire, Tabitha and Joana. Only him had realized that Tabitha might be a problem in her anthro form, but he decided to let them learn some lessons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey started to walk back to the cars for ryan to recharge the tower and both Ryans will be staying outside for awhile. Chiharu and Kagome know what the problem is so they talked with the kids about their fathers having them in mind and they went to speak with them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Dad, father\"- Ray and Kari called to them<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Yeah, what do you need?\"- Ryan K. said to them<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I wanted to say that I overreacted from what you said about your inner demon and I'm sorry.\"- Kari sad to her father<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Neither of you have nothing to be sorry for because we kept some things from both of you.\"- Ryan S. said to them<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"No you did what you thought was right.\"- Ray said to his father<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Thanks for cheering us up and I wondered where we have such good kids.\"- the Ryans asked each other laughing<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey went inside to see the others doing something and both Ryans' smiles on Kagome and Chiharu's face so they must have done something. Ryan H.'s watch started going off because the tower is done charging and they headed for the cars. Both Ryans with Ray used magic to make their cars bigger so they can carry more people with them and they used the same way that they walked to the clearing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKarina asked about the technology of their world because it is amazing and Ryan K. said it is modern age, but they use advance technology. When they got to the clearing, they got out to the trunks for the stuff they need like the case of fruit drinks, the tower, and Ryan S. pulled his guitar with a smile on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"The area outside of the barrier can't hear what is going on inside the barrier and I will be playing some music.\"- Ryan S.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyan and Kagome started to dance with the slow music so Joana was giving Blake a look that she wants to dance with him and he started to blush with her like ray and Kari when they looked at each other. Ryan K. had a serious look on his because he tell the tale of his parents and they have their girlfriends coming to help them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyan H. stopped the music for the dancers looking at them to see a serious sad face on Ryan K. and the fun ended for now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What is the problem, Ryan K.\"- Joana asked him looking worried<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\u201dThe tale must be told.\u201c- Kagome said to her<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\u201cThe tale of my father\u2019s parents.\u201d- Kari said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Like Ryan lost his mother from cancer which was before he left on his journey or even finished high school, but my parents were a great pair to the three of us and they wanted to teach me a lesson.\u201c- Ryan K. said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\u201cWhat kind of lesson?\u201c- Blake asked him<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\u201cThey wanted me to feel rage, loss, sadness, and need for revenge so they asked our brother who didn\u2019t want to do it in the first place and he created an evil twin brother to do the job, but I never though how my went missing and that rage what got my saiyan form for my first power that all of you saw before the training began.\u201c- He continued -\u201d I found my evil twin brother a few times and when we met the second time, he showed me my old blanket which didn\u2019t make sense till he took off his mask to reveal my brother\u2019s face and we talked about the whole thing at the house before we moved to japan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\u201dHow did they die?\u201c- Samu asked him<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\u201dWhile we were getting ready for a picnic, our sister was already in the car and I was about to get in the car when brother as my evil twin shot an energy blast at the car to make it explode.\u201c-  he answered back while looking at the others<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\u201cAfter we sold the house to some friends of the family, we moved to japan to look for our sister because she was still alive after the car explosion, but she went into hiding to recover and train.\u201c-then he added -\u201cthe guilt was eating him alive and he felt like he betrayed me so I gave him a hug because he needed it, but went to train with his sword that was in the training room and this was no ordinary sword.\u201d- he continued -\u201cit was a sword that fed on his emotions to give him the power of super saiyan and later we went to look for our older sister, but brother found her first so they started talking and I knew what had to be done.\u201d-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\u201cWhat did you do?\u201d- Rocky asked him<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\u201cI went to see them and they were happy to see me before I went after his sword which transformed into his inner demon or a sword demon when I was about to touch it then it was about to attack when my brother and sister came to save me. The three of us killed the demon by using teamwork and he felt relieved to have that over with so we went to our parent's graves together.\"- he added<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Now with the sad story over, we can focus on the two other stories that we have to tell and they are quite the surprise.\"- ryan H looking at them<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I will go first this time.\"- Ryan K. looking at Ryan S.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Well unlike fighting inner demons, I have the power of a demon to use if there is a personal job to do and there are levels of power with it plus there is only one way of becoming my demon form.\"-he said looking at them<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\u201cHow do you become your demon form?\u201c- Blake asked him<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\u201dThis whistle was made to trigger my demon and the only question is who will blow it.\u201c- Ryan K. said while showing the while which was from his pocket<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe continued <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\u201cThere are only two levels when this is blow, but I want to show instead of tell and I think Kari should do it because it only works on me since I was the one who made it.\u201c-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\u201dFine I\u2019ll do it for you dad.\u201c- Kari said with a smile<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyan threw the whistle at her so he can become a demon and they were surprised, but he wasn't done yet. He said <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Once she blows it. This form has more control than power besides if the same person blows it again.\"- signaling Kari to blow the whistle<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Then I become human again, but when I blow it, the same level of control is there with a higher power level.\"- he said before blowing the whistle<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Now that is better because I can use my king demon blade with my demon armor plus my half-human state for more power, but there is two levels left.\"- demonic Ryan said with a smile<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Demon armor?\"- the guys asked confused<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Half-human state?\"- Joana asked as well<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe started <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Demon armor was when I created an energy jewel made from my demonic power and Kagome's priestess power with some ice crystals.\"- He continued </span></div></div>",

He said <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"this is the form that I use to kill the worst of the worst monsters\"- his inner demonic power seal appeared behind him as he continued <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"right behind me is my final level of this power called the inner demonic power seal and I say rampage for it to be smashed away. The inner power seal is the final power boost possible with us.\"- he added while releasing his power to feel a little weak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"When using the inner power seal, it will drain you for sure and using it for too long will make the user faint from the power drain.\"- Ryan S. said<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe started to walk till where all could see him and he said -\"dark summon!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Dark summon summons a dark clone for me to become my darkness with three power boosts and one of them is a surprise.\"- he said while they were watching him and his dark clone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey matched blow for blow till Ryan hit the clone in the chest and he is covered in darkness with blood red eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Blaze has done something like that, he creates clones to fight but he has control over their degree of power. Some of them were nearly as strong as him and others were just ass-kickable\"- Blake said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Everyone has light and darkness in their souls, but they choose what side they are on and my heart is in the light while the rest of me is in darkness.\"- he said to Ray. Then added <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"the same goes for them having inner demons, but we can't make them go through the same stuff that we did.\"- while looking at Kari<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Now with my darkness in my control, it is gathering much faster as my are glowing brighter and red lightning is beginning to come from me.\"- he said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Dark oblivion!\"- he yelled as darkness forms in the air and he grabs his keyblade, made out of darkness and <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Dark inner power seal, vanish.\"- he added<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon after the dark inner power seal was released, they were shocked to see his power of darkness and he released them just before he dropped on one knee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyan S. started <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Before the fight with darkheart and during the bonus match, Ryan and I were fighting with our girlfriends watching us till when I show my mark of the beast king that was where things got weird.\" He continued <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I lost control of my body because the mark was a king and ryan hold me down while I was dealing with the fake king, but Chiharu gave me the power to give the fake king his dishonorable death because I felt her kiss and she used the spirit image jutsu to appear in my mind.\" he finished his tale like Ryan K's story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Now back to the fun.\" he said while getting back to his place where he put his guitar<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoana whispered to Blake<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"They are like you Blake\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I know, but it's somewhat different, you've seen me in my dark state haven't you?\"- Blake answered, Joana nodded<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I don't feel like having a demon inside me. I just...all I remember from that weird state is... rage, anger... usually I don't remember what I did while transformed, but I've trying to master it\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"It's okay, now let's dance\"- Joana said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Wha...?!!\"- Blake got the O_O' face, and a mild sweatdrop on his head, then Joana pulled him at his hand, with her going happily n.n and Blake &gt;.&lt;<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake, being rather shy (though he had the tough way of be and carefree attitude, he wasn't very much sociable or outgoing, despite his friends always brought him to parties) wasn't sure about what to do. Joana began to dance with the music, and she, on purpose, slowly shook her hips and it made it to look like the music was following her instead her to the music. Blake's jaw dropped as this was a definitive 'Daamn...' In his mind. He tried to repress it. Joana giggled. Blake got a brilliant idea, and said <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Wait here. I've got something for you...\"- He went where Ryan H. and Ryan K. were, and he asked them<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Hey guys! Do you have a spare guitar? I left mine in my department,,.\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You play guitar too?\"- Ryan K. asked, which Blake nodded. Ryan H. went to his stuff and after lifting many things with magic, he found it. A very cool guitar which looked like this:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.comparestoreprices.co.uk/images/b-/b-c-rich-platinum-beast-guitar-black.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.comparestoreprices.co.uk/imag...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Here's a spare one of mine. Use it well or the demon inside it will eat your soul!\"- Ryan S. joked. Blake grabbed it, and said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Let's see if you recognize this song\"- Then he said to Joana<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"This is a special surprise for you\"- <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Since when does Blake play guitar?\"- Karina muttered, Joana answered<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I have no idea\"- The guys knew about it but didn't know what was he practicing for, and they were told to keep the secret<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"He's been playing his guitar a lot while you weren't at home\"- Rocky said to her<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Huh?\"- Joana was surprised, but she knew that his pets had to have seen him practicing<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"He's been practicing that song for more than a month\"- Max said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"When I found his guitar he said he didn't play it and that it belonged to his father. He said that he had it as a keepsake\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Blake played guitar since he was very young. He played both guitar and piano when his grandmother lived, but after that he kept practice on the guitar\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"But I play guitar myself, I could've taught him\"- Joana said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I guess he didn't go with you because he wanted it to be a surprise. Now, let's watch and hear what will he do\"- Claire said to her <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe began with a beautiful solo, and in matter of seconds everyone knew it was Led Zeppelin's Stairway to Heaven, Joana's favorite song. She couldn't believe it, she didn't even know Blake played guitar. Because of the characteristic solo, both Ryans recognized the song and decided to accompany him (Blake doesn't sing)</span></div></div>",

All of them are surprised except their family and the song to end at some point, but the look on Joana's face was pure happiness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"So Joana, if you liked that then you'll like this.\"- Ryan K. said while using magic to make an illusion stage appear<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I see that you want to sing that song.\"- Ryan S. said smiling while started play the song Dream on me by the Oak Ridge Boys<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe stage is set to the song and music, which is provided by Ryan, but Ryan K. is thinking:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~what girl to use with the song because the song has been played with many of them so I'll pick the one that had the most troubled childhood.~<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Try to guess who my partner for this song is.\"- Ryan K. said while the child is coming center stage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey stared at the kid for a while so Ryan had to get the kid to go back then come back older and she did just that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Nico Robin, no surprise there.\"- Ryan S. said while shaking his head<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Nico robin, do you mean the Nico robin from One Piece?\"- Ferdinand asked shocked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"He does, I have met her.\"- Kagome said with a smile<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Well I'm surprised that at least some of you would connect the dots about Kagome and Chiharu.\"- Ryan k. said laughing while robin was giggling<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Now the big shocker is over, we are ready to begin the show and I'm going to need some help.\"- Ryan s. said while getting his magic sword from his back and making the illusion of the oak ridge boys appear<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Not all of our power is like the ones that we showed you.\"- he added<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey are watching the show with Ryan K. and Robin working the illusion while Ryan S. is singing along with the band.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"That was great and sweet.\"- Joana said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Yeah.\"- the guys added<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChiharu and Kagome gave the Ryans a flask each.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Rage huh.\"- Ryan S. said laughing<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I'll show you rage.\"- he added<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyan S. covered his body with firestarter and show them a white flame in his hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"This white flame is my soul power because it is like firestarter except for one thing.\"- he explained<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Firestarter is linked to our rage.\"- Ryan K. said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Raging spirit!\"- Ryan s. yelled as the white flame became pure red then released it<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"It is better to keep us as friends than enemies.\"- he said while walking back<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What do you mean?\"- Claire asked him<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"It was about the kid's birthday when Ryan and I were getting our friends to help us with the party and we got a call about some trouble with some pests that won't leave us alone. We weren't there so the kids and their mothers went in our place to stop it, but it didn't go well for them at all.\"- Ryan K. said not happy with the memory<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"We got hurt bad and mom with Chiharu were slightly hurt.\"- Kari said looking sad because of the memory<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"We opened a portal to the fight with guns blazing and kicked some major butt because if anyone hurts our families will be beaten to a bloody pulp.\"- he said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"it was like Blake's dark powers, but we had more power and we were dead serious besides they ran away after the beating.\"- he added<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Whoa.\"- Blake said surprised<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"We should get the beds ready because we will be going to sleep soon and take you to school, but leave the bully mess to us.\"- Ryan K. said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Umm...

Though Joana's family is somewhat rich (not as bill gates but far than anyone of Blake's family. Surprisingly, her parents never minded about that.)* and they send her money periodically to pay her studies and allow her to get stuff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake now had to see how would his pets live. Luckily, he had a spare room, which was kind of a guest room, and it had a spare bed too. So, he took an old unused hammock and hung it. His pets came in and Blake assigned places<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Ok, guys, I don't have that much space, you know, but here you can be comfortable: Rocky, you'll sleep on the hammock. Tabitha, you'll share the bed with Max, and...oh damn! D'Artagnan wait here...\"- Blake thought quickly where could he sleep but he had no other place. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'The tub?' Blake thought, and went with his turtle<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Err...D'Artagnan, I can't figure out where could you sleep...\"- <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Don't worry Master, I'll sleep here, but, if you don't mind, leave the thermostat on. I can't produce heat by my own\"- Blake was agreeing but felt bad, he felt that it wasn't fair, and decided to do something...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I'll be right back. Don't destroy the house\"- Blake joked and left, going to somewhere to see someone to get something... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake thought that his pets didn't cause trouble even when they were animals, so, now, the house is even safer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPets, alone, got bored and went to Blake's room...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of them decided to check themselves out, because none of them knew how felt to be like a human. Max and Rocky confirmed that hey retained their common traits, if not enhanced (And Rocky got retractile claws, both legs and hands, as well as the others, except for D'Artagnan). D'Artagnan practiced some fighting moves, both based in what Blake did when training near the department and what he'd seen on TV, specially a certain series where main characters were ass-kicking turtles. Rocky and Max joked at him<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What? Now you think you're the fifth turtle?\"- Rocky said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I'm the 6th\"- D'Artagnan affirmed -\"5th is sexy Venus de Milo\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Hmm...sexy?\"- Max rose an eyebrow<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Understand me! I'm a turtle, and I don't get to see much of females except in that sex channel, you know, the one with that yellow rectangle thing\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Yeah, they call it National Geographic and others. There you can see practically any animal species, all about them, sex included\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Yeeah!\"- Rocky said, remembering some documentary about dogs and wolves<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"All of you are the same, only think about sex. Are all males like that?\"- Tabitha said, sighing, turning the TV on<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I'm not sure about humans, hey! why we never have seen a show about humans? They should air some show about people\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTabitha, who was channel surfing, found History Channel, there was a documentary about people history, she said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Let's see...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2 hours later...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Wow... human history is pretty complicated\"- Rocky said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"And loong... It told us about 6,000 years, that's too much history, but it's fun to see how humans are different in each part of the world. And wear different stuff, some are fun, others are just weird...\"- Max added<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"It's strange, only humans register what other in past did. I guess that's why there's no Dog history or Cat History or Turtle History...\"- D'Artagnan said and then continued<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"But they basically find food or a way to get food, some other group of them tries to steal it and they fight, but they use stuff, like monkeys. Monkeys throw stones, humans have made from weird to weirder things just to kill, though some used just sticks and stones\"- D'Artagnan said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I thought they used their paws to fight, like Master. Master doesn't use anything, though his moves are quite strange\"- Rocky said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"That's because his paws and every other human's are bare, Master doesn't have claws. Their skin it's kind of delicate, they don't even have fur, except for their head fur. That's why they wear clothes on\"- D'Artagnan replied<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"It'd be easier for them to fight if they had claws and sharper fangs. Those shining sticks called swords that they use to cut other humans, I guess that's by the lack of claws, and they've even copied turtles' shell, made out of that same shining gray thing\"- Max said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I guess then that humans invent stuff that they lack\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Oooh\"- Everyone said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"That's not true, there are clawed humans, but I've never seen them fighting\"- Max said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Clawed humans?\"- D'Artagnan was intrigued<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"All I've seen are always females. I guess that female fighting reminds them of cats, remember Tabitha? When that Ryan guy said 'No cat fights?' And looked at Master's mate and that other girl, I guess that's what he meant\"- Max said<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTabitha silent, glared at him with a vein popping from her forehead. Rocky then said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Hmm... I wonder... how would be humans mating?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What do you mean? Mating is always the same, I'm telling you, a reptile\"- D'Artagnan said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Because all of us are usually on fours, and there vary things, like small games, kicking other males' asses, and stuff like cats' tough love' \"- D'Artagnan laughed, Tabitha and Max glared at him. Rocky said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What?! You bite each other and seem like you're fighting. You cats don't enjoy life\"- Rocky. Tabitha and Max had veins popping from their foreheads and blushed, both embarrassment and anger<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Well, whatever, as I was saying, humans are weird, they stand on two, and are weird in a lot of things\"- Rocky said and pressed Blake's PC power button <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"How did you do that?\"- Tabitha asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I've seen it many times. Master seeks different stuff in this TV with keyboard, and, oh, there's an arrow!! But.. how the hell do I use this!!?\"- Rocky said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"And you're the expert...\"- Max said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Bah! Move out! Let professionals come\"- D'Artagnan said as he sat on the chair and began browsing. All the other pets were with a WTF?! face<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I used to live here, remember? My tank used to be here until Master's mate moved in\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Okay, let's see...\"- D'Artagnan browsed the computer... -\"What would be these stuff? Hmm... it seems to be a game, hey, this is cool! This game is about beating other humans!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What's that?\"- Tabitha asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"It's called Street Fighter IV...IV? What does that mean?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Forget about that, I want to see human documentaries\"- Rocky said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"OK, let's see what's this...*time later* oh! this is another game, this like the stuff we watched, groups of humans killing each other and building stuff...Now I see, humans used to be more natural in ancient times, and now they have created their stuff...though...I wonder, why those have human stuff and these don't? Why these are almost naked and use just sticks to fight? It's not fair, enemies use guns\"- D'Artagnan said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"It says that they are conquerors and the others are natives...oh I remember that, Master had a book about that. The guys with guns are called Conquerors, and the others are called Natives\"- Max added<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"It said something about Conquerors killing Natives, I guess that Natives are Conquerors' preys\"- Rocky said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I guess so, it seems they're predators, they're hunting the natives with the same guns they use to hunt animals!!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"They look like little toys, what's that game anyway?\"- Tabitha said, standing behind them to see<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"This stuff is called age of empires III...again, what does III stand for?\"- D'Artagnan said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Wait!\"- Max said before D'Artagnan closed the game -\"Look\"- Max said, pointing to a shot where could be seen a native wearing a jaguar skin on against a conqueror<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What?\"- Rocky and Tabitha asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"This is scary... natives' skin is almost the same color as Master's, and has black fur on his head too...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"So what?\"- Rocky said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Look at the conqueror's skin... it's white, and has brown fur on his head...\"- Max replied<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"LIKE MASTER'S MATE!!!\"- All of them screamed and fell backwards\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"This is bad. Master must know\"- Rocky said. D'Artagnan closed the game, then Max pointed at a book<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"This is called History, like the TV. It says that Conquerors killed thousands of natives\"- Everyone looked at the drawings in the book. It showed armored people riding horses firing at native warriors who wore animal skins and used wooden - obsidian weapons to fight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Then what the game said it's true\"- D' said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I guess that it's their nature... I'm not sure, it must be like we cats hunting mice and rats\"- Tabitha said, wo was also an excellent hunter<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I'd like to hunt foxes. I hate that they steal anything they get, and they steal MY food\"- Rocky said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Food is sacred\"- Max concluded (Every animal thinks so, don't they?). Max and Tabitha kept reading the book together, while Rocky just looked at the pictures. D' kept with the computer<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I'll seek for the videos, they are in a channel called Internet...\"- D'Artagnan said -\"This TV with keyboard is weird!! it's difficult to use it, I wonder how Master does...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Mmm...Uh-huh...\"- D'Artagnan was checking the desktop<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What's this, a Fire fox? What does a fox on fire here?!\"- D'Artagnan said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Don't open it. I don't like foxes, they steal stuff like my food. I hate that\"- Rocky said <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"OK\"- And browsed until he found a blue E labeled 'Internet Explorer'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Yess!! This is what I was looking for\"- D'Artagnan said -\"Now, let's search\"-</span></div></div>",

Now he had them he decided to enable the department's basement, which hadn't much things in it at all. When he finished installing the two mattresses and minor arrangements to make the basement habitable, he went upstairs and heard a scream. He rushed to where it came from, and it was the bathroom...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNothing had happened, Tabitha was looking at herself at the mirror, Blake sighed and asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Tabitha, why the hell did you scream?\"- And she answered<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"My breasts, are gone!\"- Blake was with the O_o WTF?! face, he looked at her for a moment and said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"They're still there...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I had six of these, why I only have two now?\"- Blake closed his face with his hand and said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Because of the anthro transformation... you're supposed to have some human traits...and human females have 'only' two breasts\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"But I screamed because there's no way I can be pregnant...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What? What did you do?!\"- Blake exclaimed<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"My, my breasts are swollen! Why!\"- Tabitha said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"They aren't swollen... and it doesn't mean you're pregnant...It's just another human trait...\"- Blake said, and went to his bedroom. Just to find his pets staring at the computer 'How the hell did they learn to use it?' Blake thought, and when he went to look what they were looking at, he fell backwards. After he got up, he began acting frantically and closed the internet browser...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"WHY...THE HELL...WERE YOU...WATCHING PORN!!?\"- Blake asked, angry and still frantic<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"We weren't watching that. We were watching a human show like the ones on National Geographic on this TV with keyboard...\"- They said at once. Blake dismayed, realizing that they thought it was a documentary... Minutes later...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Master, are you ok?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Ugh...my head...damn! why did you think it was a Nat Geo stuff? That was a pornographic movie!!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Master, I'm sorry but I don't understand what's that porn you're talking about...\"- D'Artagnan said. Blake sighed, and began to explain. He wasn't frantic anymore as he realized they didn't mean to do something wrong<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Porn is material with humans having sex... Some perverted people pays for it, and more perverted people make out money from that...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Why do humans pay for it?\"- D'Artagnan asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Because some people with mind problems feels aroused by it... Mostly are men...human males...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Why is it wrong?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Because it has gone too far. They mutilate reality, and even sell videos of humans having sex with animals, or with children, which are human's litters, or even weirder stuff...Just to imagine it, would any of you mate with a litter? Or with a human?\"- All of them denied with their heads<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"But why is it allowed in those channels that seem educative?\"- Max said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Let's explain it, in human world, people having sex = porn, animals having sex = either a documentary or a very sick kind of porn. To most, there's nothing wrong watching animal documentaries because sex isn't the sole cause and there's a lot they can learn about animals, and because they are other species they don't feel the same as when watching people...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"But then wouldn't be those shows porn to us?\"- D'Artagnan asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Technically, but not much animals watch TV and TV shows are made for people. And by the way, the thing you're using it's not a TV with keyboard, it's a computer...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeveral explanations later...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seemed Blake's pets had understood several things. He looked at the watch and laid on his hammock, waiting for Joana. Blake's pets were moved to the basement leaving only Tabitha in the guest room (basement was bigger and had two bed mattresses and a hammock)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the basement...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Wow, humans have a lot of rules and weird things\"- Rocky said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I know. Human mating is also weird... they have too many ways to do a simple thing\"- Max replied<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"At least they don't bite each other...\"- D'Artagnan joked at Max<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"In fact, some of them do, don't you remember? When white humans feed, the TV showed they had longer fangs and they sucked their blood out\"- Max answered<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"That was scary... humans are the only kind that eats each other, besides spiders and mantis...\"- D'Artagnan added<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Which reminds me? Shouldn't we tell Master about his mate?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Girlfriend, you remember? Master told us that humans don't call them mates because is rude, they call girlfriend a female mate and boyfriend a male mate. He said something about marriage but he said he'd explain it later\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I guess he isn't in the mood now. I could smell it. And it'd be difficult to tell him with no proves\"- Rocky said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"That book! Is the prove!\"- Max said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What Rocky says is that we need a proof of Master's girlfriend trying to kill him\"- D'Artagnan said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"She's done it several times. She tried to strangle him, I've seen it, but Master never fights her back\"- Max answered<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Maybe it's an instinct to let himself be killed, like male spiders and mantis...\"- D'Artagnan tried to find an explanation<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Well, we must take a sleep don't you think?\"- D'Artagnan said, making himself comfortable on the mattress<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I guess so\"- Max said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I'll stay on guard for some hours more\"- Rocky said, used to guard Blake's department at night while everyone else slept<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"OK. I'll sleep 4 hours at much. I'll relieve you then.\"- Max jumped on the other mattress and closed his eyes. Rocky walked outside and went to the roof, using his enhanced abilities to climb up (both his strength and his claws) Rocky marveled at the beauty of the city at night. All those lights... Rocky felt the night wind and decided to keep alert for anything. Though Blake never trained him to be a guard dog, Rocky felt himself as he had to do it, like if it was in his blood...</span></div></div>",

And my dark form is the only way I've had to defeat him. There's no time I defeated him without it\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"That's not true\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Huh?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"The last time you fought Blaze, before this one, you didn't use it. Your hair rose up but your eyes didn't go white. In fact, they became yellow... I had never seen you like that... And that time was when you damaged Blaze the most\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"...'Both light and Darkness'...\"- Blake repeated Ryan's words -\"I can't understand how can I have two forces... To my knowledge I only had darkness inside me\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Even at your dark form, I see you are not evil\"- Joana said, hugging him<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"How do you know?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Because that day you went dark, I walked toward you and I stood in front of you. I stared at your eyes. You stared at me, but the look in your eyes softened. Then you dismayed because your anger was gone\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I thought that in that state I could kill anyone\"- Blake said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Once Alexander told me...'You have that ancient curse...you'll become a killing machine, just like your father, who killed my grandfather and my father...' Though I know my father wasn't a killer...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Blake. You ARE NOT evil. Don't forget it. I love you.\"- Joana said, kissed him and went to sleep</span></div></div>",

An unknown male metallic sounding voice said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You're a monster born to destroy\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I AM NOT!!\"- Blake screamed<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You're evil\"- He saw more battling memories<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You are the Angel of Destruction. You're the Key of Darkness...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I've never fought for the sole purpose of hurting\"- Blake answered<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Yes, you have, when you avenged your old friend...Robin, don't you remember?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake saw his oldest memories. Robin was his first friend ever. They met both as street boys, being Robin 11 years old while Blake was 5 at that time. Robin taught Blake all what he knew, even his fighting style. Robin taught him how to survive in streets, and with his help Blake could survive at the cruel world. Blake looked him, teaching a little version of himself to fight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake looked how Robin and him stole food barely enough to survive the day. They always divided it, though Robin, after seeing Blake's generosity, sharing with his pets, he some times spent days in hunger for Blake to eat. Though Robin never complained, he had seen Blake was a good boy. Blake smiled when looked how they played together, but suddenly, his memories brought him to the fateful day (he was as a watcher, the Blake spoken about is the young one, until written otherwise)...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin and Blake were sleeping in a park, covering themselves with newspapers to protect themselves poorly from cold. They went under a newsstand because it was raining. But suddenly, a group of vandals attacked them. Robin reacted first and began to fight back. Blake joined the fight, but being just 5 years old was easily defeated, though he put up a good fight and took down two of the seven guys of the group. Then, one of the vandals said <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Hey, street dog!! wanna see how a street rat must be treated?\"- The guy took out a knife and rushed to kill little Blake. Robin dashed and, standing before Blake, took the fatal hit himself, falling down to the ground. The guys laughed and, believing that Blake was already dead, they began to laugh and walked away as nothing had happened. Blake woke up quickly just to see Robin dying. Robin said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Don't worry...just run away...\"- <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Robin...why?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You have lots of life ahead. Don't waste your life. You can be something greater than this. You can be better than this\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Robin...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I know what I tell you. And I understand why your father did the same... you're different...you still have to find your own path...your own life, and happiness...Someday, you'll leave streets life behind, and will be...happy...maybe you...some...day...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd after coughing blood, he went cold slowly and died, at young Blake's side. Blake stood up, clenched his fists and screamed toward the sky in deep pain, and...anger...Rain falling on him, and on his best friend's dead body...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTears dropped from Blake's eyes, running down his cheeks, falling on his clenched fists. Blake screamed as he never had screamed before, and wind swirled around, lifting up dust and garbage. Blake's hair rose up and kept waving upward. His eyes went white. For the first time Blake felt anger... and the desire for killing... the thirst for blood... the thirst for revenge...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake ran, nobody left...nowhere to go..., he rushed to an unknown fate, his instincts guided him, and they took him where the guys were. Blake attacked them furiously from behind, taking them by surprise, and his appearance caused them to fear him. Blake punched and kicked them with all his might and with all his anger. He disarmed the guy who killed Robin, and slashed his throat, killing him with his own knife. Blake also killed other guy that day, stabbing him in heart with that same knife. Blake hurt all the others badly, but they escaped. Blake left there and when got away, dismayed...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You're a natural assassin, you see?\"- The voice said at adult Blake, whose visions took him back to the moment where his father died. Then he looked, when a bully was hurling Karina (11 years old). Then was taken to a moment where Claire was being hit (12 years old). Then looked to his friends being beaten up in several occasions, the times bullies attacked Joana in revenge against him. The memories began to pass faster as the voice kept saying<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Are you angry?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Don't you desire revenge?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Don't you have thirst for blood?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Don't you want to kill all those bastards?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Don't you desire to destroy?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Don't you want to kill...me?\"- The voice said as Blaze appeared in front of him, laughing maniatically<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"> Background Music: Nightwish - Ghost Love Score</div> <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Arrghhh...\"- Blake replied, clenching his fists. Lightning bolts flashed across the gray sky, which turned black, as the wind swirled around the two warriors. The grass waved along the violent wind. Thunders sounded and shook the ground, and they ran towards each other, toward, their eternal fight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey had an impressive fight and Blake was hitting him with all of his might, remembering all the anger, all the desire for revenge... Blake kept fighting at his best and was putting up a good fight. Blaze somehow kept at a higher level, but after several punches and kicks, at god speed, in this unknown place. Blake and Blaze hit each other, their fists clashing in a huge shockwave, that sent them flying backward. Blaze began to search for Blake, and then he heard a scream, a rage scream, and looked toward a mountain. In its top was Blake, standing, and turning into his dark form. His black hair rose up, his muscles tightened, his eyes went white, and parts of the mountain's summit began to crack and fell down, because of the tremors caused by his power.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze smiled and they engaged into an even more violent combat. Blaze kept pushing Blake, though it seemed that Blake already outmatched him. Blake's rage grew, his desire for blood, for Blaze's blood grew, and he was becoming more powerful. The dark traits became more accentuated than already they were. Blake and Blaze fought at that awesome speed and after hours of fighting, Blaze had already taken a lot of damage, barely standing, though he still could fight back. Blake was at a darker state than usual, and tried to finish Blaze off, but he vanished, his voice was heard<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"There, there...That's it...You're almost ready...little left to do...Angel of Darkness...soon you'll become the Key!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The sky became blue, the wind calmed down, except for the wind around raging Blake. The ground and grass, which were voided and burnt to ashed, slowly healed back. Blake found it strange. Then, a flower began to grow, wait a minute...a flower? out of nothing? Yes. It was closed, but kept growing, growing huge, as tall as a human. The petals opened slowly and a woman was standing there. The flower began to reverse, finally disappearing as it appeared. More ashes and burnt ground healed back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stared at Blake, who was still at Dark form (and around him the nature's healing had no effect, he was standing on ashes, the wind was swirling around his body). The woman was almost as tall as him (Blake stood at 1.85 mt, and the woman was at 1.80 mt for sure), had naturally green hair, and aqua eyes. She was dressed in a greek-like robe, with some golden parts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stared at him, and Blake asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Who are you?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I'm your mother\"- The woman said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Don't try to pull my leg. You're not my mother. I don't have one.\"- The woman walked toward him, Blake stood in a guard stance, after seeing Blaze all weirdos were the same to him. The woman kept walking toward him and Blake moved slightly backwards, prepared to use god speed at any moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stood very close to him, and noticing his stance, she said in a soothing voice<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I won't hurt you. I'm not like him\"- Blake got surprised at her mentioning Blaze, but he still didn't trust her<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I'm not falling for that. I asked you, who are you? If you don't respond I'll fight you like I fought Blaze...and if I'm not wrong you're not even a woman, you're a succubus, aren't you?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"My name is Lith, if that's what you're asking, and about who am I, I already told you...\"- The name triggered Blake's anger... Lilith was his mother's name, and she's for sure the person he hates the most (except for Blaze but he isn't a person)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Enough games\"- Blake used the god dash and tried to kick her, surprisingly, she dodged it. Blake dashed toward her again and kept punching and kicking, Lith dodging most and blocking the ones she couldn't dodge. Blake kept like that for about 10 minutes, and then, he said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Will you fight or not?!! I don't have time to spend with Blaze's minor servants\"- Blake said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I didn't come to fight you. I'm not hurting you\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Whatever\"- Blake began to walk away, but she appeared in front of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Why don't you believe me?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"No good person can have such powers, and the fact you know Blaze proves it more, and you telling me that you're my mother is annoying. I don't have a mother and I'm not a little child that needs one\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You are a good boy and you have the power\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I don't recall ever calling myself good, I just fight for the people I care about\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I know...your life has been hard\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What can you know? And what are you supposed to be?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I see everything. And I've watched you even before you were born\"- Blake got surprised but he hid it<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I know you're surprised. And no, I have nothing to do with Blaze, though I'm the mother of all Earth's living beings\"- Blake began to walk backwards. He thought that if he was facing a kind of goddess he was screwed<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You're not screwed\"- Lith added <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'What?! How the hell did she know?! Blake thought<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I can read your mind and your heart. You're hurt\"- She walked toward Blake, and this time he didn't fight. She extended her hand and Blake lost the dark form, falling dismayed, but Lith caught him in her arms, and he began to glow, his wounds began to heal and he slowly opened his eyes<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I told you that I wouldn't hurt you\"- Lith said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"And so...are you Gaia?\"- She did a ^_^ face and giggled<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"That's one of my names. Greeks called me Gaia, Egyptians called me Isis, and so. Only Atlants knew my real name\"- Blake pushed her off after he regained energy, she, reading his mind again, said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"There's nothing wrong with needing affection. Humans were created as sentient beings, and love is one of their needs\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I never had a maternal figure. So, I find kind of awkward that stuff\"- She hugged him suddenly And Blake was thinking 'What is this for?!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Despite I'm mother of all people and living beings, I'm specially the mother for the orphans, whose don't have a human mother. And I'm hugging you to prove you that there is no harm\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"It's OK, but may you stop reading my mind? It's kind of annoying...\"- She giggled and nodded. Blake was feeling strangely warm and felt his energies increasing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"So...are you the deity my grandmother talked me about?\"- She nodded<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Anyway. Why do you appear to me? You must've heard that I said I didn't believe in God\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You said you didn't know what to believe in. And you were right when saying why everyone would think God had to be a man\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Wait? Are you just an earth goddess or are you...?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I'm Goddess\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Err...if you are so powerful why didn't you destroy Blaze or save my father?\"- Lith's face saddened, and said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I can't kill him. Almost nobody can, only someone born with the power of light and darkness...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Aren't you the Goddess?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Someone called Omega is more powerful than me\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What happened to him?\"- <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I'll tell you with the story\"- She said, and continued<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"There have been several wars in Heaven, the one you call Blaze appeared by the third one. He was made nearly completely immortal, not even the greatest archangels were able to destroy him. Only one last creation of my Father was able to fight him back, but he wasn't able to kill him, only to seal his power... his bloodline has continued up until your birth...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOther ancestors of you were powerful but not enough to destroy Blaze, one of them, who lived in Mesoamerica, became its king. He was called Quetzalcoatl by the Aztecs and Kukulkan by the Mayans. He saved his people from Blaze, damaging him severely with his light powers. Blaze took more than 100 years to recover from that, and waited for the next ones, waiting to find another descendant that could break his seal. It's been over 2000 years after that. And you are the one with the power...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I'll tell you later. You need to wake up.

He heard a breaking sound, and immediately got up (Blake slept with a black shirt and his jeans on). Also, Rocky's growling has heard. Blake shook Joana gently, she woke up slowly, yawning<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What is it honey?\"- Joana asked, eyes closed<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Someone is attacking us!! Stay here, I'll fight back. Rocky is already doing so. Tabitha will stay to protect you. I need my pets to help me against whatever it is there outside.\"- Blake said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Blake... don't go outside...\"- <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I have to, I can't let my pets fight alone, if someone kills them I would never forgive myself\"- Joana found surprising Blake speaking like that. After refusing the idea of children and even showing disgust toward babies, it was strange that he acted fatherly toward his pets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"OK. I'll stay here\"- Joana said. Blake went out quickly...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake walked outside and closed the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What the hell...?\"- He saw how Max and D'Artagnan rushed outside. 'They have enhanced hearing, they surely heard it before me' Blake thought, as he looked up and heard the noises coming from above. He quickly climbed up (He used to do that since very young) and got to the roof. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"> Background Music: Stratovarius - Glory of the World</div> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust to see Rocky fighting Blaze, surprisingly, Rocky was matching him well. And in fact Blaze was struggling to not allow Rocky to bite him<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What the hell is with these freaks?!\"- Blaze said, pushing Rocky back and getting attacked by both Max and D'Artagnan, whom slashed him several times. Blake realized that they had a high potential to damage Blaze because their attacks cut through the skin. Blaze kicked D'Artagnan away, though he had no damage because he hid in his shell before falling down. Max was keeping up because of his speed and fast reflexes, matching Blaze's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Max used a strange somersault and held Blaze from behind, and looked at Blake. Blake got the message. He went towards Blaze, stood still until the wind swirled around of them and the dust lifted up, Blake growled in anger, and, saying nothing, began to hit him with all of his might, making him to spit out blood after so many hits. Blaze could wriggle out of Max's hold and faced Blake, and they fought. Blake kicked his ass rather quickly, as he practically couldn't connect even a single hit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, somewhere near there...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe \"mad\" scientist was scanning the area again (Yeah' he's a compulsive obsessive with severe mind troubles XD) His new scanner made several beeps, and he read it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"...A biological energy detected...2,224 EU*...What?!\"- He kept reading, the radar was showing several biological energy fields, five at least, and near them other two<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Near that are other four ones...1,794...1,688,...1653,...1700...\"- He checked the other two nearby <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"1,421...116...\"- The scientist had the WTF?! face when looked at the '116', and then he murmured <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"That must be a person...human average is generally 80 for males and 72 for females...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"It seems there's a conflict. Four energy fields seem to be attacking the 1,700 one...\"- He mumbled and began to follow the signal<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack to Blake's department's roof...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze got his ass kicked as he hadn't had ever, and, fighting the anthros, Rocky bit him in neck, a fatal wound, as Rocky crushed his spinal cord. Blaze fell down, and began to bleed, then, laughed maniatically and, after dying, vanished. Then Blake said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I knew that it was too easy... but what the hell would a simple weak clone do?\"- Then he heard Blaze's maniatical laugh, just that multiplied x 100 or more. And he looked down, he saw a lot of red glowing eyes...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Damn it!!!\"- Blake knew that it wouldn't be an easy night. Tabitha went ouside when Blake screamed but he told her to stay, which she did unwillingly<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Guys, I need all your help. We'll fight that bastard Blaze about 100 times this morning, maybe more. Don't hesitate to kill, use bites, slashes, and anything you have in mind, but kill them as quickly as possible\"- Said Blake as he deployed a red knife (Taken from one of the bullies Blake fought at 9th grade)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Blaze's clones jumped up and began a massive attack. Blake slid down the wall and engaged Blazes alone, to defend his department's entrance. Rocky and D'Artagnan kept at the roof and Max went to fight at the backdoor<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Don't let them get into the department, and...\"- Blake added, knowing Tabitha could hear -\"...Tabitha, stay in guard, go to the basement and take Joana with you\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile. Tabitha, who heard everything, secured the whole department and took Joana to the basement, they closed it and Tabitha stood in guard. She was protecting Joana just because Blake ordered her to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"> Background Music: Nightwish - Wishmaster</div> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake hit one of Blaze's clone's face. Kicked another in stomach. One of them punched Blake in the face. Blake slashed his throat with the knife, and stabbed another. One of them said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Didn't you say that cowards used weapons?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I also said that was more coward fight a lot against one\"- Saying that, Blake put away the knife in a pocket of his jeans. And dashed at god speed at that clone, striking him with a powerful punch. The Blaze clones moved at that speed and Blake began hit strongly each one, taking them down by breaking their necks or other fatal blows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was an awesome high speed battle, and the ground shook each time Blake's fist clashed agaist Blaze's clone's. Though Blake seemed to be stronger, the Blazes rose up their power a bit, and with the huge numerical advantage Blake began to lose, though he was keeping it up as he used each move, even defense blocking, to perform a counter attack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRocky and D'Artagnan were having a tough time too. Though Rocky could break their necks easily by biting them, and D'Artagnan had a lot of moves, adding that he also had claws, and those rivaled Max's in sharpness. Rocky's were big and sharp too, but were like a bear's, though sharper, but worked as heavy hammers and the bone-crushing effect was more than the cutting effect (Rocky caused bigger wounds, while D'Artagnan and Max caused deeper). Max was, by the way, who had the highest killing rate, as slashing their throats was enough, and even could slash two or three at once (two blows and a round kick)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake kept fighting the Blaze clones, now in a greater disadvantage, and jumped up, surprisingly, reaching 20 meters, and so did the clones. Blake, who hadn't taken down much clones, in mid air killed about 15 and still engaged in fight against the others. They seemed to be endless. Blake was losing anyway, getting punched, kicked and more by the clones.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake got pinned down and kicked by the Blazes, then, one of them lifted him up and threw him upward, jumped and performed an impressive punches and kicks in mid-air combo (This attack was only performed by Blaze at their first encounter in SWGF/GTS, where he defeated all of school's bullies, who were threatening his friends and Joana, to set a trap and fight Blake for the first time ever. In fact, that chapter was written by my friend Teniko, Blaze's creator, as well as Lith's)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze's clone kicked Blake and landed on him with earth shaking force, adding the strenght of the kick itself to the gravity and the falling height. Blake, barely awake, thought<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I...I can't let them win...I can't let them get inside...I can't let them hurt Joana!!...' Blaze's clones were trampling him but suddenly, wind swirled violently around Blake, and bolts flashed frantically across the sky. Blake stood up and none of the blows that clones delivered had effect. It was like they were hitting a wall. Blake didn't even move. His hair began to rise up and wave upward. His muscles tightened more. His eyes became golden, and his whole body had a golden glow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake felt different. He didn't feel anger, but felt somewhat as always (fighting to protect other people, one of the reasons he didn't go dark so often), and knew that had to fight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake gave a new definition to the \"kicking-ass\" term, and was able to annihilate Blaze clones with single punches, and the ones who didn't die at first hit, were like on fire in the place where Blake punched them, but with a golden one, which burnt the wound. He even caused that by solely touching them, or even worse, when the clones punched him, they had their hands burning in golden fire (It looks like this: <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dOwPg6KDhfw\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dOwPg6KDh...</a>)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore Blaze clones appeared and they had a higher power, though it wasn't enough, as Blake still killed them with few hits, and either the punches had no effect or Blake dodged or blocked it. Some times he'd catch the fist and perform a simple combo to kill the clone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDozens of dead clones later...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake stood in front of the clones, who were focusing on him (And eventually left Max, D'Artagnan and Rocky, who were beginning to get tired, well, Max got completely tired, and D'Artagnan was somewhat, Rocky still had energies to keep fighting)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake clenched his fists and the golden glow around him extended, it grew becoming a flaming aura, which shone in the midnight sky. And though the clones had small purple glow, it showed to not be as powerful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mad scientist looked at his radar, following the results <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"This is crazy!! There are a lot of energy fields measured in 2,000 EU, but there's this one...one moment...\"- He looked at the machine showing a stronger glowing point in the radar...2,224...then the numbers began to increase frantically, 2,400...2585...2700...2845...2900...3000...(the point where the first version of the scouter broke)...3,200...3,320...3,400...3782!!! and it stopped at that number, with a big \"!\" blinking at the screen<br>\r\n<br>\r\n.\"3782? That's insane!! I've got to find out what the hell is so powerful\"- The ground shook and he looked up, distinguishing a golden glow above somewhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"That's no star...that has to be the source of energy...\"- He ran following that light, though it still would take almost an hour reach the place...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn that mean time, Blake was exterminating Blaze's clones, one after another, and some times several at once. Then...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*It's already specified that that thing scans for biological energy, so, Energy Units don't need to be called Biological again, it'd be a redundancy wouldn't it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The clones are still coming so the Ryans used magic to replenish their energy and the twins came quicker than the other four so they are using their attacks as Blake is using his god speed to kill the clones. Ryan S.'s darkness and Ryan K.'s demon power are giving them energy to keep fighting till they fall to the ground from the energy drain. The rage is building in Ryan because they will not die here and they see the rest of their family coming to fight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"About time you got here.\"- Ryan K. said to them with a smile<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Shut up.\"- Kagome said to him<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Oh, fiesty aren't we?-\"Ryan K. asked her still smiling<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You ready Kari?\"- Ray asked her<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Yeah.\"- she said to him while fighting clones<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Ryans are resting for the moment as the others are fighting the clones and they got an idea about a suit. Ryan S. opened a pocket portal to pull two arsenal suits out because they have a nice feature.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"time freeze.\"- Ryan K. said as he put his fingers into a wall of reality before saying<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTime is slowing down to a stop while they are killing clones nonstop and he released the time freeze. Time is starting back up quicker than they thought and they rested while drinking their drinks. Ryan S. started to laugh because the clones are a joke so he summoned about 5 of his clones to fight and Ryan k. did the same thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~Sacrificing battle power for a massive attack force hmm... Blaze either has a plan or is a perfect idiot~ Ryan K. thought<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey have some of their energy back so Ryan S. made his saving light and dark oblivion keyblades appear and he said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Fusion power seal: twilight keyblade.\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis two keyblades started to have the fusion seal around them to form a double-edge keyblade with the ying-yang symbol has the keychain and he called his fallen angel wings to form the fallen angel armor.

They keep getting up for more till the ryan's rage was buring with even more rage.

The battle starts once again with new powers to test out and blake is watching this till he started walking to the battlefield. He was smiling just like his training with ryan and gave blaze a triple round house kick to face while using god speed.

Nobody knew what were those lights but Blaze knew that it always appeared when he was about to kill Blake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyan H. and Ryan K., seeing this, engaged in fight against Blaze, but surprisingly he was fighting at their same level... plus they two were fighting at once. Ryan K. with his Fallen Angel Armor performed several punched and kicks at Blaze, and Ryan H. slashed him with the Twilight Blade. They also noticed that now Blaze reacted almost as fast as them, and despite of their senses, they wondered where was Blaze's power coming from, he had taken enough damage to be defeated at least thrice (Before, they could predict Blaze's moves). Both Ryans aimed at him and shot two powerful darkness beams at once, which made a great explosion (barely contained by the barrier). But Blaze was there, standing still and then, he said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Hey, you! Tell me, what happens when you pour water on a pool?\"- Both of them were confused at such a senseless question, but Ryan K. answered<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"The pool gets filled...so what? Did you miss that class at elementary school?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Heh!! Then tell me... what happens if you throw darkness at darkness...I'll spoil that one...Darkness grows...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyans couldn't help but their jaws dropped. They had been \"feeding\" Blaze in battle, as the powerful dark shots hit him, though causing damage, allowed him to gain the energy and heal himself. Blaze then attacked them and with the power of last blast he hurt them badly, though they could still fight with no problem, as this was the first major damage dealt to them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hero duo kept attacking Blaze with light beams, light blades and anything light powered to truly damage Blaze, though it was a bit too late, Blaze had absorbed who knows how much energy, and was fighting at full power, no more, nor less. The Twilight and Fallen Angel armor used too much energy, and after a violent combat, their energies were getting drained, as such powers required a lot of energy. Ryan H., holding the Twilight Blade downward, he sank it into the ground, and a circle made out of light with strange symbols surrounded Blaze. The light circle spun around for a moment and began to decrease its diameter until it wrapped Blaze. Then, it exploded and Ryan K. shot a powerful light beam with each hand. Blaze was standing there, this time severely damaged, the right part of his torso totally destroyed, but he laughed and said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Don't you understand. I AM IMMORTAL!!\"- Blaze shot a lot of strange dark beams shaped as knives from his left hand and then. a black smoke appeared around him, taking the form of an arm where Blaze should have one. The smoke turned into Blaze's right arm and torso missing part. Blaze looked at his enemies, they were hurt pretty badly by the knives, but Ryan H. replied<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Well, we can heal too\"- Saying that, Used more of the armor's magic to heal himself, Ryan K. did so with his own armor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Idiots. My power is limitless, you barely could use your abilities now\"- <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"> Background Music: Adagio - Dominate</div> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze was about to engage against them in fight but heard a sound and turned around. Blake got up again. Blaze dashed at him with god speed and grabbed him by the neck, punching him with the other hand, also kicking and hitting him with his knee. Blaze threw him down but this time Blake kicked upward and punched him several times, though he wasn't putting up much of a fight at his current state, weakened and damaged, adding the fact Blaze is at full power. Blaze said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Do you think you can fight me like this? At normal state you can't even match me\"- Ryan H. and Ryan K. weren't sure why but there had to be an evil reason for Blaze wanting Blake to transform. They rushed toward Blaze and they engaged into another god speed combat, kicks, punches, and more clashed, but Blaze this time used a several energy waves which were boomerang shaped to attack, and he got them away from him, plus those blades cut through their armor, making them bleed. Ryan H. however destroyed most of the waves with the Twilight Blade, while Ryan K. activated his angel wings as a shield. They got sent away several dozen feet, and when tried to stand up, they found out that Blaze had paralyzed them, and watched whatever Blaze was going to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze walked toward Blake, and punched him, but this time, Blake caught the fist in his left hand and stared at him. He said no words but growled instead, and the irises and pupils in his eyes disappeared. His hair rose up and waved upward, this time his fangs grew slightly, and even his nails grew a bit (one or two cm). Even Ryans could thee the darkness in his eyes, and the power that Blake still held. Even seemed that Blake got taller and slightly more muscled.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nBlake furiously punched Blaze and they fought 1 vs 1. Blaze believing himself superior, but Blake was dealing serious damage to him and somehow Blake showed to have more physical strenght, as he hurled Blaze against the ground and thrashed him as he was a toy. Blaze jumped high and looked down. Blake vanished and appeared right above him, delivering a powerful punch that sent him down against the ground, causing a crater. Blaze looked up and looked something he had never seen before. Blake was falling down but he only aimed his right hand down, directly at him. And a completely black (Blaze's blasts were dark purple) ball appeared, glowing, and then he slowed down his fall by shooting an enormous dark blast. And that blast hit directly Blaze. The explosion was so powerful that even it formed a tornado for some seconds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyan K. then, after noticing Blake's dark traits, and knowing that for some reason Blaze wanted him to be in that state, said to him <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Blake! Don't let darkness consume you!!\"- But Blake stood in front of Blaze, the grass around him burnt to ashes and wind swirled around him, lifting up rocks and dust<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You must overcome the rage!! Don't let Blaze get what he wants\"- Ryan H. said, but Blake lifted up Blaze and after squeezing his neck, he shot him away with another dark beam.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Since when Blake can throw energy attacks?\"- Joana muttered while looking from inside the department. The scene was just terrible and Blake had gotten more into the darkness<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze then got up and dashed toward Blake, Blake hit him just to discover that it was a clone, as it vanished quickly, then, Blake heard something behind him, Blaze shot him with a dark energy beam and then he kept shooting at him a lot of blasts. Blake however, stood with no apparent damage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake walked toward Blaze again, and Joana ran out from the department and stood in front of him<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Blake. I'm not defending Blaze, but, stop, please. You aren't evil, you're not like this\"- She stared at him, but couldn't tell if he was staring at her because his pupils and iris weren't visible. She decided to kiss him, remembering that in one of his fights against Blaze (early ones, Karina wasn't there so she didn't mention it) Blake had gone dark and she reverted him back when she kissed him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake's eyes reverted back to normal and his hair fell down, but after the kiss, he dismayed. Joana was worried but before doing anything, Blaze knocked her out with a weak punch. He stood before Blake, he seemed to have won, Ryans paralyzed, Blake and Joana unconscious, everyone else tired and hurt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze aimed at Blake and Joana and charged up two dark energy balls which would blast powerful beams. But suddenly, a golden light, shaped as a man with wings appeared before Blaze and said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You won't kill them\"- He extended his hand forward at Blaze and Blaze felt like burning from the inside, he fell down weakened and after glaring at him, he shot a beam at everyone, which the light tried to prevent, though it only could save Joana and Tabitha. Ryan K, Ryan H, Blake, Rocky, Max and D' were hit...</span></div></div>",

You are nothing but a joke!\"- Ryan h. said while releasing the twilight armor as ryan k. did the same<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Can you hear that?

Ryan is too fast for blaze to get a block or an attack on him and Ryan had on his burning touch gloves which are light powered. Ryan's rage gives him more power and he formed the white fire crystal arm blades to add more damage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You see Blaze my crystal arm blades can't be broken since they makes a single sound when they are hit.\"- Ryan said while smiling<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Ryan blocks, the arm blades makes a sound and ryan k. made his relic armor appear. Blake is looking at the Ryans as they are still fighting and Ryan h. is still smiling because his flames are hiding his gauntlet bracelets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Well Blaze now you face my darkness and my fusion power, but now you can fight with my angel power.\"- Ryan h. said while releasing the flames and the gloves<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA bright light shined like the sun to blind blaze as the angel armor made itself known and the twin keyblades came with the armor. Ryan k.'s relic armor went to the highest level and Ryan h. went to the third mode, but they used the shining relic angel triple strike.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Fine, you win this round.\"- Blaze said as he vanished like usual<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Clone take down the barrier now.\"- Ryan k. said through the communicator<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Joana is waking up.\"- Blake watching her moving<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"That's good..\"- Ryan h. said as he drops to the ground from the big power drain<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Keeping the illusion going didn't help with the power drain so soon the three of us will be back to our shruken state.\"- Ryan k. said as he went to get Ryan h.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Don't worry Blake, I will protect you like last time.\"- Joana said to him with a smile as she grabbed him and went to get the Ryans<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyan h. fell asleep after he hit the ground and Joana went to inside for them to rest, but the three started to shrink as they went to the department. When they got inside, all of them looked the shrunken trio and they talked about being small till Ryan h. got up from his sleep which would be in a few hours.

Ryan h. started to stand up when he was looking around before walking over to Blake and he punched him in the face. They are shocked except for Ryan K. because he has seen it before and Ryan H. said <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"That was for letting Joana getting smacked by Blaze.\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Stop it!\"- Joana looking at Ryan H.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"No, let him do it.\"- Ryan K. said to her<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"This is for letting your rage control you.\"- Ryan H. said while giving Blake another punch to the stomach<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"'What are you doing to master?\"- rocky asked him<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"It was after the distraction war that I went with a pair to their world for teaching some lessons and I know the person behind the mask and her friend that work at a company. Something happened so it got out of control with her and I got very ticked off with her so I took them to a special world we go to vent our stress and I told her attack me, but soon enough ryan showed them their history.\"- he said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Isn't that pair the same pair who you went back in time to prevent a mistake?\"- Ray asked him<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Yes they were.\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Blake, you have seen our fusion forms so now its your turn to master both light and dark powers, but do nothing won't get you any stronger.\"- he said to him as he helped him up<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Now there is people to learn lessons from you and I can help out with that, but the training can wait after we recover from this little problem.\"- he said just before they laughed at his joke<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey went to get something to eat while Ryans and Blake were sitting down and Ryan h. used magic to pull his guitar. When they are filled with food, Ryan decided to play Happy Together by the Turtles and they all just sing along with him as he played the music.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"There is something else that we need to talk about.\"- Ryan h. said as he was putting his guitar<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What?\"- rocky asked him<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I felt something just after Blake fought with Blaze in his dream and the power level was stronger than blaze.\"- ryan h. answered him<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Yeah, after my fight with blaze, everywhere there was destruction except for a flower which kept growing till was human size well close to my size and a woman came out of the flower. I kept my guard up because I didn't trust her and she spoke to me about being a goddess of the universe, mother to all orphans who don't have one, she has something to do with my ancestors, Blaze, and her name is Lith not lilith. She also said that Gaia or Isis are some of the 'nicknames' people gave her\"- he explained<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Plus she can read minds.\"- he added<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You seemed to be leaving something out Blake like Lith's brother, Omega 17 being sealed away and Blaze was once on the side of light until that power hungry got him which is not surprising because we have seen it in other monsters that we killed.\"- Ryan H. said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"How did you know about that part?\"- Blake asked him surprised<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"That is my own little secret.\"- he answered while smiling<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"And she will be back to tell you what is Blaze planning to do with you once the darkness won the battle.\"- he said still smiling<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Well, she also said Blaze was the third most powerful in Universe... and something about me and a spell...And spoke about me being descendant from an Atlantis Warrior who was given the powers or light and darkness, also said that the legendary king Quetzalcoatl was my ancestor...and that the power takes centuries or even millenniums to reappear, it doesn't appear twice consecutively\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"D' has a crush on Venus (D' would blush if he could) which is normal because you had a crush on Kagome.\"- Ryan K. said to Ryan H.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"That was a long time ago.\"- he said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"How long was it?\"- Joana asked him<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"It was when I was in early teenage years and I was watching tv while staying up late to fall asleep in middle school, but it soon became a lust till a dream about her and I in a classroom came to my mind triggered by something and that was when I decided to write the book about the whole thing except ryan k. got kagome while I was waiting for the right one till chiharu came with ryan to get me for the reunion torunament.\"- he said with a sad look<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You had a crush on me that young?\"- Kagome asked him<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"There more when I go to sleep, my head would think of strange fake dreams like me being a baby inside a Kagome doll with a cotton stuffer that is used for making stuffed animals or worse that I will not speak of.\"- he said before he used the shadow warp jump<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Where did he go?\"- Kari asked her father<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Usually he would go to the roof to look at the stars, his realm, or going flying.\"- ryan k. said to her<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Why did he leave?\"- Blake asked Ryan K.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Well being married to the girl he loved while had a crush on the girl that he saw first is like losing your mother and getting a new one which would be hard on you because you still love your first mother so try to tell what he just did and feel better.\"- he said to him<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I will go look for him.\"- Kagome said getting up to leave<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I'm going as well.\"- Chiharu said as she was going too<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Chiharu stop, let her do this he needs her for now.\"- he said to her<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Keeping that long of a secret was not good for him so when he told it he felt like my brother after he did what he was told by mom and dad.\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyan h. was in his car thinking about just happened and he started to cry when kagome found him. He let her in the car so they can talk and she was making him feeling better, but she gave him a hug so he just let it out right there. The others were wating for them to came back and ryan is smiling about something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I see that your feeling better now.\"- Ryan k. said to the other ryan<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Now I thought about Blaze and Blake.\"- Ryan h.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What?\"- Blake asked him<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"When Blaze comes to fight, you get rather easily into dark state, Maybe he manipulates your soul in a similar way we manipulated the scientist, but I can't be sure.\"- Ryan h. answered<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Besides, Blake is ready for full training with his powers for the next training session and we can have his training after he teach the lessons.\"- he added<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Huh?\"- Blake said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You are fighting at your weakest state. Your body seems to be able to handle great amounts of power without getting drained. Mastering your power you could be roughly three times stronger.\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Blake, I...I am sorry for stopping you from defeating Blaze, maybe you could have, but I was afraid, I was afraid of you getting consumed by darkness...I was afraid of losing you\"- Joana said to him<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"No. I' m glad that you stopped me because I will be training hard to master my powers with their help. And Blaze wants me to be dark, I guess I wasn't defeating him, he was just playing along, as he did the previous time, paralyzing me, and he'd have taken me with him if they hadn't appeared\"- Blake said to her while looking at the Ryans who smiled<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Now we going should be going to bed and getting some because there is a bully to scare, but I think the kids can handle him and I will used the magic illusion one of the fathers if things get out of hand.\"- ryan said before they split up for the night<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Ray, can I have a word with you for a minute?\"- Kari asked him<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Sure.\"- ray said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Do you think that we can we can take this Ivan guy like your father said?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Well our fathers have trained us since we were little when they used their powers to help us not freak out when our powers made themselves known besides your demon power has been there to save us and they have taught us not to be overconfident in a fight.\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"But what about you and the darkness inside you?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"When that power comes, I will make a deal with it to save you, but that will be the last resort.\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Hey, you two coming or what?\"- Ryan k. said to the kids<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"We are coming father.\"- Kari said to her dad<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Hey Chiharu.\"- Ryan h. said her<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What is my little man?\"- she said while smiling<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"That was bad, but I'm sorry for- he was about to say when she stopped him with a finger on his mouth to silence him<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I know.\"- she said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Lets go to bed.\"- she added</span></div></div>",

He suddenly felt the ground shaking, and the place, which resembled a garden, burnt to ashes again. The blue sky turned to red bloody, the white clouds became black and began to flash thunderbolts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rocks and dust were lifted up by the winds, which was swirling violently and roaring. Blake felt a tremendous power, but it wasn't Blaze's. He turned around and saw a silhouette on top of a big boulder. The silhouette disappeared and suddenly appeared in front of him. Blake couldn't believe what he saw...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">Background Music: System of a Down - B.Y.O.B</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake looked at a replica of him, or at least it seemed to be. The \"false\" Blake had his hair rising up, his eyes had no irises nor pupils, his muscles were bigger and tighter, his veins became noticeable, even his nails grew and it seemed his canines became longer. The guy was even taller than him. They stared at each other and the dark one growled, attacking Blake, who, instinctively, fought back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake said to him <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"So, you are my dark side...finally I meet you...\"- The dark Blake just replied with a grunt and  they punched each other. As obvious, they had the same fighting style, though Dark's was more violent and aggressive, but also lowering his guard. Blake for the first time saw how he looked like when he went dark. Blake found the low defense weakness in his opponent, but it wasn't too useful, there were little chances to attack since Blake had to block all of his hits. Blake confirmed that the dark was stronger than himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey struggled and connected fists, but Dark was getting the upper hand, overwhelming Blake in every aspect, speed, strength, resistance, agility. Only that he had a low defense. Blake was keeping up until Dark charged up a dark energy ball and shot at him a powerful beam, the impact was so powerful that it went through the mountain and Blake with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake got up and tried to stand, but in that moment Blaze appeared again<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Did you think you were safe?\"- Saying that, shot a beam right into Blake's face, lifted him up and began to punch him. Blaze hurled him against the rocks, smashing him against the remains of the boulder, then, he threw him down and pinned him down with his left arm, charging a beam with the right hand. But a beam hit him, destroying his arm. Dark stood there, aiming his hand at Blaze. They engaged into a very violent combat, destroying more of the place they were. Dark hit Blaze with powerful blows and the wounds burnt with a black fire (as opposed to the golden one that appeared before). Also, Dark hit Blaze with a beam that went through his chest, and Blaze retreated. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake still struggled to stand up, knowing he had still a fight. Dark walked toward him, and aimed his hand at him. Blake closed his eyes. Nothing happened, instead, he felt his body fixing, and opened his eyes. Dark shot at him a different beam, a light grayish one, he did so until Blake was healed. Then, he stared at him and walked away, vanishing into the shadows...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The place suddenly changed. Blake seemed to be in a street, a familiar one, though he couldn't remember, and looked up, the sky was now...golden? There was no sun, but the whole sky was glowing in golden and also, there were very few clouds. The wind was soft and felt warm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Why did he...help me?!\"- Blake muttered, talking to himself, when a voice answered<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Because he needs you. If you die, he'll die as well. That's why he protected you from Blaze\"- Blake couldn't believe what he heard and turned around to see a man, who had darker skin, a scar on his left cheek and an identical scar to Blake's in his eyelid (though Blake was in right and this man was in left). The man had medium log black hair and deep black eyes. His eyes had a sharper form than Blake's and gave him a colder look. This man was dressed with the same leather jacket Blake wears, but has a golden glow around him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"...Father?...\"- Blake stepped back<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"It's been a long time, hasn't it?\"- James said. Blake was speechless for a moment, then he said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Wha-what are you doing here? am I dead?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Of course you aren't. The world would be screwed if you were\"- James said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"The world?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You should know. Lith talked with you...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Forget that. Where...how...why...?\"- Blake asked, and James laughed<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You know...I'm officially dead, to your world...but in the other, it's another story...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"But...how?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Because I brought him back\"- A female voice said. Then Lith appeared, Blake stared at her and his father and said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You REALLY need to stop doing that...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Like father, like son...\"- Lith said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Whatever...then...you resurrected my father all of sudden or what?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I brought him back here right after he died, and said his last words to you\"- Lith said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Why didn't you tell me? I knew you were dead but I always had the hope for you to hear me from somewhere. I've asked you for help!!\"- Blake had different feelings mixed. James knew it, he knew perfectly Blake was a tough boy, but that was after suffering a lot. James walked toward him and hugged him, saying<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I've never left you alone my son\"- Blake felt strange, he had never felt like that.He felt a deep sadness, rare in a guy who learned to get over so many things. Blake didn't even recall the last time he'd felt like that, except for the moment Robin died.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"B-But...why you...never told me...at least a signal of you being somewhere?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I've watched you from above Blake. But I had to let you grow by yourself. You need to be strong\"- Blake pushed him away and felt now a different emotion, a mixture of sadness and rage, and said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"HOW STRONG DO I HAVE TO BE?! Hasn't my whole life enough?!! I lost you, the only person who ever cared about me. I lost Robin...Grandma Irma died...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I know...but she at least was happy to meet you. Mom could never raise me, but raised you instead\"- James said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"That doesn't matter anymore. I'm alone...I'm in the point I can't lose anything else, so, what now?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Blake. You're not alone\"- Lith said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I've been for my whole life, and having you up there doesn't help very much. What have you done for me?!\"- <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Remember your childhood? Whenever people gave you food, whenever you found money. That was me, taking care of you\"- Lith said, and hugged Blake<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"And I've protected you, almost always...\"- James said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Almost? When?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I prevented you from dying. Lith gave me the ability to see the future and I saw most of your childhood and teen age. I was happy to know I had changed the future. And when you got beaten up, I prevented people from killing you, and most of times I healed your wounds\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You said almost, which means you haven't helped me always...\"- Blake said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Well...\"- James scratched the back of his head -\"I admit, I haven't protected you always because...other people has done that\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"And that's the point. Blake, even without us, you're not alone. That girl, Joana, your girlfriend, truly loves you. You have friends, who worry about you, and so do your pets...And if you say you can't lose anything else think better about it...\"- Lith said<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake bowed down and James looked at him, he said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Don't be like that. What I meant is that since you met Joana she's protected you...and she has a really awesome strength\"- James added<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"And, after your shrunk odyssey, the second time you fought Blaze, I was the one giving you the energy. I was giving you my energy for you to fight at his level. That warm light was me. And the first times you faced him I prevented him from taking you away\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Yeah...A new friend called Ryan said that. I'm not sure how did he know it but he said you prevented Blaze from killing me last time, though...it's strange...Blaze wanted me alive...\"- Blake said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"He was bluffing about killing you...He was going to do the same he did last time before this one, take you with him...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What for?\"- Blake said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I'll have to explain that later. You need to rest. Remember Blake, the world needs you...everyone need you...specially Joana...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Why?\"- Blake asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Remember...never forget who you are*, and remember what do you fight for...\"- James said as vanished, and so did Lith, after saying<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"We'll talk later. Now rest baby\"- Lith said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\" 'What do you fight for?' What's that supposed to mean?\"- Blake mumbled, and then, he felt again that blacking out feeling and, while sleeping, muttered 'Never forget who you are'. Blake woke up, and looked around, everything was dark, he looked at his digital alarm clock. 1:24 AM, and he had began to sleep at 1:10 AM. He recalled that all what happened lasted about two hours...maybe the old saying was right, that \"a dream is enough to dream a whole life\" which meant that in dreams can happen a lot of things more in little time in the real world. Blake sighed, and heard Joana's voice (He was sleeping between her breasts, as he always did when he was shrunk years ago)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What's wrong?\"- She said, sleepy<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Nothing...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You were talking...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"It's a long story, I'll tell you tomorrow, anyway, we have no class tomorrow.\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Okay baby\"- Joana said and went silent, sleeping again. Blake snuggled in between her breasts and felt their softness, then, heard Joana's heartbeats, falling asleep...</span></div></div>",

Those transformations take out a lot of him' She thought, and got up very delicately (to not wake him up) and carried him where he was sleeping. She went to check the pets but they reacted strange at her, almost hostile. She was confused by that but thought that it was because of the shrinking, though Tabitha didn't act very friendly either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoana began to cook breakfast (Blake still in her bra) and she heard Tabitha's voice<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"So...already wondering how does Master taste?\"- <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Huh?\"- Joana turned around and looked at her confused (she didn't hear it completely)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I'll be watching you, human girl. If you do something weird, you'll regret\"- Tabitha left, and Joana had the biggest O.O? face. She cooked the break fast and left hers on the table. She also left a full dish on Tabitha's nightstand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoana sat in the couch holding the dish and turned on TV, at a low sound volume. Meanwhile, in Tabitha's room...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Tabitha, I think that that was too direct\"- D'Artagnan said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"No more games. If she plans to kill Master she'll get in real trouble\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMax sighed and said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Too bad you're the only one who can fight her...at this size she could easily stomp on us like ants...I hate ants...\"- <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Bugs are annoying\"- Rocky said, remembering his days as an abandoned puppy, and an unbearable itch<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Bugs taste good\"- D'Artagnan said and all of them stared at him with the O_O face, then, he cleared his throat and added<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Do I need to remind you that I'm a turtle.

That something aimed its hand at him and burned him, and a voice said that light burnt darkness into ashes...so...I guess that by the amount od darkness in me, light consumed it as fire consumed carbon...\"- Blake said, and then added<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Well...In my dream... I encountered with a dark presence, different to Blaze. When he got closer to me, I noticed that he resembled me, but looked far different...He had no irises nor pupils, his hair was risen up and waving upward. He looked more like a beast than a human, and even his canine teeth were longer. I felt that I knew him until I realized that he was me...\"- Joana hugged him tightly in that moment. Tabitha looked at her with a suspicious look. Blake continued<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"...I had never thought I'd look like that when I transformed...And...something inside me made me fight him, he began but I quickly fought back. The fight was worse than when Blaze, that guy or thing or whatever was far stronger than Blaze, at least than his ordinary form, I guess he's near a half as strong as Blaze's full power. The fight was overwhelming, He knew each move I did, blocked them and countered them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlso, he hurled me against the ground and shot me with a beam...I didn't know I could shoot beams when I was like that...well, whatever... I fought him, it was no use. He was too strong, but suddenly, Blaze appeared claiming revenge, and shot me, and hit me a lot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI had no longer strength to fight him nor the dark guy. But when Blaze pinned me down and seemed to charge a beam, the dark destroyed Blaze's arm and engaged him into a worse fight. It must've been like when I fought him myself in dark form, I guess...However, that guy made Blaze to retreat...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoana gasped and Blake said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"After that...he stared at me, blankly, and I couldn't tell how was his look because his eyes looked too fierce, and he aimed his hand at me. I thought the worst. But he healed me instead, and vanished. I talked to myself, wondering why did that thing help me, and a voice told me that because he needed me to live. It was my father...\"- Joana knew that voice tone in Blake. Always forced to show himself as a tough one, Blake was still a bit sensitive when Alexander brought his father's memories whenever they fought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I had an argument with him...I thought he was gone and he abandoned me, leaving me by my own. He said it was necessary, and Lith said something about me not being alone...My father also mentioned that he protected me when I wasn't aware, or when I got knocked out, until...I met you...\"- Blake said looking to Joana<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Me? Your father knows me?\"- Joana remembered a vague dream where a male voice said 'Take good care of my child' But she couldn't tell whom was it, and what child he meant. Now it made sense<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"They also spoke about my friends, Ayrton, Karina, Claire, the rest of the gang, and my pets...\"- Tabitha smiled when hearing that<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"He said too that Blaze was bluffing, that he wanted me alive, but they left before I could know why... The rest I can tell is that they seem to trust on you\"- He said to Ryans -\"And that Blaze called me Angel of Darkness in my previous dream, he called me the Key too. I don't know what does that mean or why...\"-</span></div></div>",

When we get into a world, if we go alone like when we went into the Yugioh series I stayed with a girl with a special gift while Ryan went to the first season to have a duel with the gang. Her name was Akiza and I knew how she felt so she took me to a building where other psychic duelists were there for starting a war, but the person in charge, sayer wanted to test me so I dueled him with my twilight deck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was another girl that I pulled close to my heart and the most trouble is trying to take over the world, but I went to hell to get a friend for a friend and I gathered some hellfire while I was there. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The one the that will get me ticked off the most is watching kids getting hurt, killed, or people using them for selfish reasons. Before blaze shrunk us, Ryan and I have arsenal suits to kill the blaze clones while saving our powers for the real blaze. I know why Blaze called Blake the key, but will be brought up later so we dealt with aliens three times. Ryan over there went on a mission with some friends to another planet and the aliens there were cruel to tucker and Jessica, but Ryan got them off the planet while giving the king there a threat and we are dead serious when we are ticked off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow when I got up from my sleep to hit Blake, that was to make sure that doesn't happen again since hitting a girl or a woman is not a very smart idea when we are around especially me. Some of the pairs that we met were young, close to adult, and adults themselves. Ryan its your turn now so don't get carried away with the details.\" Ryan h. said with a smile<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like he said, we met girls that become our friends and some become our girlfriends even though that Chiharu and Kagome know that would happen. I was was a on trip to help a guy who has now six girlfriends and they know each other from the start. I wondered if he helped them recovered their memories yet and another guy with four maids with magic powers, but I knew him from my young childhood before my parents caused that event and he must be dating all four of them well not all at once. Speaking of memories Ryan, did your friend recovered her memories as well.\" Ryan k. said to Ryan h.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"She did thanks to kyle and she is working at the lodge.\"- he said to him<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You forget that you went in his place after besides it was you that helped her.\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Who are you two talking about?\"- d' asked them<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Anthro versions of female Pok\u00e9mon especially a giratina.\" Ryan h. said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Now for the answer for Blake's question the key, because a key is needed when a lock is guarding something and knowing blaze it can't be good.\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Besides that, I will bet that Lith's brother is behind the lock and we can't waste time dealing with pointless stuff.\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Well...it could be either Omega OR breaking whatever that made Blaze a semigod.

Humans don't feed on others' blood. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd Joana would never hurt Blake, she really loves him, and has put her own life in danger to protect him, I know you've done so several times too, but this stupid stuff has to end because they need you to be battle ready when the fights are coming and I can't keep the magic illusion going unless I have clones to do it for me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But how did you know that?\" Tabitha asked him<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There are some things that I don't miss and Ryan k. has a fox for an animal spirit so I will not tell them that you said that Rocky.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can understand that you want to protect Blake because he took care of you, but that is no reason to be cruel to Joana and Tabitha please try to work with Joana and Claire while Blake is giving his lessons.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Trust me, I know the saying 'hell hath no fury like a woman's scorn' and that is true till I get ticked off.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now that is over with, we should get going so we can beat the others to the campsite.\"</span></div></div>",

Well after we gathered the kids, the party was under way till the demoness mother and the dark lord came so ryan and I maxed out on our dark powers where we had lightning coming out of our bodies. I had a clone fight the demoness mother while I was giving energy to the clone and he sent her away for awhile. When she came back, another fight took place till chiharu got mad at me so she sent me flying to fight and they were shocked. I took control again, but this time I used my darkness with my saving light keyblade.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lets get some lunch because we need to train as well.\" ryan k. said while bringing ryan h. over to chiharu<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ray and kari, you get the fire started while I get the stuff ready and ryan can make the cooking pot appear over the fire.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The fire is done.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was quick so ray did you used that flame you absorbed while ryan was fighting blaze?\" ryan k. asked him smiling<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One cooking pot coming up.\" ryan h. said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Put in the last few flasks of the juice from that case, a few plain apples, spiced peaches, sweet onions, three pounds of meat which I have with me, let it cook till meat is ready while stirring the stew, then add one sweet fire rose to finish it off.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey twins, is the veggies in the trunk any good?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well most of them are.\" senna called back<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Put the good ones in the stew while samu is bringing me the spoiled ones.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Senna, are my fruits still good?\" ryan h. asked her<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"all, but a few are good for making your drinks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bring me my fruit because I will make the drinks now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you don't have the stuff to make the drinks ryan.\" ayrton said to him<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thats why I have a few tricks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Snap clones on the double!\" he said as he was making two clones<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You two get ready.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One bar coming out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There we are; just set it afew feet away from the trunk and away from the campfire.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ryan, you are going to use the time power to fix the veggies.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah so kiddies watch the power of time at work.\" ryan k. said while smiling<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Turn back the hand of time to give life back to the vegetables.\" he said as he pulled out the blade of timewinds<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Time reversal!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There back to normal for the stew.\" he after the veggies are good as new and the others are surprised<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm the protector of time because the sword of timewinds has the hero sealed inside it, but a friend of mine was able to break the seal which gave me a headache and I'm only the one who can use the power.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Show off.\" ryan h said to him<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here they go again.\" kagome said while chiharu was agreeing with her<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" karina asked them<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Our husbands can be quite competitive so ryan will try to top him.\" chiharu said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have seen my beast state so its time for me to wear a different fur.\" ryan said while the clones vanished<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lightning wave armor surge!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lightning wave armor?\" lavera asked confused<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good the fruits are setup nicely and they need to be refreshed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Refresh!\" he yelled as he was focusing on the fruits<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have been training with some friends to get this and other wave armors so to answer any lingering questions I will ask you this who's that pok\u00e9mon?\" he said just before throwing a smoke bomb on the ground<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the smoke cleared, ryan is not there anymore instead is a giant mouse that looks like him and they are shocked to answer him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Its nice to know that I can still surprise people so any guesses.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A giant rat.\" max said with tabitha nodding in agreedment<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wrong.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ray, would you like to tell them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pikachu from pok\u00e9mon.\"  ray said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now that is better and I should get started working on the drinks.\" ryan h. said after turning back to normal<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring lunch, they were talking about the food and lavera was thinking about ryan when they first met because she was running while he was watching from a room.

Those two are showing their energy is getting low and they need one hit to finish it, but ryan is still smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"So this is the final round.\"- joker said with a smile<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Its for you, joker.\"- batman said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Lets finish this with a bang.\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"And the winner is the batman.\"- ryan k. said with a smile as he and lavera went to get the tired duo for dinner<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"That was fun.\"- ryan h. said he was returned back to normal as chiharu did the same<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe clear night sky was showing stars and they were gazing at them till the ryan started to walk to their cars.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What are you doing?\"- tabitha asked the ryans<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Well we saw how joana danced at the party and we are going to show how we dance.\"- ryan h. said as he turned on the radio to their favorite music<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"We are going to dance old school.\"- ryan k. said as the music for the song Boogie Wonderland started to play<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ryans used some magic to have a lightup dance floor as their clothes changed as well to fit the music.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Ryan you go first.\"- ryan k. said just before the song started<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Just don't lose to me like you did last time.\"- he said with a smile<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen ryan h. started to dance, blake and the rest of his group is shocked to see him dance and soon another dance-off was started. Both ryan used their best moves till ryan k. beat him to make it even between them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"That makes it even between us so now lets take it slow.\" ryan k. said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Lets see, blake with joana while ayrton with karina, max with tabitha, ray and kari, but d' and rocky don't have partners.\"- he said as they got into their small groups<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake's face turned red and, laughing nervously, and scratching the back of his head, said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Ermmm....Myabe I'm a fighter...but I...I can't dance...\"- Suddenly, he felt a great force drag him and looked behind, it was Joana, who said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Of course you can, mister!!\"- Blake thought 'Dammit...'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I guess we're gonna use the magic illusion.\"- ryan h. said with a smile on his face<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"One venus and one roxy coming up.\"- he added<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Hey what about us?\"- the guys said since they were out of the fun<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Just think about your dream girl oh, speaking of that.\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA Cinthya clone appeared suddenly and all of Blake's friends (because Ryans and others didn't know) were with the O_O face and Claire asked, slightly angry<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What does she here?\"- Then, remembering the dream girl illusion, stared at Ferdinand, who gulped but put an angry face and said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"So what?! Everyone can dream!!\"- And grabbed \"Cinthya\" by the waist.  Then, Ryan said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Snap clone.\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Lavera, may I have this dance?\"- the clone asked her<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Yes, you may.\"- she answered<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Just try to enjoy the night.\"- ryan k. said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Love is in the air besides it seems that they are having a fun time.\"- ryan k. said to kagome as they were dancing<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What is that special cell made of?\"- ryan asked his lover.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"That is a surprise.\"- chiharu answered</span></div></div>",

You know, even when I fought, I got badly hurt when people used knives or were too much...\"- Blake replied<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"But, the Ryans taught their wives to fight so they could help them. If you had a numerical disadvantage I'd help\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I know... I was kinda considering it in mid 7th grade, but the fight against Ivan changed my mind. If I barely got out alive from there, I thought that Ivan could hurt you even more seriously, and as I said, if I get hurt, it's nothing, but...if you get hurt...\"- Blake sighed and remained silent<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoana sensed something in Blake's voice, and said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I know you've suffered a lot honey\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Huh?\"- Blake was interrupted from his thoughts<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Don't act tough. I know you've always hidden your grief\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What?!\"- Blake was now surprised<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I kind of, feel it. I sense something in your voice... when someone speaks about me or your father, your voice has a...a strange tone...I guess nobody else distinguishes it...but to me, it sounds like a silenced grief... like a silenced cry, silenced by a boy who never allowed himself to cry...\"- Joana hugged him tightly, and said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Don't worry...It's ok...\"- But she heard nothing, she looked in his eyes and noticed the sad feeling, and Blake said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Still...I've never felt like crying...I just...I just feel a grief in my heart...but crying it's not my style\"- Joana tightened her hug and said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"It's okay\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"But how did...how do you...?\"- Joana put her index finger on his lips and said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I'm not sure if you can understand, but I only feel that in you. I can only feel hidden emotions in your voice...It doesn't work on anyone else...because I love you...\"- Joana kissed him and added<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I guess it would be like you when sensed that I was in danger...you never told me how you do that...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"It's simply watching...\"- Blake said, and Joana smiled<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You still can't lie silly. I know you had feelings for me too, is it too hard to say it?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Well...I didn't even know about my own feelings...I was confused, and still I'm...though about other things\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"AND YOU confuse me more...In fact, you're confusing me now...\"- Blake replied in a playful way, as they went walking to their department, Joana carrying him in her hands.

That place resembled a greek temple, made out of a transparent blue marble-like material, with gold inlays, and the floor seemed to be made out of crystal...though all of it looked ancient, kind of worn away, eroded...it looked...older...from a further past than Ancient Greece's...Somehow Blake felt that it was familiar. Then, a little light ball appeared, flying, it past Blake and remained floating in front of him. The light ball shone and a blinding light flashed. Blake opened slowly his eyes to see his father standing before him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Wha...What is this place?\"- He asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Do you know?\"- James replied<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"No...but...it feels...so familiar...I know I've never been here...but...I feel I know it...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"This is where your ancestor was born...\"- Lith said, appearing from thin air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"This? So...is this some place of Atlantis?\"- Lith denied with her head<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"That was your earliest human ancestor, but he wasn't always a human\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake got a confused face, and Lith explanied<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"He used to be a powerful angel. His name was Azrael. He was one of the very few highest ranked angels\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You mean an archangel, don't you?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"That's right\"- Lith replied and added<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"When the war began, Azrael lead angels in battle, but after what happened...after the curse...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What war? What curse?\"- Blake asked, surprised<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I'll bring that up in the appropiate moment...But what I'll tell you is that he was the other one who the light and darkness powers...well...he became the only one after what happened long ago...But anyway, he fought the Fallen One and Omega 17\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Who's the Fallen One?\"- Blake asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You know him...they call him 'Blaze'...he's got many names through time...In Atlantis he was called Sariel...In Greece Thanatos...In America your ancestors knew him as Tezcatlipoca...And for a long time he kept a low profile, but after America's conquest he took the name of Blaze...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"So...Blaze is an ancient demon isn't he?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Not exactly, but I'll explain that later...\"- Lith said -\"As I was saying...Azrael performed a curse, similar to Blaze's...a more perfect version...still different...not evil...Azrael turned his body into a human one, retaining his full power...and prophecies were told...No matter how hard he tried, he was near to destroy Blaze, but just near...the Prophecy said that a further descendant of him would be th one. Azrael lived as a brave and proud Atlantis warrior, defending that land until the day of his death...In difference to Blaze, he aged, though slower than average, he lived 1150 years...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"And I thought nobody could surpass 80 or 90...\"- Blake said -\"So... I'm descendant of an angel...and, why do you think I'm the right one to beat Blaze? And why isn't he revived as an angel like you did with my father?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Because a part of what he did was that he'd reincarnate, his soul and his powers would be kept by his bloodline... And none of your previous ancestors have had the power level you've reached, well, maybe some, but even the ones who reached higher powers were just single sided, either light or darkness, never both. You're the only one who has used both, and even some didn't have any power... Your father for example...\"- James scratched the back of his head<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Well...I never surpassed human limits... I was like you before fighting Blaze for the first time...\"- He said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You used light powers not much ago, and that proves that you're the one who will defeat Blaze. You use your dark powers too, though they're untrained...but those good people will help you to do that\"- Lith said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I see...and so...you say that my bloodline was kept in America and that it descends from an Atlant warrior, who used to be an angel...well...If you've explained that much why can't you tell me more about Blaze or that war you spoke about?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"There are more things for you to understand, but they'll be told at their right time. Now you have to concentrate in training. You have to develop your powers. I'm sure you will\"- She said as she vanished<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You can do it Blake. I know you can...\"- James said and left, transforming into the light ball and flying away<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake woke up, this time in a more peaceful way (or maybe he was getting used to the sudden return of his spirit to his body)</span></div></div>",

Blake tried to get up, forgetting for a moment where he was, and heard Joana giggle, he realized that his movement had tickled her. She put the plate on the table and took Blake out<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Good morning sleepyhead\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I didn't sleep that much this time...\"- Blake replied. Joana petted him in the head with her index finger, and Blake said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Is it my idea or I'm the only one who is concerned about my shrinking problem?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You look cute. And I got used to it since first time\"- Blake shook slightly, finding that phrase a bit scary<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Errmm...you know this is not forever do you?\"- Joana hugged him tightly (almost crushing him with her breast) and said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I know. But I don't mind having a 'pocket boyfriend' \"- She said playfully, then she realized Blake didn't respond and released him, he took a heavy breath and said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"...So...I-I...I'm portable n-now...how cool...\" He said sarcastically, and Joana petted him again, saying<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Aww c'mon!! You don't mind do you? And ironically you never travel in my pockets...I carry you in a better place\"- Both blushed at that comment<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I wouldn't mind as long as the pockets aren't your back ones...\"- Joana looked at him with the \u00d2.\u00d3 face<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Besides I wouldn't have much space in there...I wouldn't like to be crushed...again...\"- Joana was still \u00d2.\u00d3<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Are you saying my ass is big?\"- ----&gt;Why girls always get mad at this?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You shouldn't take it as a bad thing. It's a good thing...And...even if you were flat I'd die if you sat on me again\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoana remembered...she accidentally sat on Blake when he shrank first, and he nearly died...so it's understandable that it caused a trauma in his mind...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter breakfast, they went at school (More properly, Joana went at school, though she was carrying her 'portable' boyfriend in her cleavage, so he wouldn't miss the class either). When they arrived, Joana entered to their classroom and had the first class, Biology, and after a hour, the teacher said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"It's all for today, as you should know, government is investigating the strange incident that happened a few days ago, and that according to the Dr. Van Der Vliet, the energy source was near this school. So, we're shutting down to let them proceed. You have the day off.\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoana left confused and when alone, talked to her boyfriend<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Did you hear that?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Yes...a bit muffled by your b...forget...but I heard it...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What are we gonna do?\"- <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I don't know. I guess we'll have to leave and wait for Ryans and their families...\"- Joana smiled.She went to the cafeteria, maybe she'd buy a snack for her and Blake. Then she walked outside, the day was cloudy, but she noticed a golden light above them, surrounding them, it felt warm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen James appeared before them, and said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I know what you were thinking, and I'll help you\"- Then he aimed his hand at Joana, making Blake levitate and then he shone with a golden light. Then, he appeared standing in normal size, with a slight golden shine around him for a moment. Then it seemed as always...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"It's temporary. I can't break the curse on you but this will help you\"- James vanished. Joana gasped and was totally amazed. The voice she had heard years before was the same...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Umm...Blake...what were you thinking?\"- Joana asked him<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Wel...I was thinking about our last night talk. I wanted to teach you, but at my size it'd impossible...Now...well even if it's an illusion I guess I can train you for a while\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake stood before her and she said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Umm...I can't fight you...\"- Blake fell backwards anime style, and then he said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"WHAT?!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I can't attack you...\"- Blake closed his face with his hand and said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"It's an illusion body. You won't hurt me. Now, let's begin with basics\"- With that Blake taught her his stance, the way to throw a punch, a kick and made her to practice those basic moves. After an hour she learned basic stuff. Blake decided it was time to prove her skills and fought her (As being his body an ethereal one, the hits didn't damage Joana, though she still could feel them, and he'd still feel the hits too). Blake fought a weakest as he could and was surprised by Joana's strength<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Damn...Now I understand why you defeated Ivan with a single punch...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Are you OK?\"- Joana looed at him worried<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Yes. Remember, it's just an illusion, no real damage is dealt...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I told you I wasn't that weak. You went too easy on me...\"- Joana said playfully<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Is that so mistress?\"- They resumed fighting, Blake using his average level (the normal one, stronger than average people, no superpowers). Joana matched him though Blake was a bit faster. Surprisingly, it seemed Joana wasn't bad at all in brute strength (She has played basketball, volleyball and even soccer...her body is soft but firm and well toned, and her thighs are thick...and she's strong, believe me...). After three hours, Joana was tired, while Blake hadn't used really much energy at all. They laid on the grass (They were in a nearby forest, slightly away from school and the first place the fight vs Blaze happened) and watched the sky. Still cloudy, though there was a few sunlight between clouds.</span></div></div>",

Claire and Tabitha were done, and they went with Blake and Joana and he said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Okay. Now let's begin the serious training. Joana, you just learned a bit of fighting style, but you've proven to be quite strong... Tabitha...I guess that all of you have watched me fight for years so you should know in a medium grade. I noticed that you have more speed, so try to use it as an advantage...And Claire...You are the most advanced here since you're the only one I've truly taught. I'll fight you three first in 1 vs 1. Then it'll be between you and finally you three against me...\"- Blake said as he stood in his fighting stance<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Okay. Tabitha you'll go first...I will go serious as you have superhuman abilities too, so I expect you go all out this time...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"But...Master...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Don't worry. No real damage is dealt, this body is an illusion made by my father and even the hits I deal cause no damage, though it will cause pain as a normal punch. And about the training between you, Ryans and Kagome could heal you back or give one of those magic juices. So I want you to fight at full capacity\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Oh...Okay...\"- Tabitha said. Karina who was taking a break looked at her own scanner and it showed two readings: Blake - 1970. Tabitha - 1720.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fight began, and though at first Tabitha was reluctant she decided to try her best to impress him. Blake seemed to have reflexes as good as hers, she underestimated him. And in difference to everyone Tabitha not only used her strenght, she used her claws also, and that gave her an advantage. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn speed they were almost equal though Tabitha was faster, but Blake had the upper hand in strenght. They jumped high and in the air Tabitha had the advantage, throwing Blake down, though he got up quickly and continued with the hand to hand close combat, where he was winning again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter half of an hour, Tabitha was tired (even more because all felines have great strength but low resistance) while Blake was just a bit (Not using much of his powers saved a lot of energy). He said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Enough for today...We'll need to work on your resistance limits. I understand it's a natural weakness to felines but you have to get over it...\"- Then he looked at the (human) girls<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I hope you've watched and done your homework... Joana you'll be next...Then Claire...\"- Blake said as he laid on the grass<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Just after a little break...\"-</span></div></div>",

Karina checked the readings:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake - 180 (Weakest state, enough to beat almost any normal person). Joana - 220 -&gt;Yeah I'm beginning to believe that Joana is stronger than me. Don't ask!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe rose an eyebrow, surprised because she couldn't understand how could Joana be at that level (though to the actual circunstances scale, it's a low level), that meant that before the enhancing by the machine she was already stronger than herself, Blake himself and even Ivan... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake started, fighting as he'd fight a bully, though he somehow still held back because it's her. Joana hesitated but then decided to fight seriously. To Blake's surprise she was stronger than him though a bit slower <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'If I had known she this strong before I'd have trained her since 6 years ago...' He thought to himself<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTabitha felt a bit jealous because he went easy on her. But then she changed her thought when he seemed to consider Joana as a weaker one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoana had gotten a bit stronger after training with Ryan K. but she had't adopted his moves yet, she fought more with Blake's style (As with others, after watching him for three years she learned a bit) Blake himself had trouble fighting her and found that her level was above his own but if he used his full power it'd be a total ownage...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter an hour and a half, Blake stopped and said it was enough. Then he taught her the moves and the stances for another hour. Then they went to take a rest and Blake said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"This time I got a bit too tired. I need to rest. Well.

He decided to take over the whole universe, and the war began... It was a brutal war that lasted almost 20,000 years, we were forced to fight angels vs angels, until Chaos himself defeated him and sealed him away in Tartarus, a dimension he made just for that...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe came back after 30,000 years (50,000 years ago), and he created a new species to destroy us angels. He made the demons, beings of darkness that stopped at nothing but complete destruction, they attacked us again. Omega, his mightiest demon, was the one commanding his forces along other powerful demons, and the war against them went on while Chaos went to work on a secret project. After 20,000 years, he sent out a new legion of powerful angels that were able to match the demons' power, but not even they were enough against Omega. Chaos worked for 20,000 more years, and he came back with a powerful sword, made out of his own blood, infused with the purest light and darkness...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Lucifer made a sword of darkness and his own blood as well, both weapons intended to kill gods, Chaos destroyed countless demons before taking on his brother alone, he rejected our help, and they fought They stabbed each other with their weapons, and a blinding light shone for a moment, then, it faded...\"- Her voice faltered as if she wanted to cry<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I immediately went to his side, He was laying there...He said he was about to die...and that the only way to save existence was to give me his remaining powers. He then said that I had to be careful, that evil can't be destroyed, but can be kept at its minimal. He grabbed my hand and smiled at me and vanished into sparks. I knew he would never come back...\"- Lith stopped for a moment, attempting to keep herself from crying. Blake put his hand on her shoulder and stared at her. He knew how it felt, he knew how it felt to lose his father but never thought that a goddess would feel like that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Then I found the one you call Blaze and Azrael as babies, they had a little neck-chain with a golden dog-tag where their names were written. Something told me that they were the last archangels created by Chaos before dying, and I raised them as if they were my own children. They were raised while the war continued, even without Lucifer, Omega still commanded the demons, now as their king. Azrael and Blaze eventually became commanders\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Whoa......Blaze used to fight for good?\"- Blake asked surprised<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Believe it or not. Blaze used to be good. And he had different powers...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Different?\"- Joana asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You see, me and angels fight using light...Demons use darkness...but Blaze and Azrael...they had both...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Wait what?\"- Now Blake rose an eyebrow<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"They were among the most powerful angels ever known...Then, it happened, thousands of demons appeared, Omega was leading them and Blaze was standing at his side...and looked different...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You meant Blaze looked different before?\"- Ryan H. said, intrigued<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Yeah. Anyway, the one called Blaze had betrayed us, and the only one who could fight him was Azrael...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I see...but why the way you speak Blaze's not his true name...\"- Blake said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"It is not. Before, he used to have another name, which he discarded upon becoming a demon. Back to the story, Azrael defeated a large part of the demon army, and Blaze retreated to Earth, which was the only accessible place from Heaven to the physical universe, in an attempt to corrupt all the other life forms to rise against the angels. They fought in Atlantis, and Azrael sealed Omega's soul, turning his body into stone and dividing it into 6 parts, 7 counting his sword. Without Omega and the Devil's sword, Blaze was left alone to take on Azrael, but he also had his power sealed, and he has been wandering around the Earth ever since...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"So...he needs Blake to break his curse?\"- Ryan K. asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Yes. He needs Omega's pieces including his sword, and Blake in full dark form in order to break the seal\"- Lith replied<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I see...so that's why he wants Blake to become dark...he's been pushing the limits\"- Ryan K. said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Wait, what happened with Azrael?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"He used up too much of his own energy, the nearby humans used a spell to transport him to a Mayan priest, who attempted to cure him, but was unable to, and when Azrael passed away, he rescued his soul and infused it into his daughter's womb... and thus, Azrael's bloodline managed to stay alive...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey all were in silence for a while. They had just learned of a hero nobody remembered, who sacrificed his own life to give the others a chance to live. Blake was feeling strange upon learning that he was the descendant of an angel. Lith then commented that Blaze is also sadistic and likes to use psychological torture, he has observed humans for thousands for years and knows how to press their buttons, and she tells Blake that it's actually intentional from Blaze's part to bring out the darkness in him, which is what he must be careful with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"We'll need to stay alert from now on.The sole presence of Blaze triggers Blake's dark state too\"- Ryan H. said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Don't worry, I'll protect you...\"- Joana said hugging Blake, whose illusion body had begun to disappear, and Joana put him in her chest pocket. Both Claire and Tabitha glared at her, though nobody seemed to notice (well, the Ryans noticed it but decided to let them to see how far they would go)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"That's all for now...I'll come again at the appropriate time\"-</span></div></div>",

From thin air appeared Blake's body, normal sized, and a gray light went from the shrunk Blake's chest to the other normal one. Blake opened his eyes, everyone gasped and he checked himself, he asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Did you break the curse?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Not really...look at yourself\"- Lith made a mirror appear, Blake stared at himself... He had now a black leather jacket...his skin had a fairer tone than usual, almost white, he had no scars, but then he looked at a mirror that Lith made to appear and noticed his eyes...they were now green...and his whole body felt different. The mirror vanished<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I gave you a new body...\"- Lith said while he stood still, then asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Where's my body? My real body?\"- Lith blushed a bit and said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Well...it's right where you were...\"- She looked at Joana, she blushed too and took Blake's tiny body from her pocket. Blake stared at it<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"This way you'll be able to train with them. Remember. The soul is what counts...not the body...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"The soul...\"- Blake muttered, and Lith said, before leaving<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Just, keep it safe...keep your real body safe...\"- Lith said, Joana put Blake's body in her purse. Then the green haired goddess added<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Blaze's curse on Blake is different to the one on you. I still can break yours...\"- Lith aimed her hand at the rest of the guys and a golden light shone...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Well Blake, looks like you can teach the girls to fight for real.\"- Ryan H. said with a smile as the Ryans and the little pets returned to their normal size<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"My clones can stop using the illusion because it takes too much energy to maintain.\"- Ryan h. said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I will come back again to tell the rest of the story.\"- Lith said as she vanished<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Well Ryan looks like Blake needs more training.\"- Ryan k. said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Blake, you are with me for training.\"- Ryan h. said with a smile<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Yeah...I have to get used to this body...It feels different...I feel weak...I'm not myself with this...\"- Joana stared at him and hugged him, then she said, looking at his eyes<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Remember what Lith said. It doesn't matter if your body is just a copy, as long as your heart is your own, you are Blake. Never forget that...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What you said when I became 13 now makes sense\"- Blake said, remembering. Joana though he didn't remember that. It was when she gifted him his silver neck chain (Though Blake already kept James' dogtag, he'd wear it from this moment on with the chain)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Never forget who you are...no matter what...\"- Joana muttered the words she had said 6 years ago...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"It's like my father has told me...would he know about this? He could see the future...\"- Blake said and his thoughts were interrupted<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"The lessons will put on hold for now.\"- Ryan K. said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Tabitha and claire are with me for some lessons and resistance training.\"- ryan k. said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Ray and kari, make sure that joana will not forget what she has learned.\"- ryan h. said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Karina.\"- kagome called her<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What is it?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"When the ryan's energy rise, watch for the wind swirling around them.\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Blake, you have seen me using a dark clone to use my darkness so I think its time for a different method.\"- ryan h. said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Ouch.\"- Blake said after ryan pulled a hair from his head<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Now fallen angel wings.\"- ryan said as the wings appeared<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Blake, I have the power while ryan has the fusion form of the power.\"- he said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Dark demonic summon.\"- ryan h. said he used the demon wing to summon dark blake<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Now then, normal blake fight him till you win with your light powers.\"- ryan said as the angel wing started to shine</span></div></div>",

Obviously that copy body hadn't endured the fights and training that the original one had. Blake decided to train again with the girls, though he couldn't go on them as easy as he had done previously. He said to Karina<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Hey, accordig to that machine how strong is this body?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKarina looked at her binoculars-like machine and checed the readings. It made a beep sound.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"96...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"WHAT?! That's nearly 50%!!\"- Blake shouted<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I guess you'll have to train more in that body\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"No. What you have to do is master your soul. Now that you don't have your usual body to rely on the only you have left is your inner power...\"- Ryan H. said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Alright. I'll rise up my full power. Karina check your readings and tell me\"- Blake said, the ground shook slightly and wind lifted up a bit of dust around him, then several beeping sounds were heard, and Karina said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"1,770...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Damn...Still weak...\"- Blake muttered -\"OK. I'll fight you like this. Karina goes first this time\"- She giggled and after standing up, she said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Like old times, huh? I haven't fought you in a while\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Well...actually...I fought you once...the other times you attacked me and I kept blocking\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"That was long ago, we weren't friends at that time. Should we begin?\"- (Karina's power was measured as 1,700)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey dashed toward each other and an impressive clash of fists shook the ground. Karina attacked with a lot of fast and powerful kicks, but Blake already knew her fighting style and dodged them all, he countered using a upward somersault kick, (A technique taught by Robin. He called it crescent moon because of the form it resembled). Blake punched her in stomach and stood in guard. Karina regained her stance and said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Holding back? By the way I had never seen that move...\"- She attacked Blake again but he disappeared. Karina looked around and suddenly, Blake stood in front of her, and ran past her. She turned around to see what did Blake try to do, and all of sudden felt a lot of punches in her body, almost at once. Blake said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"That's god speed. And that's the kind of stuff we're facing...enough for now...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake and Karina got healed back by Kagome. Then Ryan H. came in, and said to Blake<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Before our power meeting, I still have a thing left to do...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What?\"- Blake asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"By what Lith says, you're different. We have inner dark powers but we've mastered them. The light powers are provided by the armors, which we're not totally used to yet, as it drains a lot of energy solely keeping the fusion form. Your case is far different, you have both inner powers naturally, and have the natural ability to fuse them, thus not requiring additional energy to keep it. Also, I've seen that as long as your transformation keeps, your energy flow is regular. Only if the transformation deactivates you get drained...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo. You are going to transform into your dual form for the first time, and will learn to master it. It's the key to destroy Blaze\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Uh...okay...\"- Blake said as suddenly everything disappeared. Then Blake found himself at a snowy place, there was a snowstorm and it seemed there was nobody else. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Ryan? Guys? What happened?\"- He asked but nobody answered back<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'What's going on here?' He thought. Then he heard a known voice...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Hi Blake\"- As Blaze appeared out of nothing, holding someone by the head. He walked toward Blaze and noticed that he was holding Joana...Joana?!...And she was completely cold, pale...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"N-No...I...It-It...can't...be......\"- Blake clenched his fists and the wind swirled around him. Then, his hair rose up, his pupils and irises disappeared and Blake screamed toward the sky. It was a very loud scream, though it could be felt the grief in it...Rocks began to lift up and the ground shook, and formed several cracks. A hole formed between the clouds in the sky as a tornado formed around Blake, who stared at Blaze in anger. He growled and surprisingly, spoke<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Blaze. No matter what, I'm going to kill you\"- And dashed towards him, punching him violently, but Blaze also fought back and it turned out they were at the same level. They fought at god speed and the mountains around got destroyed. Each time their fists and knees or elbows clashed against each other, the ground shook. And after a poweful clash that sent them both away, Blake walked around (still in dark state) and noticed, there were dead bodies on the ground, and weren't unknown ones.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What the...?!!\"- He noticed his pets, Claire, Karina, Ayrton, Gustave, Ferdinand, and the rest of his friends laying in different parts of the ground and in different positions. All of them seemingly dead. Blake shouted at the sky and the ground below him formed immense cracks, and the rocks lifted upward, as it formed a small canyon. He began to dash toward Blaze and Ryan H's voice was heard<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Blake. Remember what happened last time. You must dominate the darkness inside you. You must not let it take over you. You must...overcome the rage...Remember...what you fight for...\"- Blake didn't seem to pay attention until last phrase, and his irises returned (though he still retained the dark traits), then they disappeared again, and Blake screamed<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Overcome it. Get over the rage...\"- Ryan K's voice said. Blake screamed again and the wind formed a violent tornado around him, the big rocks and great amounts of dust and snow were being lifted up by his power. Blake's irises and pupils flickered several times, appearing and disappearing quickly, until Blake's eyes turned to blue and his hair turned to silver. Blake's irises and pupils disappeared again and he stayed in that unknown state for a moment, then, he gasped and all the movement around him calmed, he dismayed and fell down...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyan H. said to Karina,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"How was that?\"- Karina had no words, and she said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I...I had never seen something like that before...It...it reached above 18,000...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Nearly twice as strong as Blaze, awesome\"- Ryan K. said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Was it necessary that illusion field? And to make him believe Blaze had murdered us?\"- Joana said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Only your deaths would trigger such anger in Blake. And he has to overcome it. He almost did it. For less than a minute, he fused both essences...Though, it took out a lot of him...\"- Ryan K. said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"And this land wouldn't resist Blake's real power as you saw...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I never thought Blake would be that strong\"- Claire said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Well. Let him rest for a while. You should train. He's exhausted now, needs to rest\"- Ryan K. said as he brought Blake near the girls, letting him to lay down on the grass.</span></div></div>",

Tabitha and Claire glared at it and then noticed each other, and both had the o.o? face- then they looked away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile the Ryans were in a meditating-like state, and everyone else was resting. Suddenly, out of nothing, two unknown beings appeared out of a portal, and they seemed to be dark ones. Joana stared at them, still holding Blake and Karina stood up, she said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Who are you and what do you want?\"- One of them laughed evilly, and the other said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"My name is Nostory, and I think you can be useful to us...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What?!\"- Almost everyone exclaimed (except for Ryan K, Ryan H. and Blake)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You may be useful to get rid of our enemies\"- The other said -\"And my name's Seth\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen he felt a sudden sharp pain and Tabitha appeared before them. Also, Max and Rocky attacked Nostory. Then D'Artagnan connected a kick on Seth and then they stood in guard<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You'll have to kill us first\"- Tabitha said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"It'll be my pleasure\"- Said Nostory and Seth disappeared, then appeared behind the pets and sent them away by punching them with great force. Seth was about to get a second hit on Tabitha but Karina kicked him in the stomach, though he grabbed her leg and threw her away. Nostory appeared behind Karina, but she kicked backward, hitting him. Nostory grabbed her byy the throat and said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"We have no time to waste\"- His other hand bared sharp claws and before he could kill her, he felt a burning pain in the chest, and discovered a light arrow stuck there. He looked in anger at a black haired japanese female,it was Kagome, aiming at him with her mystical bow. Seth appeared again in front of her and knocked her out with a hit on the back of her head. Nostory pulled out the arrow and said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Well...Where did we leave off? Oh yeah, you were about to die...\"- He said to a badly hurt Karina, and Seth's voice was heard<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You kill her. I'm gonna get this one, is already knocked out...\"- He said as he went toward Joana and Blake. She stood up between Blake and him and said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I won't let you!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Oh yeah, you will...\"- Seth punched her but she blocked the hit, and she hit him with her knee, but in that exact moment Seth punched her in stomach, with such force she spat out blood and fell down, unable to move. He put his foot over her head and said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"See the good side...I was going to kill you anyw...\"- He was saying as a punch hit his face, and he looked angrily. The previously unconscious guy was standing there, in guard stance, and angry. Blake said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">Background Music: Evanescence Bring Me to Life (Live version <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEqz6upeSTo\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEqz6upeS...</a> )</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"The ones who'll be killed here are you\"- Nostory and Seth laughed<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Are you serious kid? I bet you can't even defend yourself at school, you don't look strong\"- Nostory taunted<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Yeah. You better get out of the way\"- Seth said, Blake looked at them angrily but remained silent<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Seth. Teach this kiddo that nobody messes with us\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I'll mop the ground with him\"- Said the confident deamon<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth began the fight alone against Blake. He found that this guy was very skilled and despite the great difference of power, he was putting up a fight <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Maybe we underestimated this one' he thought. Blake was still exhausted by his transformation and weakened by the copy body he was using, but the thought of something happening to Joana was enough to keep him fighting no matter what. And he wouldn't let it happen...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake kicked him and used more [never seen before by any of his friends] moves which were taught by his old friend Robin, he could get to connect impressive combos to Seth and used somersaults to deal more damage in critical areas (like the back of the neck and the head itself) They dashed toward each other, punches and kicks clashed against each other, shaking slightly the ground, as they moved at inhuman speeds, but soon Seth was getting the upper hand, overwhelming Blake in everything. Seth kept punching Blake brutally and hurling him against the ground, and after 15 minutes, Blake was layin down, panting, struggling to stand up<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake still tried to stand up and though being badly damaged, he ran toward Seth and tried to punch him, which Seth dodged, and when he was about to counter hiim, Blake performed an inverted variant of the somersault taught by Robin, jumping backward and over Seth, completing a 360 degree spin and connecting a powerful kick right behind Seth's neck. He got stunned by a moment, while Blake stood in fight stance, his shirt almost destroyed, his body bruised, bleeding and exhausted. Blake was breathing heavily and trying to keep standing up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth walked slowly toward him, and Blake tried to punch him again, but Seth caught the fist and kneeled him in the stomach. He did so several times, slashed his chest with his claws and finally threw him away. But he didn't kill him yet, believing he could be useful for their wicked plans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I think that's enough. Let's take him with us\"- Seth said. Nostory replied<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Yeah. But I guess we need those other two\"- They walked away from Blake and headed toward the Ryans, and Seth stopped, where Joana was laying down, and said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I'll keep my promise\"- He bared his claws again and grabbed her, and Blake ran toward him, trying to punch him, but Seth dodged it and punched him in stomach. He dropped Joana and punched Blake again, sending him against a rock. Seth appeared in front of him and punched him several more times, eventually breaking the rock behind Blake, and grabbed him by the throat and threw him against a thick tree. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake remained there, standing, but with his head bowing down, having no more energy to fight back. Seth smiled and decided to finish him off by piercing through his chest, but the assasin hand was caught by Blake's hand, and he looked in anger at Seth, then his hair rose up, and his irises became golden, and his whole body was surrounded by a golden aura. Seth felt suddenly that his hand was burning and Blake broke it, then delivered a powerful punch right into his face, leaving a golden flame burning Seth's cheek afterwards. Seth grunted in anger and engaged against Blake into fight again, but this time he could only get a few lucky hits, with Blake now getting the upper hand. Blake attacked him with all his might, punching him as powerfully as he could, and kicked him, sending him several meters away, crashing against trees, rocks and the ground. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake dashed toward Seth but Nostory appeared in front him and he punched him in stomach, slashed his skin with his claws and kicked him, and before he fell to ground Nostory appeared above him and added a powerful downward punch, sending him down and creating a small crater. Seth said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Hey, why did you intervene in MY fight?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Shut up Seth!! You had your ass being badly kicked\"- Seth extended his damaged hand and rearranged the broken bones. He replied<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Aww...I was having fun...\"- When he said that a tornado formed in the crater and a pillar of golden light appeared, coming from below, and after it vanished, Blake was floating above the ground and looked at them. Nostory said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I see...You must be one of those few male angels... I thought we had wiped them out...\"- Blake dashed toward them at incredible speed and kicked Nostory, but Seth punched him in stomach and grabbed his leg, holding him and punching in the stomach several more times before throwing him away, however Blake didn't fall to the ground, stopped a few centimeters above, and regained his composure, still floating above the ground. The fight kept like that, and Blake proved to be as strong than them...well...as strong as one of them...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake kept attacking one of them but got counter attacked by the other, and so the fight kept, Blake got overwhelmed by them because they were two, and Blake was barely stronger than one of them alone. After a few minutes, they were hitting Blake very badly, Seth locked him from behind and Nostory was punching him and slashing him with his claws. Nostory punched Blake in the chest and then in the stomach with such a strenght that his fist was visible from Blake's back, and after that, Blake spat out a bit of blood and his eyes reverted back to black, his hair fell down and he fell down in front oh him. Seth put his foot over Blake's back and Nostory said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I bet this is an angel, which means that the heroes must be close...we better kill him and leave...\"- He said as suddenly...</span></div></div>",

She looked around and noticed that Blake was laying near her, and was unconscious, but not like she remembered, his shirt was torn and his body was almost destroyed, bruised and with deep wounds caused by what seemed to be claws. Blake was breathing very slowly, as he was almost dead. A tear slipped down her cheek and crawled toward him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe placed her arms around his head and said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Blake...why?\"- She hugged him tightly and when she put her head on his chest, she heard his heartbeats...very slow...even his heart was too weakened...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, her body began to glow and she felt strange, but suddenly she reverted back to normal and got exhausted. She was resting on Blake's chest, and she said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Now...I know how you feel honey...ugh...\"- A warm light illuminated them and Lith appeared. She had an amazed expression in her face<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"...Lith...why are you looking at us like that?...ugh...\"- Joana almost fainted but Lith aimed her hand at her and she felt warmth, as her body was being healed. Lith replied<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I...I didn't know...that you...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What?\"- Joana asked calmly<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"It's another part of the Azrael's story nobody else knew... There was a female angel called Ren'Ai, who developed a crush on him...I knew it but for Azrael it took some years to realize about that...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Like ancestor...like descendant...\"- Both goddess and girl laughed at Joana's remark<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"But later he accepted her love for him, and he protected her whenever it was necessary. However, when Blaze betrayed us, Azrael decided to take on him alone to fight to death, when Blaze went down to Earth, Azrael was also going to go but Ren'Ai attempted to stop him. He said<br>\r\n 'I have to do this, Ren... I..We won't be safe until we put an end to this evil...and that means, until I kill Him... What he has done, I cannot forgive, and if I shall die, so be it...'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRen'Ai began to cry and hugged him, not wanting to let him go, and when I went to stop him, he replied asking me what was his purpose. We both knew the answer... He was Chaos' last hope for this universe, and this was his duty... I sighed and left them alone, they had a long talk before Azrael's departure. He decided to do whatever necessary to stop Blaze, and then, he said that he wanted to make this existence a better one to live in, even if he couldn't see it, but as long as she was safe, he'd be happy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzrael went somewhere to be alone and created a portal to access Earth, but he didn't know that Ren'Ai followed him, she saw him leave and also memorized the spell, and after taking a deep breath, she opened another portal<br>\r\n 'It doesn't matter...I want to be with him for eternity...I want to be at his side...I want to be with him when he finally brings peace to this world...I...I love him...'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, she entered the portal. She fought along Azrael against Omega and Blaze, and she did use up a lot of her power to keep both herself and Azrael alive, as they were sustaining grave injuries. I lost track of what happened to her after the battle, her descendants hadn't any particular signal. That's why it took centuries for the re-encounter, as your ancestors were in Europe while Blake's remained in America... I began to suspect when you saved Blake from Ivan, no girl could have such strength, and it only activated because of Blake...And now...your powers almost were awakened\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoana was surprised by that whole story and she said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You mean that I have powers like Blake?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Sort of...but you only have light powers...and...a special power she had...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What is it?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"For some reason, Ren'Ai had the ability to grow and multiply her own powers...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I thought you gave her that power, didn't you create her?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"No. She was of the very few left true angels, the ones created by Chaos. Most of my brothers were wiped out during the first war, and the sole reason Ren'Ai survived was because of her powers. I was myself one of them, though now...let's say that I got a bit 'upgraded' by Chaos' powers...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"But how can I master those powers? Blake's taking a lot of training and he still can't control them\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I'll awaken them, your powers will be easier to control, Blake's are the ones that require greater mastery\"- She aimed both hands at Joana and they began to glow, but she said before doing anything<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"But...if I do this...I won't be able to heal Blake, my energy will run very low after this, but you can heal him yourself\"- Joana nodded. A blinding light flashed and then Lith disappeared. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoana checked herself, no changes, not like Blake when transforms...but she felt the power inside of her, and she caressed softly Blake's face, her hand glowed in white light and left him still unconscious but surrounded by a cian energy field which would protect him and heal him slowly [She didn't want Blake to wake up yet]<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Rest now...I'll take care of this...\"- She said as she stood up, though not fully knowing how the hell she did just do that, it seemed she could use more her powers at will than Blake...</span></div></div>",

Joana also attacked them, very angry because they were the ones who hurt her boyfriend, and this time it'd be a fair fight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoana began to punch Seth and twisted his neck with her hands, he fell down and Joana was about to stomp on his face but he rolled away, dodging it. He stood up amazed, and said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You were just a weak human!! What the hell is wrong with you?!\"- Joana's hands glowed in white light and he opened his eyes wide<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"It...can't be...another angel?!!\"- Joana vanished, and reappeared behind him, hitting his back with her knee, and with a fast move, she began to pummel him with punches and kicks, and sent him away. She was about to dash toward him but a strange feeling stopped her, she instinctively looked where Blake was and noticed he was still unconscious but moving, like trying to wake up, and her energy force field was electroshocking him. She gasped and ran toward him (at her newly acquired speed it didn't take more than a few seconds).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake seemed to be trying to break the field and was receiving electric shocks because of it (Though those electroshocks were supposed to affect anyone who tried to attack him) Joana disappeared the force field for a moment and hugged him, Jak said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Your boyfriend seems to want to wake up\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I know...he's a tough one, but he's been badly damaged today, he fought Nostory and Seth at once by himself...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What?! How can it be?! We were no match for them!!...and that's saying them alone...only Jasmine at huge sizes could defeat them...\"- Jak replied<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"My boy is a strong one\"- Joana said in a cute way -\"But he was defeated because he was exhausted and other stuff, a long story to explain later...\"- She added<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I see. No offense but I thought he was a normal guy...but fighting those two...impressive\"- Jak said, as Joana went with Blake and hugged him in her arms, she then caressed his face and her hand glowed again in white, she said softly<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Sleep, sweetie. I'm gonna fight this time. You have to rest...\"- Blake calmed, though he was still unconscious but this time quiet, like sleeping. Joana said [To Jak] -\"He...He's always been willing to save me, even when he's gotten hurt himself, he's saved me so many times...I have to protect him this time...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Don't worry I'll look over him\"- Jak said, Joana stood up and all of sudden, a clash sound was heard (like breaking glass but 20x louder) and a light blinded them, then, when Joana and Jak regained their vision, they noticed a white haired boy standing before them, his hair was very long and almost covered his eyes, Joana clenched her fists and the boy said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Mind if I join the party?\"- Then Joana noticed that he had broken the shield around Blake, Jak asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Who's that?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Blaze...a demon...and our enemy...\"- Joana clenched her fists more tightly, even Jak gulped, as he had never seen his own girlfriend that angry [Well...maybe Yasmin but she's not the true one, ok?]<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Thanks for the compliments young lady\"- Blaze said in a sarcastic way, mimicking a gentleman<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">[Background Music: Drowning Pool - Let the Bodies hit the Floor]</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Oh, what do we have in here?\"- He grabbed Blake by the hair and held him, showing him to Joana <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"This is what happens when YOU mess with me!!!\"- He said, and began to punch him in stomach and then he squeezed his throat, then he threw him away, sending him to crash against a big rock...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoana was speechless, and soon her speechlessness turned to anger and dashed toward Blaze, punching him right into the face, with thunderous force, making the ground shake and sending him several hundred meters away. Jak was completely shocked, Jasmine had to grow to multiply her own strength, and that girl punched Blaze with a strength comparable to Nostory or Seth's...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Wha...if that's your strength I don't wanna see your boyfriend's\"- Jak said, but this time Joana was silent and after some minutes Blaze reappeared, brushing the dust off, but he had a slightly amazed face he couldn't hide, and he muttered<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Why you...?! How...One moment...that...no...it's not possible...\"- Joana walked toward him in a threatening way, and for some reason Blaze felt a growing fear inside him, but he fought it and said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"It doesn't matter if Lith borrowed you her powers, you're still a little brat, and you aren't even as strong as Blake\"- Blaze dashed at god speed at Joana but she did so and they engaged into a violent combat, Blaze was surprised by Joana fighting herself, and she had a more aggressive style [Obviously hurting Blake pushed her over the edge]. Blaze jumped and shot a dark beam at her, but she deflected it with her hand, the blast went towards their left side and exploded in the distance, both Blaze and Jak were with the O.O?/WTF?! faces<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Not even Blake can do that!!\"- Blaze shouted and charged against Joana, punching her in stomach and hurling her down to the ground, Joana kicked him and took the chance to stand up again, suddenly, she began to grow, reaching about 260 feet tall (80 meters), Blaze looked at her in obvious panic, and she grabbed him with one hand and squeezed him<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"It...can't...be...Ren'Ai...\"- Blaze muttered, and Joana squeezed him more, and said furiously<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"And THIS is what happens when you hurt MY boyfriend!!\"- She threw him down and stomped on him, but soon he lifted up her foot, making her to almost lose her balance, though she regained it, Blaze said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Damnit!! I should have known before, Ren'Ai...\"- He still seemed to be afraid but flew toward her and vanished, punching her in the back, making her to fall to her knees, Blaze then flew toward her again, to hit her in the back of her neck but his hand was stopped, and heard and a male voice said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I told you before...if you put a hand on her I'm gonna pull out your intestines and hang you with them...\"- Blake said, transformed, but it looked different to what Blaze knew, his hair was risen up but looked different, his irises had become golden and a a golden glow surrounded him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"So...you finally used light...how pitiful...I bet you can't fight me like that...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You won't know until you try...\"- Blake said...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Like millenniums ago? Not even you nor your 'little' girlfriend are match for me\"- With that he drew out what seemed to be his full power, he was surrounded by a purple aura which waved like a flame. His eyes glowed in bright red also. Then the glow vanished and Blaze said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I'm ready\"- Blake vanished and reappeared in front of him to punch him but Blaze countered with another punch, their fists clashed, making the ground shake, and they looked at each ther in anger. Then they engaged in an air fight, surprisingly, Blake somehow could fly [As he did when faced Nostory and Seth, it seems it's a transformation's trait]<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze kept punching very fast but Blake blocked them just as fast and also countered at that incredible speed, Blake connected several kicks and punches and his hands glowed in golden, and he delivered a powerful demolishing punch which sent Blaze downward and created a huge crater, also it created a greater tremor. A lot of dust and rocks flew up and after the dust slowly disappeared, Blaze was still laying down, and stood up with some difficult. Then he said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I underestimated you Azrael, but no matter what you're still a fake!!\"- Blaze dashed upward and punched Blake in stomach, this time he countered with a knee hit and Blaze, whose hand was behind him, touched Blake in chest and revealed that he was charging up a dark beam, and it exploded in contact with Blake, at point blank. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe explosion was powerful and sent them away. Then Blaze walked near Blake, who was in a crater, but beofre Blaze could even look at him, a powerful tornado emerged from the crater and lightning was visible. Golden thunderbolts were flashing around it, then it vanished and Blake appeared there, floating several meters above the ground, and this time his hair looked different, still rising upward, but i was more spiked and it had finer spikes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze dashed toward him and Blake attacked also, again, in a violent air fight. Blake's skills were helping him out but after engaging in close combat, it was demonstrated that the power level of light form was far lower than dark's, and Blaze began to overwhelm him again <br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Add the still being exhausted after training + Severe damage dealt by Nostory and Seth, and the fact that he was almost not healed at all, the healing barely replenished enough energy for him to stay conscious) <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze kicked Blake and before he could begin another combo, a giant fist came above him and hurled him on the ground with enormous force. Blake was a bit confused and looked up to see a giant Joana<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Ermm...why are you so big?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"That's the way you say hello to your girlfriend?\"- Blake gulped and Joana giggled and said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Don't worry. I'll get Blaze this time...\"- Blake scratched the back of his head, and said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Okay but don't get too overconfident... Even like this, he's stronger than me...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"That's because you've been weakened silly. You didn't wait for your healing, but I'm still thankful for that, Blaze was going to hurt me...\"- Joana said with the u_u expression. Blake felt strange protecting a girl the size of a building. And finally said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"OK. Then I'll have to keep fighting...\"- And when said that, Blaze appeared between them both and kicked Blake away, Joana swatted him with her hand but he moved at god speed again and punched her in the face<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You never will be anywhere as strong as your so loved boyfriend. And you aren't able to protect him from anything. You ALWAYS have been a LOW RANK angel Ren'Ai, and your incarnation is just worse...\"- Blaze said, but Joana punched him (at giant scale, of course) and grabbed him, she squeezed him with more strength than the previous time and Blaze groaned in pain, but despite being taking demoloshing pressure, nothing on him broke or bled <br>\r\n<br>\r\n[And in EVERY other fight, though Blaze shows bruising after REAL severe hits, he recovers back rather quickly, and nobody has never seen him to bleed or o have a deep real wound]<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze's eyes glowed and he formed a quick force field to break Joana's grip, then, after vanishing it, he flew and kicked her in the stomach and at godspeed, he appeared above her and hit her behind the neck, Joana fell down but landed on her hands and knees. Blaze appeared in front of her face and said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I told you. You will never be more than an ordinary angel\"- Then, taunting, he said -\"Though I bet your boyfriend would like the position you're right now\"- A punch in his face told him otherwise, as Blake appeared in front of him<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"That's none of your business you sicko...\"- <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You don't even know what am I talking about do you?*\"- Blaze said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Argh...not really...but anything you say is either sick or pervert or evil...so I assume it's a bad thing whatever it is\"- Blake replied*. Even Joana shook her head, and stood up full height again, saying<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You won't make it against us\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"So that's what you think? Then fight both at once, no prob by me!!\"- Blaze shouted...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake and Joana fought him at once and could connect several combos (Though to Joana was difficult not to hit Blake) But Blaze had still the upper hand, and after attacking Joana he hurled Blake against the ground and hurled him badly, then, sent him away by shooting a point-blank beam at him. Blake fell down to the ground and reverted back to normal, his hair regained its original form and his eyes reverted to green. He was struggling to get up, he had never taken so much damage before, and before he did anything, Blaze said at him<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Think fast!!\"- A huge shadow loomed over him and Blake noticed in horror Joana was falling down on him. He had no time and Joana fell on him, causing a great tremor. Both Blake and Joana got unconscious, but Joana retained her size, luckily (or not) Blake was caught under her breasts, so he wasn't harmed, but was immobilized anyway. Blaze flew over them and stood on Joana's back, he said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I told you, I am the king of darkness...Nobody can mess with me\"- Then he looked back, and said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Though I have to congratulate you, Az, you don't have bad tastes on girls at all...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*If you haven't read the previous stories, it's been shown that Blake, despite being though, smart and shrewd (in some areas). He still has a high naivety grade about puns and double meaning-phrases, though Blaze's was quite direct this time. To make it short: Blake is very naive to things related to youknowwhat. And Azrael is just like him (Or more appropiately Blake is just like Azrael)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Blaze smiled and shot a dark beam to him, but Shadow dodged it too. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey exchanged punches and kicks in a mid air combat, and Blaze was getting the upper hand again, though the difference between Shadow and him wasn't that much. Shadow showed that he was good at close combat too, and several times hit Blaze with point-blank energy blasts, but was surprised that with all that Blaze didn't even get a scratch. Blaze pummeled him with powerful punches and kicks but Shadow didn't took much damage either, and after a collision between their energy blasts, the explosion forced them to move away from each other, and before they did anything, <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze looked back, and noticed that Blake was standing there, holding his left arm in pain, badly damaged, but still determined to keep going.

Blaze fell down to the ground, he never expected such a power. Blake shot at him a powerful silver beam, that caused a big explosion and a tornado afterwards. Blaze showed signs of major damage, then a silver light illuminated the place<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked up and saw how Blake descended to ground, but still floated above it, and dashed at amazing speed. Blaze readied two energy balls charging up which would explode at contact but much to his surprise, Blake dashed past him. He couldn't believe it...He saw two wings made out of silver light in Blake's back...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNostory and Seth had already advanced a great distance away from them when suddenly Blake appeared before them, looking far different than first time, with silver hair risen up and blue eyes, and had a pair of silver wings made out of light behind him. He left them writhing in pain on the ground with a single punch to each one, and shot them with a silver blast, from each hand. He kicked them, sending them away several yards away...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen he flew toward Yasmin, and punched her in the stomach and made her to fall down. He flew again at the incredible speed (it was above god speed) and punched her in the back, she fell down. Then Blake punched her in the chin and in her cheek, and shot an energy blast right into her face. She tried to shot a colossal dark beam at him but he covered with his wings and stopped the impact. Blake charged up an energy ball in his left hand and was about to shoot the beam, but he noticed that Nostory and Seth were getting up, and before even moving all of sudden his hair reverted to black and his eyes reverted to green, and fell down from several meters. This time he was exhausted and almost dead, but surprisingly still conscious, though unable to move. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze appeared where Nostory and Seth, saying <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"We have to leave NOW\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"We? Who the hell are you?!\"- Seth said, and Blaze aimed his hand with a dark energy beam charging up<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"To you, a powerful ally if you shut up...otherwise, your worst nightmare...\"- Nostory did a gesture to Seth to let him continue<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"So, what's your plan?\"- Nostory said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I'll explain later, but let's say that if you give me a hand I'll get rid of your enemies...\"- They shook hands, though Seth didn't like this guy at all, mostly because he was positioning himself as the leader. Nostory also knew it, but would act cool until he had the chance...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile...Yasmin got up groaning in pain and noticed the tiny (to her) one who caused it, now laying on the ground, she smiled and grabbed him, and began to squeeze him...</span></div></div>",

Yasmin was shocked, she thought that she would at least get a hit on Jak, but he was too fast, and also fresh.

Blake was now unconscious and even more damaged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other seemed to be regrouping, and getting up.

A real goddess, well, Jasmine was the incarnation of one, but this one had all of the divine traits, and her hair was green, her eyes aqua. But something wasn't right, she kind of looked like too pale, and being the goddess of earth she should look healthy. Jak thought, even when it was the first time he saw her<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I...I'll try to heal you...I-I didn't know...th-that...there were other beings like Blaze...\"- She definitively sounded weak<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe aimed her hands upward and a warm light healed back Ryans' families, Blake's pets, Jak, Jasmine, Joana, Claire, Ayrton, Karina and the rest of Blake's friends. Then she aimed her hands at Blake, saying<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I have to heal you with more energy, you need your powers to be replenished...if you were fresh you might have mastered your power sooner...\"- A golden light began to illuminate Blake's body, his wounds began to close but all of sudden it stopped, and Lith seemed to have fainted. The two energy balls which were floating at her sides turned into two men, one of them almost identical to Blake, but older, mid 30's, with sharper eyes, seemingly colder. The other was a guy, which seemed 24, with black mid long hair, thinner but toned, with white skin. Both with golden wings made out of light and a golden aura surrounding them. They held her and helped her to stand up again. The younger guy aimed his hands and Blake and finished the healing. Lith said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I...I-I am s-sorry....I...can't...I...don't have...energy...\"- The older man stood at her side and gestured at the younger for him to heal Blake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJak wanted to know who were those guys, and before even making a question, the adult said briefly<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"My name is James. Blake is my son...\"- Then he turned again in the lightball form, and so did the other guy, who somewhat seemed to know Blake. The younger guy said after a few seconds<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"My name...I had several ones...but most people call me Robin...\"- the young guy said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Ro...Robin?

Who was the one who fought Blaze then? He sounded a bit more violent but Blake's always like that......'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I think I know why...\"- Blake and Joana stared at her, and she replied -\"Nevermind. I'm not sure if that's even possible...I'll bring that up again if I get any other proof...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Okay...\"- Joana said, though she was already suspecting about something because of what she just saw<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"By the way...Blake, if you want, by concentrating and touching your old body, you can enter it. The backup body will disappear until you want to get out...Be careful when being small Blake...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Thanks...but...why would I go back to my body?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Well...I think you'd feel better in it, and maybe you could train by yourself using it...but I also think that she could answer you...\"- She said looking at Joana, then, teleported, and so did the lightballs at her sides, which were angels...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What the...?\"- Blake said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Well, hon, at least I'm used to have you in 'Pocket mode' \"- Joana said.

But I barely survived by my own. It was very difficult and the only sources of food I knew were some fruit trees and vegetables at the woods. I even stole to get some food to not die by starvation. But, I met a guy while fighting other street boys to defend my food. He was 11 or 12, while I was 5, and helped me. Later he became my first friend ever. When I asked him his name, he said that he had several ones, but prefered to be called Robin...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"That's the same way the angel introduced himself!\"- Joana exclaimed<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Well...as I was saying...He became my friend, and taught me to defend myself. I had already been taught by my father but it wasn't too much since I was just 5. We either worked or stole food to survive, and we slept in parks, with newspapers when the weather was cold. If it was raining, we went under bridges or under newstands kiosks. Things weren't easy. I realized that when Robin thought I was sleeping he went in nights to work on something, and that sometimes he gave me the food that was supposed to be his. And sometimes we faced other street boys who wanted to take away whatever we had. He and I fought to defend our right to live.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nParticularly, one gang was the one that caused us trouble, their group was known as Los Tiburones, the Sharks, in Spanish...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Los Tiburones? I thought that gang was extinct long ago...\"- Joana said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"It wasn't at that time, but they had been already been weakened by other gangs like the Salvatruchas, other gang of central americans. Few groups remained, and oe of these was the one that caused us trouble. We engaged in several fights, and the ones who always began the attacks were a guy who everyone called McGregor and a latino-looking guy. He was called El Lobo, which means the Wolf, they both were about 14 or 15.... And Robin was the only guy in all neighborhood who was brave enough to face them. I also did when I met him, but he didn't want me to get involved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn one of our fights, about their supposed territory, the park we slept in, I got badly beaten, and I got unconscious. Robin said that they were about to kill me but he took the hits instead. The guys smashed his left arm with baseball bats and steel tubes. Somehow he took me to a hospital, and when I woke up we were both at a hospital. Robin lost his arm that day, the doctors said that it was too damaged and that it wouldn't heal back. After two or threee weeks they discharged us. Even when such a loss, Robin didn't seem to care much about it, and even still trained me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMonths later, McGregor and El Lobo appeared while we were resting in an abandonded building to challenge us to the definitive fight, they said it'd be in the park we used to sleep in. He said he'd go to finish it once for all. I wanted to go, and after some insistence, he said it was OK. But while we were walking, he hit me behind my neck. I blacked out. When I woke up, I ran toward the park and could see the fight. Robin was fighting the two guys at once. Even with only one hand he kept up and it seemed that it they were 1 vs 1 he'd win. But fighting two and one handed was overwhelming him. I rushed there and punched El Lobo in the chin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen I kicked him in the stomach and turned around to attack McGregor, but he deployed a knife and slashed at me...\"- Joana gasped when Blake said that<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I barely dodged it, and the slash hit my right eye, though my eye wasn't damaged. After that, McGregor grabbed me by the hair and threew me away against a trashcan and said to Robin <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Hey, street dog!! wanna see how a street rat must be treated?' He rushed to kill me...with the knife...and...and tt-then...it happened...\"- Blake paused for a moment, as his voice faltered. Joana put her hands on his shoulders and stared at him, Blake cleared his throat and said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I'm okay...well...as I said...it happened...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Robin took the fatal hit...McGregor stabbed him in the abdomen...and then, he and El Lobo laughed and walked away, I passed out for who-know how long... I woke up, and noticed a fabric wrapped around my head, covering my right eye. Then I saw Robin, who was very pale, and then, he spoke, he said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Don't worry...just run away...'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Robin...why?' I said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'You have lots of life ahead. Don't waste it. You...can be some...thing...someone...gg-greater than..this. You can be better...' He replied<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Robin...'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I know what I tell you. And I understand why your father did the same... you're different...you still have to find your own path...your own life...Someday, you'll leave streets life behind, and will be...maybe you...some...day...'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd after coughing blood, he...he slowly went cold...and...his hand fell to the ground...\"- Blake's voice faltered again, and turned away from Joana for a moment, took a deep breath and said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Then it happened...I screamed to the skies...I...I no longer cared about anything...I had lost everything again...lost my father, lost a friend who was a brother to me...I...I felt...fury...absolute fury...the desire to avenge their deaths...Robin's death...I...I wanted to kill... I unwrapped the fabric around my head and used it to wipe off Robin's blood, then, I wrapped it around my head again...\"- Joana stared at him with her eyes wide open<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I ran...nowhere to go...nowhere to live...nobody to care about...I ran....not knowing where, my instincts guided me from there on...I...I confronted the guys again...I took McGregor's knife...I...I slashed his throat, and I stabbed El Lobo in the chest...\"- Joana gasped and said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"But...how? You were damaged, and...how could a child beat teenagers?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I was in dark state for the first time ever...\"- Blake answered, he added<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"The other guys got badly beaten, I think I cut one's hand...and the others had just some deep wounds and bruising...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that...I...I ran away, I had nowhere to go...I can't even remember how much I ran...until...I blacked out...Then I was found by an old woman who raised me the rest of my childhood, even when she was just as poor as me. You know that story... I learned that she was my grandmother, and that she could never meet my father after losing him during some moment that she didn't tell me, though it seems that my father was a baby at that time. She died when I turned 10, and after that I returned to streets, though this time I went to school...\"- Joana hugged him and said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You\u00b4re not evil Blake. I feel it.\"- Blake pushed her away and said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Yes, I am. It was my fault that Robin lost his arm...It was my fault that they killed him...I was the one supposed to die that time...I was the one who killed the guys...And it was my fault my father died...I shouldn't be alive right now...\"- Joana hugged him again, very tightly this time and said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Don't say such things!! I think that both your father and Robin thought it perfectly and still gladly gave their lives to save you. Don't you see it? You're necessary!! Even God...well...Goddess has come to tell you that...they need you...and...I need you too...\"- Blake was speechless, and she tightened her hug and kissed him.</span></div></div>",

I'm not sure anymore. But I'm no angel\"- He sighed and asked <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Why those bad guys and you think I'm one?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Because of what Lucius, a high ranked angel told us. Most of male angels were wiped out during an ancient war\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I see... someone called Lith told us too\"- Blake replied, and both Jak and Jasmine raised an eyebrow<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You know?!\"-  Both asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I got to meet Lith. She's Goddess according to herself... A long story...\"- Everyone were silent, and Jasmine broke the silent<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"We wanna hear it\"- Blake got a mild sweadrop but regained composure and cleared his throat<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"By what she's told me. In the beginning of things, there were three gods. She only mentioned Chaos, the oldest and the creator of things, and his brother. Chaos created Lith, and then they began creating angels and planets to fill the universe with life. Chaos wanted to share the existence with a happy family of millions of living beings. His brother acted normal. But he was ambitious and wanted the living beings to worship him and only him. He created his own angels too, well, that's what it seemed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter thousands of years, he decided to rule everything and prepared a massive attack against Chaos and Lith. I'm not too sure but here's where most of the original angels were wiped out, and I bet that most were male. Demons were almost extinct, though some survived. The war was long. In some point, Chaos decided to finish things once for all and fought the Devil alone. They killed each other. When Lith arrived, Chaos was about to die, and he bestowed her the powers of Universe to prevent its destruction by his death. She said that she found two angel babies near them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's how Lith became Goddess. She created a lot more of angels and kept the war against the demons left. And also raised the angels, one called Azrael, the other one's name wasn't mentioned. They fought many uprisings and were about to win definitively, but in one of their last battles, the angel went missing. In no time there happened another massive attack, with millions of demons, though this time they had a leader, Omega, who proclaimed himself as the king of demons. The angel was standing at his side and...\"- Blake's eyes' pupils and irises vanished, and immediately Joana stood in front of him, saying<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Blake!! Are you okay?!\"- She shook him slightly but there was no response, Jak and Jasmine also got worried<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What happened?\"- Jasmine asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I don't know\"- Suddenly, Blake seemed to have lost his balance, but regained it, his eyes reverted to normal and Joana said, very worried<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What happened to you?!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I...I don't know...I...I got lost....I...I was telling you about...S...Blaze...and I saw something...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What?\"- Joana asked again<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"It was like a forgotten memory...I can't tell what was it...but...I didn't recognize anything...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"We better sit down\"- She said, and when they sat down, she put Blake's head on her lap, saying<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Maybe you're tired honey.

Few angels were strong enough to face Omega or the fallen angel. Oh, by the way, the fallen angel and Azrael weren't just angels. They were archangels, the most powerful living ones, and the only two left in the entire Universe. They fought and almost killed Omega 15 times, each time he came back stronger. The fallen angel was implied. By the 16th time. Lith sealed him away with all his demons, and prevented the fallen angel to resurrecting him again by sealing Omega. The spell she used required, however, two keys and a location to be broken. One of the keys was the fallen angel's name, which was erased from his memory. And...Omega is called from that moment Omega 17\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Why didn't she just destroy him?\"- Jak asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"She said that Omega was more powerful than her, so sealing him was their only option left.\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"And why is the fallen angel still free?\"- Jasmine asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"He performed an ancient curse to prevent him from being killed by divines/angels. He got a never aging human-like body, and most of his powers were locked. That body couldn't be destroyed by any divine being. Then, Azrael, I don't know exactly why, but maybe because of being the other archangel left, sacrificed himself too, he obtained a mortal human body, and in difference of the fallen angel, he'd eventually die, but as part of a prophecy, he'd return to defeat him someday. The fallen angel claimed the name Blaze for himself...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Who's Blaze then?\"- Jasmine asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"The weirdo with white hair, and powers. He fought both Joana as a giantess and Blake transformed in whatever he was...\"- Jak answered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"So, Blake's the reincarnation of Azrael?\"- Jasmine said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Not exactly...he's his predicted descendant...Lith said that his bloodline comes from Azrael, we can say that he's an angel's descendant...\"- Joana answered, while caressing softly Blake's hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"That story sounds like the missing details in what Lucius told us...\"- Jak said to Jasmine<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Then...is Omega 17 Lucifer?\"- Jasmine said to her boyfriend<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I bet\"- Jak said<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter some minutes, Jak asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Hey Joana, tell me something\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Huh?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Why was Blake so damaged when I came in? I kind of feel that he was strong enough to beat Nostory and Seth\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"His powers are different from anyone else. He has a combination of Light and Darkness. But he doesn't know how to use them. It was very rare, and lucky, that he got the light powers against Seth and Nostory. The form I've seen the most was Dark, that happens when Blake gets really angry. The dark form has kicked Blaze's ass several times, and in a very violent and bloody way. Sometimes it even acts a bit sadist. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake was badly hurt by the bad guys because Ryan K. and Ryan H, some new friends of us, were training Blake so he could master his inner powers...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Wait, you mean he can't transform like Jak did?\"- Jasmine said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"That's right. Blake can't transform at will, yet... the Ryans were training him for that. Blake's transformations are triggered by emotions...and, maybe some other stuff. Call me crazy but every time Blake has gone dark he isn't just angry, every time he transforms he also has gotten severe damage dealt by Blaze. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake was being tested by them and they could make an illusion of all of his friends and me dying, which triggered his anger, but they stopped it at the right moment, and for some seconds, Blake summoned both powers at once. He fainted and got very exhausted, that took out a lot from him. And I guess that a copy body doesn't help either...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Copy body?\"- Both Jasmine and Jak asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Oops. I forgot that. Blaze attacked us a few days a go with lots of clones of himself. Blake and his pets were able to keep them away for a while, but they began to get outnumbered\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Pets?\"- Jak raised an eyebrow again<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"To help, the Ryans turned Blake's pets in humanoid like beings called anthros. They're Rocky, a pitbull, Max and Tabitha, cats, and D'Artagnan, a belize slider turtle. They have been helping us out to both keep the department and train\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"That sounds cool\"- Jasmine added<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"It is, though they've been kind of overprotective toward Blake lately...they keep calling him 'Master' But everything is fine\"- Joana said, then, she resumed the story<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Well, as I was saying, Blaze clones outnumbered Blake and his pets, though the Ryans arrived and saved them. Then they faced the real Blaze, who fought at full power. Blake in dark form almost killed him, but his energies ran out before doing so. That's what happened when Blake fought this time with Nostory and Seth. Blaze paralyzed the Ryans and for some reason didn't kill them, but shrunk them instead. The Ryans created illusion bodies to keep fighting and to fool Blaze, making him to think that they broke his curse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze got away and left the guys and the pets shrunk. Some hours ago, Lith came in and said that she could revert it, and turned the Ryans and the pets to their original sizes. But she couldn't break the curse on Blake. So, she created a copy of his body, and placed his soul in there. The copy just resembles the original, but it isn't exactly identical. His original body has a more tanned skin and black eyes, and a scar here\"- Joana gestured a vertical line in her right eye with her index finger<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I like the original the most. I'm kinda used to it, though the green eyes in the copy make him look cuter, while he looks tougher in his real body\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Seth and Nostory arrived, Blake was unconscious by his training and in the backup body, which is just half as strong as the real one. That's why he got defeated. By what I saw, Blake was stronger than one of them alone, but being two against one overwhelmed him\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I see. So, Lith is keeping the original body?\"- Jasmine asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"No. She said it'd be safer here, and gave it to me.\"- Joana opened her purse and showed her the tiny real Blake's body. Jasmine looked at it with attention<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You're right. He would look tough in normal size. But being that small looks cute ^-^\"- Joana took the body again and put it away in her purse, she said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I know. I like it too. But Blake doesn't seem to like it\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Really? Jak likes being shrunk and playing with me\"- Jasmine said, Jak blushed a bit<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Blake is a bit too shy about those things. He just blushes and tries to do something else.\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Maybe he likes it but is ashamed of it\"- Jasmine suggested<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Uhm...I'm here\"- Blake said, who had his eyes closed but was still awake, though he took a little nap<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"And wait a minute...how did you call Omega?\"- He asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Lucius referred to the Devil as Lucifer\"- Jak replied<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Lith didn't mention his name...She said, the one we'd know as Satan...\"- Joana said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She was running away from Nostory, the guy you guys were fighting a little while ago. Anyway, we were running away from Nostory...\" Jak said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why didn't you try to fight him Jasmine?\" Joana said. \"I am sure you were taller than him.\"<br>\r\n\"Well, one, I wanted to get Jak to safety, and two, this was before I thought I had powers.\" Jasmine said.<br>\r\n\"Oh, I see.\" Joana said. \"Continue, Jak.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So we were running,\" Jak started again, \"We were getting away, then we met another Deamon. His name was Shadow. He offered to help us get away from Nostory. He held him off, but he was servely injured. We helped him heal in his ship, which is behind us, the Deathray. He also told Jasmine that she had growth powers, and she mastered her growth. When we were traveling, we met Kate, who was also an enemy of the Deamon race. She started to travel with us. Anyway we met up with Lucius, who is a high angel, and he told us that he knew about Jasmine. After many encounters with Nostory, and his ally Seth, Lucius told us the story of the Great War. Lufcier was the head deamon, and Nostory is the reincaination of him. Jasmine is the reincaination of Goddess Gabriel. Soon after all that happened, Nostory also tipped off to me that this was a dream, and everything in it would become real.\" Jak said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...\" Blake said. \"The world that you were in merged with the real world?\"<br>\r\n\"Something like that,\" Jak said. \"The world was once a part of the real world, but it was separted from reality. I am almost at the end.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyway, Nostory was using me, to make a portal to the real world, which he did. And then me and Jasmine had to enter this portal, in order for me to wake up. And she had to enter, altough she didn't have the dream. So her memories, and what happened in my dream, are connected. I also got into a realtionship with her afterwards. A year later, Nostory and Seth have entered our world, and ever since, Me, Jasmine, Kate, and Shadow have been in a battle with them ever since, to stop Nostory from ruling the world.\" Jak finished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow.\" Joana said. \"That's quite a story.

Only add that he has red eyes and dresses in white and gray. Some times appears with an angel-like suit. That one will be shown later. Also, wears a black inverted cross in a black necklace)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake blushed the most, and closed his eyes. Joana said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"It's funny you ask that. You seem to be the one who has been protecting Jak. I met Blake 6 years ago. He saved me from vandals. It was a bit strange, I felt that he was different from everyone else... And... I had a crush on him since that...\"- Joana blushed a bit more and continued<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I just got to be friends with him, and I found out that he was really different. At first I thought he was rejecting me but I befriended Karina, who knew him for long, and she told me he was always that cold with everyone. She realized soon that I fell in love with him, and taught me lessons of Blakeology\"- Blake opened his eyes wide and said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Wait a minute...you mean that because of Karina you got me?!!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You're a difficult one, you know? Normal tactics just don't work on you\"- Joana said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"It's not fair. Using a friend is cheating. Then I wouldn't be here with you if Karina hadn't helped you\"- Blake replied. Jasmine and Jak looked at each other. Those two seemed to be arguing like husband and wife already<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoana smiled, and Blake got a confused face (he was still laying on her lap though), she caressed his face and said sweetly<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Well...Technically...you wouldn't be here either if you were alone. You'd have died if it wasn't by me....\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Argh...Okay...you win...\"- Blake said closing his eyes again<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"OK...Huh...where did I leave off?\"- Joana said before replying to herself<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I remembered...yeah...before being INTERRUPTED, I was about to say that I turned down most of Karina's help. I decided to do it by myself. I found out that he lived in streets. With more time I discovered that he was no pervert and I almost dismayed when I realized he was completely naive to things that most of 12+ years old boys already knew. But still... I find that cute...It's like a cute mixture, a tough boy who fights whenever is necessary, but still innocent. Not much boys grown in streets are like that. Most of them are already corrupted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so...it took 3 years for him to realize...We've been together since that. About Blaze... we met him a year later... well, Blake did. Some bullies set a trap for Blake, forcing him to go and fight them or face consequences. They hurt most of his friends. When Blake arrived, he said that there was no one, and then appeared that weird white haired psycho. They fought and it was very violent. Blake lost, even with his dark state and with Karina's help. Somehow he shrank him, saying something about increasing his power, and left. Karina brought him back to me. We had many adventures before finding Blaze, with Blake's father's help, though YOU said I was insane\"- She said at Blake<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Saying you hear a man's voice in your head doesn't sound precissely too sane...\"- Blake said, eyes still closed<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Whatever. Blaze pretended to surrender and willingly unshrank Blake, but then he attacked us and Blake fought him. We escaped from there. By what Blake's father told us, Blake put up a good fight to Blaze, and after fainting, Blaze left, and he brought the unconscious Blake to us. Since that Blake had been training hard. It's been two years...And...as I told you...Blake's powers come from his ancestor...an angel...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Wow...That must've been a great adventure\"- Jak said, and Jasmine asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Um... guys...are you...already married?\"- Blake quickly jumped up to a nearby tree, with surprising speed. The couple stared at the tree with O_O faces, and Joana sighed, saying<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"No...and...he's afraid of it for some reason...I don't know...whenever he hears about marriage or children he either avoids the topic or just runs away...We've been together 3 years though\"- <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"See?\"- Jasmine muttered to Jak, who gulped<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoana, meanwhile said to Blake<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Honey, come here. I'm not planning about it\"- Blake jumped from the tree and landed on his feet, and acted as nothing had happened<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Sorry for that. I thought that, being together for so long....\"- Jasmine said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Yeah but she's older than me...\"- Blake said before being tightly wrapped by Joana's arms<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"...Okay...I said nothing...\"- Blake murmured, and Jasmine giggled<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What's the matter? I'm a year older than my Luigi-Boogums too and he doesn't mind\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"See?\"- Joana muttered to Blake, who gulped</span></div></div>",

Luckily, they weren\u2019t in any danger. They were each picked up by two large hands though. Jasmine and Joana were behind this little scheme. Jak was stuffed in Jasmine\u2019s cleavage, and she shrunk down to her normal size, with Jak, who was the size of a bug. Same with Blake, Joana did the same thing, because she had to watch how Jasmine did it. Now both of their boyfriends were shrunk, and they didn\u2019t even know it. They were inside the Deathray, which Shadow promptly introduced himself and Kate.<br>\r\n\u201cWell, \u201cShadow said. \u201cI suppose you guys can travel with us.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cNice to have some allies who could help us out.\u201d Kate said.<br>\r\n\u201cCool.\u201d Joana said. \u201cThanks.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019ll be in my room if you need us.\u201d Jasmine said, as her and Joana walked away.<br>\r\nSoon Jak and Blake began to wake up.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Jasmine?\"- He had no answer -\"Guys?!!\"- He asked nervoously, as his eyes adjusted to the illumination. Then he noticed that he was in an unknown place. He seemed to be in a bed, or something. He saw what seemed to be a curtain in front of him, and noticed then a pulsating sound behind his back. The wall or whatever it was vibrated slightly. He touched the thing behind him. It felt warm, and smooth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Definitively not a bed...' He thought. Then he noticed that he was surrounded by two huge things...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Those are too big to be pillows, and too soft to be rocks...' He thought again, trying to figure out where he was. He decided to climb up to have a better look. But almost as soon as he tried to climb up, he slipped and fell down to where he woke up. Before doing anything else, he heard a giggle, and the vibrations around him became stronger. Then his eyes opened wide<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"That giggle...I can't mistake it...Joana...\"- Then he looked above, and the hole above him expanded as a huge hand entered, and took him out of there.

I think you're cute\"- Blake sighed and before saying something, he felt a great pressure, and noticed that he was being pressed against a soft wall that couldn't be anything but his seemingly amnesiac girlfriend's breast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Okay...Enough playing around, I've got to get help\"- Blake said confidently and performed a high jump (to him), thinking that he'd get away, but he was quickly caught by a giant hand, and he thought <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Damm it!! I miscalculated the distance I'd jump!! Curse you physics**!!!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Guadalupe' looked at him, and held a grip on his body, then she broght him closer to her face, she seemed to be examinating him, and said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Are you really a boy?\"- Blake exclaimed<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Yeah!! Can you l..\"- He was interrupted by her<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You jump like a cricket!!\"- Blake sighed, 'I never thought that Joana mindwashed would be that dumb' he thought, and replied<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I'm a martial artist. I'm trained to do things like those... At my normal size that would have been a real high jump...Well...now...can you let me go?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Guadalupe' scratched her chin, and seemed to be having a hard time thinking, then she said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I don't want you to leave. Can you be my little boy? I'll try to take care of you, I promise\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake sighed at the \"my little boy\" part, thinking 'Like I hadn't been hers this whole time...', and shook slightly at the \"try to\" part. Definitively, either Joana drove to insanity or Blaze hit her in the head with too much steroids on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"It seems I have no choice\"- Blake said, and 'Guadalupe' hugged him tightly again<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Something tells me that this will be a LOONG day...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*[NOTE: Yeah, it might sound crazy, but actually, Joana's second name is Guadalupe (She's Spanish).

Too bad that even when he thought he was flying fast, his speed was way outmatched by hers, as she simply ran after him and caught him again in her hand, this time, closed around him<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Hey little boy, wanna be my boyfriend?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake closed his face with his two hands and then, said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I'll need intensive psychiatric therapy for life if I ever get out of this ...\"-</span></div></div>",

After some moments, Jak surprisingly, outran Blake, who got the O.O WTF?!! face as he saw him to get away. No need to mention that 'Demi' almost stepped on him. Though Blake wasn't crushed, the step created a small wuake for him and he fell down. That doesn't seem to be that bad luck. And what's worse, 'Guadalupe' was on his heels and with the new advantage, Blake had no way to escape...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJak, however kept runing around for a little longer, but mostly was because 'Demi' wanted to tease him, making him believe that he had actually a chance. But after 10 minutes, which seemed years to Jak (and Blake), he was beginning to get tired and was caught by 'Demi', who walked near 'Guadalupe', each girl holding her little boy in their fists. Blake was trying to open her hand with his strength but it was futile. The girls looked at each other, and looked at the boys, with an evil grin, Blake said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Jak...Maybe this is the end, and...THIS IS ALL YOUR FREAKIN' FAULT!!!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Man.

Why do you think I can't seduce my own boyfriend?!!\"- A vein popped in her forehead, showing that her girl vanity had been hurt by being told that she didn't even know what Blake liked (about HER body). It's not like Blake would tell her so easily...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Well...by what you have told me, I think it's that. Jak on the other hand is way more playful and often asks me to play with him. But at least I know that he likes boobs and having me as a giant\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Sounds strange...\"- Joana said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Maybe Blake likes that too...or...he might like feet...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"No, he doesn't. I have a bet with Karina and still we haven't solved it yet. But I can tell you that he doesn't like feet very much, and gave me a 'What the hell is wrong with you?' look\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What's the bet about?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I bet her 15 bucks that Blake preferred boobs because I think he likes that. Karina bet her 15 bucks saying that because Blake has latino blood, he would prefer my butt over my breasts. We still don't know the answer\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I see...\"- Jasmine said<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo the training room...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"So, I'll go first, no prob, right?\"- Jak said, Blake shook his head and gave him another thumb up.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Shadow said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Just hold on a minute, Jak. You should take a breath. I'm a bit intrigued by Blake's fighting abilities. I want to test him alone first\"- Jak reverted to normal and Blake nodded. He walked into the training room<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Okay Blake. How about fighting the same Nostory and Seth programs Jak just fought?\"- Kate asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"It's fine by me\"- Blake replied, and stood in guard stance. The holograms appeared, and the fiht began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDifferent to Jak, Blake didn't immediately rush to attack, he let them to try to hit him first and, taking advantage of their brief vulnerable moment, he dodged the fists as he connected a double punch in each one's stomach, and quickly, moved his body upward while keepig his fists in their abdomen, performed a reversed somersault, landing his knees on each one's back of their necks, after that, he dashed a bit away and stood in guard. Shadow got a bit more intrigued by this, he hadn't seen such fighting skills before. Kate was amazed by the damage dealt to those holograms by those two hits, and the fact that Blake hadn't even transformed. She checked the power readings<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNostory Hologram: 5,200<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth Hologram: 5,000<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake: 1,720<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had a more amazed face and called Shadow to see it himself. As they checked the numbers, Blake was fighting both at once, blocking their hits and connecting several punches and kicks. Blake's power remained the same, while he kept fighting. Shadow muttered<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Power them up as the real ones\"- As he said, Kate pressed some buttons and the numbers changed<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNostory Hologram: 7,500<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth Hologram: 7,340<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Blake was keeping a fight, despite taking longer than Jak, Blake hadn't strained his body, and his vital signs were normal. But after powering up the holograms, Blake began to have trouble, though he was still dodging and punching them, though the damage was lessened by their power difference. Nostory and Seth shot at once a dark beam from their hands and it hit Blake. There was a small explosion. Kate was about to shut down the simulation but Shadow told her not to do it yet. The smoke vanished and a golden pillar illuminated the place. The numbers seemed to go crazy, and the count stopped at 7,220 as Blake's power. Kate seemed a bit disappointed by the result, but Shadow said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Remember that power is not all. Skill is important. Blake began fighting enemies 5 times stronger than him and he was kicking their asses. It seems that he doesn't require as much power as Jak. I've seen their fighting performance and they've been pretty much similar, but Jak overpowered himself and reached about 16,000. This guy seems to be able to do the same with half of the power Jak needs.\"- <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack to the fight. Blake was fighting just like the first time, though this time he knew their moves. Blake fought at their level, and was keeping his vital signs slightly increased. Still no strain. Blake kept using martial arts like moves combined with some never seen ones, like the somersaults, which dealt severe damage when hit correctly. Blake also seemed invulnerable to their energy shots, as Nostory and Seth shot massive dark balls at him and he didn't even dodge them. When they shot a beam at him, Blake deflected it with a single hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake kicked Nostory in the chin while hit Seth's face with his elbow. Nostory grabbed his leg and threw him against a wall, but, there was no crash. Blake stopped before hitting it and floated above the ground. Blake seemed to disappear, and reappeared, standing behind Nostory and Seth. They turned around and felt a lot of punches all of sudden, though Blake didn't even move. Both Shadow and Kate were confused by this<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I'll check that part later...\"- Shadow said<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNostory and Seth got up with some difficult, and Blake dashed toward them, he connected an elbow hit on the back of Seth's neck, and the hologram disappeared. Then he punched Nostory in stomach and his fist went through Nostory's abdomen. It disappeared also. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShadow looked the results screen, and said to Kate<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I see...Blake took longer to defeat them, but, look, he has almost no biological stress and the body strain is almost nonexistent. Defintively this guy has a lot more skill than we expected\"-</span></div></div>",

Since they were their boyfriends, she allowed the girls to watch the fight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack to the guys...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShadow said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Hmmm...This is a bit complicated...if you fight at normal state Blake has too much advantage, but, if you go omega mode, then Blake wouldn't stand a chance\"- <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Are you sure you can't transform again?\"- Jak asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I'm still trying to learn how to, but I'll try my best. Let's see how do I do against your omega form\"- Blake replied<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Then let's do it\"- Jak said, and Shadow went to the control room, he noticed the girls and before he said anything, Kate said, like already knowing the question<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"They came to see their boyfriends. Just sit there and watch\"- Shadow nodded. Kate set the virtual battlefield as a plain with grass, quite simple, with no places to hide. It was set at noon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJak immediately transformed in his omega form, his muscles grew slightly and the white aura surrounded him, lifting up dust and small rocks. Blake had his arms crossed, in a waiting attitude, then Jak gestured that he was ready. They both stood in guard, Jak in a standard position, while Blake had his own (it's kind of a mix between martial arts and street fighting, difficult to explain) Meanwhile, the computer showed this<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSubject A, Jak, Current power output: 10,400<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSubject B, Blake, Current power output: 1,750<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJak attacked first, Blake barely dodged the fist and countered with a swift kick connnected to Jak's neck. Unfortunately, it didn't hurt that much (I mean, no superstrength hurt, it just hurt Jak like any normal kick, which at omega form wasn't that much) Blake moved quickly away and was surprisingly calm, he already knew that at normal state it'd be just like fighting Blaze, though Jak seemed to be stronger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey engaged into fight again, punches and kicks were flying at sound speed, Blake still couldn't deal any heavy damage to Jak, but still matched his speed perfectly and Jak couldn't get any hit on Blake. Until, for a brief moment, Blake tried to counter a punch and he received a powerful blow that sent him away several meters (Yeah, the virtual room can do that by tweaking the space-time thing, don't start to argue about physics...)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fight wasn't going anywhere as Blake kept up with the speed but couldn't match the strength, and the blow he received weakened him. Blake still could connect several hits because of his skills by years of fighting. Shadow still was impressed to see someone putting up a good fight against an opponent about 10 times stronger than him.</span></div></div>",

Blake was looking on ahead. Both looked like they knew this was going to be the turning point of the fight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJak allowed himself to revert, and tried to see how he would do against Blake normally. They both started to exchange kicks and punches again, but Blake had a little more advantage over Jak, due the power level change. Jak wasn't doing too bad. Blake got more hits in than on him. Jak was on the defense, and Blake had gave him a punch that knocked him back a bit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright.\" Shadow said. \"That's enough.\"<br>\r\n\"Hm?\" Jak said. \"Were done?\"<br>\r\n\"I guess so,\" Blake said, as the environmental arena changed back into the white room.<br>\r\n\"Nice fight boys.\" Jasmine said. <br>\r\n\"It wasn't bad.\" Joana said. <br>\r\n\"I guess we should take a jump into the med chambers.\" Jak said. \"We can get healed.\"<br>\r\n\"Sounds good.\" Blake said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShadow and Kate was amazed at the training.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Blake has alot of potential, Jak too.\" Kate said.<br>\r\n\"Jak did take a stab at surviving the attack by Blake at his normal state.\" Shadow said. \"That wasn't too bad.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJak and Blake were engulfed by greenish liquid.

Both noticed their girlfriends, at a gigantic size, who seemed to be holding the ship, they were looking at them through the window. Blake sighed, annoyed.

Won't you search for everyone else?\"- Jak said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Maybe they ate them, or stepped on them, or...\"- Before Blake continued with the 'list of what the giant girls might have done' Jak cut him off saying<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Just stop!! Don't joke like that...\"- <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"After being almost eaten nothing seems scary anymore\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"But... what? how?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I'm not sure... either Blaze is playing a trick on us...or cloned them for real...or we fell in an alternate dimension... Ryan H. said some stuff about interdimensional things...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What? You mean that your enemy Blaze has the technology to clone people too?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Blaze doesn't use technology. Blaze uses magic, and his powers... which turned out to be evidently demonic... He's done something similar before. A few days ago he attacked us with waves and more waves of clones of himself. So, if he cloned someone else, I wouldn't be surprised. But you're right... at least your girlfriend's clone is not Yasmin.\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"How do you know? I mean, you don't even know her...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I've seen her, and I've seen the real Jasmine. I don't know how to explain but I can distinguish them, something in their eyes...\"- Jak remembered the popular said that eyes were soul's windows. Would Blake really be able to see through them? Well, being descendant of an angel would explain many things like this, so, Jak stopped thinking about that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"But...I...I can't see anything in Joana...\"- Blake added<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Don't you mean 'Guadalupe'?\"- Jak said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Whatever...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I had never heard that name before\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Because it's a Spanish name, Joana in fact is Spanish, and, yeah, here it isn't very common, but in Spain, Mexico or other spanish countries is a common name...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Wow...\"- Jak said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Well...As I said. I'll be playing DBZ in that PS3. Don't disturb\"- Blake said carefreely, but the ship shook and both guys fell to the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Okay...maybe we should deal with the little problem out there, shouldn't we?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I wouldn't call it little... the little ones are us!!\"- Jak said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Okay...anyway...I guess we should...\"- Blake was interrupted by a minor shake, which was like someone was poking the ship, and, as they knew, actually, someone was poking the ship. Joana was looking through the window. Blake knew perfectly that it was her because of her hazel eyes. Jak asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Hey, how are you sure these aren't the real ones?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I can't tell...\"- Blake said, and Jak fell down to the floor face-first<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I think we should go outside and ask them\"- Jak said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"That's the craziest idea I've heard today...it might work...\"- Blake said and followed Jak, who walked out of the room and went upstairs, Blake assumed that they were going to the roof, and so they did. Now Blake and Jak had a full view of the situation. Joana and Jasmine were holding the ship as if it was a toy. Blake looked down but couldn't recognize the place 'We must be far away from my department...or from the city...'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as they stood outside (well, in the roof, but outside the ship in general, DON'T TORMENT ME WITH GRAMMAR!!) The giant girls smiled at them. Blake and Jak sighed, believing that they were their girlfriends, but soon they'd find out...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWill they repeat the same mistakes from the last time? Or more important, are the girls just mad or there's something more sinister behind it?</span></div></div>",

Shut up!!!\"- Both guys quickly stood up and ran away (surprisingly, they ran at normal human speed), Joana's hand pursued them and caught Blake, then Jak's brain got illuminated and thought 'WTF?!! Why am I running, I can fly!!' He did so, speeding up, looking behind to see that Blake escaped from Joana's hand and began to run as fast as he was flying<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Are we stupid or what?!\"- Blake said after catching up with Jak. They believed they would get away, as they were running inside the house, which seemed absurdly big, as they kept running and there were rooms and more rooms, while Joana's kept smashing them with her hand to chase the guys (well...the guy...)  they noticed that no matter what Joana's hand kept on their heels, and Jak decided to power up to his Omega form and sped up even more, and flew upward, leaving Blake behind, who, unable to do as he did, got caught. Jak hadn't even time to think about anything as he collided with a soft surface, on which he bounced off slightly. Jak, dizzy by that, regained his vision quickly just to see that he collided with Jasmine's chest. She stared at him, seemingly confused, though she seemed to have liked that, and got Jak in her hand too. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as she did that, Blake and Jak's powers were disabled again, Jak losing his omega form and Blake his strength and speed, rendering both guys unable to break free (Though curiously, Blake's physical attributes shouldn't be removable as they are due to training and having angel blood...but...meh...don't ask...)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJasmine looked at Jak sweetly, while Joana grabbed Blake and brought him near her face<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Who has a 5 years old's IQ?!\"- She asked angrily.

So, she went toward the closet, where Jak had run under. Meanwhile, Jak thought<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Damn! Blake was right...dashing at high speed is less noticeable than flying...' He panted and said 'But it gets me tired faster...whew!...' In no time, he heard the gigantic footsteps, but this time they were less intense, and he realized<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Darn it!! They split to search in two places at once!!' Jak again used his omega powers to dash under the nightstand, not so far from under the bed, and Blake saw it. However that was the least of his worries. Jak found out that due to the damage he and Blake were dealt, and the other previous experiences, they weren't at full, and what's worse, he felt his powers running low (Consequence of the fact that Jak lacks the physic to handle the power).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the mean time, Blake had a brilliant idea, he jumped up and used both hands and both legs extended to keep a grip to the \"ceiling\" (the wooden part of the bed above them when they were hiding.

But she felt happy again knowing that what she was going to do would help both of them, specially Blake. Also, she felt that they needed this, as Blake has been too focused on fighting Blaze after he fought him<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Well, then, you should wake up\"- Jasmine said putting Jak down, so did Joana with Blake, and they walked away, vanishing. In no time, the whole room seemed to be vanishing also, everything disappeared, turning into white, like a blinding light flashing over everything. Everything vanished, and both guys felt waking up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, in the healing room...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Healing process complete... Shutting down HK-II engine...

The green liquid slowly was drained and the tanks' glass enclosures slowly retracted upward, leaving the two guys stainding, still with the mask, and the lower half of their clothing. Their shirts were rebuilt and were put in front of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore even taking out their masks, they met with their girlfriends' faces which were overly happy. Jak and Blake stared at each other, and sighed, they knew that it was no dream and that they would have to spend  whole day with them...</span></div></div>",

Kate is capable of keeping up with a Deamon, and she doesn't have the powers either but yet, she is the only L.O.R. rebel to keep up with me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jak is the one who has given me the key to get to the real world.

Whom I should have not underestimated before...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"It seems you know more than what you're telling us\"- Nostory said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"It's something I don't wanna talk about... It's a distant past...\"- Blaze noticed the looks of both deamons, sighed and said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Let's say that we were partners, very long ago... But I swore revenge, on all of them...the ones who banished me... so long ago... I swore I'd kill all of the Archangels with my bare hands, just one's left...Azrael...\"- Blaze said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Wasn't the guy Blake?\"- Seth said, still annoyed by Blaze's way of speaking<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Blake is the guy you fought, his ancestor is the one I spoke about, Azrael, the last Archangel... Blake has been training hard by what I see...\"- Blaze answered<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Training?! What do you mean?! You didn't kill him when you had the chance, did you?!!\"- Nostory said, now annoyed by that newly learned fact<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"The first time I met him, he was strong to be a mere normal guy, but his level at that time was'nt anywhere near yours or mine. He was roughly 10 times weaker the first time I fought him\"- Both Nostory and Seth now were surprised and angry at that<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Why...you?!!\"- Seth clenched his fist<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Before saying anything else, let me continue. I know perfectly what I'm doing, that's why I've spared his life, so I shrunk him. All of the dangers he had to endure made him stronger, also, one of his friends used a machine to enhance his physical body. After only one month they went to look for me, and I fought all of his friends. They were a piece of cake, except by a stubborn tough blonde. As I had anticipated, Blake's father intervened and broke the spell, so Blake regained his size and fought me for a second time. That time, he'd become nearly 4 times stronger... 4 times, in a single month... I spared his life again, and I waited for a more proper moment, now, after 2 years, that moment is pretty close\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"2 years?!! You let him to train for 2 years?!! Are you stupid or what?!!\"- Seth said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You haven't let me finish... There's something else... there's an old ally who will help us, but we need to break the seal that imprisons him and his army, that's what we need Blake for, that's why I allowed him to reach full power. His dark power is the Key.\"- Nostory scratched his chin, interested now that he heard the word \"army\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I see, but don't you think that Blake is strong enough to not let himself be caught?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I anticipated to that too, you'll see how things are done\"- Blaze said, in an arrogant way<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Okay...then, what about the others?\"- Nostory asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"His girlfriend, Joana, she has become quite dangerous, her power must not be underestimated. She can grow too, but until today, I didn't know she had that kind of powers. She was just a defenseless girl all these times, though sometimes she could stand against me, but I ended up moping the floor with her. And her temper is another threat, if we try to get Blake and he's NOT alone, she definitively will get mad...\"- Blaze said, almost fearing her, but none of them noticed, and none of them would ever imagine why<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"There's also Karina, that stubborn blonde, she's as strong as Blake's base form. Her level is not as high as you could think, but it's enough to be taken on count, and she might get stronger, though is just a human. His other friends are just harmless teenagers, I fought all of them once. But... I feel that something is not right with them...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, then, appeared some new guys, I don't know anything about them, and they have showed to be dangerous too, they're almost as powerful as Blake's full power. The only thing that I know is that they are called Ryan H and Ryan K, and that they also brought their families in, wives and children, and all of them have a considerable power. Since their appearance, Blake has gotten far stronger, and for the first time has used his light powers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What one are you talking about? That guy had a transformation with a golden aura, and then the weird one wth silver hair and wings\"- Nostory asked, now intrigued<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Blake, his power was said to go far beyond his ancestor's, Azrael. Both of the had a rare inner power, both light and darkness, in one individual. There's nobody like them in the entire Universe. The light and dark power combination might be created by special weapons or other objects, but nobody has been born like that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd in fact, only 4 have had this trait... God himself... Another archangel called Abaddon [Saying that name with a particular hate], Azrael, and this boy... The mastery of that power turns the user into the ultimate warrior. But by now, Blake can only handle one at once, barely mastering light, and being dominated by darkness. We need to push him a bit more over the edge. Each time he transforms into his dark form, which you haven't seen, the darkness goes to a higher degree. From short periods of power, he now becomes an almost unstoppable beast, but the price is that he has no control on what he's doing. The concentration of dark energy within his body has reached critical levels, so, we just need a bit more\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Then, what's the second form he transformed?\"- Seth asked, Blaze opened his eyes wide, and answered<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"It's...the new guys' fault... somehow... they have begun teaching Blake to use both powers... at once... what you saw... was a proto-form of the real fusion power...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Proto-form?\"- Both deamons asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"That's right... it's not a real light and darkness fused form... but is quite near... He still needs to master both powers before doing that... and he still doesn't control it yet, just goes berserk like in the dark form\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I wonder...' Blaze thought<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Then we need to get rid of those guys before Blake learns too much!!\"- Seth exclaimed<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"That's my point. But before that, we need to release an old buddy. He'll help us out, and will unleash his army, the glorious Ancient Demon Army!! With them, we'll crush all of the little pests, Blake included, after using his dark power to break the seal, we can throw him away just like garbage!! And after that, there will be nobody able to stop us!!!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Ancient Demon Army?' Nostory thought 'Is it be possible? Is he talking about...?... No it can't be... though his story is quite similar to us... except the fact that he described God as a man...'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I'll tell you about that later, it seems that you also know some stuff\"- Blaze said -\"Now that we have a more detailed background of our enemies, it seems we should get into action...\"- Blaze said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Agreed.\"- Nostory said, walking over to a table and pulling a cloak off a sliver ball. -\"We should see what they're up to...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNostory, Seth, and Blaze looked at the ball, and it showed the Heroes...</span></div></div>",

Soon lith came to break the curse on us all except for blake because he has a different curse so lith gave him a spare body and blake has started to use his fusion form, but lith gave joana some of her powers like healing, growth, and some others.\"- he continued<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Now Jak's group is from a different world and their enemies came to see us while ryan and I were having meeting with oursleves.

jak is going to spar with ryan over there. For those who have decks, ryan and I will have something special for your and our duel monster spirits. The ones who can fight, but can't last long will be taught by ray, kari, and ace. Finally, the ones who can't fight at all will watch the other train while taking mental notes.\"- ryan h. explained<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What about the ones who can fight and last longer than the ones that can't?\"- momo asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"They and our other personas will fight us at the same time because we need the training.\"- her captain said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You have forgotten one thing as well.\"- real ryan said after returning with the houses in their ship forms</span></div></div>",

do ryan?\"- karina asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"They call a pair of partner machines that work with the guardian persona and the is in the side story that started with a certain pair.\"- he explained<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You will meet them and others soon when I call them on the computer.\"- he added<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Ryan, what about our gun?\"- powerman asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"The tracer gun is with the personal arsenal suit and the bullets is with it.\"- ryan k. answered<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Both medicines is with the gun since the effect of the gun is a minor setback.\"- he added<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey walked into ryan k.'s lab and some of them surprised by the technology.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"This is amazing ryan k..\"- karina said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"This is better than that scientist's lab and there is a lower level to my house because that is where I'm keeping a castle from my family's kings and queens.\"- he said with a smile<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Its about time you got here ryan.\"- a voice said as a person appeared on the computer screen<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Sorry about that two history lessons needed to be taught.\"- ryan said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"We need to train as one again.\"- deathman said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Before we crossfuse, there is something that needs to be done and I did my pet along.\"- ryan said as he walked to the computer<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Everyone that has a deck come forward and I will start the power up.\"- he said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Good thing that we made enough for all of the decks and deathman, you can started calling the people from the side story while this is being done and I want all of them at once.\"- he said to the computer screen<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Hey ryan.\"- a woman said with her husband and their daughter appeared on the screen as others appeared on the screen<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"It is nice to your faces again and there is much to talk about, but this is not a pleasure call because two of our old jobs came back to help a pest that ryan was dealing with and I have a feeling that the other monsters will come back as well.\"- he explained<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Jessica, I know that it is your job to visit other worlds to check their status and haven't seen any monsters that we are talking about now except that one mission, but I'm going to need you, your family, the other agents for this last mission between us.\"- he added<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Ryan, our work is never done and we will always have our history together.\"- jessica said before laughing<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Besides tucker has been training us the moves that you taught him.\"- she added<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Alright ryan and I will open the biggest portal with our cellphones and a clone will get you to help  us in th final fight along with several other armies that we have planned till then so from now till then is training, but don't forget your other duties and goodbye for now.\"- he said before ending the conversation<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"The decks are ready.\"- he said in a low tone<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Ryan, do you remeber why do our former and the personal job?\" he asked powerman<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"To save worlds from danger, prevent suffering, for the kids that we have met and seen, get revenge so other people don't have to do it, and we do it because we want and have to since it is our job.\"- powerman said in a serious tone<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"We had this hands washed of their blood long ago on that day and we will have to do it again.\"- ryan k. said looking at his hands<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"No you won't.\"- ryan h. said as he was walking to him<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I gave you two the job because I couldn't it, but I will do it myself this time and you can deal with your personal matters like inner demons or killing omega 17.\"- he said with a smile<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Deathman, you and I will train when we are killing demons left and right or those stupid blaze clones.\"- ryan k. said with a smile<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"There is one thing left to do while we are here together and that is training, but I have a feeling that we are being watched so ryan can you do the honors.\"- he said with a cruel smile after making a window portal connected to the crystal ball<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Phantom shattering break shot!\"- powerman yelled out as he launched a powerful blast of energy<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Watch us now blaze.\"- he added before the crystal ball breaks into pieces<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Wait blaze was watching us?\u201d- blake asked confused<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\u201cNot any more and you can train in peace with the rest of us.\u201d- powerman said with a smile<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\u201cBlake, after your training your full power dark form mixed with your full power light will mean that your true power has been achieved.\u201d- powerman said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\u201cSo with that out of the way, the training groups will continue.\u201d- ryan k. said as they started back for the training field</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Ryan H. stood in front of Blake, and said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Blake, as Powerman said already, you need to master both powers, but there are some things before that. Mastering a single power is alreay difficult, and you NEED to master two. This is the real training, though the training you underwent before allowed you to transform to light form. It will be very difficult and maybe painful. Do you accept?\"- <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake nodded, and Ryan H continued<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"First. Before even getting in ligh and darkness, you must control raw energy...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Raw energy?\"- Blake asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Call it vital energy or ki, or pure energy. The simplest form of energy usage, and is the most common type of energy used. You need to learn this before learning advanced techniques, or specialized attacks, such as Dark and Light in your case. Others have Element power\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Understood, so, do I need to reach some level to be able to shoot beams?\"- Ryan H denied with his head<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You have already more than enough physical power to handle simple techniques, and for the moment, the physic has outgrown the energy part, so, first we need to make them even, and as your body became stronger by fighting, your energy mastery will grow by using energy attacks\"- Ryan H. said, and walked until he was next to Blake, and added<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You must focus your mind. It'll be difficult the first time, but the more time you practice the easier it will become to you. Try to gather a part of the energy inside you and place it in your hand...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake extended his open right hand forward<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"When you gather enough, try to shoot it at this...\"- Ryan H said as a test dummy appeared. Blake's hand began to glow in sky blue, and Ryan H said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Now shoot it!!\"- He was expecting a small amount of energy to be shot at the dummy. Usually beginners could only form energy balls<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake aimed at the dummy and the glow in his hand became brighter, he tried to shoot but nothing happened, the glow decreased instead, and then it became brighter again, this happened several times, Blake became angry at this and finally, could shoot, but he shot a massive beam. It disintegrated completely the dummy, but also damaged severely the training field. Everyone had the O.O faces, and heard a thud shound, Blake had fallen to the floor, unconscious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"He blasted almost all of his energy in one shot\"- Ryan K observed, Joana immediately ran to his side, and while lifting up Blake, she heard Ryan H thinking out loud<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What was wrong this time?\"- Karina walked to where they were and said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Maybe I'm not right, but the last times Blake went dark, he had already this ability. I think that maybe the dark form somehow keeps control over Blake's special abilities, which is what is preventing him from use energy properly. Even in his light form, Blake hasn't any special trait except for flying, though dark Blake can too\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Hmmm...\"- Ryan H scratched his chin, thinking<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"In one of his dreams fought his dark side, but he almost lost. Besides, it's not a separate entity like our inner demons, is a true part of his own soul. Taming it must be more difficult\"- Ryan K. said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Though not impossible\"- Ryan H said. The way he said it made Karina and Joana shudder, like feeling what was coming next<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Joana. Please, replenish Blake's energy. He has no physical damage so it'll be easier for you\"- She nodded and both of her hands glowed in white. Blake slowly woke up, Joana hugging him very tightly. After a moment, Joana released him and he stood up, he asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What happened?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"It seems that you have a bad teacher\"- Ryan K. joked, though Ryan H glared at him<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Your case is quite different from conventional ones. It was my fault not to have seen it before. Blake, I'll try to adapt the training to your current condition, and it will be somewhat an upside down version of the ordinary training\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Upside down? If I can't do simple things, how can you expect me to do difficult ones?\"- Blake asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You will see... First, you need to transform into Dark form\"- Ryan H said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"WHAT?! I CAN'T DO THAT AT WILL YET!!\"- Blake yelled, and suddenly, a blast almost hit him from above, missing by mere inches. Blake turned around and stood in fighting stance, Blaze landed on the floor seconds later, saying<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You will transform\"- Blake clenched his fists and tried to hit Blaze but he vanished, and appeared about 3 meters away from him. The Ryans engaged against him but Blaze shot two red beams at once, piercing through them. Blaze dashed and grabbed Joana by the throat, he began to strangle her, and charged a dark (purple) beam in his other hand, he released her involuntarily when Blake appeared and landed a punch on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze quickly looked at him, and noticed that Blake was in a weird state. His veins had become more visible, and somehow his hair was partially risen up. Blaze smiled and said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You know you can't defeat me unless you go dark\"- Blake engaged against him and couldn't deal serious damage to him, though he was stronger than before. Blaze disappeared again and reappeared, grabbing both Joana and Karina, and said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Do you know what's what I hate about humans?\"- He clenched both hands around their necks, and a strong crunch was heard. He had just broken their necks. Blaze added<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"They are so DAMN fragile, see? little strength and they're broken already\"- He threw their dead bodies away, and licked the blood from his right hand, which had Joana's blood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"At least this blood tastes so sweet... and it's warm...\"- He said. Blake couldn't believe what he just saw, he fell to his knees, and shouted in anger toward the sky as loud as he could. He clenched his fists, and slowly stood up again. He said coldly<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I don't care anymore. I'LL KILL YOU NO MATTER WHAT!!! I NO LONGER CARE ABOUT THE OTHER IDIOTS OR ABOUT YOUR FREAKIN' PLAN!!! I WILL JUST KILL YOU!!\"- Blake shouted to the sky again, and the wind swirled around him, but not like the last times, this time it formed a violent tornado around him. Blake's hair rose up but kept waving, resembling the movement of a flame, his veins became thicker and more visible from the skin, his muscles grew slightly and tightened, he slightly grew in height, to 1.95 meters (normal height, 1.90), his eyes became pupils-less and this time, his canines lengthened slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As Blake transformed into his dark state, Blaze stood in front of him, watching, in a waiting attitude. However, Blake's dark state lasted just for a moment, and felt like being ripped apart from himself. Blake had reverted to his normal state. He looked at his hands, for some reason, they were covered in blood. Confused, looked in front of him, at Blaze, who just smiled, and slowly vanished. Much to his surprise, Blaze was no longer there, but Blake's darkness was standing in there instead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis Dark Blake looked like what Blakes was going to transform, but his skin had a darker and grayish tone, and had the scar in the right eye (While Blake hasn't it because he's in a copy of his real body). Blake felt an immediate rage, like the urge to kill him, because it was what Blaze was looking for, clenched his fists and stood in a fighting stance, while the dark one was just standing...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack to reality... (WTH?!! Reality?!!)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone were looking at Blake, who was enclosed in an illusion field. Ayrton said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Isn't a bit too cruel to make him believe that Blaze actually killed Joana?\"- A vein popped in Karina's forehead and the consequent punch was heard. Now, with a bump on the head and tears of pain in the eyes, he asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What was that for?!!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You worry about Joana and not about ME?!!\"- Karina said angrily<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Well, whatever, but isn't it a bit too much for Blake?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I know. But it's the only way Blake can get to his dark side. The only thing Blake truly fears is losing Joana. Losing his friends just pushed him even more over the edge\"- Ryan H. said in a serious tone<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake's body was standing, and powering up. It was in a weird state between dark form and his normal self (Yeah, the same seen in the previous chapter before Blake faced himself). His eyes were flashing, from normal (green irises in copy body, normally black) to iris-less. The wind aroudn him swirled and roared violently. Suddenly, Momo fell down, but landed on her hands and knees<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I can't believe it, that power... how a simple human can be so powerful?\"- <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I told you before. He's no simple human. He already can match a Shinigami lieutenant in his normal state. As you see, currently his power has surpassed that of a captain. By what I see, angels must be as strong as Shingami\"- Ryan H said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Azrael, his ancestor, was the last Archangel. The last one created by Chaos...\"- Lith said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"That would explain why he's stronger...\"- Ryan H, completed his explanation<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"But... wasn't the dark thing what Blaze wanted in the first place?\"- Ferdinand asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"The darkness within Blake has taken a form of its own since his early life. Slowly has become more and more powerful. It hides most of Blake's real powers and abilities.  And if it's not stopped, it will begin to try to take over Blake more often. Currently, he only appears either when Blake can't fight anymore or when his deepest anger is triggered\"-  Ryan K. answered<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoana remembered what Blake told her previously. According to that, the dark Blake had existed for longer than everyone else thought. Karina referred its earliest appearance when they were 9, and Blake's story places it at 5. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Definitively, it's existed as long as Blake has' Joana thought</span></div></div>",

Each punch and each kick was anticipated by the dark Blake. They were fighting at inhuman speed but Blake couldn't connect even a single hit. And he dealt no damage to the dark version of himself. Blake dashed back, panting, and thought<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Damn!! At this rate, I'll be dead. I can't do anything!!' His thoughts were interrupted as the dark Blake vanished and reappeared behind him, shooting a dark (black. To let you know, Blake's dark blasts are black, while evil beings' are usually purple or red) energy beam at point blank from behind. After the huge explosion, Blake slowly struggled to stand up, being badly injured, only to be strangled by the dark Blake, who was holding him easily with a hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake, somehow, could kick him in the face and performed a mid air combo, connecting several hits in the neck, its back, an othe important spots. Blake used the last kick to impulse himself backward, and, breathing heavily said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"...Maybe you've got the brute force, but I have the skill!!...\"- The dark Blake didn't seem to even take care about that, replying<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"...Hmph...\"- And vanished again, this time, Blake anticipated and connected an elbow hit in dark's stomach. Though this didn't hurt him either. Dark Blake just kicked him forward, sending him face first against the ground, and walking threateningly slow toward him, saying<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Stupid. Skill is nothing. Power is everything. You are nothing. You're just always getting in the way, then, you must be destroyed...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Wh-what?!! When did you learn to speak?!!\"- Blake said as the dark one punched him in the face abd planted his foot Blake's chest<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I took a while to learn to speak. But I have no business with you anyway. There's nothing to talk about with you, just die\"- Dark Blake applied more pressure and Blake's bones cracking was heard, mainly his ribs and thorax.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake, in desperation, was able to push away the foot on his chest and used both legs to do a double upward kick, right into dark's face. Blake, who was standing on his hands, quickly stood up on his feet but as soon as he did so, the Dark Blake began to punch him with a strength that surpassed that of Blaze (When fought Blake himself. Blaze has used higher levels of power when fighting the Proto-Fusion form and the Ryans, none of them are registered in Blake's memories) and sent him away through several rocks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake had difficult to stand up again, and the Dark Blake said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"See? You're almost dead already, and this is barely a warm-up\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"D-damnit...\"- Blake said, and coughed blood<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Soon... this world will be MINE!!\"- Dark Blake said and laughed maniatically</span></div></div>",

Things didn't seem good again, Blake was now screaming and fell to his knees, Joana said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"He's suffering!! Can't you stop it?!\"- She said, begging to the Ryans to stop the illusion, and Ryan K. replied<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"It's too late. Our illusion has already done its work. Now he's confronting himself, the illusion field is also a shield that prevents Blake from destroying anything\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Even if we stopped it, we can't be sure if Blake has tamed his dark side yet, and if we shut this down, the darkness might rise up as Blake's conscience, and the Blake you know might not come back\"- Ryan h. said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Then why did you do something so dangerous?! If I had known I wouldn't have let you to?!!\"- Joana said, almost crying<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"It's painful. I know. Maybe it's more painful for him, because he's not fighting a separate entity inside of him, he's fighting a part of him instead, and that part happens to have most of his abilities. This is part of the only method to dominate such a power\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"By the moment, it seems that Blake is losing, look\"- Ryan K. pointed at Blake, who stood up again and screamed toward the sky, this time, the ground began to shake violently, the wind swirled ferociously around him, and lightning bolts flashed around him. Blake's eyes became irises-less and his canine teeth grew slightly, his hair rose up and kept waving upward, like a flame, moving continuously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKarina, who had her reading machine with her, measured the power, and amost fainted when she looked at it. Ryan H. held her before she fell and asked her how powerful was he now<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Curently, his power is above 12,000\"- Karina said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"This is too dangerous...\"- Joana said, like feeling what was coming next, and somehow, she was right, she had a speial connection with Blake and knew this kind of stuff<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"13,000!!...15,000!!...17,000!!!\"- Karina said, and added<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"He's almost as strong as his fused form now\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"This can't be good\"- Joana said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Get ready, Kasshi...\"- Ryan H. said<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of sudden, the field around Blake broke, creating a big explosion, and after the smoke and dust vanished, Blake was seen, in a darker form, floating a few inches above the ground. He turned toward the Ryans and the girls, and disappeared, reappearing behind Ryan H., but before hitting him, his fist was caught by Ryan K, who kicked him away, and said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Okay, everyone get ready for the subjugation battle, now!!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Subjugation battle?\"- Joana sounded even more worried<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Now, we'll fight 1 vs 1 against him.

Powerman punched Dark Blake in the face and both dashed back <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, they engaged in combat, moving at incredible speeds, Powerman could land several hits in Dark Blake and ended the combo with a powerful kick, sending him several meters away. He stood up as if nothing happened, though the damage was visible. He smiled, and dashed toward Powerman, who dodged him and with a powerful punch, sent him against a boulder, causing it to collapse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDark Blake emerged from it and still, all what he did was to smile and attempt another attack, engaging in a longer exchange of punches and kicks with Powerman, who punched him in the stomach, kneed him, and threw him away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"He's not that tough\"- Powerman muttered, but as soon as he finished the phrase, he felt a movement, and Dark Blake appeared behind him. Quickly, Powerman turned around and kept his distance, surprised that he hadn't tried an attack after catching him off-guard. Again, that evil smile, and aimed his hand at Powerman, shooting a powerful dark beam, Powerman barely dodged it, and grazed his left cheek. A huge explosion was heard and Powerman said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"We're feeling a little cocky today, huh?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I wasn't aiming at you\"- Dark Blake answered, with a metallic-demonic sounding voice. That voice caused Joana, Claire and Karina to shudder. Despite have never heard it, it reminded them of Blake's dark state and the darkness implied. Joana could already feel the darkness within him the few times he went dark in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPowerman was confused by the answer and by the fact that by what he was told, the dark form was brute and lacked intelligence, focusing only in destroying whatever that caused Blake to transform. And looked upward, finding out that the shot was aimed at the boulder near him, which collapsed on him, he had no time to react.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Pathetic...\"- Dark Blake said, and Powerman emerged from the rocks, saying<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Maybe I underestimated you, It seems that I'll have a fun time\"- He cracked his knuckles and ran toward Dark Blake, who could connect some hits but received heavy damage from Powerman. Powerman kept pummeling him, and ended the combo with a powerful hit right in the face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDark Blake stood up again, acting like nothing happened, and began to laugh maniatically<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What's so funny? Getting your ass kicked is fun?\"- Powerman asked, Dark Blake stopped laughing and remained silent, Powerman looked at him confused and opened his eyes wide when he saw how Dark Blake's body regenerated quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"It seems that you're better than I thought\"- Powerman said, and prepared to fight him again. Moving at an incredible speed, he dashed toward Dark Blake, but he vanished way faster than he expected, and before even turning around, he felt pain in the back. Dark Blake had shot at him a powerful dark blast at point blank at him, sending him against a big boulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone had been watching the fight, and were completely surprised. A loud beep was heard and Karina checked her machine (modified binoculars that measure power)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"It's not possible... his power is still growing...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What?!\"- Ayrton exclaimed<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"How can the sole Dark form be so powerful? It has the level of the weird fused thing!!\"- Anthony said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"The inner battle, the darkness must be winning. But I thought that Blake would put up more of a fight\"- Ryan H. said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"The battle inside him is allowing the darkness to become more complete. Usually, Blake keeps control over himself, losing it just when Blaze appears. To battle him in his inner world, Blake has left his own consciousness, and the control over his body is what they're fighting for. Also, the darkness, with nothing to stop it, is quickly developing, and becoming a more advanced enemy\"- Ryan K. explained<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What's his current power?\"- Ryan H. asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"22,000 and keeps going up\"- Karina said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"This has become too dangerous... Maybe we'll fight him more than 1 vs 1. OK everyone!! Our plans have changed, our main objective is to subjugate Blake's body, no matter how...\"- Ryan H said</span></div></div>",

In a exchange of punches and kicks, the Dark Blake let himself to get hurt so he'd fire another point blank dark blast, sending away Powerman crashing against large boulders, which would bury him for a while. After that, Dark Blake turned around looking at the duelists.

A thunder descended from the sky, striking him. After the smoke vanished, the damage dealt to him was noticeable, and Sparkman appeared just after. dark Blake growled and dashed toward him, attempting to punch him, but the hit was stopped by something hard, which turned out to be Clayman's arm, blocking the attack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDark Blake flew back and attacked him from behind, connecting a kick in the back of his head, sending him away, but before doing anything else, Bubbleman appeared and connected several punches and ended with a kick, then he shot a powerful water blast at him, which kept him busy until Dark Blake got engulfed in flames, which caused a great explosion, and Burstinatrix appeared, standing bravely in front of Dark Blake, whose body was badly damaged. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment, Joana decided to look away, she couldn't stand seeing her boyfriend being so hurt, but Karina tapped her shoulder, signaling her to see the battle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDark Magician, Burstinatrix, Bubbleman and Sparkman shot their powerful beams at once, causing a great explosion.

But that was what Dark Blake waned, taking advantage on the low guard and attacking Sparkman, cracking his armor after a few hits, then he kicked him in the abdomen area and sent him away against rocks, encountering with Burstinatrix, who fought him hand to hand for a bit longer, taking advantage of her fire attacks, which burnt Dark Blake's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven so, Dark Blake overwhelmed her and ended up smashing her down too. he damaged again the other heroes and engaged against Avian in an air combat.

Quickly, he slashed Buster Blader, cutting off his left arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, Dark Blake dashed at inhuman speed toward the Elemental Heroes, slashing Bubbleman's chest, one of Avian's wings and one of Burstinatrix' arms. Sparkman barely dodged him and Clayman got his left arm cracked by the impacting force. He and Sparkman engaged against their crazy opponent, who kept attacking wildly, cracking Clayman's and Sparkman's armors by mere punches. The Dark Blake was about to slice them but the sword turned into dust and flew away, reforming in Buster Blader's hand, which also had been rebuilt by Atem, whose duel disk glowed during te process.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Even with these monsters, this is more difficult than thought.

Looked like Dark Magician, but had bluish skin, and his suit, despite having Dark Magician's basic form, it had Buster Blader's design, with the golden ornaments and the orbs. He was wielding a weapon, seemingly, Dark Magician's cane, though it had a sharp blade in one of its end, the other being pointed<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I summon, Dark Paladin!!\"- Atem said, Jaden was impressed because he didn't get to see that monster too often, it seemed that the situation was serious...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(If you don't know how he looks, check those pictures: <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.teobg.com/carddex/dark_paladin_1.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.teobg.com/carddex/dark_paladi...</a> <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.arlequin.com.mx/foro/photopost/data/500/paladin.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.arlequin.com.mx/foro/photopos...</a> )<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter seeing that, Jaden said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Okay then, Elemental Heroes, Bubbleman, Avian, Burstinatrix and Clayman, combine!!!\"- So it happened, and their fusion created a blinding bright, which kasted a few seconds. After which, a golden figure stepped out, Elemental Hero Electrum, who shone in a bright golden light, which slightly burnt Dark Blake. Enraged, he attacked him by punching, though this time, Electrum could block the blow properly and fight back, engaging in an earth-air fierce combat, for some reason, Dark Blake kept trying to attack from the air (Trait inherited from Blake, explanatios about this later...)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDark Paladin teleported near Dark Blake and slashed his left arm. Dark Blake punched at him with his right hand, but he blocked it with his weapon (They're in mid air currently). At point blank, Dark Paladin fired a powerful green beam that engulfed Dark Blake, and it exploded when it made contact with the ground, creating a medium sized crater. Dark Blake was lying there, and quickly got up, but before doing anything else, he was pushed by an unknown force, and saw that two spears had impaled his body. Then, he was thrown away by this unknown force.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDark Blake healed his wounds with some effort and turned around, to see a man on a horse, wielding two spears, and those were still dripping with blood. It was Gaia, the fierce knight, summoned to the fight by Atem. The horse ran toward Dark Blake, making the ground tremble, and Dark Blake dashed forward, aiming at the knight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, a large fireball from the sky struck him and due to this stopping his dash, was impaled again in the chest by Gaia. Dark Blake took advantage of being close and kicked, but Gaia jumped and the kick broke the horse's neck. Dark Blake jumped too but was hit by a yellow dragon, and Gaia was riding on its back. Dark Blake, annoyed, shot a dark beam at them, which they neutralized with the dragon's flames.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDark Blake descended to the ground, and was surrounded by three opponents...</span></div></div>",

Dark Blake punched him several times in response. Then, Dark Paladin slashed him from behind, and Gaia ended the combo by piercing through his shoulder with one of his spears.

Angels have large amounts of energy, which they can use to either attack or heal. Angels can perform advanced energy usage techniques. The Demons, created by Lucifer, were designed for war from the beginning. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDemons use brute force, and though they can use energy based attacks too, it's uncommon in the lower classes. Also, Demons ignore physical injuries, which makes them natural berserkers, can fight until they are dead. And they need no healing techniques.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucifer invented the Demonic Healing Factor, and currently there are few species who have it...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"So, you could replicate it?\"- Ryan H asked, interested in the subject<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"No. None of the angels have it. Except... Azrael... which means...\"- Lith answered<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"That Blake has gone to a higher demonic degree...\"- Ryan K said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You said something about a few species that have it\"- Karina asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"It was demon exclusive. My father somehow could create his own version, though he couldn not purify completely the evil part. He wrote in one of his many books that Azrael was the Ultimate Archangel, and described that the dark side had to be tamed by Azrael himself. It's said that he wrote several books describing Azrael's design in coplete detail, but they were hidden to prevent the creation of imperfect archangels. Chaos affirmed that Azrael was the only archangel with the right balance of light and darkness, however, there were other beings that reached such powers...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome of the first generation of angels developed dark powers by either absorbing demons' remains and injecting themselves demon blood, though they did it to a measured extent. That behavior was unacceptable and those angels were exiled by Abaddon. They're called the Fallen Lords, because they were former Seraphs and Cherubs. Those angels are rumored to have reached nearly light and darkness balance, but that it never surpasses 45%.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMillenniums later, other angels who heard of this did similar, but they absorbed a lot more of demonic remains, and acquired a different status, being able to switch to a nearly full demonic state. They also were banished from Heaven by Abaddon. They were mostly former angels, though some former Seraphs also went like this. They're called Hell Angels.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe difference between those two unnatural angel breeds is that the Fallen Lords use light and darkness at once, while the Hell Angels switch from light to darkness. Not much is known about the Fallen Lords nor the Hell Angels, I haven't seen one since their banishment. In one of the very few times they were seen fighting, it was said that they had inherited some demon traits, and the healing factor was one of those.\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You mean that Blake is turning into a demon?\"- Joana asked, with tears starting to form in her hazel eyes<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Don't worry. The darkness can't surpass 50% of Blake's soul. He is the only one who has the perfect balance between two opposite forces. It's being a bit more difficult because of him being a human. Even Azrael had some trouble taming his dark side\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"A bit?\"- Claire exclaimed -\"They have already been fighting for more than an hour and there's no progress...\"-</span></div></div>",

Demon Blake...\"- He gave an evil smile, and the real Blake gulped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What..do you want?!!\"- He asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What do I want? Pretty simple. To rule this place. To rule... your body...\"- Demon Blake answered, and Blake tried to stand up, but he put his foot on Blake's chest, with such force that not only kept him down, but also began to crack his ribcage. The Demon Blake began to laugh maniatically again and pressed more, until Blake coughed up blood, then, he sent several meters away with a kick, right in the ribs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"W-W...What for?!!\"- Blake questioned the obviously crazy demon<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"To do many things that you should've done... and enjoy them... Also, there's no sense in me being your servant, I'm more powerful than you!! I'm better than you!! Why do you have to be the one in charge?!!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Se...servant?!!\"- Blake asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Yeah!! That's right!! You've used me as a slave here!!\"- Demon Blake answered, the anger was very obvious<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I didn't even know that you existed...\"- Blake replied, which was answered by Demon Blake with a hard stomp on his ribcage<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"LIAR!!! You've known that I exist from the very moment you were born. You know that I've had to save your neck when someone was kicking your ass. You know that I'm here, and all I get to do is to clean the mess you make...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I don't recall ever asking for your help\"- Blake answered defiantly, and Demon Blake grabbed him by the throat with one hand, and rose him to his face level<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You!! You were practically screaming for help!! And not only that, you were screaming for revenge!! You were wishing to have the power to defeat anyone who you couldn't in your normal condition!! And who was hearing those pleas?! Me!!!! And I had to go in there and kick the guy's ass because YOU COULDN'T!!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake opened his eyes wide at that statement, and said, in a sadder tone<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Can you read my mind?\"- Demon Blake laughed and exclaimed<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Read your mind?! Man, I AM your mind!!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You gotta be kidding me... You can't be my mind...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Well, sort of... I'm the oldest part of your mind... I'm also the one whom you listen the least... I am everything you pretend to not be...\"- Demon Blake answered, with another evil smile. Blake was about to say something but he added<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I am your true self. I am your instincts...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Why do you say that I don't listen to you? You've never tried to say anything!!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Blake, Blake, Blake... That's something you always lacked. People usually let their instincts to guide at least certain moments in their lives, but you never allowed me to. When you fought, you repressed the instinct of killing your enemy...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I don't have to kill any opponent I fight!!\"- Blake interrupted<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Okay, okay, but what about the other areas? Somehow I've kinda guided you to survive, but, you're definitively an idiot in stuff where instincts rule...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Like what?!!\"- Blake asked angrily<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Like some years before... You had a girl drooling for you for three years and you didn't even knew!!! I would've punched you in the face in those moments if you hadn't me tied up and enclosed in the darkest parts of your mind!! And even when surprisingly you realized, you're still a wuss... You should have taken her into bed already!!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA vein popped in Blake's forehead and punched angrily him in the face, with such force that his fist sank a little in Demon Blake's face<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Don't talk like that about her!!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I was talking about you, man, you need to get laid...\"- Another face sinking punch was Blake's reply, whose veins in the forehead had become more visible<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"See? That's my point... you suck...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What I see is that you're not part of me!! I'm not a pervert like you!!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What perversion is in doing it with your girlfriend? You can't say that you don't want to 'cause I know you do...Also, breeding is a natural instinct\"- Blake's answer was to sink his foot in Demon's face<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Your solution to anything is ignoring me... I told you already, I'm your instincts, and that includes, your deepest desires, and, your strongest desires, your deepest lust...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I hate you...\"- Blake answered<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Well, whatever, why don't you just give up and let me rule the place? You know you can't defend your throne anymore. And I'm not in the mood of killing you...\"- Demon Blake said arrogantly<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What are you in the mood for?\"- Blake said, standing up<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I like that girlfriend of yours...\"- Blake growled in anger at that statement<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You know what I'm going to do first?! I'm going to get a french kiss from her and I'm going to touch her huge boobs...And maybe that big butt of hers too...\"- Blake couldn't take it anymore, shouted in anger, dashing toward Demon Blake and punched him with tremendous force, sending him far away, out of sight at least...</span></div></div>",

This is none of your business!!\"- He exclaimed, and Blake muttered<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What?!! Another one?!! One was already bad enough...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, this guy walked with confidence and when Demon Blake tried to attack him, He dodged the punch and blasted him away with another golden beam. He offered his hand to Blake, who hesitated, and refused to accept help from another weirdo. The new guy said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I know what you are thinking. You won't accept help from someone you don't know...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"That's logical... So, who the hell are you?!! How many weirdos live here?!!\"- Blake said, annoyed by all what happened<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I am a part of you. I am all that is contained within your heart... You might say that I'm a mixture of your feelings and your reasoning...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"That other guy said the same...\"- Blake replied, distrusting him<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"No. He said that he was your instincts. That's why he's so reckless and wild. Though he's like a close relative to me. Instincts and Feelings are very close. You might think of him as my older brother.\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Wait, what's the difference?! The Demon said that he was also my supposed desires...\"- Blake said, trying to prove wrong his apparent savior<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"A desire and a feeling are different. To undertand it, instincts are the What, feelings may be the Why...\"- He replied. Blake finally sighed and nodded, understanding, he accepted the hand and stood up with help. Blake was healed by his currently unknown savior. After he was done, Blake asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"But...I'm aware that I've gone dark in the past...that I've used the Demon as my source of power...that I used him heavily to defeat Blaze...Why didn't you lend me your power instead? Weren't you watching too?\"- The new guy nodded and said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You have to call me. Even if I want to help, if it's not your will, I can't help you. The demon has appeared because you call upon your instincts. You have allowed me to help you very few times. Currently, I have only been summoned to battle twice. Your encounter with Blaze two years ago, after you unshrank, and a few days ago, when you got attacked by the clones...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"That was you? But... it felt different... it felt like I was myself... when I go dark, I no longer know what I do or what happens...\"- Blake answered<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Because I'm a little more synchronized with you. But still, it's very rare that you call me. You call him more often because what triggers your desperation is the fear, and the anger, either the wish to kill or the fear of being killed. I've been called when you fight for something, or more specifically, for someone, and you know what I mean...\"- He said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"It is quite difficult to call you... I kinda have to clear my mind and ignore the instincts...\"- Blake said, the other nodded in agreement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You once thought the exact words 'I have to remember what I'm fighting for' That's it. You thought that before summoning me the last time, when the clones...\"- The other said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You haven't answered my question... what's your name?\"- Blake asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Call me Light Blake\"- He answered<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I'll call you Light\"- Blake said, adding<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I'd prefer to not call other guys inside my mind with my name... By the way, since you seem to be good, can you tell me how many others are here? I don't want more surprises\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Weell...there are some other guys, but you'll meet them later. And technically, aren't part of you. You have to learn to work with me so we can defeat your inner dark side...\"- Light B. said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Isn't he a demon?\"- Blake asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"He lied. He looks like a demon and has demonic powers, but his nature is not truly demonic, is more like darkness... He used the name Demon Blake to sound cooler...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"That makes him a jerk\"- Blake said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"He is. Believe me...\"- Blake raised an eyebrow, and Light added -\"You don't want to know...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen they heard an explosion, and Demon Blake dashed toward them, angrily saying<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"So you're siding with him?!! Why does nobody understand that we're better?!! Why the weakest of us must be the leader?!! I won't accept him!!\"- <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Prove it. Defeat us...\"- Light said calmly, while an anime sweatdrop ran down from Blake's head, like thinking 'You have just sentenced us to death. I hate you...'</span></div></div>",

However, Demon Blake kept attacking Blake and ignoring Light, knowing that if he defeated Blake he'd win. Blake kept blocking punches, but even his arms hurt due to Demon's strength.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake was still not able to connect a single hit to him, and the only one who was putting up a fight was Light Blake. Both guys kept trying to hit Demon Blake for several minutes, and Light somehow could get a point blank beam right onto Demon's face, sending him several meters away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"This isn't going anywhere...\"- Blake said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Yeah I know... 2 vs 1 doesn't always work...\"- Light Blake answered, and Demon's voice was heard, who said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Heh!! 2 WEAK vs a strong one won't win. Even if you were 50, I'd still win...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Where did he get all that arrogance from?\"- Blake said, and Light shrugged. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaid that, Blake engaged in a violent exchange of punches and kicks, hitting Demon Blake with all his might, but he blocked each blow. Blake also tried to connect heavy kicks but Demon Blake kept mirroring his moves, blocking Blake's attacks with equals of his own. He was surprised to see Blake's determination, fighting him despite being aware that his enemy was much stronger than him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLight Blake was also surprised and decided to take the chance, charging a powerful beam with both hands. Then he jumped above Blake and his dark side and aimed. Blake swiftly moved away and the beam struck from above, effectively hitting Demon Blake. There was a great explosion, and after the smoke slowly vanished, a more damaged Demon Blake appeared, saying<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Maybe I underestimated you, but you won't last long anyway...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDemon Blake again tried to punch Blake but Light stopped him and received the blow instead, and using the moment to his advantage, he fired two energy balls which exploded at contact. Light Blake flew and kept attacking from above with several energy beams, which made continuous explosions. Even with those explosions, a black beam was fired upward, hitting Light Blake, who fell to the ground with a hard thud, and his clothes were greatly damaged, as well as his body. From the smoke, Demon's silhouette was seen, and after giving a weird smile, dashed toward Blake, who instinctively extended his hand (which casually aimed at Demon Blake's face).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA huge bluish beam demolished the whole place, and an enormous explosion was seen and heard...</span></div></div>",

He's done this so many times that he's even tried to get Blake to keep busy one of his multiple dates. Needless to say, Blake said him to go to hell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Also, he often ran away from Karina, for being a pervert with her, from Claire, for insinuating her crush on Blake or that Joana defeated her (Saying something like \"Joana 2, You 0\". He's actually done that!!) and from Joana, when insinuated what they \"should\" have already done<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone looked the scene with the O___O' face, including the anime sweatdrop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Well... if you don't, Claire might want to tr...\"- Ferdinand said as he noticed not one, but TWO angry girls looking at him<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"It seems that you got a \"Kill Me\" sign on your forehead...\"- Claire said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You're screaming for me to do that already\"- Joana added, and she was angrier because she imagined Claire doing what Anthony said before...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Okay...

Incredibly, he regenerated his arms back,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoana thought that the darkness must have consumed Blake, but Ryan H. patted her shoulder and muttered<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I can feel his soul. He's fighting now. He's fighting himself, and it might be the toughest battle of his life. He hasn't lost yet\"- Those words made Joana smile who tried to think of it like the time Blake was at the hospital....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n5 years before...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSecondary/Junior High, 7th grade...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs it's been said, Blake fought a enormous bully called Ivan, who was a muscled monster. Blake had no chance but he still fought to keep him from hurting Joana. But it hasn't been told what happened afterwards...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fight was basically Ivan thrashing Blake around and beating him up. Blake told Joana to escape though she didn't, and after having lost, Ivan went after Joana, but was stopped by a dark transformed Blake (his mere appearance scared Ivan. He was bleeding, irisless-eyes, which made him look inhuman, the hair rising up and moving, even his skin had a slight grayish tone (The current Dark Blake has a more noticeable grayish tone by the way). He brutally defeated Ivan, and stood for a moment, staring at Joana. Then he fell unconscious...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis friends, Ayrton, Ferdinand, Gustave, Cesar and Anthony went with him and Joana and carried him. They took him to the hospital. Blake was admitted to the hospital and when the doctor called directly Joana, which surprised everyone. The doctor said that he was one of the guys whom Blake's father saved many times back at school. He referred to Blake to \"just as tough as James, if not tougher\". He also was the one who helped James when Blake hadn't been born yet. They had to keep strict surveillance on his mother, who continuously tried to abort Blake. After Joana learned all of that, he asked what happened, he's seen Blake several times when his grandmother was alive, but none of his wounds was a serious as those. She told him that Blake fought an 1.90 mts. muscled mastodon in school. The doctor said that they'd run analysis on him to determine the seriousness of the damage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHours later, he came with the results. The nurses and doctors who worked with him were shocked that the boy was still alive. He had almost every bone broken, his muscles were severely damaged and his organs held internal wounds. It was incredible that he could still breathe. The doctor also brought some blood analysis, and after saying that he did it himself, he showed them that Blake's blood didn't even look human. He told Joana and Blake's friends that he had about 5 times the normal quantity of red blood cells, and that he had over 10,000 white blood cells, when the limit was 7,000. The doctor stated that he did not show those results, but wanted them to know. Then he said that Blake has suffered a lot, and even with such a tough body, his heart is as damaged as the rest of his body. He also said that his blood had nearly 0 of glucose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot even Ayrton did know all what Blake went through solely to be born, let alone his life before school, which none of them knew. His friends stayed with him until visit hour was over, however Joana stayed with Blake all the night, and she did not sleep at all. Joana had never seen Blake like that before, so helpless and vulnerable, completely different to his transformation, that made him look invincible. She rested her head on Blake's chest and fell asleep after several hours. Even Blake's heartbeats were weak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat time, Joana had a nightmare where Alexander and Ivan killed Blake together. Luckily, it was just that, a nightmare. Blake was still unconscious when she woke up. Blake stayed like that for two days, and surprisingly, after that, he gained consciousness and recovered in three days. Joana was surprised, but she had in mind what the doctor had told her, and she had the question: Why? Why is he so different?. 4 years later, she knew the answer, finally...</span></div></div>",

However, Jaden's monsters got weakened by the damage their master was dealt and Dark Blake destroyed them easily. Jaden went unconscious<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAtem's monsters were fighting him at once but Blake still dominated the fight. Then a fireball hit Dark Blake engulfing him in flames. It was Momo Hinamori who decided to intervene. She unseathed her katana (zanpakuto) and charged at him using her flash step technique. Surprisingly to her, her speed was a joke for Dark Blake who dodged every hit and grabbed her sword with his right hand, breaking it by clenching his fist. In that moment, Dark Blake disappeared to avoid a blast from Silent Magician, and appeared behind Silent Swordsman, punching a hole through him and destroying him. Atem felt greater pain but kept fighting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilent Magician and Magician of Chaos exchanged powerful energy blasts with Blake, and the place was filled with explosions. The Ryans, Blake's friends, Jak and Jasmine were watching the scene. Jasmine said, a little worried<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Is that the power he used to fight Nostory and Seth before?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Nope. He was using light power. This is his dark form trying to take over his mind... Blake is fighting in the inside, but it seems he's having difficult there\"- Ryan H. answered<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Is there any way we can help him?\"- Joana asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"...Hmmm...\"- Ryan K. scratched his chin while thinking<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Blake and the magicians were having a fiercer fight. Momo stood up and kept attacking him with her kido (energy blasts which vary on the spell used). Bad news is that Atem's energies were running low due to the damage he had endured, and Momo, who was getting tired due to using kido techniques. Also, her flash step couldn't keep up with Blake's speed. Soon, Blake's energies were overwhelming Atem and Momo's. Blake used a dual energy beam which hit Atem's monsters, though not destroying them, the damage they received weakened them and Atem, who was going pale and muttered<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Maybe Jaden was right... damn it... I should have used the gods...\"- Blake walked near him threateningly, and after destroying his monsters, kicked Atem in the ribs and grabbed him by the neck. Momo attacked him with a kick but it didn't even move him a single inch. She kept hitting him with all her might but Blake was just annoyed, and blasted her away with a dark energy ball from his left hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"This is totally out of control!! Blake will kill them!\"- Jasmine said, and Jak cracked his knuckles saying<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I will have to stop him\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You what?! But...\"- Jasmine exclaimed and Ryan H. added<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Maybe he's strong enough to fight him. Jak, you won't last too long if you do what I think you'll do, are you aware of that?\"- Jak nodded and Ryan K. spoke<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Hey! You don't need to defeat him...\"- Everyone looked at him with the WTF faces and he added<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I've got an idea. If you can weaken Blake enough, we can try to use a seal to restrain his movement. That way, Blake will be able to win the batlle in his inside and also will not be able to hurt anyone else\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Good idea, but, if Blake's losing, restraining his physical body might not help that much\"- Ryan H said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Well, we're gonna think about that later. At least we won't get killed by him\"-</span></div></div>",

Atem and Jaden were about to be blasted out of their misery, but Jak quickly kicked D-Blake away from them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get out of here.\" Jak said. \"I'll fight him.\"<br>\r\n\"Right.\" Atem nodded, and him and Jaden got out of the battlefield.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJak then powered up slowly, and his brown eyes changed to the light green-blue color. He started to be cloaked into the white aura. He soon was Omega Form, and he just waited for D-Blake to arise. Soon enough, D-Blake just rose up, arms folded, floating to the level that Jak was about. \"Ah, Jak...\" D-Blake said. \"Let's do this.\" Jak just nodded, and they both went into battle. Jak and Blake were fighting at lighting fast speeds, exchanging kicks and punches. They were fighting, with equal speed, but not strength. If anything, Jak was blocking more than attacking, but he was being smart by not trying to attack all out, and got being pummeled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJasmine and Joana were watching very closely, as this was probably more important than the other battles. For Joana, Blake was out of control, and for Jasmine, well, she was just hoping that Jak could get out of the battle alive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJak and Blake continued, as the barrage of fury attacks were continued by Blake. Jak broke through with a small explosion wave, and started to get on the offensive. Jak was now getting his hits in. Blake was feeling the hits, and they hurt. Jak then used an energy wave to knock him back. The blast hit, and then as Blake was being knocked back, Jak flew toward him, charging an energy beam in his right hand. Blake was still trying to recover, but by the time he looked up, Jak launched it at point blank range, sending Blake to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJak then landed to the ground, and released a sigh of relief. But his victory was short lived, as Blake was powered up even more. Jak looked in frustration, and decided started to do the same. Jak slowly powered up again, and his muscles slightly got bigger, Jak was going to try and end the madness. Blake then dashed toward Jak, and Jak knew he had to stop Blake with something, and lucky for him, he had an attack prepared for this kind of situation. So Jak let Blake hit him, and he got knocked back. But as Blake was waiting for a response. Jak however, was charging an attack, while he was getting up. There was lighting all around him, and the aura was shining bright this time. Jak had a huge energy wave in his hands, and it was getting bigger. Blake got impatient, and started to dash toward him. \u201cOMEGA BUSTER!\u201d Jak yelled, as he released the beam. Blake\u2019s eyes widened as the energy wave was coming for him. There was nothing he could do to avoid it, and ended up trying to not get the full blunt of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJasmine and Joana looked at each other, and both decided that they were going to the heat of the battle. Meanwhile, Jak looked up, and he was seeing Blake, still standing, but was barely standing. Blake didn\u2019t have proper control of his body, but was slowly gaining it. Jak reverted back to normal, and he was exhausted, and knew that he had very little energy left. Jak sat back, and was hoping that the Ryans or anyone could finish the job.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

When she was about 9 feet from him, he growled with the metallic sounding voice. Joana kept walking and Dark Blake stood in a defensive stance, like a cornered beast. He showed his fangs (canine teeth). Joana was now about 3 feet from him. He stood normally but seemed to be staring at her (one couldn't tell because of his pupil-less eyes). He stepped back but Joana kept getting close. For a brief moment, Blake's hair stopped waving up and fell down to normal position*. Also, his voice stuttered sounding less metallic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*REMEMBER: In Dark state, Blake's hair continuously waves upward like a flame<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack to where we left off... In Blake's soul...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake fell to the ground, exhausted. Demon Blake's lower body was only visible, and soon rebuilt himself, saying annoyed<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Well, I didn't expect that... I underestimated you...\"- Then he looked at Blake, lying down, panting heavily<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I guess not\"- He dashed but Light Blake appeared in front of him and said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Enough!! You can't take over!!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Of course I can, my power grows stronger every time, and you both are worthless weaklings\"- As Demon Blake said that, he engaged in combat against Light Blake, and the power difference was noticeable. Somehow, Blake stood up and said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"This time will be different. I'm no longer fighting solely to survive, I'm fighting to survive so I can protect Joana and defeat Blaze, and YOU won't stop me!!\"- Dark Blake growled in anger and punched away Light Blake, dashing at lightning speed toward Blake. Light Blake smiled and turned into thousands of golden particles, which went toward Blake and were absorbed into his body. Blake heard Light Blake's voice saying<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Finally, you have understood. Now, I shall merge with you. I'm returning you part of your true powers, but you'll have to do the rest. Use your light power to defeat the darkness... but remember, light is not always good, nor darkness always evil...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake smiled and cracked his knuckles, punching Demon Blake in the stomach and fighting again. This time the match was even. They fought using the same moves and most of hits were countered by an equal. Their fight seemed to be endless, and there were explosions all over the place. Also, shockwaves impacted each time they hit each other. However, Demon Blake suddenly went slightly pale (his skin had a grayish tone but not pale) and began to lose, getting hit, not healing, and not being able to dodge attacks. Blake wondered what could cause that sudden weakening but decided to keep on defeating him. Demon Blake recovered and put up a fight again, though  Blake still had the upper hand...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack to reality...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoana put her hand on Blake's face, caressing his right cheek, but soon he stepped back and reacted fiercely, though not attacking Joana. She remembered that when Blake transformed in the past, he never dared to attack her even if he attacked his friends. She wasn't sure why. Blake's father's words echoed in her head \"Only you can save my child. Please take care of him\". She gasped when noticed that Blake's pupils were visible, a transparent grayish tone but they were there, though they disappeared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake roared (metallic-demonic sounding voice again) and grabbed his head, seemingly in pain. He fell to his knees and panted heavily. Joana wanted to say something, when...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Both beared heavy wounds but Demon Blake healed faster. This was slowly giving him the upper hand, though Blake was as brave as always, and kept fighting no mater the pain, he knew he HAD to stop his darkness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter several barrages of punches, Blake stood up and thought 'I have to think...of fhis guy... as Blaze... and I've got to kill him... just like Blaze...' He dashed at inhuman speed and clashed his fist against Demon's. For a brief moment, the fists seemed to have merged, but it didn't last long, as Demon Blake dashed back and screamed in pain. His hand was smoking, and growled in anger at Blake, who was surprised as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"No mercy\"- Demon Blake said as he began to rise his power, shaking the ground and swirling the wind around him. Black lightning bolts flashed around him violently. But after a few seconds, it stopped and Demon Blake looked at his hands, and shouted<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What the hell is going on?!! I'm more powerful than this!!\"- Blake smiled, and his body shone with a blazing golden aura. He dashed at an amazing speed and connected lots pf punches in mere seconds, getting to hit Demon Blake's face, and abdomen repeteadly, to finish the combo with a powerful kick that sent him away, and before he made contact with the rocks he was going to crash into, Blake fired a powerful golden beam from his left hand, and the golden aura vanished. There was a great explosion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake, breathing heavily, said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"At least it's over...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"HEH!!!\"- Was Demon's loud answer. After the smoke faded away, Demon Blake stood, with severe damage, the right half of his face and the right half of his body down to the waist were completely destroyed. He smiled as he regenerated, though it happened very slowly. Blake said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Hmph. It seems that you've reached your limits...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Stupid!! I have no limits!! I am the darkness, I am the power, and soon, I'll rule this place!!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What it has no limits is your arrogance. You said that I've enclosed you for most of my life. Then, I'll make sure to banish you to the darkests of my soul\"- Blake said, to which Demon Blake answered witha violent metallic roar, and they charged toward each other. Blake again glowed in a golden aura and his fist pierced through Demon's fist, cutting his arm cutting it in a half, and bleeding. Demon Blake roared in pain and punched Blake in the face, not even moving him an inch, and he anwered with a powerful punch in the chest that sent him away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake's aura faded again, and walked toward his opponent. He kicked him in the ribs and said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I changed my mind. There's no sense in keeping you.\"- Blake aimed his hand at his damaged enemy, and was about to fire a powerful beam to destroy him, but was stopped by a hand behind him. Blake turned around and saw Powerman<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Powerman, what are you doing here?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I've come to help you, and to prevent you from doing something stupid\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Didn't you hear Lith? She said that you need both light and darkness to defeat Blaze. You can't destroy him while Blaze is still alive...\"- Powerman said, and Blake suddenly fell to his knees, grabbing his own head in seeming pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"The power... It... took over... I... I... Light was right...\"- Blake said, and Powerman raised an eyebrow, saying<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What does that mean? Who's light?\"- Blake stood up, regaining composure, and replied<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Just as the guy you see there, there was a good one. As he is darkness, the good one was light. He helped me, but told me that power was dangerous if not handled properly... He warned me...\"- Powerman stared at him for a moment, and Blake aded<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"The use of power, corrupted me... I... I'm no better than my dark side. I acted just like him. I wanted to kill him in the bloodiest way possible... I wanted to rip his arms apart... I wanted to brun him to ashes with this new power... I'm not the one Lith is looking for. I can't do this\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPowerman sighed, and said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Blake. Maybe I don't know you that much, but I know when I see a bad guy, and you aren't one. By what I've been told, I see that you have a lot more of difficulties than a normal person. You're young. And yet, you have a heavy responsability over your shoulders. I might be wrong, but it seems that you've suffered quite a lot. Rage is a natural part of ourselves. We must control it so we don't hurt the ones we care about, but sometimes, as a glass full of water, it just overflows. Sometimes we can't just help it. It takes a lot to learn to control it\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Thanks\"- Blake said, and shook hands with Powerman<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Why don't you go back to the real world? I think you've had enough of this\"- Powerman said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Errmm... I... I don't know how... I don't even know how I got here in the first place...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Hey!! I'm still here!! This isn't over yet!!\"- Demon Blake shouted angrily. Blake sighed and his golden aura ignited again, quickly, he punched Demon upward and reappeared above him, sending him down with a powerful punch. Demon Blake crashed down like a meteor and created a very large crater.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake flew back to where he was and his aura disappeared as quickly as it had appeared. Powerman said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Let's go\"-</span></div></div>",

Why don't you go back to your room in the Deathray?\"- Lith said, to which Blake answered<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"We can't go like that... I mean...

Joana sat next to him and stared at him. After a few minutes of staring, he said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You look worried. What happened while I was out?\"- Joana sighed and said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"To make it short: Your dark part took over. It became a crazy berserk and attacked everyone. Many of Ryan's friends faced you and had a very violent and difficult fight. Jak and Powerman were the only ones who could put up a fight against it. Until, Jak weakened it by fighting with nearly the same strength...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Wait a minute... He took over?!! I was fighting him inside my soul to prevent that!!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"He must have gained control when you left consciousness\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"He said he was challenging me for the 'Throne'. I should've known he'd lie. I was the one fighting to regain control by what it seems. He also can't be my instincts\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What happened?\"- Joana, genuinely worried, asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Well, while the darkness was wreaking havoc, I found myself in a strange place that turned out to be the insides of my soul. I fought a guy that looks like me when I transform\"- He said and Joana kept looking at him, knowing that there was more, Blake sighed and continued<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Well, the fight was... He was kicking my ass. Until another weird one appeared, claiming to be the light part of me. He fought him and healed me. He wore strange clother by the way. Whatever... We fought together but only could fight evenly against him, and he kept growing stronger. Soon, he overwhelmed us. Somehow, the light one fused with me and gave me new powers, and I used them to fight him. We were even again, but he began to get weaker, I guess I now know why. I almost killed him because he got me very angry, but Powerman appeared and stoped me, and so, I'm back he... Hey!! What are you doing?\"- Blake exclaimed as he felt Joana's hands on his shoulders<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I hate you so much, demon...\"- Blake muttered. Joana's hands glowed in white and she started healing Blake's wounds<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Huh?\"- She asked when heard Blake's murmur<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"It's nothing... Let's just say that my dark side is a jerk\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"A jerk? I thought you'd call him evil\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"He's more of a jerk than of a real evil guy\"- Blake answered,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Why?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You don't want to know\"- Blake said and gasped when he noticed Joana's face very close to his (mere inches from his)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I DO want to know\"- She said softly, Blake gulped and muttered<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Dammit\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"So?\"- She asked, while having both hands on his shoulders (still healing) and her face very close to his,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Ehm... let's just say that if I ever act weird, you can slap me or punch me with all rights\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What do you mean by weird? And why would I slap you?\"- She asked innocently, Blake gulped more and said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"My dark side... he...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"He's a freakin' pervert!!\"- Blake screamed, and panted, saying -\"At last, I said it...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Why is he a pervert?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Why are you asking so many questions? I can ask too, for example, where did you get that healing power?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I'll answer if you answer my question\"-  She said playfully<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"That's not fair\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Everything is fair in love\"- She kissed him, and after that, asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"So, what happened with your dark side?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I told you... he's a jerk. He's a pervert... He... said he wanted to take over my body so he could... whatever... and get away with it\"- Joana was waiting for the complete answer so he said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"He implied that he wanted to... grope you........\"- Blake closed his eyes expecting an angry answer or even a slap or a punch (like when Karina hits Anthony for being a pervert). He slowly opened his eyes and saw Joana, who wasn't even blushing (He had become red as a tomato, more noticeable now that he has white skin). She caressed him softly and said, while blushing<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I wouldn't mind if you did that\"- Blake got even redder and said, with faltering voice<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"But...he...wants t-to do it h-himself... It wouldn't be me... I-It's not like I-I would anyway...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"He's your instincts, isn't he? It means that you really want to do that...\"- Joana said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Please, stop that\"- Joana smiled and said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Well, your healing is done, why don't you sleep for a while?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"That reminds me, you owe me an answer... You made me tell that my dark side is a sick jerk, so now tell me. To my knowledge, you had no powers....\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Lith borrowed me her powers\"- Joana said, and despite lying, Blake didn't notice, and accepted it. Joana asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You don't like me having powers, do you?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"It's not that. The feeling of power makes you confident and cocky. A strong willpower is needed to handle a great power... just, don't get yourself killed...\"- Blake said, and Joana hugged him, saying<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I won't get killed if you are with me...\"-</span></div></div>",

She asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Are you ok?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Just can't sleep...\"- Blake answered. Joana remembered that since she moved with him 2 years ago, She always fell asleep before Blake, and the few times she didn't, Blake hardly slept. She never asked him about that but once Karina told her that he suffered insomnia. She knew it because once Blake had told her himself. Also, the stressful life he's had doesn't help either. Joana spoke to him<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Blake...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What is it?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Why aren't you sleeping?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Why aren't you?\"- He answered<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I wanted to make sure you rest\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Well... I simply can't sleep. It's natural. Since I was a kid I just can't sleep most of time\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"It's not natural. You should sleep with no problem\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"It's been like this since I was 5, there's nothing to do...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Why you never told me?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"*Sigh* I didn't think it was something important to tell... And there's nothing you can do to help anyway, as I said, I've been like this since I can remember\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoana remained thoughtful for a moment. She knew that Blake's insomnia had to have a cause, and a remedy. She wondered, and reviewed many things she knew about Blake. The most recurring terms were the death of his father, his loneliness, Blaze... She thought that there might be no answer, however, she reviewed in her ind again and wondered what could it be. After a while, she had an idea<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Hey Blake\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"How about entering your original body for a while?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Did you forget that it's shrunk?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Yeah I know, but it might help you\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I had my old body before and still couldn't sleep\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Pleeease\"- She said sweetly, and Blake sighed<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Okay, where is it?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Here\"- Joana opened a drawer and showed Blake's tiny body surrounded by a cian sphere. She said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I know that you'd say 'Is that how you keep my old body?!' So I put this barrier around it, you can't tell me that it's not safe or that it's gathering dust\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Yeah, yeah, whatever...\"- Blake stared at his former body, and after the barries vanished, he extended his hand and touched it. Immediately, Blake became golden ghost-like energy and entered the shrunk body. Blake opened his eyes and looked at the now giant to him Joana. He said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I have bad memories about this size\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Awww...\"- Joana cooed and brought him near her hazel eyes<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I missed you\"- She said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"But I wasn't gone\"- Blake relied<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"No silly, I missed you like this. This is the Blake I know. I like your black eyes better than the green ones...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Well, I have to admit that this body feels better, maybe because this is my real one. However, I still can't sleep.\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoana didn't reply, but put him in her arms, and cushioned with her chest. Blake asked, confused<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What are you doing?!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You don't know?!\"- Joana was surprised, then she asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Have you ever been lulled?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Nope...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Do you know what is it?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Not really... I only know that has to do something with babies\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"How did you sleep when you were one?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"My father once said that I slept by my own\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Usually, babies are lulled so they can sleep\"- She said as she hugged Blake a little tighter<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"If mothers do that, then you can understand why I never...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Awwwww, you poor little thing\"- Joana hugged him and softly rocked him. The motion began to make effect and Blake yawned, then, he heard her singing some old Spanish lullaby, but he was too tired to hear it whole, and soon he was sleeping, snuggling against Joana's large breasts. She smiled and thought<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'James was right. Blake needs a lot of affection no matter how old he is.' She laid back with Blake on her chest and the room was illuminated in a strange, unnatural way. Everything had a slight golden tint, and she heard a voice inside her head<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Joana. No matter what you do, don't lose the physical contact with Blake while he's sleeping\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What?\"- She answered in her thought<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Whenever Blake sleeps, you must not lose the physical contact with him. Your powers are greater than you think, and you're the only one who can protect him\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Protect him? From what?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Many things. Just keep that on mind\"- The voice said as the golden light vanished as quietly as it appeared. She already knew that voice, and in her thought, she said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I will, James. Thanks for trusting me. I won't let anything happen to your son...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoana, seeing that maybe Blake would slip if she fell asleep, decided to put him in her cleavage. Done that, she slept as well... </span></div></div>",

This is my secret from my family and only another knew about, but we figured out the what really happened. That person is my friend, ryan shinonome because we have a special bond like felix and his dragon friend, but my brother didn't really kill our parents and we are on a mission. Kagome is smarter to find this video with the game data and I must return to the main subject of the video. Ray and kari must be with her along with chiharu and our team. On that day, my brother killed clones of our parents so he won't feel the guilt that he has been feeling till we found our sister or more like I found her since I battled her and they went into hiding from us and the rest of the world. As I working at my job, I heard how I was like my father and he must be proud of me for following in his footsteps.

Speaking of that, the monsters that are coming back to be killed again is having someone bringing them back like me using the resurrection apple on my friends. Two people will be needed to open the door in the basement and one person will need to go into get whatever is inside. Today is the day where our powers go berserk, but not anymore since they started evolving and there must be more stories to tell like the final battle in the main part of the book. Our parents have heard something to have clones in their place and wanted brother to kill them, but 'time will tell' and 'time heals all wounds' or so they say. We took a deeper look into the day and found a bomb in the famliy car under the hood, but he used magic to get some prints off the bomb and we worked them through my computer while doing some other things. After we moved our different ways, he started to forget about it and I let it run in my mind..\"- she paused it again<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Fix the scar on blake's face.\"- ur ryan said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Why would he said that?\"- blake asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Maybe he saying that you have no sin and agrees that you are no murderer.\"- joana said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Well... this body hasn't it...\"- Blake said, scratching the back of his head<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Back to the video.\"- claire said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Speaking of sin, blood will be our hands again and maybe more this time. On the day that ryan and I asked forgiveness for spilling blood on our hands from our job, the demoness came and ryan dealt with her both times. We have the names of the people who planted the bomb and we are going to give them a one ticket to hell then find our parents at the old house where it began for me and my brother. In order to kill monsters, we have to become them ourselves and that plan worked. Everyone has a beast inside them waiting to come out of its cage and our cages are wbout to stop working till the final battle. There must be much more to be explained, but as they say 'time is not on my side' so I will have leave this like the way it is and go start the mission with ryan's help. Hopefully we can be stopped from becoming our most hated enemies by our friends or families and we will continue the training with our students, but they know us too well or do they?\"- was said as the video was finished<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Their evil twins.\"- ur ryan said as kagome nodded<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Chiharu, we have to stop them now and bring blake and jak with us.\"- kagome said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Right and ur ryan with kizaki will have to open the door in the basement of the house.\"- chiharu said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What about us?\"- joana asked with jasmine<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Don't worry we will keep them alive so they will fight with you to destroy blaze and the others.\"- kagome said with a smile</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Back to Blake and the others...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe wondered what kind of powers Lith gave Joana. So he decided to put Tabitha against Karina and test Joana's abilities himself. He also had in mind that Joana complained about him never teaching her to fight. And so, he was with Joana, and said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Ok, everything is ready. Joana, I don't know what kind of powers you have, but I want you to fight with all your power.\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Are you sure?\"- Joana said, not totally sure of the limits of her own strength<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Don't worry. I want to see what kind of powers Lith gave you...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'If you knew...' Joana thought. And stood in a fighting stance. She didn't like that Blake was at his normal state. She also felt that Blake would go easy on her just like before. She decided that she could heal him and herself back, so she had no reasons to worry about. She dashed toward Blake and hit him. She was surprised that Blake didn't react and crashed against some rocks. She immediately ran to his side and asked worried<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Blake!! What happened? Are you alright?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stood up and brushed off the dust, he had an O.O face and slowly said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"How... how did you that?!...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"We were supposed to train were'nt we?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You just got me off-guard... Let's continue...\"- He said, though he was now thinking that he might have underestimated his grilfriend a little too much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe again tried to attack him but this time, Blake dodged her. He was surpsied again by her reaction speed. Soon, she was hitting him again and all he did was to block her blows. His arms ached a little. He wasn't fighting seriously and was overwhelmed. Joana stopped a moment and pouted<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You aren't fighting me... Be serious Blake!!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I... I'm sorry... I didn't know how strong you had become\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What DOES that MEAN?\"- Joana knew that he underestimated her, and it annoyed her because it reminded her when she was told that Blake kept her from fighting because she was weak. She knew that Blake didn't believe that, he just wanted her out of problems, but now he needs all possible help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I always fight easy to calculate my opponent's level. I even did that when fighting Blaze, so I could determine how much power he was using... bad thing that he wasn't fighting serious either... ok then... I'll fight you seriously...\"- Blake said after vanishing and reappearing to hit her. Though she dodged him. Blake connected several punches and kicks but all of those were blocked by Joana.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n[SOME MINUTES AGO...]<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFerdinand and the rest of the guys were watching Blake's fight. He walked to Ayrton and saw that he was watching Tabitha and Karina's fight. They were pretty even though Tabitha had her enhanced senses as an advantage over Karina. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of them, here is a bit of info about them: Karina had been the fastest fighter until Blake's encounter with Blaze, and his consequent training to face him again. When Blake was limited to human abilities, Karina was faster than him. While Blake was shrunk, she was the strongest human fighter who confronted Blaze (arguably, because Alexander once fought her, Ferdinand, Ayrton and Anthony AT ONCE, and dominated the fight), and despite having only normal human abilities she was the only one who could keep standing until Blake's arrival, two years ago. So, she has lots of skill, and kicks are her specialty. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnthony is her most usual punching bag. Despite being strong, Blake, when she asked him about training, he replied that she was strong enugh to defend herself. In difference of Joana, Blake rarely helped out Karina in a one on one fight. However, if she was against more, or the guys were dangerous, Blake and her would fight them together (Another difference with Joana... When he appeared, he fought the guys alone)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTabitha, on the other side, had been a normal cat her whole life. Though she and Max faced some animals like rats (which can put up a fight against even dogs, and are quite brave), skunks, foxes (Rocky hates them) and scorpions, besides others. Also, stray cats and dogs that tried to steal their food. Tabitha excels at hunting, and is far better than Max. She was also the fastest pet. Now that she is an anthro, her senses have gotten a great boost, and her speed surpasses even Karina's and Blake's. Her attack method is with her very sharp claws (Though she can't use them in her fight against Karina)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving greater speed, reflexes, and jumping abilities, her only drawback was the stamina. She had those abilities with practically a normal person's stamina, which decreases drastically the time she can fight seriously (Felines have low stamina... seriously, not even cougars or lions can fight for too long. Proven fact). Her training had been focued on enhancing her stamina and increasing her power. Currently, she can move faster than Karina (Due to her feline nature, Tabitha found easier to reach speeds above what the human eye can see) but her punches alone are not as strong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAyrton was watching the fight. He never imagined that his girlfriend would end up fighting Blake's cat. Ferdinand spoke<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Those girls are pretty even, huh?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"My girl is stronger\"- Ayrton said confidently, and Ferdinand said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Your girl is facing a cat... Imagine... the same speed, the same powers... and cat's senses...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Ok... maybe Tabitha has a chance...\"- Ayrton said, still watching<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Hey, let's see Blake's fight. He's fighting Joana right now\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"No thanks...Hey, BLAKE IS WHAT?!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Follow me\"- Ferdinand said as he and Ayrton ran to a confortable place to watch Blake and Joana fighting. Gustave had some bills in his hand, Caesar was sitting and had a large bowl of popcorn. Anthony was bringing 5 sodas, and Gustave said to Ferdinand<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"So, what does he think?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What do I think about what?\"- Ayrton asked, and Caesar replied<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"On who is your money? I bet 10 bucks on Blake\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I'm betting 15 on Blake\"- Gustave said. Ayrton stared at Anthony who replied<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I bet 10 on Joana...\"- Everyone had the WTF face and he said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"She's sexy...\"- To which Ayrton replied<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"If Blake was here you'd be running and screaming like a girl\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Hey!! I just said that she's sexy... I didn't say anything about her wavy brown hair... her sey figure, and her two huge...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone stared at Anthony and he said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"qualities... \"- Ayrton put his hand on his face and then he said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I'd bet on Blake, but I don't know... Blake might underestimate her... Ah what the hell, 10 on Blake\"- Ayrton said, then he asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"On whom are you betting, F?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I haven't decided... But you're right... Blake might get too confident... I'm not sure how strong Joana as become but she has some chances of beating him... So... I'll bet...\"- He began searching in his pockets, and after taking out lots of fluff, he took out some bills and said</span></div></div>",

That was the most awesome kickass moment in 7th grade!! Joana beat that mastodon with a single punch...\"- Caesar said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I'd say that it wasn't too ladylike... but what the ehll?! That rocked!! And she did it 'Because she was protecting her sooo oved Blakie...' \"- He said the last phrase with a fake girly-like twee tone<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\" 'Blakie'? You're lucky that Blake is there fighting. If he was here he'd have shoved your own fist in your throat...\"- Ayrton said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Well, back to our topic. I proved my point. Joana IS strong\"- Ferdinand said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I'd doubt that she'd dare to hurt him...\"- Gustave said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Well, our bets are set, so, let's watch...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>To Where we left off... </b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake disappeared again and reappeared to hit Joana, she barely dodged his fist and connected a powerful knee hit. Blake took that chance and could punch her in the face. Both dashed away at high speed. Joana then bengan firing lots of energy blasts, and Blake ran toward her, dodging every one of them. Joana used her arms to protect herself when Blake was almost in front of her, expecting to block Blake's hit. She felt nothing and when she opened her eyes, she heard Blake's voice<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Never close your eyes in a fight\"- Then she felt Blake kicking her from behind, sending her several meters away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe got up and saw Blake standing in front of her, he said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You aren't fighting seriously either... If you want me to be serious, you have to be serious too\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoana said nothing. But decided to do her best. She didn't like too much the idea of fighting Blake, but she knew that the Ryans were right. Blake also didn't agree with involving her into his fights, but this should help him with that. Also, Blaze's threat wasn't one to be underestimated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Blake has to win. He has lots of more experience fighting... Joana... ermm...\"- Gustave was saying<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I don't know... did you watch the first moments? Blake couldn't see her coming...\"- Ferdinand said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"She still lacks the skill, she's almost totally untrained... I mean, beofre these days, she knew nothing about fighting...\"- Caesar said and they heard a known voice saying<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Not exactly...\"- Karina had just come, with Tabitha. Karina continued<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I've taught her some moves back at 7th grade and onward\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"So, you think that she's gonna win?\"- Ayrton asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I don't know... Blake's tough too...\"- She replied<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What does your machine thing say about them?\"- Anthony asked, and she checked it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt read: <b>Blake's current power 1,850</b>. <b>Joana's current power 5,000</b>. Karina was surprised at this result, she would have never figured out that Joana had become that strong. She couldn't believe that Joana had become nearly three times as strong as Blake or herself in such a short time. She decided to keep this to herself by now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What did it say?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Uhh... let's not ruin the fun...\"- She evaded, and it seemed to work, though Ayrton noticed her hesitation<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake again stood ready to fight, this time, he would fight as he would fight Blaze. He dashed, disappearing repeatedly to confuse Joana, and he succeeded. He connected a powerful punch right in her stomach... but... there was no reaction... She didn't move a single inch... nor was feeling pain... Blake was totally surprised...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What the...?!!\"- Gustave shouted<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"How the hell is that possible?!!\"- Caesar said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I told you. Everyone has underestimated her\"- Ferdinand said, regaining the hope to win the bet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"No way!! Not even Blaze is that strong... well... at least the times we've seen him fighting...\"- Gustave replied<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Blake has said thousands of times that Blaze's true power is unknown... Let's remember: 2 years ago, he fought above Blake's level. They kepy an even fight but he was obviously stronger. Blake had nothing of the superstrength nor super speed stuff. Time later. When he fought him for the second time, he still had not superpowers but could beat him\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What's your point?\"- Gustave asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Let me finish. Two years later, Blake developed the powers you saw. If Blaze's level was the same as of two years, then, Blake would have kicked his ass. But their fight was even. And Blaze again ended up moping the floor with Blake, until he went dark...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"So...?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Blaze shows the level he wants us to see. He's fought Blake and everytime they seem to be even...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Maybe he just trained to be at Blake's level...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Nope... In their first fight, it was obvious that Blaze was stronger. He didn't break a sweat to beat both me and Blake. And... in their recent fights, he still seemed to be going easy. Blake only gave him a run for his money when transformed, and he could still beat Blake's dark state\"- She answered, and almost everyone agreed. However, Unknown to her, Tabitha had seen the results due to her superior senses, and thought<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'There's too much difference... Master shouldn't be fighting her...'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake dashed back after realizing that his attack was totally harmless to his girlfriend. Seeing that she had a worried face, he said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Worry later. Now we need to do this...\"- He said as he grabbed his left wrist with his right hand, aiming his left open hand to Joana. Blake started to charge a bluish white energy ball, and fired. It was larger than everyone expected and Joana didn't move. She simply deflected it with one hand. Again, everyone, including Blake, had a WTF face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Hey!! Take this seriously!! You can't be that confident in a real fight!!\"- Blake shouted, slightly angered both by the fact that Joana had deflected his energy with such ease, and that she seemed to be stronger than him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake dashed again and engaged in close combat against her. Despite the great difference between their powers, Joana indeed lacked skill compared to Blake, and he was able to connect several hits. However, he didn't deal any damage besides some minor scratches. Joana after getting hit could connect a powerful punch to Blake that sent him a lot of meters away.</span></div></div>",

Though none of the guys nor Karina noticed it neither. She clearly had realized that Blake had received more damage in that punch than expected. He said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Heh... I didn't expect this... I didn't expect that I'd need to transform...\"- As he said that, she wind began to swirl violently around him, and golden lightning bolts flashed around him. His hair rose up and his eyes changed to a shining golden. He immediately dashed and hit Joana, this time, sending her away at least ten meters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKarina checked her readings. Blake's power: 3,700. Joana's power: 5,000. Blake had effectively duplicated his power, but it wasn't enough to match Joana properly. She still kept it to herself despite Tabitha also viewed the results, unknown to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake knew that close combat wasn't Joana's strong point so he decided to exploit it (the idea: enhance Joana's capabilities, though at this point, there's some pride involved). He kept attacking with fists and kicks and Joana hadn't much chances of attacking because she had to block. When she was about to counter him, he used a somersault, landing right behind her, and when she turned around, Blake fired a golden ball right into her chest. The explosion confused her and in the smoke, she could only see silhouettes, which she attacked. But none of them was the real Blake. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, all of sudden, a giant golden beam struck her from above. The explosion was enormous. This time, Joana had received a fair amount of damage. She looked up but nobody was there, and when she lowered her look, it was too late. Blake was firing a barrage of golden beams with his left hand (left wrist grabbed by his right hand. <b>This is one of Blake's most common positions to fire energy</b>)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEach beam hit its target and created multiple explosions. After some minutes Blake stopped firing and stood in a fighting stance. He waited for the smoke to vanish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, the guys were telling Ferdinand and Anthony that they had wasted their money. Tabitha heard Blake's heartbeats from there, and she knew that Blake was fighting at his best, though he might be efforting a little too much. By what she saw in Karina's radar, She knew that Blake was facing a stronger opponent than Blaze. <b>(She had heard, as a cat, Blake and his friends' discussion about their fight with Blaze, right after it happened. She heard that Blaze's power was roughly above 3,000 in that combat)</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the smoke vanished, Joana was standing normally, and still had a worried expression. She said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Blake... are you ok? You shouldn't effort too much, you just recovered a few days ago...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I haven't said anything. Let's keep this. It's important that we train so I can defeat Blaze...\"- <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake didn't note that he said \"I\" in his last phrase. Joana thought that what she had done with her giantess game hadn't worked fully because Blake was too focused on beating Blaze AGAIN. She knew that since his first encounter, Blake has pushed himself over the limits everytime, trying to be stronger to defeat him. What worried her is that Blake was pushing himself too much and specially after severe damage and exhaustion. Also, that Blake was able to do anything even at the cost of his own health <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>(Like protecting her or his friends, working, training, fighting Blaze and other enemies before. He didn't even sleep well, though partially is because of his insomnia. And if you ask, Blake studies, but he works on his own by repairing computers and many other electrical machines. He has never depended directly on Joana's money nor anyone's except his father's and Robin's)</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I'm alright, happy? Now let's continue\"- Blake said kinda disdaining Joana's worries. He prepared to fire another barrage of golden beams but this time, Joana countered them with her own white energy balls. Blake realized that long range attacks weren't his strong point (As Joana is just starting to learn to fight, Blake is starting to manipulate energy. Joana got that ability \"for free\" because it was unlocked when Lith restored her powers. <b>REMEMBER: Blake doesn't know that Joana's powers are her own, he thinks that Lith borrowed her powers to Joana)</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Hey, isn't it weird that Joana hasn't used her size changing ability?\"- Gustave asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Maybe she doesn't need it\"- Ferdinand said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"She doesn't need anything to DOMINATE Blake!! Yeah!!\"- Anthony said, emphasizing the word dominate. The guys laughed but not for too long because Karina landed her fist on his face. She said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Keep your perverted toughts to yourself...\"- He remained silent, but kept staring at her legs and thigs, and she said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Forget about it. DON'T EVEN THINK YOUR PERVERTED STUFF!!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack to the fight...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake was trying to get close, but he had either to deflect energy blasts, take them, or counter them with his own energy attacks. Joana was using a lot of energy attacks at once and didn't seem to be such an effort, while Blake was slowly growing tired. Blake did a risky move taking one direct energy ball so he could get close enough to hand combat. It worked, and this time, he glowed in his flaming golden aura and punched Joana with great strength. Joana blocked most of the hits but her arms ached heavily. When she tried to attack Blake dodged it and kicked her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKarina heard a beep in her machine and Blake's power had grown to 7,200. She heard a lots of beeps as the fight progressed and she noticed that Blake's power fluctuated from 3,700 to 7,200. Then she found the pattern: Blake's power quickly rose to 7,200 RIGHT BEFORE hitting Joana, and quickly decreased until he would attack again. She also noticed that Blake's aura continuously turned off and on, changing with his power level. She was intrigued because she had never seen that technique before. She also recognized that Blake doubled his current power, which means that he is able to multiply his power x4.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake kept like that for about 15 minutes, and then, he and Joana were  going to punch each other in the face, Blake dodged Joana's fist and his connected. What happened was something that Blake didn't expect...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Blake almost missed the hit, but bad thing, is that his fist slashed Joana's cheek, drawing blood. Since all of that happened in mere seconds, Blake stopped his dash and returned to his normal state. He said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I think we better stop here... I'll ask the Ryans to heal that wound...\"- Blake said, though he wasn't sure what would be Joana's reaction, either crying, becoming angry... maybe even hating him. He couldn't tell. Joana turned around and said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You said that we had to do it as in a real fight...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I meant to fight seriously... we're not intended to kill each other...\"- He replied and Joana's right hand glowed. She put her hand in front of her cheek and her wound was immediately closed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Did you forget that I have healing powers?\"- Joana asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"In a real fight it'd be too unpracticalto heal each wound. You'd use too much energy for that. You should only heal the severe wounds. Keep that in mind.\"- Blake transformed again, implying that he would continue to fight. He thought to himself 'Dammit... I forgot... Now if I ever deal another wound, she'll be able to heal it... I'll be the one who will grow tired and damaged because I have no healing ability of my own...'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake had no time for further thoughts because Joana had started to fire several energy beams at him. At least, Blake was fast enough to dodge most of them. He again glowed in the golden aura and dashed and an speed that surprised everyone. Blake appeared behind and dashed past her. She was about to turn around when immediately felt lots of punches all of sudden, and Blake was just standing a few meters in front of her. She remembered<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'God speed... That's what Blaze called it... He used it on Blake not too long ago... Is it possible? Blake learned a skill from Blaze?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned around but Blake had already disappeared. Blake fired a golden beam at her, and started firing lots of golden energy balls. She blocked them with her own attacks and then she noticed Blake's power increasing again. He glowed in that flame-like golden aura when it happened, and Blake became faster and stronger. He moved so fast that she couldn't see what he was doing, nor react to it. When Blake hit her, she felt that his punches and kicks were stronger than before, but the last hits weakened, as Blake's aura disappeared. He dashed back and kept with energy balls and beams.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoana also noticed the strain over his body. Somehow, Blake looked to be getting worn out. She didn't imagine how strong had herself become when Lith restored her powers. Now she realized that she surpassed Blake's abilities to the extent that Blake had to force himself in order to match her. She thought about going easy but she knew that Blake would realize. So she decided to keep the fight<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake engaged in close combat again, connecting fists and kicks, though this time, he was breathing heavily. When he was about to connect a punch, Joana grabbed his hand, but didn't see that Blake had a energy ball charged in his other hand, and he fired it. The explosion was not that big, but sent both of them away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoana fired a powerful white beam and Blake had no time to counter it. So, he tried to stop it with his hands. The force of the impact was tremendous and the beam was pushing Blake backward, leaving deep marks in the ground. Blake was stopping it with all his might but his hands were still slowly sinking into the energy. It was such an effort that Blake's hands began to bleed. He didn't stop and instead, glowed in the golden aura again. As soon as he did so, he began to push forward the beam. He slowly walked forward, pushing the beam. It was an impressive view for his friends. Karina noticed that Blake was keeping the 7,200 power for a longer time, so he can push back the beam.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Blake's energies are starting to run low, and he got pushed back a bit by the beam. He regained his strength and kept pushing. Shortening the distance. Joana had fired the beam from about 60 feet, and Blake had halved the distance. Then, his bleeding hands glowed and Blake shot a powerful golden beam that engulfed Joana's. The beam was immense and it totally engulfed Joana as well. The explosion was huge, and even thunderbolts flashed around it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake reverted back to his normal state involuntarily. He was breathing very heavily. He saw how the smoke vanished, and Joana was standing... She was very damaged but not as much as Blake expected. He immediately glowed in the aura and dashed toward her and tried to connect a punch, but Joana countered with her own fist. The force of the shock sank a large portion of the ground around them. But, blood shed from Blake's fist, and the aura disappeared. Blake dashed back, holding his right hand in pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTabitha immediately stood and everyone noticed<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Hey Tabby, what's wrong?\"- Ferdinand asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"M...Master... He... his hand... is broken...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What?!\"- Everyone exclaimed<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I could hear how his bones shattered... His hand is broken, look at him... his hand is bleeding\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Blake... what happened...?\"- Joana asked, now truly worried<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Argh...it's nothing... just... nothing to worry about... we have to keep this... I'm not done yet...\"- Blake replied. He couldn't hide the pain in his voice, but his tenacity amazed Joana. She knew that Blake would never give up on anything, but maybe this was too much. She said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Let me heal your arm then...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"If this was a real fight, you couldn't be healing your opponent after you deal damage to him...\"- Blake said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Yeah, but this is not a real fight\"- Joana answered<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn that moment, Blake heard his dark part's voice<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I think I can help you out\"- He said, with that characteristic metallic voice of his<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Don't even think about it... There's no way I'm letting you to take over...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Geez... just because once I tried...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You will keep trying, you've said so. You aren't trustworthy...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Listen. I wouldn't be here offering you my help if I hadn't any reason, would I?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Your reason is because you want to take over me again...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I've come to save you many times without complaining, since you were a child...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"...I've said NO!! I don't need you to win a fight against my own girlfriend...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Your body doesn't say so...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What?!!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Your body is badly damaged... your muscles are exhausted, your hand is broken, and add the straining you've put to it... Man, I hate this cheap thing. I'd prefer the old body if it wasn't because you had me enclosed there\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"And it was good that you were!! I don't like that you stick your nose in my life!!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Listen...I simply don't want you to be beaten like this... I don't want you to have your ass kicked by your own girlfriend...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I don't care... if she wins, then I need more training...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Well then, at least make it an even fight...\"- Demon Blake said, and before he continued, Blake replied</span></div></div>",

He sounded with real authority, as the Master of his own inner world... his soul...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wind began to swirl around Blake, roaring violently and forming a tornado. Joana shouted<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Blake!! We better stop this!! I can't force you to fight being wounded...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, lightning bolts flashed around the tornado and powerful thunders were heard. Suddenly, Joana shuddered. She sensed something strange. The wind stopped swirling around Blake and after the dust settled down, she gasped. Before her, Blake was standing, but, this time... looking different. He ALMOST looked normal but his skin had a very slight grayish tone. Half of his face had an iris-less eye, and the hair looked different. He also seemed to be taller (Blake was already tall). Blake finally said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Wounded? You mean this?\"- He showed his bleeding hand, the blood was going back to its place and the wound closed by itself. His voice sounded metallic though not as much as Demon Blake's voice<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Dark Blake!!\"- Joana shouted<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"No, it's not him... It's me...\"- Blake said, and Joana noticed that his right eye was still golden<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What happened to you?!!\"- Joana was about to cry<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Don't cry. I just let my inner darkness to lend me a hand...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Blake...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Now that we can both heal ourselves, let's continue...\"- Blake said. Joana didn't like that Blake was using darkness... even when the Ryans said that he needed to master it. Joana believes that Blake is not ready yet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoana grudginly agreed to fight, though she was also growing tired. She was surprised that Blake was fighting at her level, though this time without strain. She kept shooting energy attacks and discovered that when her light ball hit Blake's left shoulder, it showed severe burning. But it healed back immediately. Blake shot a golden energy ball at her, which she dodged by dashing aside. Now that she had seen him from a closer view, she realized that Blake was slightly taller and bulkier than before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she looked at her left, Blake was there, and was about to punch her. She stopped his left hand. She felt like burning, and noticed the black glow in Blake's fist. She released it and got more punches from Blake. She countered with kicks, but Blake delivered a powerful punch that sent her away against large rocks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe saw how Blake's golden aura appeared but it shone weirdly, flashing from golden to black and silver... it quickly faded away, and Blake fell down. He heard in his head<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Stupid!! You can't use the aura in this state!!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You should have told me...\"- Blake said to him in his mind. In real world, he coughed and breathed heavily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Your energy is running low... And with the limitations you have imposed me, I can't replenish your energy too quick... So, don't use much light based techniques for a while, okay?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I guess so...\"- Blake replied and stood up. His wounds were slowly healing. In this state, dark's regenrating ability couldn't match Joana's healing powers. but he noticed that Joana was not healing any wound except the slash on her cheek caused by his fist. She looked at him with sadness. He said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Heal your wounds... I let darkness to lend me some power so I could get its regenerating ability...\"- Joana knew he was right, and did so. Though healing all the heavy damage she had received used up a lot of energy, plus, she used a lot more of energy in long ranged energy attacks because that was her strong point. Still, her energy reserves were larger than Blake's (She lacks the self-replenishing trait from darkness, though)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so, they fought again. Joana was now the one tired, while Blake couldn't fight properly either because his internal energy was replenishing very slowly. However, Blake now was relying on darkness' powers and limited traits, an idea that he didn't like too much. He attacked using black energy balls and beams, at a slower rate than before. Both of them, Joana and Blake, were really worn out*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake finally reverted to his normal state and said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Enough...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoana simply smiled and wa about to hug Blake, when he said coldly<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"If you don't mind, I'd like to sleep...\"- He walked toward his friends and the guys, and heard them<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Blake won!! So, say goodbye to your 20 bucks F!!\"- Gustave said, and Ferdinand grudginly handed over the bills.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I'd like a reconsideration. Joana practically was moping the floor with h...\"- He stopped when he noticed Blake, who just grunted, and quickly snatched the bills from Gustave, saying<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Nobody won this fight. I was about training, not about proving who was stronger\"- He walked away toward his (and Joana's) room, but after 4 or 5 steps, he collapsed. Ferdinand immediately snatched the bills from everyone and said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I KNEW IT!! Joana WON!! Whooohooo!!\"- Everyone else went with Blake, and Karina said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You're such a greedy...\"- <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJasmine and Jak happened to walk by there and saw what happened. He asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What happened?\"- Then he looked at him and at Joana<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Whoah!! You sure are wild, huh? But maybe you should leave that stuff for your room...\"- He joked. Joana laughed and said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"We were training... I think Blake kinda overdid it\"- Jak took him to his room. Joana asked to talk alone with Jasmine and they left the group<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What's up?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I think Blake is too concentrated on Blaze again... What should I do?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Hmm... By how things are... Maybe you should go there, heal his wounds and spend the rest of the day with him. I mean, I think he's already completed his day...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Okay. Thanks...\"- Joana left, a bit amazed that a younger girl was giving her advice on her relationship...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><font class=\"size2\" style=\"\"><br>\r\n*Joana is fighting at a higher level than Blaze himself. Well, higher than Blake has consciously fought. While their first fight (in this story, two years after their true fist encounter) was kept even and they were roughly at 3,000's level. It's understandable that Joana makes a more difficult challenge. Even when Blake's power has gone above 10,000 (both in the quasi-fused state, and when darkness almost took completely over him) that doesn't count as Blake is not fighting consciously nor developing skill. The achievement today, if it wasn't obvious, was that he partially controlled darkness. Grudginly, I may add, from both parts, Blake and his inner darkness.</font></b></span></div></div>",

I'd like to see how much you can resist if your GF was set in seductive mode...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Believe me, there's no such thing as Joana's seductive mode...\"- Blake answered<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"WHAT?!!\"- Joana exclaimed, with a vein popped in her forehead<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Now at the count of 3... ah screw that, just RUN!!\"- Blake said as he and Jak quickly transformed to Light and Omega forms respectively, and started to run. Jak immediately flew and Blake kept air dashing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"WHY...*pant* THE HELL...*pant* DIDN'T YOU *pant*... TELL ME THAT THAT WAS YOUR PLAN!!!\"- Jak shouted<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Because if I had told you you wouldn't go along and you'd probably end screwing up us\"- Blake said, while dashing in air<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"If they catch us we'll be in deep trouble man\"- Jak said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"That if they EVER catch us...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Umm Blake... aren't you underestimating them again are you?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Of course not!! Now I'm perfectly aware of what those girls are capable of... that's why I came up with this plan. In real world, they can't disable our powers like they did in our dream... Ain't I a genius?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Well... that was smart... but... aren't the girls as fast as we are?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Maybe, but now we're shrunk we're physicalle lighter... so... we MUST be faster than in normal size\"- When Blake said that, Jak looked back and poked Blake, saying<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Uhh... Blake... the girls...aren't...following us...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What?!!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake looked back and the girls weren't behind them. Before he did anything else he crashed into a soft and warm wall, and heard Joana's angry voice<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Soo... you were saying that I don't have a seductive mode, huh?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Gulp!!!* Was Blake's only answer...</span></div></div>",

This guy is younger, crazier, and if takes over my body you know what happens...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"He was tough... I fought him... but, how can someone distinguish him from you?\"- Jak said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Simple. He's dressed as my former self...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Uhhhh...\"- Jak obviously didn't get that, Blake slapped his forehead<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You didn't know. Well... that guy Blaze, shrank me. Lith, the weird green haired woman, said she couldn't break the curse Blaze placed on it, and her way to fix this was to give me this cheap copy of myself... the irony is that she's God!! well... Goddess...\"- Blake aswered, with some anger in the last phrases, and somewhere... Lith must have sneezed...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I see... but, I don't think your spare body can be THAT bad...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"That bad?!! This goddamn thing is way weaker than my original body... also... I had a brown jacket that belonged to my father... and... What's with these green eyes and white skin!! My skin was darker and my eyes were black!!\"- Blake was seemingly shouting at Lith wherever she was<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"At least it was for free...\"- Jak laughed. He understood that Blake had a softer look and he didn't like that (He also had heard about Blake's scar in the eye, and although he was confused at first, not seeing it,now he got it)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I wouldn't give a cent for this...\"- Blake said, and added -\"I'm sure that I'd have beaten Joana if I had my original body at normal size...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Hey one moment... you say that you'd be stronger and faster if you got back your original body?\"- Jak asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Not possible... Joana keeps it... and at our size we can't do much... if only they were normal girls withour powers we might have a chance...\"- Then he looked at the ceiling and said -\"Lith, why the hell did you have to give Joana some of your powers?! Don't you think that this is a little too much?!!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"That won't help...\"- Jak said, and Blake replied<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I know, but I HAD to say it... Next time I see Lith we're gonna have a little talk about this... Now... let's go...\"- Blake and Jak transformed again and started moving, Jak flying and Blake running on the walls. However, they heard a swishing sound and the girls were in front of them...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Did they just use enhanced speed?\"- Jak asked in shock<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"That's a game two can play...\"- Blake said, glowing in his golden aura, seeing that, Jak also glowed in his white aura. Both of them disappeared from their view... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"We must be quick... each second I'm using this aura my energies run lower\"- Blake said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Welcome to the club\"- Jak replied, feeling his own energy beginning to get drained<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"At least the girls can't keep up with this speed...\"- Blake said as he was air dashing. They were so rushed that they didn't even know where they were going. They saw an open door and decided to hide in whoever's that room was. Blake immediaely noticed the PS3 and said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Jak... this is your room...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Dammit...\"- Jak muttered, and said -\"We better get outta here\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"We can't even play at this size... and the only ones able to change us back are the same ones who want us...\"- Blake said while thinking some plan<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Maybe this is futile... how long will this be?\"- Jak said, and Blake got angry at the pessimism<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"It's not fair either!! I never get to play PS3... because I don't have one...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Well... maybe if we give up things wouldn't get worse...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"They can't get worse... And I won't be forced to be Joana's prisoner without opposing resistance...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Heh. If Jasmine wasn't angry, I wouldn't oppose much... By the way... how is your relationship with your girlfriend?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Huh?! How is my relationship? What DOES that mean?\"- Blake asked, both confused and annoyed<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"She seems more like your sister than your girlfriend... I mean... you rarely agree in anything... and it seems you don't like spending time with her...\"- Jak said cautiously<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Believe me... I can't spend more time with her... I'VE LIVED WITH HER FOR TWO YEARS!!! Give me a break...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Whoah... I didn't know that... but still... you don't treat her much like a girlfriend...\"- <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Well... I haven't had any girlfriend before... and I don't know... she was annoying even before she was my girlfriend... she always followed me around wherever I went... she even followed me when I climbed in trees back in 7th and 8th grade...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Awww... she likes you\"- Jak said mockingly<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Well... I didn't figure out until 9th year... and she practically shouted 'You're my boyfriend now, you like it or not!!' ...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"It seems that you were a little too dense... but also a bit exaggerated\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Hey, I've been a lonely guy who fights bullies my whole life... I'm not used to that stuff...  and believe me, she wants me to spend 100% of my time with her... I can't do that... she also complains because I train to beat Blaze... which I do to protect HER...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Jasmine kinda complained about me training too, but she didn't take it too bad...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Thank your luck...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Maybe if you willingly spent some time with Joana she might calm down...\"-</span></div></div>",

Perfect and flawless white sharp claws, pointing at Joana's delicate throat. She had to gulp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I'm a feline... made for speed... you're just a heavy cow...\"- <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaid that, she vanished completely, leaving a very angry Joana, specially for what Tabitha said<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile... somewhere outside...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake sighed and said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"That was a close one...

I sensed that you needed help...\"- Tabitha said gladly<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What do you think, Jak?\"- Blake asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"About the time we got help...\"- Jak said not so happily<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"At least she's faster and she's on our side...\"- Then, looking at Tabitha's hand, Blake said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Could you retract your claws Tabitha?\"- She immediately did so and said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Sorry...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"No problem\"- Blake said. By now, he and Jak were tired, so, on their own they wouldn't stand a chance. Tabitha, using her greatly enhanced senses, climbed up a tree and laid on a branch. She put both guys on her belly. Blake was about to say something, and she said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You better rest, master. Don't worry, if someone is getting close I'll feel it...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake relaxed then and laid back. He wanted to rest for a while. Jak did so though he wasn't completely sure if trusting in a former animal would be reasonable... not like they had much choices besides that...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Suddenly, Tabitha's fur bristled. She immediately grabbed Blake and Jak, who were sleeping and vanished. Joana and Jasmine appeared immediately and another pursuit. Blake shouted in Tabitha's hand<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"That...was...a...bit...rough...\"- Tabitha dashed very quickly and climbed up the building. Then, she brought Blake near her face, saying apologetically<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Excuse me, master... but... they're following us...\"- She put him and Jak on her right shoulder and said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Please hold tight... \"- Blake and Jak nodded. Before the female cat even jumped, Joana and Jasmine appeared before her, looking not as angry as before, but still determined to get the guys back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Tabitha...\"- Joana began, Tabitha hissed angrily<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I've said it before. I don't receive orders from you...\"- Tabitha replied firmly -\"And there must be a reason why my master would be trying to get away from you anyway... Nobody runs away from anything if there's no harm\"- She added. Her animal-like reasoning was simple but effective. Joana answered<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Listen. There are many things you don't understand about humans... and relationships is one of those... simply hand over Blake and Jak and you'll be free to go...\"- Tabitha simply vanished, followed by Joana and Jasmine. She was dashing the fastest, but the girls were on her heels (or tail?... whatever)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn front of her stood Jasmine, who said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Well... Blake's your business... but Jak isn't\"- Tabitha stopped, realizing she was right. Blake shouted<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Don't listen to her!! They're tricking you!!\"- Before anything else, Tabitha sensed the characteristic wind of superspeed techniques, and barely dodged it. Both girls charged at her and Tabitha dodged them again, this time, kicking both with her feet's claws. Joana attacked her with punches and kicks but Tabitha had been right, her strength was useless against Tabitha's speed. None of the blows hit the cat, and she slashed at her tens of times. Joana was surprised by this technique... It was a variation of Blaze's God Speed... A skill learned by Blake... and seemingly, by Tabitha as well, though her version adds slashing with her claws instead of the sole punches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTabitha kept like this for more than 15 minutes, dodging, slashing and ocassionally mocking the girls, specially Joana, commenting about her weight and her lack of speed compared to hers. Finally, Joana said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Enough already. You are going to give us those guys back one way or the other\"- She looked at Jasmine and nodded. Blake gulped, and Jak whispered to him<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"If they're going to do what I think they're going to do, we're screwed...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Lith... I'm not a praying man, but if you're up there or wherever...\"- Blake said eyes closed and hands praying-like, then, he opened his eyes and shouted, raising his fist -\"GET US THE HELL OUT OF THIS!!!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"With such a prayer... I don't think she'll help us...\"- Jak commented<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"It's not like she'd appear even with a proper prayer... After all, she's the very responsible of giving Joana those goddamn size changing powers...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Don't be that negative... even if your girlfriend hadn't, she surely would have convinced Jasmine into shrinking us both anyway...\"- Jak said, but that obviously didn't confort Blake at all<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat they feared was becoming true. Both girls started to grow until they reached 50 feet. Both girls smiled evilly, Tabitha gulped and tried to run away, but this time, she was like a toy to them. Their lack of speed was now compensated by the huge physical difference... multiplied x2...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTabitha still kinda dodged the giant hands but it was much more difficult. She even slashed Jasmine's fingers but it wasn't much of a wound. She kept bravely facing the giant girls until she got distracted dodging Jasmine's hands, and got caught in Joana's, who brought her to her face and said, with oubvious anger<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What were you saying about you being made for speed?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I'M saying that I'm still a feline made for speed... and you're a whale now...\"- That last part made Joana's face bright red both in embarrassment and anger. Tabitha managed to break free and appeared near her left ear, saying<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You were a heavy cow... but with your current size you're more like a whale...\"- Tabitha jumped before Joana's left hand could grab her. Bad thing that Jasmine sawatted her down, sending her into a tailspin fall. Her feline reflexes managed to protect Blake and Jak, but not much of herself, as she had very little time to put Blake and Jak to safety. She was trying to stand up when Joana hovered her foot over her. Tabitha, Jak and Blake were now really scared. Joana pinned her down with er feet and took Blake with two fingers. Jasmine did the same. The girls immediately shrank back to their normal size. And they were walking away, but Joana went back to Tabitha and said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Well... the feline lost anyway...\"- Blake looked at Jak, who was held by Jasmine, and both of them thought</span></div></div>",

Thanks\"- Blake replied<br>\r\n-\"Will you ever let me live it down?!! This is not the moment to argue...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What do you want then?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You won't be able to do anything else in your current state. Let me do this and we'll get away\"- Demon Blake said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I can't trust someone who has tried to attack me from behind... You've attacked me even in my dreams several times!!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Sheesh. Last time I helped you didn't I?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Okay... It will be like the last time...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You can't even transform into light\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Well... I'll let your darkness do the job. BUT you aren't taking over. I will be in control of everything, understood?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Not that we have much choices\"- Demon Blake shrugged. Blake snapped back to reality. He whispered to Jak<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I might do one last effort. It's all or nothing. How about you?\"- <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I'm tired... but yeah, maybe I can pull off something once more...\"- Jak answered. Jasmine asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You seemed to really want to get away from me\"- Jak noticed a slight hurt tone in her voice, and suddenly he just wanted to give up. But he also saw Blake's look. He was kinda stubborn, and is very different from himself. He was older and his life was different. Jak also had in mind what Blake said earlier. He lived with his girlfriend for at least two years... that's something different. Maybe because of that is why Blake isn't as willing about to spend more time with Joana. He had a determined look. And his character was of someone who always fights for what he believes, never giving up. Jak thought of doing his last effort... He looked at Blake...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoana asked to her boyfriend<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You were really this serious? You've forced yourself too much... and all just to run away from me...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You don't understand...\"- Blake replied<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"That's always your answer!! You always said that nobody can understand you!! At least let me try once!!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake sighed, saying<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I don't have time for this...\"- Quickly, he glowed in a black aura, and witha sudden boost he vanished from Joana's grip. Jak immediately got the tip and glowed in his white aura as well, this time, his aura had a brief blinding effect, and he flew away, catching up with Blake immediately. He noticed that Blake wasn't running under his light powers anymore. Blake seemed to read his mind, saying, with a slight metallic tone<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"It's still me. I'm running under darkness. You look different too\"- Jak was surprised at both Blake's comment and his own feeling. He felt stronger and faster than before. As suddenly as Blake escaped, he now had the feeling they could actually get away. Jak also was amazed that Blake's air dashes were fairly longer than his previous ones used in normal or light state.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Good thing you had that ace up your sleeve...\"- Jak replied<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Not that I wanted to use it... I don't know how long can I trust him... but as long as he helps me, I will survive. By the way, how did you transform again? I did by switching my source of power...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I don't know...\"- He and Blake stopped near a puddle to take a breath. Jak observed his reflex. His hair looked more spiky, and ocassionally some white bolts flashed around his body or arms. It seemed to be an enhanced transformation result of his training. He watched Blake's appearance too. He looked tougher, a bit bulkier with more muscles. His skin had a grayish tone but he wasn't sure if it was the transformation or the illumination. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had already seen Blake's irisless eyes so he wasn't surprised about that, though it was still a bit intimidating. Currently, only one was irisless, the other one was green like in his normal state, a signal that he was in a mix of normal-darkness hybrid form, also made it weirder looking. Bake's hair also was different from his light state. It kept waving upward, like a flame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"We better get going, before the girls come\"- Blake said, normally he wouldn't take a breath but he did so to buy some time for darkness to replenish his internal reserves a bit<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Blake... I'm thinking this might be fruitless... I mean... it seems that no matter what we do we won't get away in the end...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"We won't know until we try\"- Jak knew why Blake's attitude annoyed Joana. But he understood it in a deeper sense. Blake never gave up, and he always tried his best. Possibly, that attitude was what fueled him in his previous fights with Blaze. He doesn't know that much, as he hasn't been told about that, but Jak just guessed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Anyway... we can't get more screwed than we're right now...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Maybe the girls would have mercy if we just give up. Maybe yours will treat you well if you stop this\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Nah... She'd just go into 'crazy jealous possesive girlfriend mode'... and there's no way to calm her down... well, enough talk, we should move before...\"- Blake was cut off by Joana's voice<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Before your crazy jealous possesive girlfriend comes in?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"WHAT?!!...\"- Both guys exclaimed<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Uhm... well...\"- Blake paused for a moment, seemingly thinking an answer -\"Yeah\"- Was Blake's final answer<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Blake... are you aware that you just screwed yourself up?\"- Jak asked, now scared<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"And are you aware that you too?\"- Jasmine appeared also out of nowhere<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Me? Why me? I've said nothing!!\"- Jak replied<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Because you ran away as well\"- Jasmine said, sounding severe<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Darkness... don't let me down now... don't dare to let me down...\"- Blake muttered, and he glowed in the black aura again. Jak powered up as well, with more white bolts flashing around him. Both guys started to fly away (well, Blake air dashes). Jak looked back and noticed that they weren't moving, they were smiling though. All of sudden, Jak fell down to the ground, reverting to normal. Blake also fell next to him, reverting to normal state and saying<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I hate you so much darkness...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeathing heavily, and unable to move, they couldn't do anything else anymore. The girls started to walk toward them and each girl grabbed her respective boyfriend.</span></div></div>",

He was right. She had never seen Blake sad, or frustrated, except when he got shrunk the first time. Most of time, Blake acted strong and tough, never giving up.  She still was hurt because Blake didn't tell anything before, and there was a slight anger in her voice<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"How can I know if you don't tell me?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Because I just need sometimes to be a boy... I want sometimes to eat pizza and play videogames... two things I hardly ever get to do...\"- Blake had a point. Ever since she knew him, he always acted wise and mature, tough and never giving up. His behavior was more that of a man than of a teenager. Joana never thought that it would put pressure on him<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Anyway... I didn't mean I don't like to be with you...

The second time was when you saw me hanging out with Karina the first time. The third time was when Claire also greeted me once. The fourth was when I came back to my locker after getting beaten by a bunch of guys who tried to catch me for Marilyn... The fifth... you're angry right now...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Blake... I simply wanted to spend more time with you...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I live with you!! And the day has only 24 hours...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You know what I mean. You're always training because of Blaze, preparing yourself for the worst, and don't even sleep because you think he might appear\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I can't sleep anyway... and Blaze actually attacked once at midnight not too long ago\"- Blake replied<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I just want to be with you. Not only in the literal sense. Blake, you never speak about your own problems... and you hardly show any feeling... sometimes I wonder if you do care about me...\"- Joana said that with a sad tone.

You gave hopes to an orphan vagabond. You gave me a reason to live. You know that I've had few people I cared about, and I ended up losing most of them. At 5 years I had to witness my father fighting against his own brother to death. Later, I befriended Robin who was an orphan vagabond just like me. He lost his hand because of me... and he died because of me again...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Blake...\"- Joana was about to say something but he continued<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I always stared the sky, specially at night. I always wanted an answer, to why did I have to be here, what was I living for. For years, I didn't find that answer...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"But Blake, when you met me you hadn't any feeling for me...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Well, not exactly... I had no particular reason to save you the first day we met. But I did. Something inside me told me to do it...\"- In Blake's mind. Demon Blake smirked 'Heh!!'. Despite being together for 3 years (10th grade - present) it was the first time Blake admitted something like that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoana's mind flashed back to those days. She had been attacked by a bully and he was stealing her backpack. Unable to fight him back, she didn't know what to do, and in that instant, a mysterious boy came out of nothing and punched the guy. He stood up and attacked her mysterious savior with a knife. The boy got slashed in the arm but knocked him out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout words, he simply picked up the backpack and handed it to Joana. She hadn't seen his face until that moment. His skin evidenced he was a latino. His eyes were black. And, he had a scar in the right eye, a signal of that he was used to fighting. Despite these traits, Joana didn't feel any evil from this guy. As silently as he appeared, he was walking away, bleeding. It was the time they met. She stopped him and healed his wound with a piece of fabric torn from her sleeve. The guy thanked her and was again walking away. Joana asked him his name, and he answered: Blake...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe got to be one of Blake's few friends. She found that his behavior and overall attitude were of an older person. Still, He always came to save her from anyone. Even risking his own life, as of the times he's fought 5 or more guys, who usually were armed with knives or sticks. Or when he fought Ivan, knowing that there was no way he could beat him. Joana asked once if he ever cared about himself and his answer was <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"My life itself has no sense. If I can do something to help someone whose life does, then mine can be of some use\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoana had discovered that Blake was cold most of time, not showing any feeling nor caring much about himself. She felt that something was missing in Blake's life, but didn't know what. A year later, Blake once told her that he had no family, his father was dead. She had thought that his father just died, until Blake said that it happened when he was 5. She also noticed Blake's remark that <b>he was the only person who ever cared about him</b>*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlso, came to Joana's mind when back at 7th year, Karina told her that 'Blake in fact, what he needs the most is affection and love, strangely as it sounds, his cold attitude is indeed a scream for them. I've been with him several years but I'm not the appropiate one for that. Since you love him then you should try...' Joana was doubly surprised by both this revelation and that Karina had realized about her feelings<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe time passed. Somehow Blake's attitude had been softening since he met her. By 9th year it was almost obvious that Blake felt something special, but he had an internal conflict beause of that. He asked her out though (It was more like she asked him out, but, who cares?)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe moment he confronted Blaze the first time, he was much more than the bullies Blake had faced before. Their fight was teribly violent, and Blake was really close to dying. Plus, he ended up shrunk. Blake has been training to destroy Blaze once for all ever since, to Joana it was just an obsession. Now she understood that as Azrael's descendant, it's in his blood. She smiled, and brought Blake near her face and kissed him<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Despite I dislike clich\u00e9s... I'm sorry...\"- Blake said after the kiss<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I want to be with you, no matter what...\"- She hugged him...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>*The reason Blake omitted Robin's mention was obvious. The omission of Blake's grandma was mostly because Blake was still reserved about personal things with Joana.</b></span></div></div>",

You'll feel better...\"- Joana said, taking it out of her pocket<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Whaaaa?!!! B-but why the hell are you carrying it in your pocket!!?\"- Blake nearly fainted from the shock<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Don't worry. It was protected by a energy field. I brought it because I thought you'd like to spend some time in it. Lith said entering your old body would heal any injury in your spare one, as well as replenish fully your energy\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Okay then... but please keep it somewhere safe...\"- Blake said as he walked toward his true body. It was a bit scary to see one self in an inanimated body, but due to the spell or Lith's power, Blake's body didn't look as a ead one would. It looked like an unconscious version of himself. Blake touched his chest with his hand and glowed, entering to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe opened his eyes, and stood up. He felt much more lighter and stronger. But before he did anything else, Joana gave him another hug. Blake thought 'If I were my normal size this would hurt... maybe shrinking is not that bad... Joana still needs to control her strength anyway...'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe released him, and he jumped to the bed. Jak came next to him and almost didn't recognize him. Blake laughed at his shock, and said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"This is what I really look like, why are you surprised?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJak kept staring at him. Blake's brief description of his former appearance wasn't as detailed as Jak had thought. Blake was still a tall guy (in proportion as he's shrunk now, his real stature is 6'2\", or 190 cm, this stature is kept with the spare body at normal size) but he looked different from Blake's spare body appearance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverything seemed to make Blake more serious and tougher. His muscles were noticeable, while Blake's spare form was normal looking (mainly because of its \"new\" status, not passing through years of fighting as Blake's real body did). His skin was darker, and there was scar in his right eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"It's surprising that you look like you were already transformed\"- Jak replied<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"It's not such a big deal. But, it feels so much better to be myself\"- Blake said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I guess...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Hey what was that shocked face for?\"- Jasmine came near the bed, she looked at Blake and added<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You... aren't you Blake?\"- Jasmine hadn't seen Blake as much times but she knew how he looked, she wasn't that surprised because Joana had already told her about Blake's situation<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Yeah... I kinda forgot that you had never seen my real self...\"- Blake answered<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Don't worry\"- Jasmine replied<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What a day...\"- Jak said, as he and Blake were picked up by their respective girlfriend. However, a growl was heard, Blake and Jak looked at each other, and then stared at Joana, who blushed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I'm sorry...\"- She said embarrassed, and Blake answered<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I'd say that you're hungry...\"- <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Well... I guess we have to wait until everyone else come back...\"- Jak said, feeling hungry too</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Blake got up early in the morning. About at 2:00 AM, it was still dark. He managed not to wake Joana up. He felt the need to investigate about his aura power, and to enhance his capabilities, as these latest days his power level was almost the same, though he had developed more skill and the usage of energy techniques. He took with him a few supplies from thr Ryans, basically, a backpack full of magic recovery juice cans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot that he'd use more than one or two, but he had the feeling he might need more. He used his hyper speed to leave silently the place. He went to the woods to train on his own. His inner darkness yawned inside his head, asking<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What the hell are you doing this early? What do you have against sleeping well?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"It's none of your business. Go back to whatever you were doing and don't disturb me...\"- Blake replied coldly<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What a way to say thanks... I saved you twice and what's all I get? A 'get back and don't disturb' \"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Actually, your help just made things worse with my girlfriend...\"- <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You knew you needed to tell her about yourself. I'm your instincts, I knew perfectly what was going to happen. You needed to tell her that sometimes you need to relax\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Weren't you supposed to be evil and be conspirating against me to take over my mind?\"- Blake sarcastically asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Nah. I'll do that later... Anyway, if you counted how many times I've tried to take over against the times I've saved you, you would kiss my feet\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"The few times you tried to take over were when you screwed up... AND I kiss nobody's feet. \"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Not even your girl's?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I'm not into feet... thanks...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Then what about her 'orbs' ?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Do you ever think about anything else?\"- Blake replied annoyed. Demon Blake smiled, and mocked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Awww... the boy is so innocent that hasn't even a taste for girls... Snap out of it!! You grew in streets!! You should be drooling at the mere thought of your girlfriend's 'fleshyness'...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I'm sure that word doesn't even exist... and you make it look as if you were a hungry dog...\"- Blake mocked him back<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"YEAH!! I'm hungry!! And I WANT FRESH FLESH!!!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Go get it yourself...\"- Blake replied<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You won't let me take over...\"- <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Stupid!! That's because you'd make it look as if I was the perv...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Well, I'm you... so... you're actually a perv...\"- Blake sighed and decided to ignore his internal darkness. He had found a good spot for training anyway. He started practicing, transforming into his light power, and glowing in the aura. He said to himself<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"This technique is multiplying my power x4... let's see if I can go further...\"- Blake then started to focus and the aura's flaming movement became more electric like, spikier, more violent and faster. Also, golden bolts flashed around Blake. He jumped upward at high speed and tried using his air dashing moves. He nearly could fly, yet requiring previous impulses for he dashes, but they were faster and longer. Blake also tested his strength. But after just 15 minutes, he fell to the ground exhausted, he said, breathing heavily<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Damn!! I can't believe I lasted that short... I really need to improve this... at least... I multiplied my power x8...\"- Blake was about to take a juice can, when a golden light illuminated the area and Lith appeared. Blake said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Too late, when I needed some help you were somewhere else...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You didn't need my help. You just needed to tell her that you needed to relax as well...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Uh-huh...\"- Blake growled, sarcastically saying in his mind 'Where have I heard that before?'</span></div></div>",

You perferred her as just an ordinary girl?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"ACTUALLY YES. I wanted her out of this mess... what if Blaze attacks her?!!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"At least she can fight back...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Don't screw with me... the power you gave her is not enough...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"She was stronger than you. How do you know Blaze's power anyway?\"- Lith sounded surprisingly girly, which annoyed Blake<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Because I fought him. I felt that his power is far beyond we've seen so far. If Blaze was serious he'd crush all of us to death with his bare hands...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Joana can grow... She'd crush Blaze to death before he did\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I think brute strength is not all. Blaze would simply overpower her and would end up with the upper hand, no mater how big she would become... also, I don't know her growth limits... maybe growing too much would be dangerous for her...\"- Blake momentarily imagined a super giant Joana, tripping... and gulped -\"Or for us... if she were too big maybe she'd crush us instead...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Don't you think that Joana already knows that?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\" *Sigh* Yeah... I guess...\"- Blake scratched the back of his head<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Haven't you thought of her feelings?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What DOES that mean?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I hear people's prayers... haven't you thought that Joana suffers seeing you fight such a beast by yourself? haven't you thought... that she might wish to be strong so she can not just protect you, but to fight at your side?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"She's never needed to fight...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You ended up badly sometimes Blake. And she was frustrated with herself, because she let it happen, because she hadn't the strength to help you. She really loves you Blake. She'd sacrifice her life for you...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"No more sacrifices. I've caused two deaths because of that...\"- Blake regained composure and said, in his serious normal tone -\"Well, what did you come for here?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You wanted to train, right? I'll replenish your energies, and will serve as your sparring, but, with one condition...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What? Letting Joana fight... okay... but if she gets hurt you'll have to answer me!!\"- Blake said firmly that last phrase, not intimidated by anything nor anyone, nor bullies, nor Blaze, nor gods...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I want you to train in the use of a weapon...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Come on!! Weapons won't work against such enemies... I doubt something would hurt Blaze, the first time he fought lots of armed bullies and in the end, the knives and guns were useless against him...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Not even Blaze is immune to everything. There are certain weapons that can kill even gods... But for now, you'll train with this...\"- Lith spoke seriously. As she said that, she appeared an ordinary broadsword that looked like this: <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://images.elfwood.com/art/h/a/hakobian/broadsword.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://images.elfwood.com/art/h/a/hakobi...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You gotta be kidding me...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Well, how about for each hour we train your usual fighting style we train another hour sword combat?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What for? I'm sure steel does nothing to Blaze... I've seen him to stop bullets with his hands, once, when Rick was trying to hold him off, while I was being unshrunk... two years ago...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"It will be helpful someday. Believe me...\"- Lith said, Blake sighed and decided to do it. Despite not trusting completely her judgement, he thought 'This can't go wrong... I mean... why else would a woman thousands of years old insist if she hadn't a reason?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLith raised an eyebrow and said -\"I heard that!!...Do I look that old?\"-  She said almost worried, Blake just covered his face with his hand and started to train...</span></div></div>",

They placed headbands on their foreheads and symbols appeared on their bodies. They started to speak pure japanese which the symbols reacted by small flash then vanished and different clothes appeared on their bodies, but the new clothes switched out their normal clothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"This is a change.\"- ryan said looking at his clothes<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Our summons will be wanting to fight that snake and the band of rogue ninja.\"- powerman said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Susake's brother.\"- ryan said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You have the curse mark removal jutsu so do you have any other jutsus?\"- he asked powerman<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Maybe for later, but just watch out for my steel bullet barrage.\"- he said as he was looking at the to groups with a smile<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"A clue is what I gave you.\"- powerman said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Ryan, if we keep them waiting any longer then there will be no one left to be saved.\"- ryan said as he and ur went through the portal back to their homeworld, but an arrow just missed his head<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"No kiss?\"- kagome said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I was wondering when you were going to ask.\"- ryan said with a smile as he walked to his wife and gave her a sweet fire kiss<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Still the same kisser like on our first date.\"- she said with a smile<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyan started to walk away to his brothers when he and powerman started to hold their heads. They fell to one knee and the look on powerman's face is quite ticked off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"They are very annoying like blaze.\"- powerman said as they are got up to their feet and ryan k. pulled out two apples<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"This will numb the headache.\"- ryan said as he tossed powerman an apple<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Sweet and that did help.\"- powerman said as they started for the portal<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Ninetails and gardevoir, you two are special to me and your trainers but if you sense me in severe trouble then come and use your tricks.\"- he said as they nodded<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Riolu, I will be coming back to help you with your training which will be tomorrow or later today.\"- he said using his aura<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ground started to shake and blake's friends were getting scared, but powerman is smiling when two giant pikachus wearing clothes were coming to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I'm the one guy in the whole universe who should be the luckiest because I have you to wait for me.\"- he said smiling a sad smile and one of the pikachu picked him up and they both gave him a hug<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"That should be is suppose to be is.\"- animan said smiling<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pikachus put powerman down and gave him a shock which didn't affect him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Thanks.\"- he said as combing his hair back to the usual style<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I want you two to start weight training now.\"- he said as they saluted then walked to the higher floors of the mansion<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"The team will be on standby till we need help and blake with jak's group will be having a normal day, but try keep the house in one piece.\"- he said the last part with a laugh</span></div></div>",

Then a portal opened up to reveal the person that they have fought before and ur ryan decided to come out to play.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\u201cNice to see you again.\u201d- the person said as ur ryan was looking at him with a straight face<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\u201cMess with this world and you deal with me.\u201d- he said as he made a supernova fireball then threw at the person\u2019s face<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\u201cYou will be dealing with me and evil twins so better bring your game face.\u201d- the person said before leaving through the same portal that he came through<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\u201cWe are going to bring a lot more than just our A-game.\u201d- powerman said as he switched to his firestarter and attacked the person before he could escape<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe and the person fought, but powerman had the speed and the power to send him flying not into the portal but the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\u201cSo you want to play fine.\u201d- the person said as he used the flash step and send powerman into the ground before going after ryan and ur ryan<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe person was faster than them using the flash step and he used a combination of attacks, but powerman switched to his full power darkness and ryan went full power demon as they attacked the person at the same time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\u201cThat won\u2019t work.\u201d- the person said as he double kick them to the ground<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\u201cRyan, we might have to call the team for this one.\u201d- powerman said as they tried to stand up<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA portal opened and animan came out with his armor, but he has a smile on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\u201cSomebody called for a team.\u201d- he as used the flash step and knocked the person down with a hard right hook to the face<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\u201cMess with the brotherhood and will have to deal with me and the team.\u201d- he said as the portal is still open and people started to come out<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\u201cWell it seems that you are with them and I hope you are stronger than the other three.\u201d- the person said as they started their fight and the ryans used the flash step<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\u201cThey were clones and this joker showed up in their place.\u201d- ryan explained as they were drinking their flasks and their wives healing their wounds</span></div></div>",

But they began to wake up after hearing some noises, specially Rocky's growl. Joana woke up and nearly fell off the bed when she realized Blake wasn't there. After hearing the noises, she started to suspect something bad... would Blake have gone to fight by himself? She also wondered why he didn't wake her up, and remembered that the last time Blaze attacked, Blake wasn't intended to wake her up either. She got up and dresses while thinking<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n'Blake still has to learn that he can't do everything by himself...'<br>\r\n <br>\r\nWhen she walked outside her room, she encountered with Jak and Jasmine, the latter said<br>\r\n <br>\r\n-\"I have a bad feeling about this... uh... where's your boyfriend?\"-<br>\r\n <br>\r\n-\"I was wondering the same...\"- Joana answered, strangely sounding worried and sarcastic. She stared at Jak, who felt it and replied<br>\r\n <br>\r\n-\"Don't look at me. I don't know... but, I don't think Blake would leave unless it was something important...\"-<br>\r\n <br>\r\n-\"Yeah, but, I can't feel his presence anywhere...\"-<br>\r\n <br>\r\n-\"What?\"- Jak was surprised.Blake had told him before that she had unknown means to find him, he was still trying to figure out because he evaded all of her 5 senses and she still was able to tell where he was.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n-\"It's a bit complicated... but almost always, I know where Blake is... except when I'm sleeping, as you see...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"We better stop wasting time and find out...\"- Jak said as he started to walk, followed by the girls. Minutes later, they reached the entrance and after looking in the distance, gasped, seeing three unknown (to them) men. Blake's pets Rocky, Max, Tabitha and D'Artagnan were standing before them.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n-\"So... this is the best that Shinonome Ryan could get?\"- Said a scary man, who was completely white skinned and had long black hair, with amber snake-like eyes.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n-\"Hmph... they seem like some strange experiment failures...\"- Said another man, whose skin was pale but not completely white as the other one's. He was dressed with a blue long jacket, and an armor seemingly made of bone. He had red eyes and long black hair.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n-\"Just kill them already, Orochimaru\"- Said the man in the middle of the other two. He had swept back brown hair, with a strand hanging. He was dressed in a what looked like a long white jacket over white samurai-looking clothing. Joana gasped, as she recognized two of the three men as Sousuke Aizen and Naraku. The other man's identity had just been revealed.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n-\"It will be my pleasure\"- Answered Orochimaru, who charged toward the animals. Instead of dodging him, Rocky stood and punched him with great force. The cats immediately slashed him several times and D'Artagnan connected some kicks. Orochimaru was very surprised, and after wiping off the blood in his face, he opened his mouth, and another Orochimaru came out. Rocky, Max and Tabitha had very confused looks.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n-\"You simply can't win, animals. I can't die!!\"-<br>\r\n <br>\r\n-\"You call us animals... then, what are you, snake guy?\"- Rocky replied, angering Orochimaru<br>\r\n <br>\r\n-\"How dare you?!!\"- He charged again with great speed, this time punched Rocky, but he didn't deal as much damage as he expected. Instead, Rocky bit his arm, instantly breaking it. Orochimaru simply tore it off and kicked him, sending him some meters away. Max and Tabitha took the chance, slashing Orochimaru several more times in the body and face. He punched Max with his left arm and Tabitha immediately ran to his side. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe again came out of his damaged body, with a new one. He walked threateningly toward Max who also got up, and exchanged several punches and kicks. Meanwhile, Rocky had gotten up as well, and dashed toward them<br>\r\n <br>\r\nOrochimaru was so focused on fighting Max that he didn't see Rocky coming. He had rushed toward them at very high speed and headbutted Orochimaru, sending him away against some trees. Max laughed, saying<br>\r\n <br>\r\n-\"I think you took a little too seriously the 'bull' part in 'pitbull'...\"-<br>\r\n <br>\r\n-\"Heh... that will teach that freaky snake guy...\"-<br>\r\n <br>\r\n-\"I AM NOT A FREAKY SNAKE GUY!!\"- Orochimaru screamed, as he walked toward them with another new body<br>\r\n <br>\r\nIn that moment, D'Artagnan kicked him but Orochimaru grabbed his foot, punched him in the face and sent him away. He also grew a snake tail instead of his legs and slithered at great speed, punching Max and Tabitha. However, he still had a hard time fighting Rocky, whom wasn't as much affected by his punches. They kept fighting like this when D'Artagnan appeared, but this time, he slashed him with his weapons, which consisted of two tonfas with sickle blades.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n-\"So that's how you want to play it then, huh?\"- Two snakes came out of his shoulders and attacked D', however, it was useless against his shell. Rocky took the chance to bite and tore them off. Orochimaru then extended his hands and more snakes came out of his sleeves, some of them got to bite Rocky despite his efforts. Max and Tabitha attacked them but Orochimaru used the snakes to trap them instead, the snakes wrapping tightly around the cats. D'Artagnan intevrened cutting the snakes with his sickle bladed tonfas. In a swift motion, he thrusted the blades into Orochimaru's chest, while Rocky tore off his left arm and the cats inflicted several slashing wounds.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nThe three anthros were struggling against the ninja. Not allowing a chance for him to emerge from his body. However, his torn arm turned into several snakes that attacked them. And he used that chance to come out of his damaged body again. This time, larger snakes (boa-like) emerged from his shoulders and wrapped themselves around all of the anthros. Then, the snakes rose into the air and smashed down  their victims. Orochimaru was about to repeat this when a voice said behind him<br>\r\n <br>\r\n-\"I'd think it over before doing that again\"- Blake said.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n-\"Master!!\"- Tabitha exclaimed gladly<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n-\"Don't worry. Thanks for holding off this weirdo... Now, I'll take care of this...\"- Blake said, almost readint his pets' worries. <br>\r\n <br>\r\nFrom the mansion. Joana was surprised to feel suddenly Blake's presence. She was also surprised by how suddenly he appeared out of nowhere. She was starting to walk toward the place when Jasmine stopped her, saying<br>\r\n <br>\r\n-\"Maybe he can really take care of this... Trust him...\"-<br>\r\n <br>\r\n-\"I TRUST him... I don't trust the freaky snake guy...\"- Joana replied, and heard the angry scream of said person<br>\r\n <br>\r\n-\"I am not a freaky snake guy!!\"-<br>\r\n <br>\r\nThen...</span></div></div>",

She immediately exclaimed<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Blake?!! Where the heck were you?!! You had me worried!!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I have no time for this. Long story. Take care of them\"- Blake then walked closer to her and whispered<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Please... don't use your powers unless is strictly necessary... Blaze has no knowledge of them...\"- Joana opened her eyes wide, because she realized Blake didn't remember when they met Jak and Jasmine. Blake had gone into the fusion form and Joana grew giant to fight Blaze... however... Blake doesn't remember anything. To prevent further trouble, she nodded. Blake vanished and reappeared where Orochimaru was. He said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What makes you think you can beat me alone, huh? Your pets were barely scratching me...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake answered nothing, and only stood seriously. Orochimaru smiled<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Let's see if you're really that strong. C'mon, fight me with all your power!!\"-  He said as he charged toward Blake<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"All my power? You're wrong. I don't need that much to beat you. I won't even fight seriously...\"- With that, Blake dodged his punch and connected a powerful kick, sending him more than 100 feet away. Orochimaru then opened his mouth and a snake came out, from the snake's mouth came out a very long sword, that extended quickly and tried to pierce Blake. He simply dodged him with little movement. Blake grabbed the blade and pulled it toward him, effectively pulling Orochimaru toward him, punching him in stomach again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake also sank the blade into the ground, and kept attacking Orochimaru like he was a simple punching bag. The snake in Orochimaru's mouth retreated as well as the sword, with some difficult. He then performed some strange poses with his hands and called<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Earth Clone Jutsu\"- Another Orochimaru appeared, this one made of mud. Blake said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"At least you should have tried better to confuse me...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Orochimaru and his clone charged toward him and this time, they landed some punches on Blake, but much to their surprise, Blake didn't move even an inch. And he had no damage. Blake punched through the mud clone, destroying it. Orochimaru looked with wide eyes. Blake turned around and connected several combos of punches and kicks, to end with a powerful mid air upward kick that sent him away out of sight<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, where Joana and the others stayed...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Hor did he do that? I was sure those guys were pretty tough...\"- Jak was surprised, he thought that he'd need to transform to face those enemies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Maybe it has something to do with Blake leaving in the night...\"- Jasmine said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"He... he had a different look in his eyes...\"- Joana said, and Jasmine looked at her confused, Joana added<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I had never seen him like that. He looked... confident... He always was serious in a fight, and somewhat conscious that he could lose... but now... he looked like he could do anything...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake stood, his back turned to Aizen and Naraku. The latter, grunted and rushed to attack Blake as well, but he was surprised when Blake stopped his incoming fist with his bare hand, without even looking. Then he swiftly landed a powerful kick on Naraku's chest, cracking his armor. He stared at him and muttered<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Is it possible... another lame hybrid?... No... He isn't one... his presence is different... almost... opposite?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaraku reformed his hands into pincers and attacked Blake, who stopped them with his bare hands. Naraku then grew a scorpion tail and tried to sting Blake, failing, because Blake kicked him, and with his now free hands, ripped it off. The tail fell to the ground. Naraku laughed, and changed into an insect-like form, only keeping his humanoid torso. He grew dragonfly wings, scorpion pincers and tail, and insect feet. Blake's expression was cold, and emotionless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsing his wings, Naraku flew at great speed trying to attack Blake, but he dodged it with little movement and ripped off two of his wings. Then he connected some punches into his humanoid torso and gave a powerful kick that cracked his insect part's exoskeleton. Naraku kept laughing and said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You're so gullible... Heh... You should think over before ripping off my parts...\"- All the parts Blake had ripped off wriggled as if they were alive and wrapped themselves around Blake's neck, wrists, arms, knees, feet and torso. Blake said nothing, and Naraku changed his lower body into a large centipede like form. He also grew more arms with pincers and tentacles. He used the latter to wrap around Blake, but even already binded, Blake had no problem to crush with his hands and rip apart Naraku's tentacles. He laughed<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You are a slow one, aren't you? I can't understand why are you this strong, but in the end...you'll be a good lunch...\"- Said that. all of the parts torn from Naraku's body enveloped Blake, and brought him inside his body. Joana gasped and started to run toward them, decided to use her powers even when Blake told her not to. Jak and Jasmine ran with her as well, as all of them thought Blake was in literally deep trouble. But they stopped when heard Blake's voice<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Hey Naraku... I am not the gullible one... In fact... you are the gullible one...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What??!!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Haven't you heard? They say that eating mexican gives you an upset stomach...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Nonsense... I'll digest you no matter where you're from...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside Naraku, his tissue was starting to envelope Blake, in a web-like fashion, to absorb his nutrients and energy. Blake let the tissue make contact with his skin and then said</span></div></div>",

The tissue enveloping him started to burn at contact, as well as everything inside Naraku that touched Blake's body. Outside, Naraku groaned in pain and spat out lots of fluids. Then Blake's voice was heard again<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You should be more careful with what you eat Naraku...\"- Inside Naraku, Blake rose his hand and fired an upward golden beam. Outside, Naraku opened his mouth and a golden beam came out of it, severely damaging his own face. Then, many lightbeams shone inside the demon. Then, a fist punched through, and burned what it touched in Naraku's body. Blake came out as if nothing had happened. He added<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"How did you like that? Want another taste?\"- He grabbed his left wrist with his right hand and charged a powerful energy beam that when fired, totally blew Naraku's upper body. Then, the lower half collapsed to the ground, apparently dead. However, Blake kept the transformation. Joana ran to his side, saying<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Blake... don't do EVER that again... You had me so worried\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I had to. I knew since the first moment that Naraku was aiming to absorb me to become stronger... too bad... I think I gave him severe indigestion...\"- Blake laughed at his own joke. Joana kept staring at him, and asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Why are you still transformed? Didn't you say that it uses up lots of energy to keep your light form?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"We'll talk about that later... But for now, go back to the house.

He took his full humanoid form again, and said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Why you?!!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake felt that this was no longer a one on one fight, and with precise timing, he jumped upward, getting Naraku and Orochimaru to hit each other. Blake landed on the ground and turned to see his two opponents. They were deeply angry, specially Naraku. When they prepared to charge toward him, Aizen appeared (using shunpo/flash step), and said firmly<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Stop you two already. It's clear that you're no match for him\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Shut it Aizen!! I'm just getting started\"- Naraku said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Me too...\"- Orochimaru said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Enough!!\"- Aizenm who was standing on the air, landed on the ground. His presence brought forcefully both Naraku and Orochimaru to their knees. He looked threateningly to Blake's eyes, saying<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You may not be an ant. But you're just a bigger bug that I still can crush anytime...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You shouldn't underestimate your opponents. Naraku just learned that the bad way\"- Blake said, not intimidated by Aizen even the slightest<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"When you're a god, everyone else is just weak\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'The strongest wave of deja vu just hit me... I wonder... where have I heard that before?' Blake thought, sarcastically. He knew Aizen had been watching his fight, and that's why he had used very few techniques. Aizen effectively underestimated him, and that's what Blake wanted. He disappeared, and Aizen felt a punch in his stomach. Blake then reappeared behind him and kicked him. Aizen turned around and looked at Blake, then, he wiped off the blood of his lips' corner<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"A front attack against me, without even a weapon... you sure are a courageous man... however... you're also a fool...\"- Aizen said as he used shunpo and attacked Blake, much to his surprise, he dodged him. Aizen was starting to analyze his fighting style<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'That move... it isn't shunpo nor sonido... how does he do that? Can he move at that speed with no spiritual energy?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I don't need my zanpakuto for this...\"- Aizen used shunpo again and this time punched Blake, sending him several meters away. He said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Was that all what you've got?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake simply stood and dashed at him. Aizen was able to dodge him and to connect powerful punches and kicks on him. When he was about to smash down Blake to the ground, he grabbed his fist and Blake was the one who smashed Aizen down to the ground. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Blake has just gone mad... how the hell does he think he can face Aizen alone?\"- Jak said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Aizen is faster... but... as strange as it sounds... Blake isn't fighting seriously yet...\"- Joana answered<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What?!!\"- Both Jak and Jasmine had o.o faces<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"When Blake fights Blaze, or when he fought me, he gave off more energy in his presence. This time, Blake seems to be using as least as possible...\"- Joana explained<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Would that have something to do with the aura he spoke about?' Jak thought, and sighed 'Blake, don't dare to die...'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAizen was fighting bare handed as well, but he was dealing heavier damage. Blake's attacks seemed to be not enough to damage him properly. Blake's resistance surprised slightly Aizen, who defeated most of his enemies with little effort. After an extreme exchange of punches and kicks Aizen kicked Blake, sending him down, and creating a large crater with the impact. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n[Background Music: Bleach - The tables have turned <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11vALBfUC60&amp;feature=related\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11vALBfUC...</a> ]<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Just another bug... you are unarmed, and aren't worth my time...\"- He slowly landed on the ground, just to see that Blake wasn't there. Then, Blake reappeared above him and said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Gold as the sunlight... the light that pierces through darkness... burn the enemy down to ashes...\"- A huge golden light was fired from his hand, while his other hand was grabbing his wrist. This beam was totally different from ordinary ones, it was a triple beam, a large one with two smaller ones that create spirals around it. Also, in difference of the other energy attacks, this seemed more fire-like (Like Blake's golden aura)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe explosion was enormous, and effectively, left everything that the explosion touched burnt to ashes, except Aizen, The same couldn't be said about his clothes though...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What kind of attack was that?!!\"- Aizen reflexed 'He did use an incantation... but... I have never heard of such Kido spell... It was also... a high leveled one...'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake was standing a few meters in front of him. Joana and the others were in shock<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Since when Blake can do that?!! 4 days ago he couldn't even form an energy ball!!\"- Jak exclaimed<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Definitively... Blake, wherever he went, went to improve himself...\"- Joana said, now with more hopes and faith on him<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You have all the rights to be proud\"- Jasmine patted Joana's shoulder. They kept watching while healed Blake's pets, which had bravely fought Orochimaru and gave him a run for his money.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Just luck...\"- Aizen said. Blake dashed toward him and both again engaged into a high speed combat. Aizen kept the upper hand but Blake got to fire energy balls at point-blank right into his face and chest. Aizen then said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Hado #31: Shakkaho\"- He fired a red energy ball at Blake. Blake dodged it without much problem<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Hado #33: Sokatsui\"- Now he fired a blue energy beam. Blake barely could dodge it and Aizen was already in front of him<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Bakudo #4: Hainawa\"- A rope made of yellow energy entangled in Blake's arms, and Aizen said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I knew I didn't need much to defeat you...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You thought this was all?\"- Blake said, and then he started to glow. A golden aura surrounded his body, and the energy binding on Blake's arms dissolved as a rope exposed to fire. Aizen could perceive that Blake's power was rising, and he grabbed his zanpakuto, saying<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I can't let you live. No more games...\"- He slashed at Blake but his blade was suddenly stopped. Lith appeared between Blake and Aizen, blocking the zanpakuto with a finger. Aizen tried to attack the woman but she dodged the blows with no problem. Blake asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Lith... what are you doing here?\"- Lith extended her hand and a very large sword appeared, it was nearly 6 feet long. This blade was very wide, double edged, and the metal was black, very shiny, as if it was polished. But at the same time, it didn't look like any metal known. Blake said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You want me to use that?!! It's too heavy and big!! The metal looks weird anyway....\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Use it, please...\"- Lith said, handing it to Blake. He, reluctantly, grabbed it. It didn't feel as heavy as he thought. She disappeared. Blake said to Aizen<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"If you wanted a sword fight, you got it!!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Since when does Blake wield a sword?!!\"- Everyone back outside the house wondered<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake's sword looks like this: <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.tantra.ph/mudha/images/nikrato.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.tantra.ph/mudha/images/nikrat...</a> But with a hilt like this <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.blade-empire.com/Kit_Rae/Kilgorin-Sword_of_Darkness-closeup.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.blade-empire.com/Kit_Rae/Kilg...</a></span></div></div>",

Then, he hit Aizen several times with it (the wide side, not the edged sides). Then, Blake slashed Aizen's shoulder, and he was surprised to be cut by a non spiritual blade.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Someone told me that even gods can die. And you aren't even one, Aizen...\"- Blake said, disappearing and reappearing in front of Aizen, trying to pierce through him. Aizen stopped him with his zanpakuto and countered slashing at Blake. But, despite he seemingly was slashed in two, disappeared and when Aizen turned around, Blake was there, this time Aizen said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Attacks vaguely similar to Kido... a sword that can cut through spiritual beings... and... a flash step movement... Who ARE you?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Blake. And I'm nothing you've seen before...\"- He said as he disappeared, Aizen realized he couldn't predict where would he appear due to no spiritual energy usage. Still, Aizen could react quickly enough, and slashed Blake in the chest. But Blake had grabbed the blade. Aizen opened his eyes wide for the first time. Blake then glowed in the golden aura and delivered a powerful punch right into his face, followed by several slashes. Yet, most of the wounds were superficial.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake's aura changed from its gently flaming form to a more violent, and more jagged. Also, instead of flowing outward, the aura started to flow upward. He disappeared again, and Aizen felt lots of slashed on his body. Deeper than before, but far from being severe wounds. Blake reappeared and Aizen said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Hado #63: Raikoho\"- He fired a thunder-like yellow energy beam that Blake blocked with his sword. Then, Blake started to spin his sword and threw it at Aizen, who dodged it by standing on the air with no problem, he said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Did you expect to hit me with that?...\"- Blake wasn't there, then he heard<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Purge... light of the heavens... banish from existence those who worship the wicked god*...\"- Blake was below him and fired an extremely wide beam that went upward as a pillar, trapping Aizen in the middle of it. Aizen was badly burnt this time, however, his hands glowed in green and healed himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake took the chance and punched him, but got slashed in the chest by Aizen, who then said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Shatter... Kyoka Suigetsu...\"- Blake punched Aizen and he used shunpo to get away, he repeated the command<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Shatter...\"- Blake dashed at him with his aura and puched him in the face. Aizen wondered why wasn't it working until he recalled that Blake wasn't looking at his sword. Then, he said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I don't need to release my zanpakuto to beat you...\"- He pointed his hand at Blake and said -\"Bakudo #9: Geki\"- He fired a red beam that engulfed Blake, who said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What's this supposed to do\"- As he attacked Aizen with his sword. Aizen now said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Bakudo #9: Horin\"- A rope-like orange beam wrapped itself around Blake's arms. Aizen summoned another and binded Blake's feet. Then, Aizen said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"A mere human can't break two Binding spells at once...\"- Blake then powered up his aura, this time turning even spikier and electric-like, in contrast to its usual fire-like appearance. Blake said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You're wrong... I am no mere human...\"- With that, he broke the energy entangling him, and started to fire several golden energy balls. Aizen put his arm in front of him and said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Bakudo #39: Enkosen\"- He created a round shield of yellow energy, but it broke after more than 8 impacts of Blake's energy ball attacks. Then, Aizen aimed both hands and Blake, saying<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Hado #73: Soren Sokatsui\"- He fired two powerful blue energy beams. Blake shielded with his sword but the beams exploded at contact. Suddenly, Aizen heard behind him<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Purify, Soul Vanisher... Bring the judgement of light...\"- Blake said, with his open right hand on the ground, as a symbol started to form on the ground, around Aizen. (It looked like this: <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_m1ALyYSRw9U/StMxkGWAE0I/AAAAAAAAGyI/wApwBP2hn60/s400/yu+gi+oh.bmp\" target=\"_blank\">http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_m1ALyYSRw9U/St...</a> but made of golden light) Aizen found that he could no longer move his feet, nor perform shunpo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What the...?!! What kind of binding spell is this?!!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Consume the darkness, sentence to death... Incinerate, heavenly lights!!\"- Six pillars of light rose from the ground, and a seventh came from beneath Aizen, then, it extended over all the others and the whole symbol. After a while, it slowly decreased in width until it disappeared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAizen had sustained major damage but he still wasn't too heavily damaged. Blake on the other side, was tired, and breathing heavily. That last technique consumed lots of energy, and he combined it with his aura state to power it up. Aizen again healed himself and said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Such powers wielded by a mere kid. No wonder you're running out of energy after this. I'd tell that green haired woman that she shouldn't send kids to do a god's job\"- Blake was angered by that and aimed his hand at him, firing a golden beam. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Bakudo #81: Danku\"- A transparent barrier appeared in front of him -\"This can stop any spell up to level 89\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe barrier shattered when Blake's beam struck it, which surprised Aizen 'A beam with no incantation... and it was above level 89?'. He was interrupted when Blake dashed toward him, glowed again in his aura and attacked him, Aizen dodged him and slashed with his zanpakuto, cutting a deep wound in Blake's right shoulder.He also aimed his hand and said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Bakudo #30: Shitotsu Tatsen\"- Three beams linked by light were shot at Blake, pinning him against a rock. Blake couldn't break free this time. His energy reserves were really low. Aizen walked threateningly toward Blake, with his zanpakuto ready to take his life...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size2\" style=\"\"><b>*This reference is not meant to be Aizen himself, since the techniques Blake uses were taught by Lith, and were created thousands of years ago.

Aizen used shunpo to appear in front of her, a few meters from the house. Jak and Jasmine were behind him in fighting stances, as well as Blake's pets<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRocky and Max were the first ones to attack, but Aizen punched both of them and then, was about to attack Tabitha, but his fist was stopped by D'Artagnan, who attacked him with his sickle bladed tonfas, just to find that they couldn't cut him. Jak got to punch him in the distraction and Jasmine fired an energy ball at him. Joana was the only one not fighting because she was protecting Blake, and with good reason. Blake had become Aizen's main target, after seeing his abilities, mentally labeled him as a possible threat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAizen again used shunpo to dodge everyone's attacks and stood in front of Joana<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You better leave that boy if you value your life...\"- He said, unseathing his zanpakuto<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Over my dead body\"- Joana said, carrying Blake on her back.

Joana was very surprised by his reaction... and remembered Blake's past...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake was struggling against Aizen who simply smashed him down to the ground, and fired a Shakkaho (red energy ball) at point blank at him. Blake stood up, panting, and again glowed in the aura. This time, his aura was even more jagged, and moved erratically. Blake punched Aizen in the face as he pierced through his chest with his zanpakuto. Blake's aura disappeared, his hair reverted back to normal, and he fell backward. Joana screamed...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLith appeared suddenly before Aizen, and looked at Blake. Then, she said to Joana<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Heal him. He's still alive\"- She nodded and disappeared, carrying Blake on her back. Aizen went after them but Lith stood before him, and placed a very powerful barrier around the whole house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Let me tell you something... There's only one thing more dangerous than a god... an angry mother, who happens to be a goddess...\"- She said as she vanished, punching Aizen while using her high speed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, inside the house, Joana was desperately healing Blake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Why?!! Blake has been so many times so close to death... why?!!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"He did his best. Joana, by what you told me, he's willing to do anything to keep you from harm...\"- Jasmine kneeled next to her and added her own healing on Blake. Jak said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"He sure trained a lot... I thought we were equals in fighting abilities but it seems that he improved a lot. Joana, Blake's doing the best he can... you can't ask more of him...\"- Jak saw tears running down Joana's cheeks, and gasped when saw Blake opening his eyes, saying with a faint voice<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Don't cry...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoana hugged him tightly when she heard his voice. Surprisingly, Blake's healing speed boosted when Joana did this, and she wasn't even using any healing technique at the moment (it was interrupted when she lost concentration). Blake stood up after Joana released the hug. He said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I'm sorry about this... I knew I should've multiplied my power further...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What do you mean?\"- Joana asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I can control a technique that had remained unknown: When I'm in light state, I can use an aura, and it multiplies my power, speed and strength at the cost of lots of energy and durability. It ends up weakening me. Currently I can multiply my power up to 5 times with no problem. But, if I want to beat Aizen I must multiply above 7 times... and I don't know how long will I resist...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You don't have to fight him alone\"- Jak said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Maybe... but if things get ugly, at least everyone else will be able to escape...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I don't think Joana would, as I wouldn't leave my Luigi-boogums either\"- Jasmine said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Fighting somebody like Aizen is worlds far from what we've known... I'm afraid to say that he's stronger than anybody we've fought so far... I feel that Aizen fights as an unrestrained Blaze... Yet... he looks familiar... like I knew someone like him in a further past...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You mean he's stronger than Blaze?\"- Joana asked starting to feel scared<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Nope. Stronger than Blaze's last fight's power level. If he was to fight seriously then he'd be probably just as strong or even stronger...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Well... we better go outside... I don't know how much Lith can hold Aizen off...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"LITH WHAT?!!\"- Blake exclaimed<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Lith is fighting Aizen so we could get back here and heal you\"- Joana answered, as they rushed outside the house, until they found the barrier. Blake said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"We can pass through it, only enemies are affected by this barrier. However, I suggest you to stay here\"- Blake said. But he didn't walk out, he was watching Lith fight against Aizen in air. It looked like an even fight. And Lith wasn' even armed. yet, she used lots of advanced techniques and in difference of Blake, she didn't say any incantation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe also moved at extreme speeds, roughly equaling Aizen's, something Blake failed at (Blake's advantage is that Aizen couldn't predict where he would reappear, instead, he used his superior speed to immediately attack Blake. Lith's movement also shares this trait, but is so fast Aizen can't use his speed to keep up. Blake's inability to fly also kept him from air fighting properly)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAizen was slashing at her until she stopped his blade and fired a thunderbolt from her other hand. When Aizen fell, the ground under him reformed into spikes. He quickly recovered and Lith said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"If you can't keep up with this, then you aren't worth to be called a god...\"- Lith then raised her hand and thunderbolts, along fire and ice started to rain. Aizen dodged ith with some difficult and was considering that he might be fighting a real goddess. But, he said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Bakudo #73: Tozansho\"- He was surrouded by a blue inverted pyramid made of energy. Lith fired an emerald beam at it, piercing it. The whole pyramid collapsed but Aizen had disappeared. Suddenly, Lith felt a sharp pain. Aizen's zanpakuto stabbed her from behind. She fell to the ground, and Blake felt an immense rage... also, images flashed back to his mind...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Blaze... Lith... and lots of unknown people, in an unknown place... Blaze stabbed Lith with a strange sword...</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake grabbed his sword, and rushed outside. Aizen looked at him saying<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You healed fast... but your efforts will be useless... this goddess wasn't worth her title...\"-</span></div></div>",

Aizen stopped the attack but felt that Blake was stronger and wasn't transformed. He punched Blake, sending him down against the ground. Blake dodged Aizen's attempt to stab him and blasted a blue energy ball at him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake dashed and tried to stab Aizen again, but he blocked his sword with his hand. Aizen felt some pain when noticed that the sword was cutting through his hand. Then, Blake took out the blade and thrusted it into Aizen's chest, then, he said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Stab his heart... burn him to nothing... explode, mighty blade!! Reduce him to nothing by using my soul!!\"- Blake transformed into light form, and glowed in his aura. Then, his sword started to glow in golden light. Aizen found that he couldn't take it out... Then he muttered...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Damn...\"- There was an immense explosion, and an enormous golden light pillar rose from the place where Aizen and Blake were. Many thunderbolts flashed violently around it. The light pillar slowly decreased, until it disappeared. There was now a very large crater, with Aizen and Blake standing on it. Both of them were badly burnt. Blake took his blade out of Aizen's chest, and dashed backward. Aizen pointed his hand at him, saying<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Bakudo #63: Sajo Sabaku\"- Chains made of yellow light appeared and binded Blake's torso. Aizen said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Your physical strength can't break a level 60 Binding Spell...\"-  He was aware that Blake had broken a level 80 Bakudo with a mere energy blast, but he was confident that without energy attacks, Blake would be nothing. He didn't know that Blake's specialty was hand to hand combat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You sure?\"- Blake's aura changed from its flame-like form to the more jagged electric-like form, this time Blake's muscles tightened, and his golden irises were glowing. Blake unleashed all that raw power to destroy the chains that were binding him. Then, he punched Aizen with great force, drawing blood. This time, Aizen used shunpo to get a point blank attack behind him, but he was surprised that Blake had dodged his sunpo and he fired his own energy beam behind him...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You still want to fight even after that self-destroying attack?\"- Aizen smiled and said -\"Hado #88: Hiryugeki Zokushintenraiho\"- <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA blue electric-like beam was fired from his hand and Blake had no time, nor strength to block it. Instinctively, he extended both hands, and prepared for impact... But... there was no impact... The beam was slowly entering Blake's hands, and being absorbed into him. Soon, the whole beam had been absorbed by Blake, who healed back completely. His aura now had some remaining lightning bolts around. Before they did anything else, a gigantic carnivorous plant rose from under Aizen and trapped him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLith appeared next to Blake and said to Aizen<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You think a mere sword can hurt a goddess? Even you, Aizen, are just a small life trying to linger for longer... even you fear death...\"- Then she looked at Blake, and said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"When did you learn to absorb light based attacks?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I didn't... I just... did it... somehow... I had the feeling to do it...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"That's impressive... Very few angels were capable of absorbing light based attacks... Azrael was one of them... Blake, leave this to me... now that you're fully healed and replenished, go back to the house... I have an account to settle with this self-proclaimed god...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"But, Lith... I thought he had killed you... and... I didn't think you could fight like that...\"- She laughed and said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Of course I can. Once I was an archangel myself, and I am the commander of Chaos' 4th Legion\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Ok, I guess you're right\"- Blake returned to his normal form. When he turned around, Joana and the others were running toward him, and Joana hugged him very tightly<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Blake!! You had me really worried this time!! I thought you had destroyed yourself to stop Aizen!!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"...c...can't...breathe...need...oxygen...\"- Blake said faintly, and Joana realized she was hugging him too tightly<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You really need to stop doing that...\"- Blake said after gasping for air<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Let's go then. Lith sure can handle this...\"- When Jak finished the phrase, the carnivorous plant was sliced and Aizen disappeared using shunpo. He stood in front of Blake, and said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You aren't going anywhere...\"- He was interrupted when Lith landed a kick on his face, sending him a great distance away...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey started to run but in front of them appeared Orochimaru and Naraku, they smiled evilly<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You aren't going anywhere... we're not done yet...\"-  Orochimaru said, as snakes started to come out of his back and shoulders<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"We have business with you...\"- Naraku said, but a fist punched through him, and an evil voice was heard<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I'm sorry, but that's my prey...\"- Naraku fell to the ground, revealing Blaze's presence, he smiled, and said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I know you've missed me so much, didn't you, Blake?\"- Blake had an angry espression. Blaze continued<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Who are those guys anyway? New friends of yours?\"- Orochimaru tried to attack him but Blaze dodged him and punched through his stomach. From Orochiamru's bowels, several snakes started to come out and bit Blaze lots of times. Blaze laughed and asked sarcastically<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Are you trying to poison me, lame human?\"- Orochimaru opened his eyes wide when Blaze smiled, revealing his fangs, and aimed his open hand at his face, firing a purple energy blast. However, a scorpion tail pierced though Blaze's shoulder with its stinger. Naraku's voice was heard<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I feel you're a demon... that's good... I could use a little appetizer before the main dish...\"- Naraku grew lots of tentacles to wrap themselves around Blaze, and engulf him in his own flesh. Blaze was inside him, smiling evilly. Outside, Naraku had grown a very large centipede-like lower body, with six dragonfly-like wings, a gigantic scorpion tail, and lots of additional pincers, and tentacles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Didn't your mother teach you not to eat anything you see?\"- Blaze started to power up, using his raw power to damage the insides of Naraku. He managed, with no difficult, to rip open Naraku's tissue, and walk out. Naraku healed quickly and said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You'll be part of me sooner or later... And what a better moment to have a snack\"- <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Then eat this!!\"- Two purple energy beams struck him from above. Nostory and Seth had appeared<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Just what I needed...\"- Jak said, angry and annoyed<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"We needed those freaks as holes in our heads...\"- Blake added<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"At least they're fighting each other...\"- Jasmine said</span></div></div>",

There's no need to get your hands dirty with these lame attempts of demons...\"- Blaze said, as he vanished and started to perform a punches and kicks combo on Orochimaru. he then kicked him but Orochimaru opened his mouth, a snake came out of it and a sword started to extend forward, piercing right in Blaze's chest. Then, Orochimaru extended his hands and more snakes extended to attack Blaze. He broke the blade and used it to slice off all of the snakes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, Blaze used high spped to get away and fired a large purple beam with his right hand. Orochimaru then out his hands together and said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Summoning: Rashomon\"- The blast exploded when it impacted the huge gate. But Orochimaru was succesful, the gate took all of the damage, it collapsed though. What he didn't see, is that Blaze was already charging another energy blast, and this one was wider and more powerful. Without time to react, nor the gate he had summoned, he took the full force of the impact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaraku then sent a swarm of his hell wasps. However, Blaze created a purple barrier around him and his allies. When the wasps tried to attack the barrier, it killed them. Naraku smiled<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You use a shield... which means that you can be hurt, and that anything that kills demons will affect you as well...\"- Blaze gave his trademark maniac laugh and then said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Blocking attacks and dodging are just instincts... I am much more than you can handle... human...\"- Blaze's shield disappeared, and Naraku, enraged by Blaze's remark, charged at him. Blaze punched him in the face, in the stomach and kicked him. These punches destroyed completely his bone armor. Naraku was bleeding, and breathing heavily<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"How dare you?!!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You thought I couldn't feel it? You're a failed attempt to be a demon... It's natural that we, as the most powerful race, are often copied by all of the other species, humans... spirits... even angels need to imitate us to gain more power... although they're our antithesis, they copy demon traits to be stronger... but none of those cheap copies will never match a true demon... we were solely created to destroy angels, and any other species that would oppose us...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaraku for the first time, grudginly, admitted he was right... But he hated to, and started to release a purple mist. Blaze stayed where he was, while the environment around him was quickly dying and disintegrating, and laughing, said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Are you trying to poison me too? You humans don't understand... poison can't kill superior life forms...\"- <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze fired another single handed beam, completely blowing Naraku's arm, where the miasma was coming from. He regenerated it and Blaze grabbed him by the throat, he started to tighten his grip, saying<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Outta the way. I have more importnt business to do...\"- He tightened his grip so much that Naraku's neck exploded like a tomato. Blaze threw away Naraku's body. Then, two swords pierced through Blaze's shoulders, and Orochimaru said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"We aren't going anywhere... you are the one who will leave this place... dead...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Hmph...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Just great... a duel of maniacs with mental troubles...\"- Jak said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"We'll have to destroy the surviving one anyway...\"- Blake replied<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Lith was still fighting Aizen, and using lots of light based attacks, she got to cause him heavy damage. He was able to heal himself but at the cost of his spiritual energy. Aizen had seriously underestimated her, and now was paying the price. She could block most of his kido attacks since they were element or light based. Aizen also found that his hypnosis was useless against her. Much to his surprise, despite the massive amounts of energy she was using, she didn't look tired at all. He then decided to make a risky move, he put his hands together, saying<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Bakudo #99, part 2: Bankin!! Shokyoku Shiryu ...\"- Fabric started to cover Lith, binding her arms, throwing her to the ground, and stacked to it with iron shafts forming a X shape<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Nikyoku, Hyakurensa\"- Metal bolts appeared and stabbed Lith...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Shukyoku... Bankin Taiho!!\"- An immense metal cube appeared and fell down right on Lith, smashing her. The force of the impact created a small earthquake and cracked part of the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Hmph... Goddess... Maybe you weren't worth the title after all...\"-</span></div></div>",

I have business to do here. I came to kill my enemies, and the likes of theirs...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Is that so?\"- Blaze said defiantly<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I don't care if you killed those two, but, don't think I'm at the same level...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Then show me what you've got!!\"- Blaze laughed maniacally as he dashed toward Aizen, punching him in the face, and sending him away. Blaze disappeared and reappeared right in front of Aizen, he delivered another powerful punch that even created shockwaves. Aizen slowed down by making friction against the ground, leaving deep marks on it. He grabbed his zanpakuto and said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Shatter K...\"- He was interrupted when Blaze grabbed his weapon, and clenched his hand, breaking it. Aizen for the first time gasped<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What?! Didn't you command it to shatter? I'm so nice I did it for you... now what?\"- Blaze said. Aizen used shunpo to appear behind him, but when he slashed, Blaze was no longer there. He reappeared in front of him, both hands extended, and fired a purple beam at him. The explosion was big, and lots of dust blocked Aizen's sight. Blaze attacked him from above with more purple energy beams that created even more explosions. Aizen quickly escaped, just to find Blaze in front of him, he said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Neither you knew I wasn't at the level you thought...\"- He fired a large beam with both hands. The smoke and dust dissipated and Blaze said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Garbage taken out... now, down to business\"- Blaze said, when a dual blue beam perced through him, he fell to the gorund, Aizen used shunpo to appear behind him. He said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"It takes more to kill a god...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You're right...\"- Blaze said as he vanished and reappeared in front of Aizen. His wounds healed themselves, Aizen thought<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Healing without any technique? He seems to be of the same species of that teenager and that woman...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I am a god myself, but I serve a higher authority...\"- Blaze said, everyone were in shock with Blaze saying such a thing<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Blaze, the guy who claims to be a god serves someone else?\"- Joana exclaimed<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Omega 17...\"- Blake muttered, then he saw more images in his mind:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn unknown place, that looked unwordly... Blaze... in strange clothes... Lith... A brown haired angel with a large sword and purplish armor... A fully armored demon... wielding an immense sword... three dead angels... a beam... piercing through his chest... the image of Blaze firing it... the feeling of death... the anger...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake fell to the ground, nearly dismayed, worrying Joana<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Blake!! What happened?!!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"N...it's nothing...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Blake...\"- Joana said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I think so much hits on my head have had some effect... I'll be okay, but I'll need a good rest after this...\"- Joana didn't trust Blake's answer. She felt that Blake was different, she senses that Blake felt fear... anger... but couldn't understand why... the sole presence of Blaze didn't cause this. Blake definitively saw something...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack to the villains, Blaze said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"This fight is nonsense. You can't beat me... so, step aside and leave this in the hands of the pros...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Why don't you make me move then?\"- Aizen said, blocking Blaze's incoming fist<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Okay then...\"- Blaze said, as he started to power up, a purple aura surrounded him, and purple lightning bolts flashed around him. The wind swirled violently, and the ground around him sank into a small crater. Aizen did so as well, without an aura, but the air around them felt heavier and thicker. Both adversaries kept increasing their powers and Aizen stopped<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Well then... it seems you're worthy... Aizen... join us...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"WHAT THE...?!!!\"- Everyone (even Naraku, Orochimaru, Nostory and Seth)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You want to become a god? Then follow me... I'm also searching for ultimate power...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"We'd need to recover the Hogyoku first...\"- Aizen said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Hogyowhat?!! Forget about that!! I need to release Omega 17... the evil god... he will grant us unlimited power...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Why are you so sure?\"- Aizen questioned him calmly<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I've worked for him for thousands of years... Some bastard sealed him and most of my own power...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What do you mean?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I have only access to a small part of my true power... obviously, with all these years my power in this body has increased...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Body... aren't you a spirit?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I got this body to prevent being killed by those bastards... Anyway, a body is useful...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"How? The only thing it does is to bind your powers...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Are you stupid? The body might limit you at some degree, but with training you get over the limits... and it protects your soul from damage...\"- Aizen was now surprised<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Haven't you wondered why that boy put up so much fight? His attacks damaged directly your soul, as you have no body to protect it!!\"- Blaze exclaimed -\"He's descendant of an old fellow of mine... and that bastard's specialty was soul damage...\"- Aizen opened his eyes wide at this information 'How didn't I figure it out before?!!' He thought to himself<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"So, all we need to do is to kill those guys and get away with it?\"- Orochimaru said while walking toward them<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Most of them... but I need the guy who kicked your asses alive...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Why?!! He's the most dangerous!!\"- Orochimaru exclaimed<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Because he's the Key to release Omega... He's the angel of darkness... the one that will bring apocalypse...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake opened his eyes wide when Blaze said that. 'So... Alexander was right... Is it really my destiny? Was I born to solely revive the evil being that threatens to destroy the world?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Are you okay?\"- Joana's sweet voice snapped Blake's thoughts<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Yeah... I think...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You better get ready... we'll have to fight all of these guys...\"- Jak said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I know...\"- Blake said. But Joana felt that something was wrong with him... something in his voice felt different...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, Blake, Joana, Jak and Jasmine stood in fighting stance against their enemies...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jak and Jasmine started their fight against Nostory and Seth. Aizen, Blaze, Orochimaru and Nraku stood in front of Joana and Blake. She whispered<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I'll have to use my powers... I can't let you fight them alone...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\" *Sigh* Ok then... It seems I have no other choice...\"- Blake said, and Lith suddenly appeared, she said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Aizen, did you think that a metal cube was enough to stop me?\"- With that, both he and Lith disappeared, leaving Blaze, Orochimaru and Naraku vs Blake and Joana. She said to Blake<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Fight Blaze... I'll take care of those two...\"- He nodded, and dashed backward to get away from Joana (for safety). Blaze immediately reappeared in front of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Are you ready to become the Key?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Nope. I'm ready to kick your ass!!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"We'll see about that...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze dashed toward Blake to punch him, he dodged and started a long combo of punches on Blaze. Then, they started high speed combat, which Blake was able to keep up with. Blake kicked Blaze, sending him about 100 feet away. Blaze reappeared in front of Blake smiling, he dashed and tried to attack Blake from behind, but he countered with an elbow hit. Then, punched Blaze's stomach. Blaze fired a purple energy ball, the  explosion sent both fighters away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey dashed toward each other and started fighting hand to hand, and they were still even, Blake's 13 years of fighting were matching well against the millenniums Blaze had of experience. This time, Blaze sensed that Blake wasn't getting tired, and that his energy flow was more controlled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I see... you have really trained this time... BUT...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"But what?!!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"It won't be enough to beat me...\"- Blaze's red eyes glowed for a moment, and this time, Blake got the tip. Blaze punched him and Blake blocked with his arms in an X shape. Blaze definitely was using more power. Now all Blake was able to do was to block and perform a few counter attacks. Blaze started to laugh while punching and kicking<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What happened?! You seemed happy about reaching this fighting level...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I'm not happy... and this isn't my full power...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You are at your limits right now... You aren't going to beat me with that power\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Totally wrong... and... yeah... I'm not going to beat you... I'm going to KILL you!!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>[Background Music: Nemesis Theory - Show no Tears <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjzujfDrQ64\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjzujfDrQ...</a> ]</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake transformed into his light state. His hair rose up and his eyes became golden. He dashed toward Blaze, punching him, disappearing, and connecting a knee hit on the back of his neck. While falling, Blake connected an impressive combo on Blaze, and right before he landed, Blake punched him, sending him downward, and creating a deep hole in the ground. Blaze quickly emerged from it and attacked Blake, but he was no longer there. A golden beam struck him from behind and Blake continued with a barrage of energy balls, each one hit their target. The continuous explosions created lots of smoke<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze was surprised to see lots of silhouettes, to his knowledge, Blake had not control over high leveled techniques. And much more to his surprise, a golden energy beam hit him from the left, and immediately was punched by Blake in the stomach. Blaze took the chance to fire a point blank energy beam at him but Blake dodged it, his hand glowed in pale golden light and punched Blaze with greater strength, sending him away out of sight. The smoke and dust dissipated and suddenly Blaze appeared a few meters in front of Blake<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'That was no ordinary attack... that punch damaged slightly my soul... where the hell did he learn that attack? Abaddon... Azrael... bastards, I hate you so much...'  Blaze thought, as he kept fighting Blake. They were definitvely roughly at the same level, Blake with the upper hand. He shot again a barrage of golden energy balls at Blaze<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze deflected an energy ball that nearly hit Blake, and started shooting lots of powerful purple beams, Blake then started to glow and his flaming aura surrounded his body*, he used his enhanced speed to dash toward Blaze, kick him upward, and connect a high speed combo while they were in air. Blake kicked Blaze downward but he managed to grab Blake's foot, so both of them fell to the ground. Blaze still took the worst part of the impact though. He wiped off the blood of his left lips corner, saying<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"It seems you can already use that light power properly... but as I told you, you won't be match for me!! Darkness engulfs all!!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey engaged again into high speed close combat, Blake was punching and kicking Blaze a lot, until Blake shot an energy ball, barely missing Blaze, but raising lots of dust and smoke due to the explosion. Blaze emerged from it and fired his own purple energy beams at Blake, he dodged them with no problem and used his high speed to disappear and quickly reappear behind Blaze, punching his back (to damage his vertebral spine). Then, he appeared in front of Blaze and with a swift move, he hit Blaze's nose upward with his hand and said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Destroy... ancient lights... erase the souls of the fallen ones...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake shot a gigantic pale golden beam, right into Blaze's mouth... The beam pierced through Blaze's head and enveloped all of his body, disintegrating it, his head burnt as well... then... there was nothing left except the ashes of what just some moments ago was Blake's nemesis...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><font class=\"size2\" style=\"\">*Blake's aura somewhat gives a hint of the power increasing he uses: <br>\r\n<br>\r\n- When it's a golden gently flaming outward, the power Blake uses represents no problem and it means he can use it for long periods of time. Currently, the only stable output Blake can handle for long time is x3<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-When it's still flaming, but more jagged and STILL outward, it means that Blake is using an increased amount of power, he still hasn't problem handling it but it will last significantly less than the previous output. Blake has this aura currently when multiplies his power to x5<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-When the aura becomes even MORE jagged, electric-like and starts to flow upward, it means that Blake is forcing his power to more than he can handle. The more power he forces, the worse the side effects will be. When Blake reaches this status, his power gets a great boost, but at the cost of a short time to fight, dangerously lowered stamina, insanely high energy consumption just to mantain the aura, also, any damage he receives in this state is far worse than it should be. His muscles become extremely tight, his veins become more noticeable, his eyes glow, different from before when they were just golden colored. Currently, x7 and beyond make Blake go in this state.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe more Blake increases his energy, strength, and mastery, the more power multipliers he will be able to handle. Blake is still at a very early stage of the usage of this technique, though, it bears mentioning that at his very first light transformation when Blaze clones attacked, Blake's power was quickly drained by a x2 multiplying aura. However, at the time it was an unknown ability, and Blake had no knowledge of how it worked</font></b></span></div></div>",

'If I can, I'll try to not use too much energy...' Jak went on ahead, and dashed toward Nostory once more. Jasmine and Yasmin were exchanging kicks and punches, in a deadlocked air duel. Jasmine then grabbed hold of Yasmin, and then grew. Yasmin was trying to break out, but with Jasmine at a new height, she was trapped.

She could fight Orochimaru with mere strength and speed, but fighting Naraku was dangerous as she learned that his hell wasps and miasma were lethal for humans. Suddenly, a golden beam struck him from the sky and Blake appeared in front of Joana, he said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I finished my business early... need help?\"- Joana was truly surprised that Blake had beaten Blaze, she asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"He... he ran way, didn't he?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Nope... look, there\"- Blake pointed his finger to a place where nobody was. The only thing that was on the ground were lots of ashes. Joana was confused<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"There's nobody...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"The ashes... that's Blaze...\"- Joana had an O.O face, and she then hugged Blake and kissed him. He said, blushing<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"It's not the moment for that... now we have to take care of the others...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake fired a one-handed golden beam through Naraku and at the same time, with his other hand, blew off Orochimaru's head with another energy beam. Naraku then started to release miasma from the hole in his chest, and Blake was totally unaffected. He then saw how Orochimaru came out of his previously beheaded body. He dashed at him and Blake dodged him by jumping. Orochimaru ran into Naraku because of this, and when they looked at Blake, he had placed his open hand on the ground<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Purify, Soul Vanisher... Bring the judgement of light...\"- Again, on the ground appeared this symbol <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_m1ALyYSRw9U/StMxkGWAE0I/AAAAAAAAGyI/wApwBP2hn60/s400/yu+gi+oh.bmp\" target=\"_blank\">http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_m1ALyYSRw9U/St...</a> around Naraku and Orochimaru, its diameter was about 20 feet<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNor the demon nor the ninja were able to move. Blake continued<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Consume the darkness, sentence to death... Incinerate, heavenly lights!!\"- Six golden light pillars rose from the ground, and a seventh came from beneath them, then, it increased its width,  covering all the other pillars and the whole symbol. After a while, it slowly decreased until all of the pillars disappeared. Orochimaru and Naraku were very badly burnt. However, Orochimaru moved very fast and locked Blake's arms from behind, Naraku grew a lower scorpion body with three tails and lots of pincers. A white beam pierced through Naraku, creating a large hole in his chest, and a cian barrier surrounded Blake, it burnt Orochimaru and forced him to release Blake<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was surprised to see that Joana had just saved him... He scratched the back of his head and said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"That was a close one... uh... could you remove this barrier now?...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Nope\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What?!!\"- Blake attempted to break the barrier and Joana said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I'm healing you and replenishing your energy. I saw that when you do that powerful attack you get tired...\"- Joana said soothingly, Blake sighed and said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Those are advanced techniques... weren't supposed for a human to perform...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"But you do... and... how come you weren't affected by that lethal mist thing?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"...I'm not sure...\"- Blake answered confused<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"At least you weren't so badly hurt. Replenishing your energy will be easy\"- Joana said, as her hands glowed in white. In conjunction with her barrier, Blake's energy was being replenished and his body healed from minor wounds. Blake looked at the giant Jasmine throw her evil clone and shooting a beam at her. Blake then observed Jak having a hard time. Joana was done healing him and the barrier around Blake disappeared, he said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Well... we better help Jak a little, don't you think?\"- Joana nodded, but Blaze's maniacal laugh echoed through the whole place. Blake immediately turned around and saw the burnt place where he had supposedly killed Blaze. The ashes emerged and started to reform Blaze's body, even his clothes*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n[Background Music: Bleach - What can you see in their eyes <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIL5Fi6Ue4Y\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIL5Fi6Ue...</a> ]<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze was completely reformed and said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Not bad Blake... but I told you, you can't win, I am TRULY immortal!!!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake's hands trembled. He had used a high level light technique that burnt every organ, tissue and every physical element in Blaze's body... how could he reform himself?!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I guess I underestimated you, but let me tell you something: Long time ago, I fought Abaddon, Uriel and Raphael... once called 'The three unbeatable angels'... I killed them all, and they were the strongest archangels ever... Azrael couldn't defeat me either, he was just a weak wimp, but still an archangel... you, a sad failure of angel won't beat me neither...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake then thought 'Lith said Azrael was the last archangel... she never said he was the strongest... is Blaze right?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I will show you the TRUE difference between us!!\"- Blaze started to power up, a purple aura glowed and surrounded him. It was flame-like, but it moved upward and more violently than Blake's. The whole land started to tremble, the wind roared and swirled violently, as if it there was a hurricane. Lightning bolts flashed in the sky, and thunders shook the ground. The quakes and the wind were so powerful that it seemed like the whole place would be destroyed. The ground cracked severely. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake stood in front of Blaze, and slowly, but determined, began to walk toward him...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Fight me, fake angel!! I'll show you how weak you really are!!\"- Blaze screamed<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><font class=\"size2\" style=\"\">*Blaze dresses somewhat like Blake, but with gray and white colors instead: He wears a white jacket over a light gray shirt. Although his jacket is long tailed while Blake's not. He also wears white jeans and black shoes that resemble both boots and tennis.

They dashed toward each other, but this time, Blaze disappeared and Blake hadn't even time to react as he was above him. Blaze fired a point blank dual purple beam with both hands at Blake. The beam sent him down, and it made an immense and very deep crater in the ground. A golden light pillar rose from it and when it vanished, Blake ascended, glowing in his golden aura, he muttered<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Dammit...\"- Blaze was already in front of him and punched him with tremendous force, Blaze kept connecting lots of punches and kicks, Blake couldn't even tell where the attacks were coming from. Blaze whispered<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What's wrong? Is this too much for you?!! Is my sealed power too much for the little fake?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake tried to fire a golden beam but Blaze was way faster, then, Blake tried to fire two golden beams (one with each hand) in different directions. Both missed, and caused great damage to the ground with large explosions. Blake had no time to do nor even think anything as Blaze already was grabbing him from behind the neck and smashed his face on the ground. Blaze then started to fly at an unbelievable speed, dragging Blake on the ground. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen he threw Blake away, and fired a barrage purple beams, nobody had seen anyone throwing so much beams so fast. and every one of those hit Blake. Then, Blaze disappeared and reappeared in front of Blake, who was laying on the ground. He said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You see? I fought the other archangels with all my power. Now it's sealed and still you can't do nor see anything... do you understand the huge difference between us? You're nothing... the only reason I haven't killed you already is because I need your power to release lord Omega!!\"- Thenm he grabbed Blake by the throat and continued<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Now, where's your real body? I need both you and that body to accomplish my mission. Where is it?!!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"It got lost somewhere...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Wrong answer...\"- He punched Blake in the stomach and smashed him on the ground again. this time, the impact caused a small crater. He then looked at everyone else: Jak fighting Nostory. Shadow was fighting Seth. Lith was against Aizen... Jasmine was seemingly done, and Joana... Blaze smiled, and disappeared (this is the effect caused by faster than eye speeds, yet, Blaze's speed is much higher than everyone else's except Aizen)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoana gasped when Blaze simply appeared in front of her, saying<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Give me Blake's body, now!!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I don't have it... and even if I did, I wouldn't give it to a monster like you!!\"- <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Wrong way to speak to a God, girl...\"- Joana then fired a white light beam at him, and it pierced a hole through Blaze's shoulder. He groaned, and looked at her angrier than ever. His eyes were not only red as before, but now they were glowing... in that bloody red color... Then he punched Joana and pinned her down, with his hand on her face, he said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I'll say it once again... WHERE...IS...BLAKE'S REAL BODY?!!\"- No answer was said since a punch struck Blaze from the left, sending him nearly 300 feet away. Blake stood before him, and this time, he looked deeply angry. He said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You were wrong Blaze... I wasn't using my true power either...\"- Blake's aura became more jagged, and it flowed upward instead of outward as usual. It also looked more electrical than fire-like. Blake's eyes started to glow, his muscles tightened a lot. And golden lightning bolts flashed around him. Blake extended his hand and his sword came back to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Let's see if the failure is as weak as you say, Blaze!!\"- He dashed at him and punched Blaze in the stomach, then, he kicked him upward, which sent him to above 200 feet in the air. Blake jumped and appeared above Blaze, and said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Sacred flames...in the name of Chaos... delete this evil soul!!*\"- Blake blasted a reddish beam, it wasn't as wide as the others, just barely engulfed Blaze, but when it brought Blaze down, it created an insanely large explosion. Almost like a nuclear bomb's, but instead of smoke, a huge column of fire rose after the explosion. This fire didn't look like ordinary fire, instead of the red/orange/yellow color, this fire was entirely red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake landed some seconds later and much to his surprise, Blaze was standing in the center of the crater (which was at least half of a kilometer wide). He was burnt but obviously Blake wouldn't expect him to be alive from a point blank high level technique with incantation plus his aura at maximum power. Blaze charged a dark purple energy ball in his hand and said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Now let's turn the tables...\"- He threw the ball upward and it created a dome that surrounded the whole place. The sky and the sun were no longer visible. Only a black sky. Everything was now in deep darkness**.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I told you before... darkness engulfs all!! And my power of darkness will overwhelm everything!!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake dashed at him and punched Blaze in the face, Blaze countered with a punch as well, but Blake took the chance and slashed him with his sword. It was a vertical slash that cut Blaze from his right shoulder to roughly above his waist. Blake slashed him several more times, and thrusted his sword in Blaze's chest. He smiled and fired a powerful beam at him, it sent him backward. Blake got up but noticed how Blaze was bleeding<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I hate that thing...\"- Blaze muttered, as his wounds were closing very slowly. Blake dashed toward him, firing a point blank energy ball. In the smoke, Blake saw multiple silhouettes and tried to attack, but soon Blaze was punching, kicking and smashing him. Blake kicked upward and swiftly got up. He started to connect a high speed mid-air combo on Blaze, punching him with all his might, he also slashed with his sword and sent him down with a large golden beam.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then punched through Blaze's chest as they were falling, and before Blake gave a finishing blow, his eyes opened wide, and reverted to normal. He felt his heart skipping beats... he barely had time to realize he was having a heart attack, and could do nothing about it... Blake fell to unconsciousness, and despite his hair and eyes turned back to normal, his damaged and strained body remained like it was still transformed. Blaze got up, took Blake's fist out of his chest and smiled<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"It seems I was right. You weren't meant to have this power... and this PROVES it...\"- He left him on the ground and walked threateningly toward Joana...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><font class=\"size2\" style=\"\">*The reference of Chaos indicates that this spell was created after Chaos died, about 50,000 years ago<br>\r\n** This means that the whole Rose's homeworld dimension was in deep darkness</font></b></span></div></div>",

Then she saw Blake falling, his energy extinguishing, she feared the worst. And also noticed Blaze's glare. Her hands glowed as she was preparing two powerful beams. Blaze disappeared and was already in front of her. Joana dashed back and fired the two beams, Blaze protected himself with his arms crossed. They still took damage and were badly burnt, Joana's light power damaged him severely, even with the darkness around him to his favor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"It's useless to fight. Now I rule this place...\"- Blaze said, Joana kept dashing backward, and when Blaze disappeared, she fired a beam behind her without seeing. It hit him, as she had predicted, but Blaze grabbed her anyway. He locked her arms from behind. Joana still charged energy in them so they burnt Blaze. She quickly turned around and fired the energy balls into his face, and much to his surprise, his regeneration was faster now that everything was dark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze punched her in the stomach and pinned her down again. Joana kicked him in the stomach and she pinned him down with her foot. Then she started to grow. She pressed harder with her now enormous foot so she could crush Blaze, and stomped on him, creating a large crater and a small quake. She immediately walked toward Blake and picked him up, he was unconscious, and she couldn't tell if he was still alive. But she had no time to heal him because Blaze flew toward her and kicked her (yes, he kicked a giantess) in the back, with such force that Joana fell down. Fortunately, she didn't crush Blake as she had him still in her hand. She used her speed to try to overwhelm Blaze and fired a now giant white energy beam.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze was still floating there, and despite the right half of his body was destroyed, he quickly regenerated it back. Then he disappeared, and reappeared above Joana. He fired a colossal purple beam with both hands that engulfed Joana completely. It was so powerful that she fell down, with little energy left, and reverted to her original size. Blaze landed on the ground and grabbed her by the throat again, and started to strangle her. Joana's cries and screams were echoing in Blake's head... in his mind, he was saying<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Get up!! Get up!!! GET...UP GODDAMN CHEAP BODY!!!! GET FREAKIN' UP!!! DO SOMETHING!!!\"- He was growing angry because he was hearing it all and could do nothing about it. Suddenly, his eyes opened, and he felt almost like he wasn't in a body. He got up and looked at Blaze and Joana. He felt a new power fueling him, but also another will trying to govern his thoughts, he already knew what it meant. So, he ran toward Blaze, and punched him with such strength that sent him more than 400 feet away. Joana was amazed to see Blake still up. He turned around and said firmly to her<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Joana...kill me now...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What?!!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Shoot an energy beam at my heart... Hurry up!!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"B..but why?!!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"It... It is taking over... the darkness... soon... I won't be myself...\"- Blake said, and Joana was now worried. 'Is it so dangerous that Blake wants me to kill him?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I can't do it\"- Joana replied<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Fine...\"- Blake answered<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake dashed toward Blaze and locked his arms, then he shouted<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"One way or the other, you won't get away with anything!! If I die, your plans will be screwed...\"- Blaze opened his eyes wide at this statement<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I have no descendants so if I die, your can kiss goodbye your hopes of ever getting your power back...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Bastard...\"- Blaze muttered<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"But you won't have much time to complain about... I'm taking you with me to hell!!!\"- Blake started to gather (this time black and fire-like) energy and he started to glow in a black aura, his grip on Blaze was very tight and he said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Blake... you know that if you fail at killing me, I'm gonna kill everyone else?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"But you'll never get your powers back, nor your pride...\"- Blake answered, which angered Blaze because it was true. Blake whispered -\"See ya\"- And then he created an explosion using his body as a cathalyst, this explosion was also insanely huge, and besides the smoke, black fire lingered. Blaze had his lower body completely destroyed, and Blake was laying behind him, unconscious and badly burnt. Blaze said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Idiot...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>[Background Music: Skillet - Monster <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWERYqWs5xY\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWERYqWs5...</a> ]</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake stood up, but he had a different look. He looked like a living dead. Blaze raised an eyebrow, and Blake screamed furiously, his voice sounded inhuman and metallic now. Blake's skin turned grayish, his eyes became pupil-less, his muscles rew and tightened, and his hair rose up, and waved upward like a flame. Blaze smiled<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Just what I needed...\"- He shot a chain made of purple electric-like energy at him, but Blake deflected it with his hand. Blaze was now surprised<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Blake's dark form had roughly half of the power I'm using now... what's going on??...' He thought, and then his question was answered. As Blake was screaming furiously, claws grew in his hands, his light grayish skin tone became darker, and two wings emerged from his back (Obviously, they tore Blake's back but it healed back immediately). These wings were black but weren't demon-like. They had black feathers, and were still dripping with blood. Blaze had the feeling something had just gone wrong...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he thought anything, Dark Blake was in front of him and fired a gigantic black beam. Blaze was thrown back by the impact but Dark Blake was flying above him and smashed him on the ground with his hand. He began to tighten his grip, sinking his claws in Blaze's face, and suddenly, he did a ripping motion, tearing off half of Blaze's face with only brute strength. Blaze groaned in pain and fired a dark purple energy beam, much to his surprise, Dark Blake stopped it with his bare hand, compressing it into a ball, and threw it back at him. The explosion was enormous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDark Blake roared with a more metallic sounding voice, and Blaze saw his fangs. He smiled, and said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"No matter how much you look like a demon, your power will never match mine... you're just a mindless beast...\"- Dark Blake grabbed him by the troat and with his other hand, pierced through Blaze's chest, then, he ripped apart his head and threw his beheaded body to the ground. Then, aimed with his hand and charged up energy in it. When he fired, a huge column of black energy rose from the place of impact (Like this <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://images1.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20100225174060/dragonball/images/e/e2/TurlesVsPiccolo.png\" target=\"_blank\">http://images1.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20...</a> but the column of energy is black, and is much wider)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Orochimaru walked closer toward Joana, but a kick in the face sent him about 30 feet away. Karina had just come, and seeing the whole situation, said to Joana<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"It seems that they awakened the beast once more...\"- Joana looked at how Blake was wildly attacking Blaze with no mercy, and she felt guilty because her screams and cries while Blaze threatened her life were what awakened Blake's inner darkness. Karina picked the wounded Joana up and started to run away...</span></div></div>",

His body mass increased, as well as his power. But Jak knew he had to make this transformation count. For he knew that this was probably going to be his only chance to rid himself of his nemesis. Jak dashed toward Nostory, and in a swift motion, Nostory side stepped him, shooting a dark energy blast at him. Jak got hit from behind, but recovered quickly, and delivered a roundhouse kick to Nostory, sending him a distance away. Jak then pursuited toward Nostory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJasmine and Shadow were taking care of Seth, who in turn got the power increase. Jasmine was fighting at 50 ft, in the meantime, Seth was taking on both of them with ease. Seth then broke through their attack, and punched Shadow, getting more room. Jasmine starting shooting energy beams, trying to hit Seth, but he gathered it in his hand, and turn it into his own attack, firing it at Jasmine. Jasmine got out of the way, but got a bit nicked by it. Shadow came back for more, but Seth again side-stepped, but this time he kicked Shadow, and then started to raise his hand. A circle that at least covered the area of Shadow appeared, and shone brightly, in a purple color. Then, in a fast motion, Seth raised his hand higher, and a purple beam engulfed Shadow. \"SHADOW!!!!!\" Jasmine said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJak was keeping up, but still losing. Nostory had a purple beam in hand. He clenched it, and it became purple lighting. Jak did some damage to Nostory, but it wasn't close to defeating him. Nostory in a split second dashed at Jak and was going in for the kill. Jasmine saw this, and was running toward her boyfriend in a hurry, as Jak covered his eyes thinking it was the end, but he saw Jasmine, diving in the way of the dash attack. \"NO!!!!!!\" Jak said. \"Jasmine, don't...please...\" \"I'm fine...\" Jasmine said, \"It won't kill me, but I think you have to take it from here.\" Jasmine teleported to where Karina was, but soon passed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, that takes care of her.\u201d Nostory said.  Jak knew that Jasmine was still alive, but he was in a tough spot, and needed something\u2026or someone. In a last ditch effort, he reverted to his standard Omega Form, but then his aura started to show again. He spread his arms out, and closed his eyes. Nostory however wasn\u2019t going to have it, but Shadow quickly shot a beam at him, which was more than enough time for Jak to prep his attack. Jak then had two somewhat huge energy balls in his hands, and in quick succession, he fired one at Nostory, which blindsided him, and then at Seth, which also coming to finish off Shadow, but got hit as well. Then Jak reverted to his norm, and looked toward Blake, who was controlled by the darkness again. \u201cI know I might get myself killed, but Blake needs help.\u201d Jak was inspired by Blake\u2019s will not to give up, and he decided to help him. \u201cThis is for you Jasmine.\u201d  He powered up, back to his Omega Form, and zoomed toward Blake and Blaze.<br>\r\nNostory and Seth were hurt, but could still fight. \u201cThis isn\u2019t over Jak.\u201d Nostory said. \u201cWe are in our element now.

He had gonelike this because he was determined to protect Joana. He saw how Dark Blake destroyed and tore apart Blaze's body, to then fire insane amounts of energy at him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDark Blake roared with a metallic echoing sounding voice, he forced his hand inside Blaze's throat and fired an energy ball that made his whole body to explode. He reformed and said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I can't believe a human can resemble a demon this much\"- He then readied purple energy balls while saying<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"But you're still mortal...\"- Blaze shot a powerful beam at him, destroying his whole left arm and the left half of the torso. Dark Blake roared again and his left side started to reform. Blaze opened his eyes wide<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Impossible!!! That's the demonic healing factor!!! How the hell can a human have it?!!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn that moment, two purple beams struck Dark Blake from above. Nostory and Seth landed on the ground<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"So... is this Blake's true form?\"- Nostory asked, scratching his chin<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Sorta...\"- Blaze answered<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I still owe him a knuckle sandwich from our last encounter...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Don't be overconfident... He's pretty tough\"- Blaze said, which surprised both Nostory and Seth, as they already knew that Blaze stated that Blake was a sad failure, an attempt to copy demons' power...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three demons attacked him, Blaze engaged into hand to hand fight while Nostory and Seth started to shoot beams and energy balls at him. Jak decided that it was the moment to help<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>[Background Music: Bleach - Stand up be strong <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZSp8CJLZg8&amp;feature=related\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZSp8CJLZ...</a> ]</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nJak fired a beam right into Nostory's back, and with that distraction, Dark Blake was able to kick Seth and pin Nostory down with his hand. He was about to blow his head off with a beam when Blaze managed to punch him and send him away. Dark Blake slowed down with his wings and flew toward them. Meanwhile Jak was blocking Nostory and Seth's punches. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDark Blake appeared and grabbed both Nostory and Seth with each hand and threw them away. Then, he stood in front of Jak. He didn't know what to do, nor what to say. No expression was visible in those iris-less eyes. Jak stepped back, expecting a wild barrage of punches or energy beams, but Dak Blake was seemingly staring at him, then, he turned around and continued to fight the three demons. Jak was surprised<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Maybe he's somehow resisting darkness' influence?\"- He muttered and went to attack, this time, firing a white beam at Blaze. He turned around angrily and when was about to punch Jak, a hand pierced through Blaze's chest. Dark Blake had just done that, and threw Blaze away. He said, still with the metallic echoing voice<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Jaaak...\"- Jak was truly surprised and noticed that Dark Blake was only fighting Nostory, Seth and Blaze. They fought  in air, Jak decided to help him, and try to not push his current luck. Jak flew toward them and connected a downward kick on Seth, while Dark Blake was beheading Blaze for about the 20th time. He fired an energy beam at Nostory and slowly landed on the ground, waiting for his enemies to attack again. Jak said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Don't you think that beheading Blaze maybe... just maybe... doesn't work?\"- The only response Jak got as a metallic sounding low grunt. Suddenly, a beam was fired from somewhere, and had Jak's name on it. He prepared to block but before it impacted, a black feathered wing extended right in front of him and took the blast. The explosion was small but destroyed most of the wing. It was bleeding. Jak looked at Dark Blake's face, no expression yet. He simply retracted his wing back and started to grow back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, Dark Blake opened them again and when Blaze appeared, he dashed toward him, grabbing him by the back of the head and smashing his face against the ground. Seth fired a wide purple beam with his two hands that created a large explosion. Dark Blake was still standing there and with a single flap of his wings, dissipated the smoke. Blaze stared angrily at him, and started to shoot a frantic barrage of energy beams. Dark Blake disappeared before any of those hit him, and reappeared right above Blaze, with his open hand aiming at his face<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe fired an immense beam that nearly disintegrated Blaze. Then, he started to air fight against Nostory and Seth, he kicked Nostory and Jak appeared, firing a white light beam that exploded at contact, the already hurt Nostory was now more burnt. Jak also fired two energy balls at Seth, who was struggling with Dark Blake. Seth groaned in pain and looked angrily at Jak<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You little bastard!!\"- He dashed at full speed toward him but Dark Blake appeared right before he connected the punch, stopping it with his open hand. Nostory also appeared in front of them and fired energy beams at Jak, which Dark Blake blocked extending his wings. Blaze then appeared suddenly, piercing through Dark Blake's abdomen, smiling<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I found your weakpoint, angel of darkness...\"- He took his arm out of Dark Blake's body, and he slowly started to fall down. Jak powered up and his white aura surrounded him. Now he was angry. Blake still had the will to protect those who he cared about, even in that state, and those three bastards had just wounded him. Jak started to fire white beams, in a desperate barrage that heavily damaged Seth and Blaze. Nostory got to dodge most of the beams and punched Jak. He also fell down to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom above, Blaze started to charge a different purple beam, this one, made the wind swirl around him, and had a darker hue of purple, he said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Did you think you were the only one able to perform battle spells? Of course I can, and I don't need to say incantations neither...\"- He fired a wide dark purple beam that was heading right on Jak and Dark Blake... speaking of him... he wasn't laying on the grund anymore, he flew upward, toward the beam, he stopped it with his hands and kept flying toward Blaze, pushing the beam toward his caster, he muttered<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Crap...\"- The insanely nuclear-like explosion  briefly illuminated the now sunk in darkness place. Jak then noticed Dark Blake and Blaze standing there, badly burnt, but alive. This time, Blaze punched him downward and charged another beam like the previous one. This time, he fired it solely to Blake, and he deflected it with his wings. Then, Nostory appeared behind him, and locked his arms and wings from behind. Seth and Blaze prepared a dual dark beam to kill him<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly</span></div></div>",

Jak and Karina, who had come just in time. Jak asked her<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Shouldn't you seek a safe place for the girls?\"- He had noticed that Karina had been carrying both Joana and Jasmine (to move faster)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I couldn't let those punks to kill Blake... He's been my friend for 9 years...\"- Joana, who barely could move, did an effort to stand up. Jasmine helped her, and Joana asked, with a faint voice<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Is that Blake?\"- She looked at him in detail. She noticed that he had claws, and fangs, and the already characteristic iris and pupil-less eyes, but then noticed his black feathered wings. She muttered softly<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"He... he doesn't look like a demon to me... he looks more... like an angel... one that is confused...\"- Everyone were O.O? at the statement, but Jak already had perceived something similar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"If it makes you feel better... he is still resisting the darkness... he protected me from incoming attacks, and saved both of us by making Blaze's own beam explode right into his face...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoana smiled. Dark Blake meanwhile had just sent away Blaze, pinned down Nostory and blasted a beam on Seth. All of them were gathering energy from the surrounding darkness, which made them stronger. Dark Blake dashed back, and turned around. He stared at everyone. Karina had an amazed expression, Joana looked at him lovingly. He looked away for a moment. It seemed that only Joana could perceive where or whom he was staring at. Jasmine on the other said, was scared of his form. He somewhat resembled Nostory and Seth, and that was the scary thing. She didn't feel safe with him. Jak calmed her down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Blaze appeared in front of him, as well as Nostory, Seth, Naraku and Orochimaru. Blaze, Nostory and Seth fired beams at his friends, and Dark Blake answered with an angry roar and extending his wings to shield his friends. In that moment, Orochimaru's snakes bit him and wrapped around his arms, immobilizing them. Naraku also had grown a scorpion tail that pierced through Dark Blake's shoulder. The snakes started to pull him and pinned him down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJak and Karina fired their beams at Orochimaru, freeing Dark Blake, who roared in anger and slashed at him with his claws. A beam was about to strike him from the right but an energy shield appeared before him and blocked it. It broke after the impact, Dark Blake turned to see a very weak Joana aiming her hand at him. His hair stopped waving upward for a moment. Then Blaze appeared and grabbed Joana's arm, he disappeared and the now furtherly enraged Dark Blake pursued him. He proved to be faster than Blaze and fired a finger beam with such a precission that it pierced through Blaze's eye, forcing him to release Joana, who was falling down and too weak to do anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer fall was stopped, and when she opened her eyes, Dark Blake was carrying her in his arms. He slowly descended using his wings. Joana looked at him, at his seemingly empty eyes. She was able to sense Blake's strong will, his dark form had been called to battle but Blake was managing to restrain its totally mindless beast personality. She smiled and closed her eyes. He gently placed her on the ground in front of Jak and Karina, he said, still with beast-like metallic voice<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"...Care...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What?\"- Karina asked, and Dark Blake said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Protect...her...must...protect...\"- Now they had gotten the message. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn that moment, Orochimaru and Naraku were about to attack him when Aizen appeared using flash step. He said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Stop it. I'll have to get my sword dirty with this infernal beast...\"- Dark Blake turned around to see him, and roared angrily, then muttered<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Ai...zen...\"- He extended his hand and his sword was brought back to him, without touching it. Aizen didn't expect a mindless beast to fight with a sword, but he showed no fear, a characteristic of himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Lith appeared and said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Blake... stop... this is enough...\"- Dark Blake's answer was to punch her in the face, grab her hair and smash her on the ground. Lith used her fast movement to get away but Dark Blake was already behind her, he fired a large black beam at her at almost point blank. Jak and the others were shocked to see his reaction, and Jak rushed to stop him. He grabbed Dark Blake's wrist, he answered by powering up, his black aura burnt Jak's hand lightly. Dark Blake then flew toward Lith who was only blocking and dodging, he was about to shot another beam at her when images flashed in his mind<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...An unknown place... an unknown world... He felt... alone... and he saw a woman crying near a sword stuck in the ground... The woman then was about to walk away but noticed him... It was Lith... she carried him in her arms, and sang a lullaby... one that he had never heard before...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDark Blake stopped, muttering<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Lith...\"- In that moment, Aizen's zanpakuto stabbed him from behind, Aizen took it out and cut off both of his wings, and fell down to the ground. Aizen descended slowly, and having analyzed Dark Blake's fighting pattern, he decided to attack his friends, he used shunpo and tried to stab Joana but Dark Blake appeared, taking the fatal hit himself, right in the heart. Joana and Karina screamed, as Dark Blake spat out blood and fell down forward, Aizen seathed his zanpakuto saying<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Hpmh... Just as predicted...\"- A white beam hit Aizen's left arm, and he turned around to see a deeply angry Jak, who said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You called my friend a beast?!! I'll tell you something, YOU ARE the real beast!!\"- He fired two white energy beams, Aizen deflected one with his hand but was hit by the other. Lith appeared at his right, and fired a golden beam from her hand. She said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Even Blake's dark form cared about some peole... he instinctively protected the only person he loved in this world... You're such a monster...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I'm not a monster... I'm a god!!!\"- Aizen laughed<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Joana was crying inconsolably, Karina and Jasmine were trying to calm her down. Still, she managed to stand up and ran toward Dark Blake's body. She said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Blake... please... don't die!!! I love you!! I need you...\"- She gasped when noticed that Dark Blake's wings were growing again. He stood up and stared at her, he muttered, still with the metallic voice<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Must...protect...must...you...must.....protect....you...\"- Joana was deeply moved by this. Despite feeling weak, she hugged him. He said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"...Rest...\"- Joana nodded, and he carried her where Karina and Jasmine said. To the girls, it was understandable that he wanted them to take her to a safe place, they started to run away and Aizen appeared in their way, Dark Blake then appeared behind him, punching him with extreme force, and drawing his sword. Before him, Jak and Lith were Aizen, Orochimaru, Naraku, Nostory, Seth and Blaze, all of them willing to fight and enhanced by the surrunding darkness...</span></div></div>",

I'm proud of you, Blake. Your will has grown stronger and almost control your inner dark side\"- Chaos Ryan looked at Blake<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Heh. A lame attempt to copy us, old man. It seems Lucifer didn't finish the job... I'll have to send you back to your grave, where you belong... I'll become the new God!!\"- Blaze replied<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Then show me your divine powers...\"- he said as he started to walk when yasmine stood in front of him smiling a dark smile<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I was wondering when you were going to show up.\"- he said not worried<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You think that I'm afraid afew punks who got a power boost.\"- chaos ryan said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Powerman made a vow to kill my brother and he summoned my power so I will help achieve his goal for the good of the universe.\"- he said as he started to power up<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Blaze, long ago, my brother tried to do just the same you're trying now. He wanted to rule the Universe with power and fear. He failed\"- Chaos Ryan said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Lucifer failed... yeah... but I'm better than him!! I killed your three strongest archangels alone and with my bare hands!! I nearly exterminated all of your precious angels with a single attack!!! Your most powerful warriors were just trash!!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"And that's why I won't forgive you. And the reason you'll fall... at the hands of my strongest angel...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"If you mean Azrael, he died 10,000 years ago... and he was just a wimp...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Then how come that he managed to seal most of your corrupted power? And Azrael is not dead... his blood lives in Blake. You're repeating Lucifer's story, and you'll fail just like he did 50,000 years ago\"-Blaze got mad as hell and they started to fight at high speed<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other three are fighting him as well, but chaos ryan was expecting it so he used godly force to push them away. He said some words to make yasmine her normal size then send her flying into seth and he vanish to cath up with blaze for another round, but dark blake appeared<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Right I did that you could have him after I had my fun.\"- chaos ryan said with a smile<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I will be watching you.\"- he said seriously as they went to fight their opponents<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Remember that we are your friends for life.\"- he added as dark blake remembered when he was hold by blaze and powerman broke him free and their teamwork against him then nostory and seth along with yasmine came into the picture<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"...Ryan...-\" dark blake said as chaos ryan nodded before he went to fight nostory and seth while yasmine was coming back from her flight<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChaos Ryan fired a golden fire-like beam, which was the same spell Blake used before, Blaze dodged the beam but was caught in the explosion. Dark Blake dashed toward him and slashed with his sword, causing wounds difficult to heal for Blaze. Chaos Ryan appeared above him and with his two hands, summoned another spell, this one placed 7 light pillars piercing through Blaze's shoulders, hands, knees and his back. It pinned him down to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Bastard... you knew this spell?\"- Blaze said, very angry, and powering up, trying to break free<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I created it\"- Chaos Ryan replied, and Dark Blakr fired a barrage of dark beams at Blaze, furtherly damaging him. Then the central light pillar shot a thin beam at one of the pillars, until all 7 were linked, then exploded right on Blaze. He emerged from the smoke, deeply angry and glowing in a purple aura<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"The dark power will consume those who aren't able to control it. Lucifer was consumed by it in his attempt to take over\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Shut up!\"- Blaze engaged in high speed combat against Chaos Ryan who then disappeared and before Blaze realized, a pale golden beam hit him, creating an immense explosion. Blaze disappeared<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Rakurai, huh? Have you gone so low?\"- Chaos Ryan said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Low? This is what demons do!\"- Blaze appeared behind Chaos but felt a sharp pain in his chest, much to his surprise, Dark Blake had stabbed him from behind<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I...can't believe it...I couldn't see it coming...'</span></div></div>",

Angels can only absorb light attacks which are weaker than themselves, with a few exceptions, while the demons can absorb nearly otherwise fatal dark attacks. Blaze used this when Ryan attacked him with darkness the night he attacked with hundreds of clones of himself)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze was still in surprise when he realized Dark Blake was no longer there, and appeared behind him. He turned around in total shock<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I lost sight of him... That was definitively no Shoshitsu*... it was... Rakurai...**\"- <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDark Blake now had clearly gray skin (before, it was normal but with grayish tone) His fangs also were more noticeable. His claws were now black. He roared and attempted to attack Blaze, but he dodged the attack using Rakurai. He then heard a deep booming sound and Dar Blake appeared at his left, an energy ball was charging in his left wing and shot a powerful black beam at Blaze. There was a large explosion, and Blaze was burnt. His voice faltered<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"...This... is nonsense... this can't be happening... It doesn't matter how much others try to imitate a demon... there's no way someone besides a demon can use Yoruhane...***\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDark Blake extended both wings outward and they started to radiate a black fire-like aura. Suddenly, a barrage of countless beams was shot at Blaze, each blast hit him and they caused a larger explosion that shook the whole world. After the explosion, an immense pillar of black energy rose and lingered longer. Blaze was now laying on the ground and his eyes glowed in bright red because of the anger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe flew toward Dark Blake but he got stabbed in the stomach instead, by Dark Blake, who swung it while it was stuck in Blaze, cutting him in two. Dark Blake fired more dark beams from his wings and Blaze was reduced to what seemed to be liquid ashes. They reformed and once again, Blaze was there. He shouted at Chaos<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"If you say that using demon techniques is low, then... why did you create a demon?!!\"- <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><font class=\"size2\" style=\"\">* Shoshitsu = Vanishing. The fast movement angels and some humans use. It has a swishing sound and it's simply to move so fast that one can't be seen. The speed depends on the user and how much energy they have, if the user is tired his shoshitsu ability will decrease.<br>\r\n** Rakurai = Lightning Strike. A fast movement exclusive of demons. It's faster than Shoshitsu and consumes no energy, so the speed depends merely on the user's own ability. This movement in difference of Shoshitsu, isn't ordinary. While Shoshitsu is simply a fast movement, Rakurai might be described as moving through space (not IN space) at high speed. Shoshitsu can be predicted by skilled users, but Rakurai is unpredictabe. Besides Abaddon and Azrael, Rakurai was a forbidden technique and any other angel who acquired this ability was banished. Lucifer created this technique and was its first user ever<br>\r\n*** Yoruhane = Night feather. Powerful dark concentrated beams fired from the user's wings. Apparently, a demon exclusive ability. Only high class demons can fire it from a single wing, as Blake just did...<br>\r\n**** Of course that the version that killed 2,000,000 angels was performed by a 5x times stronger Blaze, still, Ultimate Genocide quite packs a punch. Blaze is so far, the only one who can use it. Sorry for abusing of these notes...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the way, I had these techniques in store but they were unnamed. I felt that simple self-explanatory names wouldn't fit, and, as clich\u00e9 as it may be, I chose japanese. My native language is Spanish but I never thought it'd be cool for naming techniques... and if I were to use them then it would seem as copying Bleach... So, while these names might not be as good, it's the best I could think of. I'm open to suggestions on this topic</font></b></span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Blaze had no time to get his answer, as Dark Blake furiously punched him, both started to fight wildly, at speeds that were difficult to keep up with, even for Lith. As strange as it might sound, it looked like Dark Blake's sword was the real advantage, as the wounds it inflicted were difficult for Blaze to heal. More to their surprise, Dark Blake started to shoot another barrage of dark beams from his wings, but this time, Blaze dodged most of them. He stood in front of Dark Blake, saying<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Impale. Feed on enemy's blood. Engulf the light, pierce through angels' hearts... Lance of Eclipse...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn Blaze's hand a lance made of dark purple energy appeared, it was roughly 2 meters long. He said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"If it wasn't by the seal that your bastard of ancestor put on me, I wouldn't need to say incantation for this...\"- <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze started to spin the spear with his two hands and cut a deep wound in Dark Blake's shoulder. He countered with his sword and both weapons clashed. The metal seemed to be as tough as the energy weapon. Blaze wasn't surprised though. They started to fight at high speeds again, This time, they seemed to be more even. However, Blaze flew away from Dark Blake and shot a beam from the lance, which was thunder-like, and it destroyed half of his right wing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe started to fall down but quickly grew back the damaged wing's part and flew furiously toward Blaze, who smiled, showing his fangs. Dark Blake kept attacking but Blaze showed that he had great skills with this weapon. Both of them got cut deeply, but Dark Blake could heal faster. In a swift motion, he tried to slash downward to cut Blaze in a half, but he countered with an upward hit with his lance, sending away the sword. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze gave another evil smile as he flew backward and threw the lance, right into Blake's heart. His eyes reverted back to normal, with the green irises, but the rest of his body didn't revert. He coughed up blood and began to fall down. As he was falling he saw Blaze smiling, saying<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Bye Bye, Blake...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>A memory flashed in his mind. Just like this moment, but Blaze and he wore different clothes. They were in a temple-like place, with pale green illumination, it was a natural illumination, and at the same time, an unworldly one. Behind Blaze was a small cascade. And, at his own left, there was a sword, that looked like this <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://tinypic.com/view.php?pic=kdr2uv&amp;s=7\" target=\"_blank\">http://tinypic.com/view.php?pic=kdr2uv&amp;s...</a> embedded in what looked like a short column's base. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze had his left hand aimed at him, and Blake felt that he had just shot a beam through his heart. He coughed up blood and started to fall backward, before completely falling in unconsciousness, he saw Blaze's smiling, and heard him<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Bye Bye, prince of the heavens. You're no longer useful to me. Now I got Omega's Sword.... Too bad you won't live to be killed by it, but don't worry, soon your little girlfriend Ren'Ai will join you. She'll be the first one killed by this blade. Lith will make you company as well... and EVERYONE!! I'm gonna wipe out angels!!\"- Blaze laughed maniacally, and soon Blake's senses stopped working. </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Who... who is Ren'Ai?... How did Blaze get Omega's sword?! Prince of the heavens? What is he talking about?!!' And What have I to do with this?' Those were Blake's thoughts as he fell to unconsciousness, both in the memory and in reality at once. He fell from more than 300 feet high, with the spear stuck in his chest. Joana who was recently healed now screamed for real.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile he was still falling, Blaze flew downward toward him, and said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"No human has right to have demon traits...\"- He shot a beam at his right wing, destroying it*. The unconscious one winged Blake finally fell to the ground. Blaze soon landed near him and stomped on his stomach. He grabbed him by the throat and squeezed it, making blood to come out of his mouth. Blake was unconscious, but strangely, his body was still in dark state. Blaze then aimed at him with his other hand and a chain of purple electric-like energy started to wrap itself around Blake...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size2\" style=\"\"><b>*The worst insult against an angel was to cut one of their wings. Chaos did this to Lucifer after the First War (To be explained later). It was also a previous punishment before exile. So, Blaze does this meaning to humilliate the unconscious Blake.</b></font></span></div></div>",

Here nobody can't follow us nor sense our presence\"- Naraku stood up violently, saying<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What makes you think we want to go with you?!!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"So, you prefer to be slayed just like the snake guy?\"- Blaze answered, Naraku turned his hands into pincers but Aizen gestured him to stop.

Everyone sat down, Naraku still reluctantly<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I shall explain why we appeared there\"- Blaze said that and a blackboard appeared suddenly. Naraku exclaimed again<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"This ain't school you son of a...!!!\"- He was cut off by Aizen's spiritual pressure, focused on him. He muttered -\"Okay...\"- and Aizen stopped<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"As I was saying. My enemies are allied with yours... I'll explain...\"- The blackboard turned into a screen and an image of Blake appeared<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"First. This guy is quite strong. You should know already, since he kicked your asses...\"- Naraku growled but after a deadly cold look from Aizen, he remained silent<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"By how you desperately fought, it seems you know nothing about him. He is an angel... more exactly, descendant from one, but he got most of angel traits. Even in normal form he can put up a fight against weak enemies. His light form, what you fought, with the golden aura and stuff, was developed recently thanks to those other guys. Usually Blake was unable to draw more power than brute strength and speed, physical attacks...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he was saying that, Blake's battle with Orochimaru and Naraku were displayed in the screen<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"But even his light form wasn't that dangerous...\"- The screen now showed Blake's dark transformation<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"This is big deal. This form is wild, extremely violent and unpredictable... and dangerously powerful... It's stronger than I had thought, and somehow he got to use demon exclusive techniques...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Then let's kill him first!!\"- Naraku shouted<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"That's not possible, I'll explain that later. Well... formerly, Blake was the only one who could fight back, but again, recently, some of his friends have improved\"- The screen now showed Joana<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"This girl... is Blake's girlfriend... for most of time she was just a weakling human like everyone else... but somehow, she got powers... similar to Blake's light ones, and as you have felt, light hurts... specially us, beings of darkness... She also seems to be able to form shields and has some healing powers... Her fighting level is not to be underestimated. She can kick some asses too but without Blake we'd take her down\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Then let's kill her!!\"- Naraku again shouted, and Aizen discreetly grabbed his zanpakuto's handle. Naraku gulped<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"We can't because it's 90% likely that Blake will be near her. And, they aren't alone anymore...\"- The screen now showed the anthros, Rocky, Tabitha, Max and D'Artagnan<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I don't now how these came to exist... they were Blake's pets. They aren't to be underestimated either, while they only use physical attacks, they have greatly enhanced senses, insane speeds and reflexes in the case of the two felines, and insane strength in the dog's case. His bite might break somebody's neck if you aren't careful...\"- Blaze looked at Naraku while saying this<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"These also will be near Blake, since they're his pets. The other humans are just weaklings who are of no importance\"- The screen showed Karina, Ayrton, Ferdinand, Gustave, Anthony and Caesar<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Nothing to worry about these...\"- Blaze said, and Aizen spoke<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What are exactly these angels you talk about?\"- Blaze narrowed his eyes, but proceeded to answer<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"This will be a History class... *sigh* More than 100,000 years ago, There were three gods: Chaos and Lucifer, and Goddess Gabriel. Gabriel died, though I don't know how or when. Well, the important is, that Lucifer was the one who looked beyond simply creating life and giving them free will. Lucifer was the first one to realize that a god shouldn't serve his creations, creations were born to serve the god. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecause Chaos was the idiot good guy, Lucifer knew he was more powerful, being the oldest of the three. Angels were a creation of Chaos, these beings of light were powerful, but weren't made for fighting. Lucifer created demons, beings of darkness, solely born to search and destroy. The first ones created were the most powerful, and gave them command over the lesser ones...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith this... I mean that, demons are the antithesis of angels. However, the angels excel at spell usage and their light attack spells are deadly for most of demons. Most of demons know no spell but comensate because of their abilities and techniques. Also, demons were made as bersekers, we can withstand severe injuries and still fight, and to avoid losing time on healing, Lucifer invented a regenerative factor that all demons have... Somehow... that bastard Chaos managed to copy it and created one last angel to be his last hope: Azrael... Chaos' last creation was an angel with both the powers of angels and demons...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"And what does this have to do with us?\"- Naraku asked calmly, he peeked at Aizen who was calm as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Blake descends from Azrael's bloodline, and he's the one who inherited back all of Azrael's traits. His previous ancestros had just part of his power and traits. Blake is almost Azrael's reincarnation...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You said that we can't kill him, why would be that?\"- Aizen asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Because... back 10,000 years ago... Azrael and I fought. I nearly destroyed the whole Heaven but Azrael intervened, and he almost killed me. Then, I performed a forbidden spell to get immortality. I succeeded, and Azrael was unable to kill me. So I went to Earth, but Azrael performed a similar spell and followed me. We fought in Atlantis, and he managed to seal most of my power...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Why did you go to Earth?\"- Aizen questioned Blaze<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Because, Omega 17, Lucifer's heir, became the new god. He commanded the third war against the angels, and those bastards tried to kill him, but never could, Omega ended up sealed. Omega named himself with the number of attempts of killing him, as each time he came back he was stronger. Azrael sealed Omega the 16th time, and sliced him into pieces. 7 pieces, plus his sword, and sent them to Earth. I went there to restore him, and after what happened, to restore my former powers. Omega is the only one who can nullify Azrael's seal, but he was so goddamn sly that only his energy signature could break the seal on Omega. That's why we need Blake, with him I'll restore Omega and he'll reward anyone who helped him with great powers...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"So, if we help you in this, Omega will give us power?\"- Aizen said, now more interested 'This might be a good chance, since I don't have the Hogyoku anymore...' He thought</span></div></div>",

Blaze said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What do you suggest then?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"We need to get rid of the Ryans and their friends, so we can get the Hogyoku back...\"- Aizen said, and Blaze replied<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"With your current power they'll kick your asses...

Karina met up with them. Everyone seemed ok. When Jak asked Blake about what did he remember, he answered<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Not much... I was fighting Blaze... I used the aura... and then I had-I mean I got unconscious after Blaze attacked me with his power, after surrouding the whole world in darkness. Then Powerman came into my mind and somehow got my darkness to work with me... that's all I remember...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I see...\"- Jak aswered, this answer surprised him further because he somehow managed to restrain his dark side's attitude despite not being even consious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Hey guys, you'll be impressed after you see this\"- Karina said, and a small robot that looked like a bee appeared and landed in her open palm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"An artificial mosquito... Just when I thought I would be able to sleep...\"- Blake said, obviously joking, but annoyed Karina, who said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"It's a robotic bee!!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Does it make honey or something?\"- Blake replied, Karina stared at him with the \u00ac_\u00ac look for a moment, then said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I made this to prevent a possible attack by Blaze, it's like a small sentinnel. It watches everything in a certain radius, and best of all, records it...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"In HD?...\"- Blake said, not expecting an answer<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"YES, IN HD!!!\"- Karina answered -\"So, check this before someone needs a doctor...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe robotic bee flew toward Karina's room and connected itself to the TV screen. As soon as it started, they realized that besides the fight, it also registered lots of numbers, and Karina said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"It also was equipped with my energy detector, so, it measured almost everyone's power...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n[Since it's not likely that I write again the whole battle, I'll just list the energy measurements registered, also, the true power or Orochimaru, Naraku and Aizen remain unknown, because their energy signatures weren't registered in the robot's computer.

Blake could barely surpass 7,000 just yesterday and now he fought Blaze with a whooping power of 25,000\"- Karina said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"That part doesn't count... It lasted for too short...\"- Blake said, more serious -\"Blaze is a strong bastard anyway...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Did you notice that he actually feared you this time? He cheated because you'd beat him otherwise, he used that darkness thing to enhance himself and the others...\"- Karina added<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I doubt it, if Blaze fought for longer, even if I was kicking his ass, I'd lose in the end. The highest power I can reach without so much strain on myself is my aura at 5 times, which is 18,000, according to you...\"- Blake answered<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"It's still impressive. Just yesterday you were exhausted with 7,200. How did you do it? \"- Karina raplied, and her question reminded Joana to ask him why did he leave while everyone else was sleeping<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Yeah, since when you leave me alone while I'm sleeping?\"- Joana asked, slightly angry and Blake gulped, he said:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"It was just today. I found that the aura wasn't a random thing and I trained t get a better control of it... That's what allowed me to put up a fight against Blaze and Aizen. If I was like yesterday, I would've got beaten easily\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"And what's with THAT?\"- Joana asked again, referring to Blake's sword on his back<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Lith gave it to me... She wanted me to train with a sword...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Where does it come from?\"- Karina said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I don't know...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"At least let's give it a look...\"- Karina said and Blake took it out of its holder, which was also given by Lith. Jak then exclaimed<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Whoahh... What's with that huge ass blade?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"As I said, I don't know where did Lith get it... but it seems to be harder than steel, and hurt effectively Aizen and Blaze. Lith said that this sword can hurt divine beings...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJak was also with an O.O face when noticed that Blake was holding it with one hand, and he asked him to hold it for a while. In the precise moment Blake gave him the sword, Jak fell face-first on the ground because of the sword's weight. He quickly got up and managed to hold it with his two hands, he said, with a sweatdrop<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"This thing definitively is not a weapon... why does someone make a sword this heavy?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"It's not that heavy\"- Blake said, taking the sword back. Karina looked at the cracks on the ground and added<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Maybe it is for everyone else...\"- Blake put the sword back on its holder. While talking to Karina about the sword not being heavy, he noticed Karina's O_O expression and turned around. Joana was examining the sword, and was holding it with one hand as well. Blake said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Something inside me tells me not to give her a weapon...\"- Everyone laughed at that, except Joana herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size2\" style=\"\"><b>*Not her true power, but the energy she gave off while fighting.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>-\"I have to ask, who are Abaddon, Chronos, Uriel and Raphael?\"- Blake asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"They... they are my brothers...\"- Lith answered -\"Abaddon and Chronos were the first ones created by Chaos\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Are all of them archangels?\"- Karina said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"In that time, there weren't called archangels. Archangels are the angels created by Chaos, currently there are very few ones. However they were the highest ranked ones. Abaddon and Chronos were given the command of the 2nd and 3rd Legions. I commanded the 4th myself, Uriel and Raphael commanded the 5th and 6th legions. By the time Lucifer betrayed us, I was a teenager... The First War lasted over 2,000 years, and Lucifer used his angels to fight us\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I thought that Lucifer used demons to fight\"- Joana said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Lucifer tried to defeat light with light. Abaddon fought him alone, until Chaos arrived and destroyed Lucifer's army. Then Lucifer and Chaos fought, and Chaos used dark powers to defeat him. He sealed Lucifer, and told us that only few ones can use darkness without corruption. He also congratulated Abaddon, who fought nearly evenly with him, a god. Then, he granted him the power of Death...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I thought death wasn't because of angels...\"- Jak said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"It didn't mean that. It meant, that Abaddon was given the power to destroy demon souls. He received a new armor, and what would be his signature weapon: His twin chained sickles. Their chains were embedded into his forearms, and could change their length at will. With those weapons, Abaddon could either drain energy, rip souls, destroy them or absorb them\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I remember that Blaze said something like that... by the way... where was Blaze at all this?\"- Blake said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"All of this happened 100,000 years ago... Blaze hadn't been born yet...\"- Lith said, and added -\"Chaos also granted Chronos a gray suit, with a lighter gray cloak on. He gave him a staff and granted him the power of Time. Chaos said that nobody should travel to future, nor past. Chronos could see both, but couldn't do time travel, his time manipulation still allowed him to make everything but him slow, or to compress time in a place, making it so that while it was just a week in the rest of the world, in a certain place it would be from months to years. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe didn't grant special powers to the others, nor me. He said that all we needed was to rest and to train for the next years. 'Evil will always find a way to return' he said. Yet, he changed the schemes or our army, passing the command 1st Legion to Abaddon, and the 2nd to Chronos. Another angel took the 3rd Legion and Chaos himself created a new division: the Zero Legion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis new division was smaller than the regular legions, and all of its members were very high leveled. Chaos reunited the strongest angels from all legions except for us, because he wanted us to command the other legions. Chaos was of course the commander, but in difference of the other legions, there was no vice-commander. Instead, Chaos kept a personal bodyguard, who had the second highest rank in all 7 legions... higher even than commanders themselves, only below Chaos himself\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"And you're gonna say that Blaze was that one, huh?\"- Anthony said, seemingly, wasn't paying much attention. Karina kicked him, and Lith continued<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"It wasn't him. At that time, Chaos hadn't chosen one. He said that he'd have to wait. More years passed. Until a day, 48,000 years later, someone entered, and destroyed part of our home... He was a being we had never seen. His skin was black, and had dark gray hair. He introduced himself as Amon, he released Lucifer and an army of dark beings attacked us. Lucifer said that he'd come back and that he'd be the ruler of Universe. Nobody could pursue him because his army was giving us a hard time, then, Lucifer revealed that he had found the way to kill us, and so, created the demons, with the sole purpose of destroying us.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so it began the Second War. It was far worse than the first one, and it lasted over 20,000 years. Chaos decided to do something and asked us to keep fighting, and he left. This last battle had been the worst one, we were fighting seemingly endless amounts of demons. Abaddon used extensively his soul destroying ability to help, and also, he absorbed many demon souls. He used their energy to recharge himself, and to keep fighting. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChronos also used his power of time to kill many demons in short time. This war was so destructive that if it had been fought on Earth, it wouldn't have lasted. Still, the humans found out about our conflict...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"That's right, many cultures mention something about a conflict in the heavens...\"- Karina said, everyone else nodded, and Lith continued<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Some people were able to perceive what happened here, also, the course of the war affected slightly Earth's weather, making it more rainy, dark, and frequent thunderstorms. While we defended Heaven with all we had, Abaddon fought Lucifer for a second time, but this time, Lucifer turned the tables when showed his new form, he abandoned all of his light powers, and turned himself into a demonic being. He thought that he'd win instantly, but since Abaddon also had gotten stronger and absorbed many demon souls, Lucifer still had a hard time, despite he had the upper hand this time<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sickles of Death gave Abaddon a great advantage, he managed to stab Lucifer with them, and proceeded to absorb Lucifer's energy. The continuous energy drain weakened him, and Abaddon then tried to kill him once for all, by ripping out his soul. Abaddon nearly succeeded but Lucifer's top demons attacked him and the sickles got out of Lucifer's body. Then, he tried to kill Abaddon when Chaos finally arrived, he had forged a weapon, from the combination of the purest light and darkness, a powerful sword to put an end to the war. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChaos revealed the Sword of the Heavens, and with it, he sealed away all of Lucifer's army. Lucifer managed to escape, and swore revenge. Some time later, he came back with a new army of demons and modified his own sword, formerly called the Silvermoon Blade, into a sword of corrupted darkness. The Blade of Destruction. Its power equaled that of Chaos' sword, and he attacked Heaven again, this time, Chaos fought him in a remote place, and they ended up killing each other...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLith's voice faltered when said that, and paused for a moment. Her tone evidenced her sadness</span></div></div>",

And somehow, I'm afraid that they might use their power a little too excessively...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Huh?\"- Jak's phrase caught Blake off-guard, and also, it made something ring inside his mind... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Again, Blake seemingly was taken to another place. A place he has never been to, yet he still finds it familiar. He is wielding two swords, and in front of him are several men dead... No... they aren't men... they are... angels? Suddenly, he turns around to find a demon trying to kill him, but as soon as he appeared, a sword made of light pierced through the demon's chest. Behind him, a mysterious person stood, dressed with a dark purple tight suit... The figure revelaed it to be that of a woman, and her face was covered, ninja-like style. She disappeared as quietly as she appeared...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Are you ok?\"- Jak said, and Blake snapped out of that. He said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"It was nothing... Uh... how long was I gone?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Just two minutes...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Alright... Whatever it was, it never happened...\"- Blake said, getting back to play, and ignoring completely whatever he saw. Jak now understood why Joana was that protective of him... Blake tends to not say when he's in trouble, nor when he needs help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Are you sure?\"- Jak asked once more<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Sure, man. My brain is kinda burnt down after fighting, the stress of many things, and maybe the fact that I got myself a girlfriend who turns out to be a supernatural being... Other than that... I'm fine. Thanks...\"- Blake kept playing while he said that...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile... somewhere else<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoana looked at Jasmine and noticed that she was alone, she asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Why are you alone? Wasn't Jak with you?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Nope. He suddenly walked away... out of nothing... he said that I'd go psycho about something but he didn't tell me...\"- Jasmine said, then added -\"So... your boyfriend found out about you, didn't he?\"- Joana nodded and replied<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"But he reacted badly... He also left me and went somewhere, he said that he needed to go somewhere to do something...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Why would he act like that? I think that is cute that you both are the same kind... and that your ancestors once were just like you...\"- Jasmine said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Not for Blake. Lith told me that when she read his mind, he was calling his life a joke and that destiny sucks...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I think that Jak wasn't too happy with me being descendant of a goddess either...\"- Jasmine said, sounding slightly sad<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What's with those guys? Blake should be happy, I can fight too and help him. He wouldn't need to fight Blaze alone anymore...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Have you thought that actually they might be afraid of us?\"- Jasmine said, seemingly, in her own thoughts, since what she said made no sense with what Joana was saying. Joana was surprised by the question<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Let me see if I get it... Blake is not afraid of Blaze but is afraid of me?\"- Joana asked, and Jasmine nodded<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Precisely. He can fight Blaze with no restrictions... but.... he wouldn't be able to fight you back...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Why would he need to fight me?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"He doesn't... I'm just trying to think like they would... also... if you remember... when Blake's demon transformation took over for the first time, he couldn't hurt you, right?\"- Jasmine added<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Yeah...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"And I think Jak is the same...

Joana entered the room and said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Blake, we need to talk\"- She received no answer, and she sat next to him.

I would never hurt you, you know?\"- Joana said, but Blake didn't answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You know that, right?\"- Joana asked again<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I know nothing... and what's more, if this was already to happen, then it makes my life nothing. If destiny is true then I did nothing by myself...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Blake, when I met you I didn't know anything about you being an angel or whatever. I only knew you were different from the rest but I love you by who you are\"- Joana said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Not really. If this was destined, we would end up like this anyway...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"That's not the point. I mean, who cares if our ancestors once were lovers? That was more than 10,000 years ago!!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"And still I couldn't get a girlfriend by myself...\"- Blake said, this phrase saddened Joana. Blake was almost saying that he hadn't a real girlfriend -\"You should get a real boyfriend\"- He added, despite making them even, Joana was sadder. Then, she said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I love you Blake. I can't love anyone else. And I want to help you, you've had to fight alone so many times to protect me, I want to fight at your side. I want you to not worry about facing Blaze anymore...\"- Blake opened his eyes wide, he wasn't expecting such determination from her, nor that she actually wanted to fight Blaze. In Blake's logic, Joana had no reason to fight Blaze. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Ok then... I understand, now, can I get out?\"- Blake said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You don't want want to be with me?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\" *Sigh* I simply want to go to play some PS3 so I don't think about having a girlfriend on steroids...\"- Blake answered, and Joana's reaction wasn't clear. On one side, Blake got his humor back, so probably he was better... but the way he put it... Joana was  'I don't know if to laugh or to cry'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You still don't like that I have powers of my own...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Your hugs nearly suffocated me whe you were normal... Now... maybe you could break my ribs...\"- Blake said, a bit nervous, then he added -\"I still want to get out\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Why don't you stay here for a while? Just you and me...\"- Joana said, trying to sound seductive<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Give me the key\"- Blake said, ignoring Joana, she almost fell face.first to the floor, then, she dropped the key in her (large) cleavage. Blake had a O.O face and a sweatdrop. Joana blushed, and more when she saw that Blake was blushing as well. Even being her boyfriend, he wouldn't dare to put his hand there. Though she would want him to...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so, Blake was unable to get out without the key, and retrieving it was no option for him. Joana teased him<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Why don't you take the key out? You know where it is...\"- Blake gulped, his hand trembled but he couldn't bring himself to do it. Before he did anything else, Joana hugged him tightly, but this time, she was careful because of her own strength.* The result was a warm hug, that even Blake had to admit that he liked it. Joana then kissed him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake, off-guard by the circumstances, only could open his eyes wide when Joana took his hand and shoved it in her cleavage. She kept him from taking it out. Blake felt weird, he had blushed some times, but not to this degree. She said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Now, will you take the key?\"- Blake did so, but very slowly. He then asked, with faltering voice due to embarrassment<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What was that for?!!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I just wanted you to do it... and now you have the key, you can go out when you want...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Yeah... *yawn*... I think I will play some *yawn* PS...3...\"- Blake was effectively feeling sleepy, and couldn't help but fell asleep in the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoana looked at him, caressed his hair and thought 'Blake practically learned the lesson...

Nothing unusual... wait, nothing? well... the sand was white, but other than that, Blake and Jak decided to not pay attention, this weird world seemed normal for its inhabitants. Blake decided to go to for a swim (and get away from these girls... Blake would have preferred their lower IQ if they kept a 4 years old's innocence, since they didn't, Blake wanted to be away as most as possible. He also wanted to take advantage on their low IQ as he has already tried)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJak flew some meters (to him... the environment was giant sized) to perform an otherwise impossible diving. Blake said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Sheesh... Just flaunting that you can fly...\"- In a sarcastic tone, to which Jak replied<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Jealous?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Nope...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Well, this is fun\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"These girls have become practically the same as the others...\"- Blake said, looking at the horizon<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"They seem still gentler...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I don't think so... Actually... a teenager's IQ could be worse than either the adult's or child's...\"- Blake said, and before Jak could even think of an answer, they were thrown upward by an immense tidal wave. Both Guadalupe and Demi had diven as well. While falling down, Blake said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You see?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Screw gravity, I can fly\"- Jak replied, and floated, while Blake kept falling down, he had nowhere to land on so he couldn't get any impulse to help him<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Darn it... Why can't I fly?!!\"- Blake shouted, apparently, to nobody in special, but he was referring to his inner darkness, which retains a lot of skills Blake SHOULD have. Inside his head, his dark side smiled, and Blake thought<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I hate you' Blake kept falling until he landed somewhere dark... it was warm, and soft. Blake did recognize the place this time<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Not again...\"- He heard a giggle, and that confirmed what he was thinking... Guadalupe caught him, though not with her hands. Blake tried to find a footing, and managed to jump up, getting out of Guadalupe's cleavage. She caught him with her hand, and Blake, facepalming himself (with one hand, to clear it), asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Couldn't you just catch me with your hand in the first place?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"It would have been less funnier\"- She chirped<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Uh... <i>you just sounded like your doppelganger</i>...\"- Blake muttered<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What's a doppelganger?\"- Guadalupe asked, Blake opened his eyes wide, and thought 'Crud!! I forgot the enhanced senses!!' Looking at her, who was waiting an answer, forced him to say it, and tell the truth... it would be too bad to have two giant girls that look the same, have the same powers, and both angry at him, wouldn't it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"An evil double of yourself... the other girl that looks like you...\"- Blake answered, not very surprised to find that she acted like a typical dumb teenager. Blake noticed her effort on processing the information in her mind<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Forget about that\"- He said, and she did it a little too well. Out of nothing she brought him near her face and gave him a giant passionate kiss. After a minute, Blake was using his strength to push her away. He had to transform to his light form to do so. She looked at him, amazed at his change of appearance, Blake, again, almost reading her mind, said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"This is just an ability of mine, don't pay attention to it...\"- <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You look cute\"- Guadalupe said -\"Your golden glow looks cute\"- Blake turned off his transformation and said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Whatever...\"- Then, he shuddered, and Guadalupe asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What's wrong, little guy?\"- Blake was wordless, and behind her appeared Joana, with an angry look...</span></div></div>",

Joana couldn't hold back her obvious anger and slapped her. Guadalupe tried to counter her but Joana used her enhanced speed to evade her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What do I do? She's fast!!\"- She said to Blake. Although nobody could see him, he facepalmed himself and said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You can DO that too!!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Really?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"For the love of... YES YOU CAN USE SUPERPOWERS TOO!!!\"- Blake shouted, then he tried to calm himself down 'Alright... what else could I expect from a girl who seems to use less than half of her brain?'  Guadalupe was struggling against Joana, but she was in disadvantage. Blake tried to get out of Guadalupe's (also large) cleavage but she kept him in her closed fist... 'Somehow... I ended up worse' Blake thought<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile her fight continued, Guadalupe didn't realize that she was clenching her fist, and putting a lot of pressure on Blake, he used his hands and feet to push away at all sides as most as possible, but after some minutes, he had to transform to his light form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, the \"fight\" looked more like a single sided beating, Guadalupe could do from little to nothing against Joana, and the worst is that they were equally strong, she simply wasn't smart enopugh to use her own powers to her advantage, and as it progressed, the more pressure Guadalupe put on Blake, and he powered up to 5 times to open her hand and get out, as soon as he did he turned off his transformation to save energy, but fell in the water. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe noticed that both girls were staring at him, and couldn't tell who was who. They were exactly identical, an wore the same type of bikini, the same color. One of them tried to grab him and Blake assumed that she was Joana, and having not much of a choice, went to the girl who did not try to grab him, she said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Right choice Blake\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Wait... What?!!\"- He then looked at the other girl, whom he thought to be Joana, she looked at him sadly<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Uh... This is not what it looks like... this is a great mistake...\"- Blake tried to jump away but Joana caught him and brought him near her face<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"It's alright Blake, I knew you'd come to me\"- She said very sensually, Blake gulped. She said softly<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What are you afraid of?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Currently...Pretty much of everything...\"- Blake said, while trying to open Joana's hand, she giggled and kissed him. During the moment she did, Blake stopped his struggling. Not that he was a perv... but he had to admit that he liked her. Guadalupe had been rough to him, and acted like an early teenager, and Joana had \"that feeling\" Blake never found in any other girl<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Did you like that?\"- Joana asked, still in her soft tone<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"That's... not... the point!!\"- Blake was struggling againt the pressure but couldn't open her hand yet. He then transformed to his light form and could open it, then jumped out, but Joana caught him again easily, she then brought him near her face again, saying<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I don't need to fight you\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I'm not Jak if that's what you mean\"- Blake said. Meanwhile, Jak, in Jasmine's cleavage, sneezed for no apparent reason<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoana giggled again, though the fact she wasn't able to get Blake into drooling mode as Jasmine did with Jak annoyed her slightly, and it hurt her pride. She was decided to do it this time, and so, she kissed him once more, though this time was slower. She noticed that Blake was blushing, and after staring at him for some seconds, she licked him, Blake's transformation reverted, and he was with an O.O face, then, with a sweatdrop in his head, he asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"W...W-What was that for?!!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoana's answer was a second lick, then she said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You don't really want to go away from me\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"That's not something you can dec...\"- Joana licked him a third time (after the first, she realized that the ffect was stronger than that of her kisses)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, she slowly put him down her cleavage, and added<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Make yourself at home\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake had a tic on his right eye, and somehow, found himself unable to move, to speak... even to think. It was the first time he got overwhelmed this way (And NOT being used to be shrunk didn't help him either... in fact, Blake might have been less sensitive to this if he actually was used to physical difference between him and his girlfriend...). But this was partially good, while he rested, his energies replenished, and he felt again the strange effect of that the physical contact with Joana was healing his body, and because it wasn't hurt, it simply refilled Blake's energy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the calm wouldn't last that long, and Blake felt shaking, and knew that Guadalupe finally got up and fought back Joana... hopefully...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Gimme my boyfriend back!!\"- Guadalupe screamed, Blake was surprised that she knew the meaning of that word.. which she didn't some minutes ago..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"He's mine\"- Joana answered, and though to most of guys it would be hot to have two identical beautiful girls fighting over him, to Blake sounded rather creepy that both girls claimed possession of him... And if Joana got punched in the chest, there was a chance Blake would get hit... well... now that I think about it... with such cushions... I doubt it... anyway...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGuadalupe managed to connect a punch into Joana's face... bad thing is that Joana did the same exact thing, and both girls fell backward into the water. Blake took this chance and, transforming into his light state, jumped out of Joana's cleavage. Joana got up and tried to catch him but Blake powered up his aura at 5 times and dodged her easily, taking further impulse by stepping briefly on her hand, then jumping away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoana pursued Blake but Guadalupe stood in her way. Blake then looked where Jak was. Jasmine was coming toward the girls with him in her cleavage. He sighed, and powered up to 7 times (with the strain on his body, such as extremely tight muscles [tight not big, just to clear] and more visible veins, good thing is that he wasn't battered, so he can keep this form a bit longer) He jumped at extreme speed and snatched Jak out of Jasmine's cleavage, both of them didn't even realize.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJak was really confused, just a second ago he was in his ex-girlfriend's cleavage, and the next, Blake was dragging him at extreme speeds (running on the sand)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Before you ask, the answer is Nope...I don't know what I'm doing\"-</span></div></div>",

Guadalupe didn't bring one)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while. Jak poked his head out to see that they were in a part of the city that was still intact, although there was no people. Blake poked his head out as well, and noticed people's absence<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Well, I can't blame them... We're actually running away from them...\"- Blake jumped out of the purse, followed by Jak. Soon Blake fixed his eyes in a videogame store, he walked there, Jak looked at him confused. A few moments later, he came out with a PS3's box<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Umm... Isn't stealing wrong?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Screw the rules. I have... wait... I don't have money... Anyway, nobody's here...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"It's not like we can take that with us...\"- Jak said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Let me live the illusion!!!\"- Blake answered, Jak sighed, and Blake had to put the stuff back in the store, but he grabbed an Xbox 360's box. Jak stared at him coldly, Blake looked down, and said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Some day... some day...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"We shouldn't stay here for too long, or the 'monsters' will find us\"- Jak said, and they felt the ground trembling, Blake said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You were right, if you say it, things get worse...\"- Jak briefly transformed and quickly flew to Demi's shoulder. Blake jumped to Guadalupe's. She said playfully<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Are you sure that it's me? Don't you wanna make sure?\"- Blake realized what she wanted, and gulped. Strangely, Blake didn't blush as he would if Joana was the one to say a similar thing. In his mind, he thought 'Dammit... I better stop thinking about her...'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGuadalupe and Demi started to run away, but Joana and Guadalupe appeared in front of them. All of them (Guadalupe, Demi and the guys) screamed<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"NYEEEEHHH\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Party's over\"- Jasmine said, and looked seductively at Jak. Joana looked at Blake as well, and he looked away<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I'm not falling to... those hazel eyes... to... ARGHH!!\"- Blake transformed to his light form, the aura's flash blinded temporarily the girls, and gave them a few seconds to escape. Jak, rubbing his eyes, said angrily<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Nex time you do that, WARN ME!!!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"If I warned you the girls would  have been warned as well\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Hey! How come these girls weren't blinded by it?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Because they weren't in front of me... maybe...\"- Blake said, not completely sure<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDemi stopped and said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Maybe you could hide in these buildings\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"But what about you?\"- Blake asked, (and to clear, he refers to both girls)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"We'd have to fight them anyway...\"- Guadalpe said, sounding more serious, then said in a more girly tone -\"I still want that kiss\"- And without giving Blake to even process the question, she brought him near her face and kissed him, then she said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Next time I want you to kiss me\"- Blake's mind flashed back... he remembered that Joana had said that several times, that she wanted Blake to take more initiative. Before he asked her out (or was it the other way? well, who cares?) Joana also wanted him to hug her because he wanted to, though he never did (even as friends, Blake only let Joana hug him, but never did hug her on his own. Also, Blake hadn't shared much of his past other than his father's death and his grandmother's)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls walked into another direction, knowing that the other girls would go after them. Blake was still remembering when Jak said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Blake...uh... Blake!!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What is it?\"- He snapped out of his memories<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Maybe this wasn't a good idea...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Why? We are in... a... Starbucks? Alright, free coffee!!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Blake...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Not even a cold capuccino*?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"We ARE INSIDE A BUILDING\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"So what?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Think about it... We are inside a building... in an empty city... and soon, there will be 4 giant girls fighting... and they are likely to stomp and fall ON the buildings...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Oh my...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Yeah...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Well... Let's drink a coffee and we'll leave...\"- Blake said and went for a coffee, Jak fell face-first to the floor. Soon Blake came back with two cold capuccinos. He gave one to Jak, and after taking a sip<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Not bad... but this isn't anywhere as good as Joana's version**...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"She makes coffee?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Yeah... usually in the morning, but that doesn't make it less special. I'm not sure what ingredients she uses, I'm sure she adds vanilla and cinnamon, but there are ingredients I can't identify...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Maybe is not an ingredient but how she prepares it?\"- Jak said, and Blake laughed<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"That's what Ferdinand said, he said 'She makes it with love...' and somehow, he sounded like spongebob# or something...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I think I figured you wrong. I thought that you were kinda fed up of her...\"- Jak said, and Blake realized, he blushed and said angrily<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Shut up!!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Heh, it seems someone misses his girlfrieeend...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Well, I'm not the one who drools at the mere sight of her!!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I admit it.

Are you crazy?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"We'll end up going back to them, you know that...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Uh...\"- Blake tried to find an argument, then he said -\"What about the other girls?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"That doesn't matter. Remember that last time we got away they cried, and I believe that with good reason...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Then they should stop acting like Godzilla...\"- Blake said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size2\" style=\"\"><b>*I'm not sure how is that type of coffee called in English<br>\r\n<br>\r\n** Real fact.

Jak then looked with his eyes widened, and then called Blake to take a look at what he was seeing. <br>\r\n\u201cWhat the hell?\u201d Blake said. \u201cIs that us?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYeah.\u201d Jak said<br>\r\n\u201cAnd there\u2019s Jasmine and Joana!\u201d Blake said. \u201cSo they\u2019re sleeping too?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019m guessing.\u201d Jak said. \u201cWe\u2019re dreaming again.<br>\r\n\u201cThis feels weird,\u201d Blake said. \u201cSeeing Me like this is kind of awkward\u2026<br>\r\n\u201cSame here.\u201d Jak said. \u201cCome on, it\u2019s our only escape.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake was suddenly grabbed by a giant hand, and then snatched down fast. Jak flinched very hard, as it looked like a scene from Jaws. He then saw Jasmine throw not only Demi, but also Guadalupe into the air, and then blasted them with a Beam that looked all too similar to his signature blast he created to stop Dark Blake. It engulfed them very violently.  Jak was scared again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Blake was with Joana, and she was still in her swimming clothes. She took Blake into the water, and she was still huge. Blake was trying to escape, powering up quickly into his Light Form, but he was being licked, and his transformation slowly reverted, to add insult to injury.  His face was like O_O<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe heard footsteps coming which sounded more like quakes, and he transformed into his Omega Form, scared of out of his mind.</span></div></div>",

He tried once more to transform, and Joana licked him, his transformation once again reverted. Blake shouted inside his mind<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'What the hell is going on?!!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I don't know... I just know that I feel so good...' Blake's iner darkness replied<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'What the...?!! What do you have to do with this?!!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I told you. I'm your instincts... and I don't want to run away anymore...'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Are you high on something?' Blake asked, his darkness' tone was weird, and it sounded like he was really high on something. He got no answer. He then said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I wasn't calling your powers either, then why does light not respond me?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Because neither you want to get away...' His dark side replied, and Blake's eyes opened wide, and he said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'You... are NOT telling me what I want to do!!' Blake powered up to his aura at 7 times, and tried to open Joana's hand, but the transformation was reverting back, Blake managed to jump upward before the transformation reverted completely, much to his dismay, he barely made it past Joana's face, and soon fell back down. Joana smiled and instead of catching him, she leant forward a bit, catching Blake.... in other place...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe knew where he landed. Between his girlfriend's breasts... Blake again tried to transform but this time he couldn't (Not even for a short time like before) Joana said playfully<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"It's not like you want to get out of there, do you?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake remembered that after being shrunk by Blaze and found by Joana, she placed him between her breasts quite often. Not that he could complain at 2 cm tall. He had to admit that it was at least better than her purse. And against his own will, he was blushing (Although nobody could see him given his location). He sighed, and said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What's the point of this?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoana took him out of her purse and brought him near her face<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What's this for?\"- He asked again<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe kissed him and said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I said it before this started. I want to be with you, but you are afraid of my powers...\"- Blake tried to say something but she continued -\"You also seem dissapointed of us because our ancestors were once lovers...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"If that means that we were supposed to end up like this, yeah... It makes my life a joke... if all of this was destiny, then I would end up with you no matter what, doesn't that annoy you?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"No. I love you, and I'm glad I got the chance to meet you, who cares about destiny? We're happy together, and not long ago, you told me that I gave you a reason to live for\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake was silent. She had hit the nail. He scratched the back of his head, then he said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"But this is still not good... After learning my true origins, it's clear I'm not a human, at least, not a regular one... but you... given what Lith said... you wouldn't be either...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"And what's wrong about it? Now I can understand you more than anyone... well, except Lith and your father I guess... Blake, I love you, and I think it's great we have similar origins. Otherwise I wouldn't understand what does it feel like, which I didn't for years\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then kissed him once more, and said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I love you no matter what species you are\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"And you HAD to get Jak and me into this mad world just to tell me that?\"- Blake asked, and Joana giggled, and answered<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Sort of... You didn't want to listen to me before... Jasmine said that Jak was also afraid of her powers\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"With a girlfriend that can shrink you or grow to Godzilla-size, who wouldn't?\"- Joana laughed at Blake's comment, but knew that he was serious. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I wouldn't misuse my powers. I've used them to get closer to you...\"- <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Closer? We ARE together!! We LIVE together!! You even hang out with my friends!!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"And with all that, I still feel that you don't let me get to your heart...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Blake's mind went back to when he was 9 years old. His last conversation with his grandma... She wanted Blake to have a girlfriend in the future, one who would take care of him, and understand him... </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Nobody gets to know me that much...\"- Blake answered, after snapping out of his memories<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Well, I want to be the first one then\"- Joana said and added -\"And... it wouldn't hurt to see that you like me...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What does THAT mean?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You say that you aren't a pervert... but I don't think it would be a perversion to at least enjoy the sight your girlfriend\"- She blushed when she said that<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"It's not my style...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"C'mon Blake!! At least some time you should say what you like of me... or show a preference on how I dress...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"By what I know, usually girls hate that their boyfriends are too centered on their physics...\"- Blake said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"But you ignore them. I... I feel bad when it's proved that I don't even know how to impress you...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"If you bought me a PS3 I'd be impressed\"- Blake said joking, Joana glared at him, but couldn't help but laugh at the joke<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Blake...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I know... it's just that seeing how Karina treated perverts... and how many slaps, punches and kicks Anthony has gotten over the years taught me that one shouldn't even take a slight peek...\"- Blake said (Although, the fact that he never had a motherly figure, and knowing from very long ago that his mother hated him worsened this)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I wouldn't hurt you, not for that nor for anything. I love you too much to do that...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake looked down. He felt weird... those words... 'I love you too much...'. <i>Those were words Blake denied that could be said to him by anyone, he always said to his friends that he was not into relationships, and the farthest he could get would be a girl who thought of them as just friends. He always said that it was impossible for a girl to love him. Maybe they would like him, but not love. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd getting into a relationship just for the heck of it wasn't Blake's style. He once said, at 7th grade (Joana heard it) 'It's cruel to play with someone's feelings. Even I have to admit that. People with feelings* get hurt by those sorts of things...'</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, Joana was telling him that she loved him more than anyone. So much that she wouldn't hurt him. Knowing about his dark side, Blake knew that she was not likely to fight back at him, even if he got taken over by his inner darkness. He had a weird feeling, like the void** that has been with him his whole life started to fade away, like that void was finally filled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size25\" style=\"\"><b>* Blake admitted several times that he had no feelings at all. Though Karina soon found out that he simply hid them, and acted as if they didn't exist. Meeting Joana changed that, and it was such a change that it took to him 3 years to finally show a bit of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n** From his early childhood, Blake has acknowledged that there is a void in his life, although he couldn't tell what was he lacking. By 10 years old, Blake already had said to his friends that it was better to live with one's reality, rather than bothering into trying to change it</b></font></span></div></div>",

Joana... I learned my lesson...  it's not necessary anymore to use illusions...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Huh?!!\"- Joana was confused, and turned around to see her counterpart*. Joana was about to place Blake into her cleavage, when Guadalupe snatched it with her speed, Blake sighed and said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Now I have some idea about how felt the people at King Kong...\"- Then, he thought aloud -\"Am I stupid or what?!!\"- <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen he transformed to his light form, but Guadalupe tightened her grip on him, and he went up to 5 times. Guadalupe tightened her grip even more, and Blake felt that his body started to ache, soon he felt his bones cracking. Quickly, he powered up to 7 times, and managed to open her hand and jump away, landing in the beach... face first... (well, he indeed fell on his feet but one of his legs got damaged, and immediately fell face first). Struggling with the pain, Blake stood up, and saw that Guadalupe was already after him... or it was Joana? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe decided to not wait to find out, and jumped again, this time, landing on her shoulder and quickly jumping away from it, and crashed against something soft, his transformation reverted immediately. Blake saw a green fabric, and sighed<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I have to stop ending up here... I'm beginning to think that someone hates me...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I'd say that someone loves you. Me\"- The girl giggled, and Blake knew it was Joana. She stared at him, but looked sad, Blake, confused, asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What's with that look?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Jasmine and I found out that your and Jak's will interferred with the illusions, getting the girls out of our control... that's why we destroyed them... at least that's what I thought... if they come back, it means that you still want her to win...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Let's see if I get it, because I descend from some freaky archangel or something, my dark side is also my subconscious, who happens to be a jerk, who tells me to be with you, who happens to be not human as well, BUT something unknown deep in my mind still wants to get away from you for reasons I don't quite understand... Riight?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoana nodded in response. Blake facepalmed himself and said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I am SO going to need intensive psychiatric for the rest of my life after this... or at least a PS3...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I can help with the therapy...\"- Joana said playfully<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"And the PS3?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Therapy first...\"- Joana said, and healed Blake's leg<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What about your double?\"- Blake said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>*It's been said at least twice, Joana can only feel Blake's presence.

Jak was tightly packed in between his ex-girlfriend's boobs.

They looked at each other and they realized that everything was in black and white. They ran back to the wall, but it wasn't a wall, it was fleshy and felt soft. They realized that they were in a romm with Jasmine and Joana, who were not exactly fitting in the bedroom, and their clothes were torn from their size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She noticed that Jasmine was the same, they stared at each other. Then the whole room started to tremble and the roof was taken off... by the clone girls... (They are still dressed like in the beach). Blake and Jak stared with O.O faces and Blake said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Alright... this doesn't make sense anymore... I'm going to play Super Smash Bros Brawl... on a PS3. Don't disturb me...\"- Blake said, and started to walk out of the room.

Nowhere... you? you better ask HER...\"- Blake said, and transformed to his light form at 7 times, and jumped backward, landing into Joana's open hand. Her other hand was aimed at Guadalupe and fired a white beam, that pierced through her (No blood. She's not real, ok?) and slowly disappeared. Blake stared at Joana, she smiled at him, and they vanished as well...</span></div></div>",

People were there, and Jasmine started to attack, again. Jak saw this, and due to his strong sense of justice,  he went to combat his own girlfriend. Jak dashed to the city, and then he flew into the air, and shot an energy beam at Jasmine's legs. Jasmine stumbled a bit, but wasn't too damaged. Jak then tried to deliver a punch to Jasmine, but she swatted him into a building, which he left a crater into the stone wall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're totally going be gased after this one.\" Jasmine said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJak flew out of the crater, and continued to fight on. Jasmine just stood there, yawning. Jak felt insulted, and he flew at a higher speed. Jasmine was caught off guard when Jak hit both of her legs, causing her to fall down. As she was falling down, Jak saw a few people who were about to be flattened, and he dashed to save them quickly, and he did, telling them to get inside. Jak was starting to pant, and was getting tired. Jasmine fell down, and she made a small quake happen. Jasmine took a bit of hurt from that, and she was surprised at that. Jak then started to shoot a ton of energy blasts at Jasmine, trying to pin her down, and finish her off. There was smoke covering Jasmine, and Jak was panting even harder. Jasmine then teleported to where Jak was, in the sky, and she grabbed Jak with her two hands, and started to tighten her grip. The pressure was great, and Jak felt his Omega Form went away. He reverted, and shortly after he passed out. Jasmine realized her work was done, but Jak was going to remain shrunk with her until Blake was fully healed. Jasmine was going to somehow get Jak to like her and the powers again. </span></div></div>",

Blake does't want me to protect him at all...\"- Joana said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Huh?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Blake is the one who has protected me for a long time. He had the excuse of that he didn't want me to get hurt, and since Blaze appeared, I've had to stand on the sidelines. Specially after Blaze showed inhuman powers, and Blake trained to reach his level.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Blake has faced dangerous situations on his own even before Blaze appeared. He even fought more than 5 guys some times, or faced monstrous bulies such as Ivan, and got badly hurt, but doesn't care about himself... He doesn't understand that seeing him wounded hurts me...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I feel the same about Jak. For 2 years I've got this power and I've used it to protect him from Nostory and Seth because Jak had no means of defending himself, other than some Jutsu skills...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Maybe you should give him a chance. That's what I want Blake to do with me...\"- Joana said, and Jasmine understood why Joana knew, she was feeling the same way Jak was probably feeling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What Blake has come to dislike is that... I... that I am the same 'species' as him...\"- Joana added<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Species?\"- Jasmine didn't understand<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You descend from a Goddess. Well, we've been told that Blake descends from the Azrael, the last Archangel, one who even Blaze seems to have feared. Well, I descend from a similar angel... Azrael's girlfriend... Ren'Ai...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Wait a minute... girlfriend?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"It seems that they got separate while Blaze came down to Earth or something. Lith hasn't told much about it, mostly because of Blake...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"And he doesn't like that you're like him?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Nope. He thinks that is pathethic that of all people, he ended up with one precisely in a similar status as him, which makes all his life a joke, because that would mean he didn't anything by himself...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"He should be happy. The excuse he uses of you not understanding him is not true anymore... Maybe he feels like he must never be understood nor loved...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"How do you know that?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"After suffering what you've told me Blake has been through... His father is dead... his family hates him... his friend and mentor died just like his father... and his grandmother succumbed to her age... I can guess Blake has lots of traumas, and possibly thinks that he must be unhappy forever...\"- Jasmine said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Brilliant deduction, though I already know. The thing is that Blake won't let me even try to heal those wounds\"- Joana replied, sadder<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I see\"- Jasmine said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I think Jak wants to fight Nostory and Seth at your side, without you having to worry that much about him. I guess that what he really wants is to help you...\"- Joana said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"But he came to dislike all about our shrinking games... he didn't run away of me like he's done lately...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Well, Blake and I hadn't shrinking games... Shrinking was a bad experience to him, though to me, it helped him to trust me a bit more, after all, he had to trust me with his life... and we kinda had some difficulties...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Difficulties?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Blake got snatched by a girl who wanted him for herself, and got snatched back by another girl who also wanted him... and one more girl snatched him once more...\"- Joana said the last 7 words with an angry tone<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I thought Karina was Blake's friend...\"- Jasmine said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"It wasn't her... It was Claire...\"- Joana whispered, who sounded angrier, and Jasmine got surprised, because she knew (not much) who she was. Another friend of them, who traveled among them. She wasn't sure if Clairee had a crush on Blake despite she acted suspicious, and exchanged death glares with Joana some times. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"In the end, I rescued him, but he was a bit shocked by the shrinking, and learning about Blaze. He had challenged him to survive a month being shrunk, and after that, he'd unshrink and fight him. If he won, Blaze would leave. Blake fought him, though they were slightly above average human level at that time*. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake fought trying his best, but Blaze wasn't even breaking a sweat. Some golden light illuminated Blake, and he transformed into light form for the first time. He kicked Blaze's ass, and forced him to leave. After that, Blake disappeared for long time, he returned very late to our house... that was 2 years ago, and now, I recently found that he was training really hard so he could beat Blaze and never get shrunk ever again...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"And I thought Jak overreacted to shriking...\"- Jasmine said, both she and Joana laughed, though only Joana knew why was Blake afraid of shrinking.... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"But he's getting over it... in his own way...\"- Joana concluded<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size25\" style=\"\"><b>*Just to clear, Blaze was fighting at a level near to Blake's, but still enough to overwhelm him. Blake's power at that time was 520, while Blaze fought at 740. Blake's starting strength, I mean, the level he had when first fought Blaze, and only had gotten stronger from human level fights, was of 110 against Blaze's 330. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze really holds back, as he doesn't need to fight at full strength. However, he underestimated Blake when fought him after two years (This story's first fight). Blaze's real power remained unknown for long ago, and yet its real limits are not known. However, given his sealed form, he can go as far as 27,000. And it MAY be possible that Blaze's power only stops at 30,000. Being that the barrier he can't get through unless he releases Omega<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPS: The average people here has a power varying from 50 to 70. Only martial artists would range from 70 - 100. What I mean, is that Blake only had a high human level, no superpowers at all.</b></font></span></div></div>",

Blake found himself painting Joana's nails...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What the hell?!! How did I end here?!!\"- Joana giggled, and Blake said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Seriously... I was saying that I was not going to...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n5 minutes more later... Blake has completed Joana's left hand, and is paiting her right one<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"God...dess dammit!!\"- This time, Blake heard a familiar laugh inside his mind, he said mentally<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'It was YOU, bastard!!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I'm your instincts. I tell you what you have to do...'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Then WHY am I doing this?'

But I'm sure you'll get your reward...' Blake's darkness answered<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'You perv...'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Heh...' Blake's darkness laughed<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'So you took over?!! How?!! I didn't even call your powers!!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I told you... ever since you've been with her, I was finally unleashed, and the more you're near her, the more freedom I'll get... Paradoxically, she also harms me when I'm outside...'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'You don't know how much I hate you right now...'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'THIS wouldn't happen if you had been like any other person and let me be free from the beginning!!

You actually need me!!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'If I master the light, not anymore. So as long I can get over this, you can kiss goodbye your freedom because I'm going to kill you, bind you, kill you a second time, chain you, burn you with fire and acid, and then throw you to the deepest and darkest part of my soul...and close the door!!!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake's dark side scowled and seemingly, went away. Blake sighed, and noticed that while he was cursing his dark side, he had already done 3 of Joana's nails, and came to realize that they were painted black<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Uh... what's going on here?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Why are your nails black, did you just become goth or something?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"No, but a little birdie told me that you like black...\"- Joana answered playfully<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"...Ermmm... whoever that little birdie is, doesn't know me... I like black in clothing and most of things... but in this... I'd prefer your nails unpainted**...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Well... it's not like they will remain like this forever...\"- Joana said, realizing that Blake was being honest, though she couldn't understand it too well<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Alright...\"- Blake sighed and finished the last two nails. Joana briefly checked them, and hugged him tightly. Blake blushed more than normally, and more when Joana gave him a big and long kiss....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size2\" style=\"\"><b>*Despite the damage was done to the spare body and spare organs, they need time to heal back, in the mean time, Blake isn't getting out of his real body...<br>\r\n** Actually, that is a real trait of myself, for some reason, I don't like that much painted nails, lipstick, makeup, or high heels in Joana.

Jaxx stood, just as creepy looking as always.  Zenn slowly formed his blades in the air and grabbed them.  They were pretty long.  If he pointed them straight down they would be only millimeters away from the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Zenn... How nice of you to drop by for a visit.\" Came Jaxx's voice omninously. \"Where should I send you this time?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not this time Jaxx.  This time I put you where you belong.\" Zenn said and began his charge.  Jaxx just tied him in black flaming ropes.  Zenn fought and tried to break out but to no avail.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are almost ready.  One more and you can destroy him.\" Jaxx said to him and opened a portal.  He broke the ropes and hit him with an odd beam.  He then kicked him in the chest and sent him into the portal.  \"Soon Zenn.  Soon it will be your time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZenn's vision went from that if a dark omninous room to a girls bedroom.  Just really big.  He was about 3 feet above the ground.  But to his shrunken self, it was a long fall.  He hit the bed and bounced onto a bar, then started falling again.  A platform formed under him and he rode gently to the ground.  He saw Joana and Jasmine searching for their boyfriends and immediately sprinted under the bed.  He started mumbling strings of curses with Jaxx peppered into them.  Then he saw a movement under the dresser.  It was a foot from a person his size.  Then a foot from the huge person came into a view.  He jumped and dug his blades into the bed and held them for dear life.  Jasmine stuck her face under and he went into complete silence.  She pulled away, not noticing anything.  He decided the best thing would be to keep together with the other two.  He sprinted over to the dresser unnoticed.  Jak and Blake both looked at him with a face of surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJak dropped down and went into the open to call to the girls.  He got their attention and Zenn jumped into action.  He roundhouse kicks Blake and sprints over to the other side of the dresser.  He begins flamestepping and jams the blades into the back of the dresser.  He then, once again, held on for dear life.  By the time Blake got up from his surprise attack and Jak pointed to where he was it was as if he had disappeared.  The four began to search for him and after about 10 minutes, Joana saw him hanging.  For about two seconds they just looked at eachother.  Zenn, with a look of terror, and Joana with a look that she wanted to be a kind smile.  Zenn took it as a look of laughter, like she was going to eat him.  Zenn and Joana broke out of their staring contest at the same moment.  Joana telling everyone she found him, and Zenn jumping across to the wall and preparing to fight.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe launched himself across the gap and slashed Joana's chin.  He then kicked off and ran across the dresser.  Everyone began heading towards Joana.  Zenn was hiding under a piece of paper, and cowering, knowing he was going to be killed.  Joana had lost him, and began looking for him again saying \"He has to be up here.\" after a bit a pair of huge hands with painted red fingernails picked up the paper.  The other hand wrapped around him before the sword formed.  Zenn was now captured.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>-\"Alright, let's go straight to the point, who are you and why are you here?\"- Blake said, slightly angry<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Why should I tell you?\"- Zenn answered<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I'll show you why...\"- Blake clenched his fists and Jak stopped him, he asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Well, what has been this for?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Just defended myself from those giant monsters... Not that I have to tell you anything...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"That's it!!\"- Blake shouted angrily<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Wait... shouldn't we... uhh... solve this without fighting?\"- Jak was trying to stop Blake, but he answered very seriously<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I don't think he's gonna answer us nicely... and he has burnt MY girlfriend... that's something I won't forget...\"- Blake said firmly, Jak then replied<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I'm fighting too\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I hope this doesn't sound selfish, but I don't like fighting two on one... if I'm on the 'two' side... and what's more, I'll tell you in less than 5 minutes how tough he is...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJak could almost feel the fire in Blake's look and words, and let him go... though he was confused by what Blake said... less than 5 minutes... he would tell the guy's strength...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZenn had turned around and walked away, just to feel an impact on his left side, which sent him away (several feet to them, though in real scale, just some inches), he almost crashed into the wall if it he hadn't used his fire platforms again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">[Background Music: Helloween - Deliver us from temptation <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssI-6JwwueU\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssI-6Jwwu...</a> ]</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe turned quickly to see what hit him... It was a guy, the dark skinned and black haired one. This guy was wearing a brown leather jacket*, a black shirt under it, and black tennis shoes. And it was obvious that it was no accident, Zenn knew that the hit he received demonstrated that he was no ordinary person, and so, he prepared to fight, forming two fire swords in his hands<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake took his jacket off and threw it a good distance away, without saying anything, he charged at Zenn, and punched him in the stomach, however, Zenn didn't even move an inch. Blake had very little time to react before he got cut by one of Zenn's fire blades. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'It seems it was just a lucky hit... though, he's definitively stronger than average...' Zenn thought, and dashed toward Blake, in the last moment, Blake dodged him, and connected a punch in Zenn's face, though, it didn't hurt him, and Zenn punched Blake back, sending him away (again, several feet to them...). Blake quickly got up and brushed off the dust from his shirt. Then, he seemingly concentrated on something, his hair rose up, his eyes changed to golden and was surrounded by a golden fire-like aura. Zenn was slightly surprised, though he didn't show it. Both guys dashed at each other, and there was a quick exchange of attacks, after it, Zenn was still unharmed, while a wound opened in Blake's left shoulder... not a very deep one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake then dashed and pretended to punch Zenn, who prepared to block, and much to his surprise, Blake kicked him in the stomach, then, took advantage of breaking his defense, and connected a long (but fast) combo which sent Zenn upward with a kick. Zenn braked** with his flame stepping platforms, and when he realized, Blake was slightly above him, and punched him downward, this time, crashing into the floor. He got up, and wiped off a small bit of blood from his right lips' corner. He mumbled<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"That almost hurt...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen he jumped (again, taking impulse on his fire platforms) and slashed at Blake, who blocked, but got his forearms burnt (superficially, still painful). Blake then landed, and said <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"As I said, Jak... I'll tell you how tough this guy is... by fighting at his level...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen he started to glow into a more intense aura, this time, the wind around him swirled and the aura flowed faster. His eyes glowed in golden for a while, then, he disappeared... Zenn didn't know what happened, and found out the hard way... getting hit in the stomach, the chest, the chin, and the back of his neck in an insanely quick combo... he slashed at Blake, this time, cutting him in the right cheek. Zenn noticed Blake's scar in the eye in the brief moments he was in close combat, and knew that this guy was used to fighting...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside, Joana sensed Blake's energy changing, and knew that he was fighting. She rushed inside the room and Jasmine followed her, and watched Blake powering up. Joana didn't want him to fight because he hadn't recovered from heavy damage and a heart attack... but Jak flew in front of her, and Jasmine stopped her arms. Jak said, seriously<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I may not agree with what Blake is doing... but he's doing it for you. I didn't know he was that serious when it was about you... so, at least let him do this...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"And you said he didn't care that much about you\"- Jasmine said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"He does... but not in the way I'd like...\"- Joana said and sighed. They walked outside, and only Jak stayed in the room. Blake and Zenn were too focused in their fight to notice what happened... and speaking of that, let's go back to the fight...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZenn stepped back a good distance using his fire platforms and again, Blake appeared behind him, about to connect a kick, but Zenn countered and thrusted one of his blades in Blake's calf. Then he slashed Blake in the chest, both cutting and burning him, and sent him down with a downward kick. Both guys fell, Zenn landing with his feet on Blake's chest, and tried to stab Blake with his fire sword blades. Much to his surprise, Blake stopped them with his bare hands and pushed him off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZenn threw his fire blades at Blake, who dodged them but got hit by another pair that Zenn threw while he was dodging. Then he added a fire beam, which hit Blake and created a small explosion. After the smoke and dust vanished, Blake stood, though burnt and bleeding. His hand glowed and his wounds glowed in golden, and stopped bleeding. Jak and Zenn were surprised by this technique, but Joana knew the truth (yes, she's judging Blake's moves by feeling his energy flow's changes and this tells her that Blake isn't healing)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'He's not healing... he's...patching his body? what kind of trick is that? Energy patches***?' Joana wondered<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake extended his hand and said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Sunlight shards... pieces of heaven... made into knives, piercing the enemy...\"- A golden circle made of energy light appeared in front of Blake's hand and shot 7 knives made of light at Zenn, who had barely time to dodge most of them, though 3 of the 7 blades struck him on the shoulders and his thigh. Blake again appeared suddenly before him and aiming his hand at him, shot at point blank 7 more blades (I know, he didn't repeat the incantation, somehow, Blake mainatined the spell to perform it a second time without repeating the incantation... this is a sign of development on light arts)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Zenn blocked them crossing his two fire swords, and meanwhile, Blake took from the floor two of the light blades that missed, and said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I know your trick... I can pull it off too...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so, they started to fight, each one using their blades, light against fire... a bit paradoxical... Zenn moved really fast by using his fire platforms instead of standing on the floor, and could keep up with Blake's speed, and kept exchanging slashes, until, after Blake blocked Zenn's fire blades, his own light blades broke into pieces (They weren't mean to be used for melee fighting in the first place... Just another improvisation of Blake...) Blake had an 'Damn it...' look, and Zenn sank his fire blades into Blake's shoulders<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake then, while still having the blade stuck into his shoulders, punched Zenn in the stomach, who, given the situation, couldn't block. Blake kicked him in the stomach with such force that sent him away and got the blades off. Zenn thought 'If this is his true power, I'll have to fight him with all my strength...' Then he jumped up so Blake followed him, and while air fighting, realized that Blake's disappearing was because of extreme speeds... He came to a logical conclusion, and when Blake kicked him in the face, he stuck his two fire blades into Blake's right calf, and quickly forming another pair, stuck them into Blake's right thigh, with a third pair, he managed to cut a deep wound in Blake's leg, and when they fell down, Blake crashed into the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You are stronger than I thought, but I don't have time for this... if you value your life you should retreat\"- Zenn's fire blades vanished and he walked away. But suddenly, the wind changed and Blake stood (limping) in front of him. He took out the 4 fire blades stuck in his leg and said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Actually, I don't value my life...\"- He disappeared and reappeared right before him, and Zenn had little time to dodge the incoming punch. He dashed back and reformed his fire blades<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"And I was starting to think you were a warrior... it seems that you are just a reckless troublemaker\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake and Zenn stood in guard stances before each other...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size25\" style=\"\"><b>*Maybe I forgot to mention, but Blake never wears his jackets closed.<br>\r\n**Not completely sure of how it's said/written correctly... a conjugator in Internet conjugated brake as a verb...<br>\r\n***Yeah, an improvised technique... Without mastery over darkness, Blake lacks the demonic healing factor, at least while he isn't under his darkness' control. Maybe next time Blake should stick to bandages or duck tape?</b></font></span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Blake disappeared and attempted to attack Zenn from behind, but he used his fire platforms to dodge him quickly, and slashed at Blake's already damaged leg. Still, Blake disappeared again and connected a punch in Zenn's chin, he shot a fire ball to counter him, then he said, forming again his fire blades<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I didn't think you'd move like that with just one leg...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"There are alot of things you don't know about me...\"- Blake then extended his hand, and a sword came from who-knows-where into his hand. The sword was none other than the sword Lith gave him, though, it shrank to a proper size for Blake... well... not that proper... but at least is small enough to be wielded... it looks like this: <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.tantra.ph/mudha/images/nikrato.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.tantra.ph/mudha/images/nikrat...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Hmph... you plan to use a metal sword against fire? You are either stupid or crazy, or maybe both...\"- Both guys dashed at each other, ad Zenn thought he'd melt Blake's sword easily. The metal clashed againt the fire, but didn't show any sign of melting. Zenn's fire blades, which were orange/red changed to blue, as he increased his own fire's heat. Blake was keeping up against the two fire blades, though their increased heat damaged his hands and arms, even if he shielded with his wide sword.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJak observed the fight. he was surprised by Blake's level, and because he was fighting with just one leg and severe wounds...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Is his real body that stronger than the spare one? Or is this the result of that mysterious training? Maybe it's both...' Jak thought as he saw Blake and Zenn fighting with a lot of mid-air attacks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake tried to punch Zenn, but he stepped back quickly, and when he realized, it seemed that Blake had already planned his next move... While Zenn was dodging, Blake had risen up his sword and struck the floor with great strength, cracking it, and making a small quake*, which knocked Zenn off his feet. Blake appeared in front of him and landed a punch on his face, sinking him into the hard floor. Zenn kicked him and jumped by using his fire platforms to take impulse. He stood high in the air (well... about 2 real meters... though to them it was a lot more...) and when Blake appeared behind him to attack, Zenn dodged him and countered, kicking him upward. He saw how Blake was falling down, and realized of something<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'He's... falling? Is this a trick?' Zenn thought<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake manaed to land safely... well... somewhat... Zenn then realized that Blake was not able to fly, nor had any other way to move in air other than jumping (Well, Zenn can't fly either... but his fire platforms are just as good) He used again impulse on his platforms to descend quickly and attempted to attack Blake, who blocked with his sword, though he still felt his hands burning due to the intense heat. Blake fired a golden energy beam at him, hurling him againt the wall, and cracking it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZenn wasn't expecting that, and quickly climbed up (using his blades as alpenstock/ice axes... I'm not totally sure how are those tools called) to dodge a barrage of energy balls. He jumped from the wall and stopped mid air with the fire platforms once more, and Blake attacked him, he connected several punches and with a kick, he tok impulse into the wall, and from there, he jumped again toward Zenn, who already knew what he was going to do, and stuck his fire blades into Blake's shoulders right before Blake punched him. Zenn kicked him downward and shot a fire wave from his hands. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Blake countered it with a light energy ball, creating a moderate (to them) explosion. Then, Blake again disappeared and attacked Zen with a kick, this time, Zenn countered with a kick as well, and the force  of that impact sent them both away in opposite directions. Zenn quickly got up, while Blake was having a hard time. Seeing him struggling to get up, Zenn sighed and turned around, his fire blades vanished and started to walk away<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake said angrily<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"This is NOT over yet!!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"This was over before it started...\"- Zenn said, not turning around, and still walking away. Blake then clenched his fists and managed to stand up, and felt that his damaged leg was getting healed. He heard a voice inside his mind<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'You owe me a big one more' Blake's inner darkness** said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I don't care...' Blake answered in his thought<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Well, I'm gonna have fun later...'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake then started to power up, his aura changed from flowing outward to upward, it became a lot more jagged, and instead of fire-lke, it became more electric-like. Also, Blake's body bulked up a bit, and the muscles tightened a lot. Blake's hair became slightly more spiked, though it still pointed upward. Also, his eyes glowed in golden intensely. Then, he dashed toward Zenn with full speed, punching him in the back with tremendous force, sending him against another wall, and crashing against it, this time, not only he cracked it, but sank a bit into it. He quickly formed his fire blades and didn't see Blake anywhere, then, he felt a lot of sudden punches and Blake was barely visible. Zenn managed to catch Blake's fist and with this temporary stop, he managed to get out of the (now damaged, though not really much in real size's view) wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Where does this energy come from?!! He was barely able to stand up!!' Zenn thought, while dashing backward. Much to his surprise, Blake was in front of him and then appeared behind him, he connected a long combo by punching him from the front and from behind, Blake sent him upward with a punch and fired a wide two-handed golden beam at him. The explosion was considerable (grenade-like to normal scale, mostly like the weakest grenade). Zenn was standing on his fire platforms on the air, his swords crossed, in an attempt to block the beam. He looked at Blake and said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"This makes no sense... if you were this strong then you were just playing the whole time...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Heh...\"- Blake gave an evil smile, and Zenn saw, surprised, a strange ghostly silhouette surrounding Blake. The silhouette looked like Blake, but his hair was waving continuously upward, and it seemed that his skin was darker. Zenn could feel the darkness in him, and added<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I see your hypocrisy...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Huh?\"- Blake and Jak were surprised aat the same time<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You apparently fight with light powers, but your heart is dark...\"- Zenn replied, and inside Blake's mind, Blake's darkness smiled, then said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Don't pay attention to him, KILL HIM!!!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake seemingly didn't hear him, but rushed to attack Zenn, (without sword, in case you wonder), delivering powerful blows that made the room tremble (again, only to Jak, Blake and Zenn), and Zenn had  a hard time blocking them, he was surprised at Blake punching his fire blades without feeling any pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'What did he mean? How does he know? Maybe Blake is right and this guy is up to no good...' Jak thought while (still) watching the fight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake and Zenn kept exchanging attacks at insane speeds, but this time Zenn was the one against the ropes, his only chance was to take advantage on Blake's inability to fly. And he still made up for that with extreme speeds and incredible mid air fighting. Zenn slashed several wounds ion him but Blake didn't even flinch. Then, after dodging several attacks, Zenn got smashed downward by Blake. He quickly landed on the sloor and dashed to attack once more, but he stopped suddenly, his hair regained its normal shape, and fell to the floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZenn, who was now heavily damaged, walked away, but got kicked by Jak, who was transformed in his Omega form, Zenn thought<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'If this guy is as strong as the other one... I have no chance of winning...'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut before any of them did anything, Joana and Jasmine rushed inside the room. Joana gasped when saw Blake's unconscious and really damaged body. Then she gave Zenn an angry glare, and when he realized, a transparent white-ish energy sphere was surrounding him. He tried to break it with his fire swords but he found that they couldn't even pierce the force field. Then he prepared to burn it, and Jasmine said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I wouldn't do that if I were you... unless you want to become your own BBQ...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Joana grabbed Blake and felt that he wasn't breathing, and after placing him near her ear, she realized that his heart wasn't beating, and very worried, she healed Blake with as much energy as she could. Blake's body got healed but remained unconscious... and yeah... Blake just had another heart attack... which happened because Blake didn't do as the doctor Powerman said, so, the moral here is: Kids, don't fight with super powers when a doctor tells you that they caused you a heart attack...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Actually, since they're 2 inches tall, the cracks aren't a big deal to repair... And nobody else other than Blake, Jak and Zenn would have felt the quake...<br>\r\n** I've got some mails from readers asking about this guy's proper name... well, to be honest, it hasn't one... he calls himself Demon Blake, but it's more accurate to call him the darkness inside Blake's soul... or Blake's inner darkness... Dark Blake is partially him, though this term is applied when Blake is taken over by the darkness... also, his personality goes from wild to somewhat controlled... and by the way, Blake calls him a jerk most of the time...</span></div></div>",

Jak was glad that they were on summer break, so he didn\u2019t have to worry about grades. Nostory and Seth were already enough to handle. Then adding a clone of Yasmin made that more difficult.

He jumped up and ran out from under the bed.  Kicking a hole in the window, he jumps out onto the side.  He slides down and catches himself with a roll.  There, in the woods is the black form,  broken only by the white mask, that was Jaxx.  Zenn felt his power kick in and watched the ground recede from his view.  He charged him, but felt himself teleport to Jaxx's tower.  \"Zenn.  Good to see you're alive.  But, you look a bit shaken, maybe by the children?\" came Jaxx's voice with it's usual arrogance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jaxx.  Too bad something didn't kill you while I was gone.  And you look as much like a freak of nature as you did before.  But, enough talk, this time I will kill you.\" Said Zenn in his own voice.  They both took their charge at the same moment, Zenn, with twin fireballs by his sides.  Jaxx met him in the same fashion fireballs colliding in a bang and each matching eachothers slashes.  Soon, Zenn got the upper hand.  Jaxx shoved him away and began one of his rolling barrages*, as he had done many times before.  But as he rolled, Zenn formed a platform, which he rolled into.  On his back, Jaxx took a few cuts before teleporting in a sizzle of dark fire, he came back behind Zenn, who connected a roundhouse kick like the one he gave to Blake.  Jaxx teleported away and began to use a spell with an incantation.  \"Dark torches of the night, burn me a shield.  Block out the light!\" he began to be surrounded by dark fire which molded into his shape.  Zenn hit him with a beam and it just was absorbed into the shield.  He then formed blades and they fought, Jaxx in a beserk mode, while Zenn was stuck in a defensive state.  It stated like that until Zenn began thinking, \"If I make an incantation, will it work\" he began mulling it over in his head, thinking of something to say.  \"Spirits of fire and light, burn through the night!\" a massive beam shot out of Zenn's hand, destroying the shield.  Both fell to the ground, Zenn, out of energy, Jaxx, wounded by the thing that had drained Zenn.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Zenn, I have watched you grow in power, but you have never messed me up like this.  I can't help you anymore.  The next time I see you will be my last.  Go with Blake, Jak and Ryan.  They will help you.  Once I'm gone, you will face something more powerful than you can imagine.  Don't fail me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZenn faded back into the world behind the ship.  Confused and exhausted by what had just happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

After a while, everyone else was getting tired and giving up, and Joana said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Let's stop this. We aren't finding that guy...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"That's what he wants to hear!! And my money is on that he's here to spy on us...\"- Blake said, who kept searching in any possible corner<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"The only thing he said was that his presence was an accident...\"- Jak said, trying to calm the frantic Blake down<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Riiight... he appears shrunken out of nowhere, in a dimension that's not even our home world, and in a spaceship... which is in the middle of space!!\"- Blake said, sounding even more paranoid<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Well...\"- Jak said, trying to find an argument against that -\"It's landing....-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You know that's not the point!! And the only ones who can do the teleport thing between dimension are Blaze, the Ryans and Lith, and I doubt the latter ones would do such a thing to us, so my bet is on Blaze...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"That's quite a good reasoning...\"- Jak said, and Jasmine glared at him, like saying 'Don't raise his paranoia' Then Joana grabbed Blake, and she said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"If he's to appear again we'll take care of it, now let's go back to our room and let's finish our game...\"- Joana said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I'm not waiting for him to strike first!!\"- Only Joana raised an eyebrow at Blake's statement<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You always said that in any fight, you never did the first attack...\"- She said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"That was when it just was between someone else and me. But Blaze and Zenn made it personal...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"But you had another heart attack!!\"- Joana replied, worried<br>\r\n <br>\r\n-\"It was not that bad. Now that I'm healed I'm going to kick that guy's ass...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Uhm... Blake... you were healed when you fought him the first time...\"- Jak said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I still don't understand what happened... I should have been able to do better than I did... With the aura at 7 times he should be history...\"- Blake said, and he, Joana, Jasmine and Jak heard a female voice<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Actually, I can explain that...\"- Lith appeared before them, and Blake said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You need to stop appearing before people out of nothing...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Whatever...\"- Was her reply, then she added -\"Blake, you haven't understood how living energy works, right?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Huh?!\"- Everyone was caught with \"?\" over their heads<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"It can't be that difficult... I got beaten, Joana healed me and refilled my energy, what's difficult about that? I should have been at full power when I fought the creepy guy...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Not really... You see... Non-divine living forms have at least two types of energy... Though Earth's living forms rely mostly on just one...  Well, what I mean is that in all of you, there is what we may call, standard energy, or extra energy, which is what allows you to do anything above regular human specs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis energy exists in every living form, but in most of Earth ones, it's a very little amount, and it needs training to grow and get enhanced. Most of humans are born with an amount so small that they can't even feel that it exists, except in some extreme moments. You need this energy to fight, and it's what Joana refills in you when she heals you...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"So I was right...\"- Blake said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"No. There's a second type of energy, the vital energy, which all living forms rely upon. That energy is forcefully required by your body, as you're still a human. Your vital energy grows as you train, but at a much slower and lesser rate than your extra energy. And the only thing that can refill your vital energy is... food... or any other way to get nutrients into your blood...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I still don't get what's the point...\"- Blake said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You haven't eaten anything in the whole day...\"- Lith said, almost calmly, and everyone was o.o<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"WHAT?!\"- Asked a now very, very worried Joana, and while she started getting frantic, Lith said to Jak and Jasmine<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I can't guarantee the same for you two. I don't know what were Goddess Gabriel's designs like, or how similar were they to Chaos'. But I could say that is pretty much the same... though it seems that you can refill even vital energy... I don't know...\"- Then she turned to Jak -\"And as for you, I don't know much about your body structure either...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"No problem...\"- The couple replied, feeling a bit awkward about being referred as different...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Here we go again... Joana's ultrapanicked superoverprotective mode...\"- Blake sighed, and felt how Joana pressed him tightly against her chest<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"It's kinda my fault... I wasn't expecting a surprise attack... Blake was in fact going back to the house and spend the rest of the day normally, but the incident with Naraku, Orochimaru and Aizen happened, and, after the fight, and all the stress, and the new guy, I forgot about that...\"- Lih said scratching the back of her head, which looked cute and strange (You wouldn't expect a goddess to act like that, would you? I wouldn't...)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"So...*mph!!*... you...*mph!!!* mean that... *mmmphh!!* I lost to Zenn... *mphh!!!* just because I haven't eaten?!!\"- Blake gasped after that, he was struggling against Joana's unconsciously but insanely tight protective hug<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"That has to be the most ridiculous thing I have heard today...\"- Blake said, and gasped more for air<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"It's true... and Joana, Blake needs oxygen as well...\"- Lith said, and Joana relased her tight hug, blushing a bit, but still kept Blake in a protective position<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Wait a minute... how come you aren't hungry? Your stomach should hurt as hell\"- Jak asked to Blake<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I'm used to spending long times without food. After a few hours I feel nothing, maybe just a slight headache*...\"- Blake said, and Joana brought him near her eyes, then she gasped<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What now?\"- Blake asked, reluctant to more care from his girlfriend<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"How long have you been without food?\"- Joana asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I don't know, at least 12 hours, maybe more...why?\"- Blake answered, still angry at the fact that he still needed food despite training hard to become stronger<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I hadn't noticed because you are shrunk... your scleras are really yellow...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Huh?!\"- Blake said, and Jasmine came nearer with Jak in her hand, all of them watching Blake's yellowish eyes<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Woow... now that's strange...\"- Jak said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Are you sick?\"- Jasmine asked, and Blake, a bit exasperated, said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Stop watching me, all of you!!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"He's not sick... but his eyes have always indicated Blake's status*... I suspected something when I noticed that Blake's eyes were white when the week began and became yellowish as the week passed... Karina told me that she knew that too, and that it shows how weakened can Blake be... the yellower, the weaker...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Weird...\"- Jak added<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"And they had only become this yellow after you lost to Ivan...\"- Joana added<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Thanks a lot, Lith...\"- Blake mumbled -\"It doesn't matter anyway....\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"It matters!! I don't want you to have another heart attack or something!! Dr Powerman said you need to rest for a week!!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"There goes my training... I'm starting to feel old already...\"- Blake said angrily, but Jasmine and Jak couldn't help but laugh about the tone Blae was saying it (he was serious, but it was still somehow fun)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, somewhere, in an unknown place...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I think he's starting to have trouble with his weak human nature...\"- An unknown man's silhouette appeared and said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"He can get over it. He's a strong boy...\"- Lith replied to her mysterious visitor<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I'm still not sure about how long should he keep his weak nature... You know, he needs to be fully restored at some point...\"-The man said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"He will, as his power grows and develops. It's too soon...\"- Lith answered<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Have you told him about the consequences?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Not yet. He's not ready. His emotional status is very fragile, despite his looks...\"- Lith answered, in a serious tone<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You'll have to tell him someday, before his evolution goes further...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"There's still plenty of time. Blake has still a lot to develop yet...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"We can't push our luck... Omega's pieces haven't been destroyed, and if he is restored...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I know... we'll take care of that too... but for now, let these guys be. The Ryans are really good guys. They have helped Blake and the others a lot. He's improved in the time he's been training with them than his whole life...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Well, let's see how far can that body go...\"- The man concluded, and disappeared as quietly as he appeared...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size2\" style=\"\"><b>*As strange as it might sound, both of these facts are true... after a long timw without food, I only feel a slight headache, however, it's been at least 2 years that I haven't suffered lack of food. And as for the eye sclera thing, it's true as well... Joana and Karina use it to check on me... which is a bit annoying, I mean, why the hell do my eyes reveal such a thing?!!</b></font></span></div></div>",

I guess we'll be free for a while... PS3 anyone?\"- Blake said happier, and Jak nudged him, saying<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Uhm... We're shrunk, remember?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Duh...\"- Blake said, and looked down<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You can still spend time with me...\"- Joana said, trying to sound cheerful, but Blake simply sighed, which made her slightly angrier, and grabbed him rather forcefully<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Hey!!\"- Blake was about to say something when Joana tightened her grip on him and said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Dr. Powerman told me to feed you and keep you safe, so you ARE going to be with ME...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"That's a definitive ouch...\"- Jak said, and he was grabbed by Jasmine as well, though not as forcefully as Joana did<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"We also need to eat...\"- Jasmine said to her boyfriend, who simply nodded in agreement<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Why am I the one with bad luck?\"- Blake asked nobody in particular<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I'm just worried about you... I have to, since you don't worry about yourself...\"- Joana said, in a sweeter way -\"Let's go and get something for you...\"- She said and her stomach growled loudly. She blushed in embarrassment and Blake laughed<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Heh. It seems you're hungry as well...\"- <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Joana said nothing, and started to walk toward the kitchen, and Jasmine followed her, Blake whispered to Jak<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Why always do girls feel embarrassed by such a thing?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I have no idea... hell, I'm younger than you, you should know!!\"- Was Jak's answer</span></div></div>",

Blake said seriously, and Demon Blake replied happily<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Oh, that's good... you're being aggressive to me because I'm not letting you sleep... why? BECAUSE YOUR INSTINCTS, A.K.A ME, ARE TELLING YOU TO DO SO!!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I hate you so much... one of these days I'm going to rip you part by part, kill them, pour gasoline on them and burn them...'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Where are you going to get gasoline?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'ARGHH!!

Joana giggled at this, and Jasmine breathed a sigh of relief. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, let's shrink them a bit more.\" Jasmine said. \"We should be fine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...Jasmine?\" Joana started to say. \"I removed all the layers, now what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We put the boys in the middle.\" Jasmine replied. \"Near the ham.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJasmine then shrunk Jak some more, and Joana did the same to Blake, and they both rocked their boyfriends, just to relax them a bit more, and it worked and then they sat them back in their respective halves of the sandwich, and then sat the sandwich back in the exact spot. Blake then woke, and the girls vanished instantly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake tried to move in the sandwich, but due to the girls adding on mayo and mustard, he was wrapped up inside the sandwich.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jak, wake up!\" Blake said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...wha-\" Jak said, half-awake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You got to wake up!\u201d Blake said. \u201cSomething is wrong. Really wrong\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe haven\u2019t been caught yet.\u201d Jak then tried to move, but he wasn\u2019t able to. \u201cI can\u2019t move.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMe neither, I knew sleeping in this was a bad idea\u2026.\u201d Blake said. \u201cWe probably slept, and were stuck to the ham, and rather, were like cut in half\u2026.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t like this.\u201d Jak said, he then closed his eyes, and tried to power up, but nothing happened, his hand had the white aura, but vanished immediately. \u201cNo powers still, do you have anything?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNope,\u201d Blake said. \u201cWe got to find a way out.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of a sudden, there were small tremors, which shook the kitchen floor. Blake mouthed to Jak, \u201cWe are dead.\u201d Their view was a bit obscured by the bread layers, but Jak had seen two pairs of feet walking toward him and Blake. Blake again mouthed, \u201cWere your girlfriend\u2019s nails painted red?\u201d Jak gave a simple nod and then asked \u201cYours had her nails black right?\u201d Blake nodded and then again said. \u201cWe are so screwed. Then they heard the voices of their beloveds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright\u2026\u201d Jasmine said. \u201cWe\u2019ve looked everywhere\u2026\u201d Her eyes were red again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell,\u201d Joana said her eyes red also, \u201cWe need to report back to Nostory and Blaze.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey look,\u201d Jasmine said. \u201cThere\u2019s a sandwich!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell,\u201d Joana said. \u201cI\u2019m starving and it\u2019s cut in half, so I\u2019ll take a half and you\u2019ll take a half. \u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe small quakes continued as Jasmine and Joana walked toward the man-wich. Blake and Jak were in their panic modes, and Jak could only think of one thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe got to talk to them\u2026\u201d Jak said. \u201cI know they are possessed, but we have to try.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFine.\u201d Blake said. \u201cBlaze is more than dead.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJasmine then lifted the plate on to the counter top, and Jak and Blake then started to yell their lungs out\u2026.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Now I am!!\"- Jak knew it came from Jasmine, and she said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I guess it'll be next time. I doubt just half sandwich would do...\"- Jasmine said, sounding evil and somehow sensual, then Jak said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Damn!! Blake!! we have to get the hell outta here!!\"- He tried to break free from the sandwich, but he wasn't able to, and noticed that he got no answer from Blake, and that the spot where Blake was just seconds ago was empty, then heard<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What are you waiting for?!!\"- Blake had jumped from an insane (to them) height... however, he was easily caught by Joana, who brought him near her face<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I was so close...\"- Blake couldn't have felt so hopeless (Well, maybe when he was kept prisoner by Cynthya and Lillian while shrunk for the first time... but even they wouldn't eat him, although his life was never safe with those girls... there were high chances that Cynthya would tire and starve him to death, and that Lillian squashed him under her immense rear... and possibly on purpose...)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoana used the tip of two of her fingers and pulled out several hairs of Blake's head, which lead to an *Ouch!!* from him, seemingly, she appeared a tiny portal and sent his hairs there.

Joana did her best to keep her evil demeanor, and she did, but she was very shocked, as she didn't expect Jasmine to role-play this so well. And Jasmine, on the inside was shocked and amused....she didn't expect her boyfriend to get so emotional and sad, and she really wanted to comfort him, but she had to keep still.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jasmine,\" Joana said. \"The hairs will be delivered to Nostory and Blaze.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right.\" Jasmine said, then she looked at Blake, \"You wanna eat them now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoana simply nodded and Blake gulped extra hard, and he facepalmed himself, and then he again looked at Jak, who was still crying. Joana slowly lifted Blake up from her waist then to her face. Joana licked her lips slowly, and bit her lip as well. \"HEH!!!!\" D-Blake said, and Blake just rolled his eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose you want one last kiss...\" Joana said, as a evil smile crept across her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure.\" Blake said. \"But I want you to know, no matter what, even if Blaze brainwashed you, I want you to know I-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"JASMINE!\" Jak said, still sobbing, \"I just want you to know, if you eat me, I will always be in your heart....who knows...maybe will have the chance to meet again in the next life.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww....\" Jasmine said, half out of evil and half of being touched, \"That's so romantic...\" Blake's face went like this :D \"Too bad the old Jasmine is dead though!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the girls bursted out in laughter, and Blake's face went back to D: Jak started to cry his guts out again, shocked that his meaningful love speech and  desperation move did not work. Jasmine then lifted Jak up, and then licked him, her tongue encasing his whole body, and then she sat him on top of her tongue. Jak felt his was it, and he closed his eyes, and was slowly taken inside the moist cave of his brainwashed girlfriend. Joana followed suit, and Blake was trying to fight his almost inevitable death, but Joana's tongue proved to be stronger, and he was inside Joana's mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJasmine and Joana looked at each other like \"They really don't taste good....\" and Jak and Blake came flying out, groggy, tired, and soaked with saliva...</span></div></div>",

Blake... this is weird...\"- Jak said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Shut up and enjoy the ride\"- Blake kept running at incredible speed. He had realized that when he slammed his fist on the table,it cracked, which meant that despite not having powers, he retained the enhanced strength and speed he gained through training, And so, in matter of seconds he had dragged Jak without telling anything until they got a enough advantage<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake stopped, and took some deep breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I thought we were disabled...\"- Jak commented<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Don't you remember? They disabled our powers, but with all this training, my normal form has gotten stronger and faster although not as much as my transformations...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"That's cool\"- Jak's hopes raised<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"But it seems you have only powers when you transform...\"- Blake said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"That sucks...\"- Jak facepalmed himself<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Well, we're shrunk, and can hide in a whole spaceship... I guess they won't be able to find us...\"- Blake walked toward a door, and slid under it<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"WHAT IN THE NAME OF...?!!!\"- Jak heard Blake scream, and slid under the door as well. Joana and Jasmine were yawning, and laying on two beds<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I should've stayed outside, shouldn't I?\"- Jak said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Yeah...\"- Blake said and there was an uncomfortable silence, then, Blake and Jak slid under the door again as the girls got up...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake and Jak were running (at slightly above average human speed, in difference of the speed Blake used a moment ago), and Blake said, between breaths<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"There... was... no... way... IN HELL... they could've outrun us...\"- <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while, they stopped again, this time Jak was a bit tired (Blake was running at semi normal speed, so he wasn't really tired), then Jak said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I'm guessing that they're using extreme speeds to appear where we went before us...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Nope, super speed has a weakness, the gust of wind it generates. I can tell you when has someone used super speed, exception to this is Blaze, though I don't know why, maybe because he's too fast... anyway, I can tell you that they didn't use super speed..\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Don't tell me they are teleporting, because if they are, we are SO screwed...\"- Jak said, worried<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Didn't you tell me not to invoke such things?\"- Blake said, joking<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"This is not the time for jokes!!\"- Jak said, a bit angry and ashamed that Blake saw him crying, though the former didn't even really care<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Okay... Well, we should be safe here, it's Tabitha's room?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Recurring to your cat again?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Who else? If Blaze and Nostory managed to possess Joana and Jasmine, I'd bet they controlled other human beings... so, I think Tabitha is a safe bet...\"- Blake slid under the door, Jak sighed and followed, muttering<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Not like I have a choice...\"- But before he slid, Blake shouted again<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"WHAT THE HELL??!!!\"- This time, Jak knew he had to run away, but expected Blake to run like hell, instead, he heard<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"GOD DAMMIT!!\"- Jak thought he was caught, and though he didn't have a plan, he decided to not leave hm behind, and so, he slid under the door. He saw a very shocked Blake, who was near Tabitha's chest, his hands were trembling...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What happened?\"- Jak asked, then noticed Tabitha laying on the floor, seemingly unconscious...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Her heart... isn't beating... her skin is cold...\"- Blake said, his voice was faltering<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Oh no...\"- Jak knew what it meant, he didn't know what to expect, Blake always showed to be a tough guy, but maybe this was too much<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I... I found her...abandoned in the streets... I-I raised her...practically since her birth...\"- Blake said, his voice faltered more, Jak put his hand on Blake's shoulder, despite he didn't really understood his grief, he knew it was definitively painful for Blake, who knelt before Tabitha's body<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"She was always cheerful, loyal and innocent... even as a humanoid... there was no evil in her...\"- Blake paused for a moment, then, he clenched his fists and said -\"I can't believe this... I can't forgive this!!\"- Blake slammed his fists on the floor, cracking it a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"It's like killing a child... First my girlfriend... now her... I'm frickin' gonna kill Blaze even if it kills me to do so!!!\"- Blake stood up, and shouted to the sky (ceiling?). He tried to break the seal that disabled him, and started to power up, glowing in a whitish transparent aura. White lightning bolts flashed around him, and the circles around his wrists started to glow more intensely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Blake!! Calm down!! You won't break the seal!!\"- Jak tried to calm Blake but he was so angry, and he kept powering up, then, his hair rose up, his aura changed to golden, and when his eyes were flashing to become golden as well, Blake's aura flashed into a blinding light, and when it disappeared, Jak heard a loud thud, and saw Blake laying on the floor, he said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You were right... damn... I can't do anything about anything...\"- <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJak helped him to get up, and asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Are you OK?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I guess... these things don't let me transform, so, there's no strain...\"- Blake said, after breathing deeply, calming himself<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What are we going to do?\"- Jak asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You tell me. I don't want to enter someone else's room and find more dead ones...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Alright... I think we should...\"- Jak was cut off by the door opening all of sudden, Joana and Jasmine walked in<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"...Pray for our lives?\"- Blake completed Jak's unfinished phrase<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"We're tired of hide and seek. No escape this time guys\"- Jasmine said evilly<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You'll be our little slaves\"- Joana said, looking evilly (and strangely seductively) at Blake<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Like hell we will!!\"- Blake answered, and he and Jak ran for their lives, and got past under the girls and ran near the door, which was slammed shut. Blake and Jak gulped loudly<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What were you saying?\"- Joana said, again in her evil/seductive tone<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I won't be your slave anyway...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Uh, Blake...\"- Jak nudged Blake, but he ignored him<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Oh really?\"- Joana walked toward Blake<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Yes, really!!\"- Blake answered angrily, while looking at Joana's now red eyes<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Blake...\"- Jak nudged Blake again, and this time he replied<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What?!!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I think you just dug your own grave...\"- Jak said, and Joana crouched in front of them, she picked Blake up, and said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"More like you'll fall to your own grave...\"- She said threateningly<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You said I didn't taste good...\"- Blake said, and Joana sighed in her thought 'As subborn as ever... I can barely believe he didn't even cry'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Yeah, but I still eat even food I don't like, you'll be just one more thing I don't like...\"- She teased him by licking him, which she actually liked, and Blake, predicting his inner darkness' behavior, said in his mind<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Before you say anything, shut up... we're in big trouble...'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Nope, YOU are in big trouble...'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Stupid, if she eats me we'll both die...'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Not quite... I just learned that you may die, and if I'm fast enough, I'll take over without you in the way!!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I hate to be myself' Blake thought<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Jasmine picked up Jak as well, saying<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"No speech will save you from this one, little Romeo\"- Jasmine said, though inside she felt bad for hurting his feelings<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Don't you remember anything... about us?\"- Jak was really desperate, and saw that Blake seemingly would share his fate<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Nothing that can help you\"- Jasmine said even more evilly, though inside, she thought she might have overdone it, however, both her and Jak stopped when they heard Blake<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I can't believe this is my end... Blaze is so coward... to kill me by the girl I love's hand...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Aww... how cute... but not even in your dreams!! You think I'd choose to be with you, an unwanted orphan, when I can be with the guy who will rule the universe?!\"- Joana said, and Blake looked down, no longer angry, but deeply sad... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Maybe it was too much..' Joana thought 'I had never seen him this sad'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"...ouch...\"- Jak muttered -\"That definitively hurt...\"- Jasmine looked at Joana for a moment, then she said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Enough talk...\"- And the girls were about to let their boyfriends fall into their mouths...</span></div></div>",

Joana was saddened by Blake's attitude, no matter what she did, he always thought he was worthless<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I rarely stopped to think about what has changed from these 3 years... I hadn't realized completely how necessary you had  become for me...\"- 'And I was told this would happen...' Blake thought, and remembered another conversation with his grandma, she said to him that <i>\"You don't truly know what you have until you lose it\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake noticed that Joana stopped and her look had somehow softened, but her eyes were still red. Jak gave him a thumbs up and a look like saying 'Keep it up!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I always refused help, at least from most of people... And I once told you '<i>My life itself has no sense. If I can do something to help someone whose life does, then mine can be of some use</i>'... I always thought that my life was worth nothing, and eventually grew sick of life itself, I wanted to die, but not by a cowardly suicide... I had no reasons to live for... and then... I met you...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Blake...\"- Joana said, she was about to cry, but she fought it for a moment, and played it as if her evil self was keeping the upper hand<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"At first, to be honest, you were just a simple girl... a bit annoying one at that, but you became my friend... even when I told you that you wouldn't want to know about me...  I thought of the times I was with you as awkward, and everyone kept telling me that you loved me... I denied it, not because I didn't like you, but after so many years, I had come to the conclusion that I couldn't be loved by anyone or anything, except maybe my pets... I couldn't believe that someone had such feelings for someone like me... specially someone like you...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Huh?\"- Joana couldn't help but be a bit confused, Blake had never confessed why he refused to believe that she loved him, nor what she exactly meant for him<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"My bad experiences and seeing how Karina treated perverts made me to self impose never be one myself, though I never felt like being one... I was... afraid... I always thought you'd slap me or kick me if I said anything about your appearance... but being honest... no other girl I've seen in my entire life is prettier than you, not then, not now, not ever...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoana's hands trembled at this, and Blake thought it was his end<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Jak, I told you this wouldn't work... *sigh* I suck at these things...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You're doing well, continue!!\"- Jasmine said, trying to rush him because she knew Joana wouldn't be able to play it off for much longer...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What else can I say? Almost everything what has happened so far was my fault... like Blaze appearing... attacking us, hurting her...\"- Blake sighed, and said to Joana (and failed to notice her tears forming)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\" *Sigh* I can't lie... I'm the one who wouldn't be whole... without you, I'm just the same miserable rat you met 3 years ago...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoana couldn't take it anymore, and after looking briefly at Jasmine, who said in Joana's mind<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I'm guessing that that counts...'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoana hugged Blake very tightly, more than ever, and let her tears drop. After some minutes, Blake said, muffled by Joana's chest<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Am I right if I assume that by this Ultra Hug of Death, you're yourself again?\"- Her answer was to tighten more her hug, but it wasn't hurting Blake at all. Maybe because the other times she hugged him he was wounded... he didn't know, but what he knew, is that he felt really good, and recalled a long forgotten feeling... the feeling of being protected, that nothing could harm him in that moment, Blake couldn't tell when it was the last time he felt it, as all he remembers from his childhood are horrible deaths and the loss of his father and his friend... yet, the feeling seemed to be from a remote past that Blake couldn't remember clearly...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I love you so much...\"- Joana said, still hugging Blake<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Forgive me...\"- Blake said, almost like a whisper -\"For not realizing how much you really are for me... and for disdaining your worries about me... I had still refused to believe that I meant anything to you....\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoana didn't say anything else, but more tears dropped. Jasmine looked at them with the 'How cute' look, but only Jak and Joana knew that it took a lot for Blake to open his heart to that degree. After some seconds, the girls disappeared, as well as the whole spaceship, Blake and Jak found themselves in an empty space, which seemed to drag them out of that place, they had a warm feeling, and then...</span></div></div>",

If I can do something to help someone whose life does, then mine can be of some use</i>\", but Joana changed that. Overtime, I thought she was just another girl, but in deeper retrospect, without her my life is nothing. I've really come to accept that...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen there were footsteps heard once again, Jak and Blake also noticed that they were on the counter of the kitchen again. They didn't acknowledge the fact that they shared the same dream, but whatever it was, realizing that they couldn't possibly know what to do without Jasmine and Joana, and they both had a slight change of heart...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor Jak, he realized that whenever he has a chance to hangout with his girlfriend, he needs to, because he would never know when she will be gone. He also understands that she worries about him, and only wants to protect him, so he needs to start understanding why Jasmine is going to be protective at times. <i>'I'll always be your protector, and fill in for the both of us...'</i> Those words rang inside his head at times...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor Blake, it meant being a bit more affectionate towards his girlfriend, and not trying to push her away, but to get close and spend every moment with her and pretty try and make up for lost time. In other words, he should be more loving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJak then flew up to Jasmine, and kissed her lips, (tried to kiss the hugepuckers...)then Blake jumped toward Joana's belly intending to hug her, with no apparent reason....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJasmine and Joana looked at each other and then said....<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

After some minutes, he said, still worried<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Uhm... Joana... just to know... would you ever go out with Blaze?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJak, Jasmine, Joana and Blake himself might have sworn that they heard a record needle scratch coming from somewhere unknown...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"H...Huh?!!\"- Joana blinked twice in confusion, then she said -\"WHAT KIND OF QUESTION IS THAT?!!\"- She asked angrily (despite she was just pretending, she knew perfectly why Blake asked such question)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Nevermind...\"- Blake sighed relieved<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Though maybe if I think about it...\"- Joana said, Jak (who still heard it) and Blake went from happy to D: faces<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Just kidding\"- Joana said with a n_n face, Blake and Jak sighed again in relief -\"I would never leave you for anyone else... and Blaze is particularly disgusting by the way...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoana then brought Blake near her lips and gave him a long giant kiss, and heard a voice inside his mind<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Well done. Opening your heart will reward you in many ways' <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake opened his eyes wide... it wasn't Demon Blake's voice, nor his inner light's (which merged with Blake... still, he had Blake's same voice). That voice sounded young but maturer, like from someone above 25 years old... But, remembering what he promised to himself, he stopped thinking about it and enjoyed his girlfriend's kiss...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Jasmine stared at Jak, who watched how Blake would behave once they apparently came back from a horrible nightmare, Jasmine, still having Jak near her lips, kissed him as well. And with that, Jak thanked whatever it was what caused the nightmare, because he had lost sight of his girlfriend's promise of protecting him. It was true that he developed powers, but after seeing Blake and Blaze, he realized that he still needed a lot of training and skill, and that refusing to accept Jasmine's protection actually hurt her. Though he didn't tell Blake, seeing him, and knowing him showed Jak that he needed more to be able to face their enemies... and that he would face them along Jasmine, the kind and loving girl who swore to protect him...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake was the opposite case, thinking of himself as worthless, he had lost sight of life itself, as he no longer could acknowledge what was he living for. He refused to believe that anyone could ever show a warm feeling such as love for him. Blake bears the weight of many things upon his soul... his father's death, the fact that he was unwanted by his mother's family, and his mother herself, the death of his first and best friend, the weight upon his conscience for killing for vengeance, the time he recognized that there was darkness inside him... the time Ivan hurt Joana and Blake was unable to protect her... and the conflict inside him, after he started to accept that maybe Joana really loved him... then she asked him out... despite fighting many bullies, Blake had been relatively happy, until that fateful day, when a gang almost killed Ayrton, and challenged Blake to go to the park, alone... then, Blaze's appearance... their fight... then the anger, and the fear... fear of himself, of what he was becoming... after he learned that he could damage Blaze by turning into \"the beast\"...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake had even thought of suicide back when he got shrunk by Blaze, he had always disdained it, and called it something that only a coward would do, but when he grew desperate about Blaze's inhuman strength, he thought that it was the best way to solve it, screwing Blaze up for eternity... But Joana stopped him, she told him that his life was worth much more than he could see. That she cared about him, loved him, and wouldn't be able to live if she lost him, such words... such words managed to get into Blake's heart, which had been almost dead for years... the last time someone said that cared about him, it was his grandma...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, after three years being with Joana, Blake still bears the weight of many things upon his mind, but regained a reason to live for, her. He swore to kill Blaze once and for all, so he could finally live in peace with Joana, who didn't know of this secret promise, but somehow perceived it. And she wanted to help him, Lith helped even more by unlocking a part of the powers that resided inside Joana, unknown to her until that very moment, she also learned of Ren'Ai and Azrael, who were just like them, many millenniums ago...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was somewhat happy that she would be the same species as Blake after all, she was saddened when she had learned that Blake descended from a powerful angel called Azrael, not because of that, but because it meant Blake was not really human, thus, nobody besides Lith would truly understand him. When she learned that she also descended from an angel, she was so happy, she wanted to tell Blake that she was like him, after all... but when he finally learned it, Blake was the saddened one, and blamed their ancestors for their relationship, feeling that if that was true, he did nothing by himself. And that feeling was what had been torturing Blake for a while, it made him to reject affection, love and kindness from his girlfriend, to push her away...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake didn't understand himself completely, and hadn't realized that he held a very old belief, that he should never be happy, that belief was triggered when all of this happened. Blake was feeling like it was wrong for him to feel nice, or to be happy. However, Joana has finally broken that belief, and now Blake feels warm inside and outside...</span></div></div>",

He needed to get stronger, and it was vital and necessary, giving the way that he fought against Nostory, he saw it as a bad fight, with him being on the defensive side for most of the fight. The only reason he was able to get away is that slight power boost.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis forced form was too relied on. He would often have to resort to measures to handle the toughest enemies. He was able to stay in his Omega Form naturally, without having to worry about that strain anymore. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCase and point: Jak needed to get stronger, and fighting two girls at a gigantic size is perfect, considering the fact that this would be valuable experience, and this was the perfect opportunity to get in some training. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright, Jak.\u201d Joana said. \u201cWe\u2019ll be in Jasmine\u2019s room.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGotcha.\u201d Jak said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoana, Jasmine, and Blake went into Jasmine\u2019s room.  Jak\u2019s goals were to be able to realize when there were openings, weaknesses, and when to go all out. He also wanted to enhance his base form as well, and see if that could handle some damage before he would have to transform.  However, his thoughts were interrupted by Jasmine, screaming \u201cREADY!!!!!\u201d Jasmine was eager, eager to battle and play with her boyfriend\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It's not what you think... Blake, why don't you tell them?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Huh?!!\"- Blake was caught confused, Jak and Jasmine looked at him expecting an answer -\"Alright let me think...\"- Blake got into a thoughtful position and kept counting mentally, and recalling what happened at that time... then he said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I don't know... at 8th grade the only things I remember was that you gifted me the silver chain I've worn ever since, a crazy girl that stalked me...\"- Now Jak and Jasmine looked at Joana with a raised eyebrow<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Not me...\"- She said, then added -\"Blake, you counted wrong. When we were in 8th grade YOU were 13, but I was 14...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"So?... Wait a minute... if you meant to act like when you were 13... that means... 7th grade...\"- Blake said, confused at his result<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Exactly\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Huh?!!\"- Blake, Jak and Jasmine were a bit confused again<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I recall that I behaved differently as time passed... at 9th grade I wanted to tell Blake about my feelings, despite I didn't know how...\"- Blake and Joana blushed, Jasmine giggled, then Joana said -\"At 8th grade I was very shy after learning that Blake wasn't the average boy and that it was very difficult to be friends with him...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I don't see what's so difficult...\"- Jak answered, and Jasmine petted his head, saying<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"That's because you're a guy. I can see Joana's point, so, why do you want to impersonate your 7th grade version?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Because that's the time I fell in love with Blake\"- Joana said, blushing about saying such a thing, Blake gulped loudly, Joana then said -\"I've been wondering what would have been things like if I found Blake shrunk BEFORE he was my boyfriend... and I think that 13 years old me would be overly happy...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I hate my karma...\"- Blake said, facepalming himself with both hands<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Aww, come on!! You'll like it...\"- Joana said playfully, and gave him a puppy look<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You're going to do it anyway...\"- Was Blake's way of saying yes... Jasmine then said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Alright, let's begin with this\"- Jak nodded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Just let me more affectionate. That's what I meant with this acting...\"- Joana whispered to Blake<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"WHAT?!! Even MORE affectionate?!!\"- Blake said, almost exasperated, and noticed Joana's saddened look, and remembered his lesson<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Uhm... yeah, it's okay...\"- Blake said, and Joana hugged him very, very tightly, Blake thought 'Calm down... remember Blake, you prefer a nice, over-protective and hyper-loving girlfriend than a brainwashed evil monster that wanted to eat you...' to stop himself from pushing her affection away, though he didn't really know that Joana was holding it back...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she dropped Blake in her cleavage, and prepared for training. Jak decided to attack Jasmine first, by punching her ankle... but it did nothing, and Jasmine (or \"Demi\") said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Hey, look! it's another cute wittle boy...\"- Jak then noticed that her guard was low, although it was probably on purpose, anyway, he decided to try, and shot a small energy ball that exploded in her face, distracting her, then, she pretended to get angry and tried to grab him, Jak used his flight ability quickly to dodge her hand, and then thought 'I need to stop doing that....'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, he dodged Joana's hand without using energy, and jumped backward (he was trying to adapt Blake's moves, also, he recalled that Blake said that it was better use as least energy as possible during a fight, though he didn't apply it when he fought Zenn). He got a bit away so he could analyze better, but given his size, it was a lot more difficult to find openings in the girls' defenses...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, he decided that if it were real, he wouldn't let Blake to be taken away (Jak had heard something about that those were Blaze's intentions, despite he didn't understand why), specially in this week, when he was particularly vulnerable (Jak knew, almost as well as Joana, that despite Blake's attitude of \"I can defend myself\" his tendency to go on his own makes him an easier prey for their enemies, no mater how stronger Blake gets. It had already been proved when Nostory and Seth fought him)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so, Jak prepared for the training of his life (maybe?)...</span></div></div>",

Jak started to look around for Jasmine, but realized he had very little time as he nearly got crushed by Joana\u2019s foot. Blake, who was inside of Joana\u2019s cleavage, was a bit dizzy, due to all the motioning that Joana was doing. Jak was trying to focus on where Jasmine was, but Joana kept hindering him from doing that. And Jasmine finally strikes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSurprise, Surprise!!!\u201d Jasmine then punched Jak, and he really flew upward, toward the ceiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Crap,\u2019 Jak thought in his head, as he was flying backward. \u2018I wonder how I can handle this\u2026wait. If I could get Blake to take Joana out of this equation, I might be able to handle Jasmine one on one by myself.\u2019 Jak was able to quickly recover before he hit the ceiling wall. He had a plan to get Blake to help him, but he needed to get him out of Joana\u2019s cleavage.  Jak powered up briefly, but not to Omega Form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s he planning\u2026?\u201d Jasmine said. \u201cI\u2019m guessing that he\u2019s finally going to go all out.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat, or\u2026\u201d Joana was thinking in thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Jasmine said. \u201cDo you think he has an ace up his sleeve?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t think he would do all that.\u201d Joana said. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen him do some strong moves, but I doubt it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen why are you-\u201cJasmine was then interrupted by a quick wind sound. \u201cDid you hear that?\u201d She then quickly looked up, and her boyfriend wasn\u2019t near the ceiling anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJak was moving quickly, and he was able to focus his energy into flying faster, and he was aiming toward Joana. Blake eyes widened, as he was slightly surprised by Jak speed suddenly increasing, and then his \u201cRoller-Coaster ride\u201d was going to continue.  Jak then focused his energy into one punch, and he hit Joana\u2019s leg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoana was surprised by the hit, and she started to fall down. Jak realized that this was his chance to get Blake, and he quickly transformed, and flew toward Blake, as Joana was still falling down. Blake then saw Jak reach out toward him, and Blake grabbed Jak\u2019s left hand, and Jak used his right hand to fire a beam to bounce off Joana, and quickly accelerated himself and Blake away from the girls. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNice job,\u201d Blake said. \u201cFocusing your energy was a smart move.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah.\u201d Jak said, powering down and still carrying Blake. \u201cListen, I might not have enough time to say this, but I have a plan for you to hinder Joana. Could you possibly tickle her?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure.\u201d Blake said. \u201cI\u2019m guessing you want Jasmine all for yourself.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJak nodded, and he then said. \u201cI\u2019m lucky to even be able to dodge most of their attacks, and when I do get a chance to attack, I only deal a little damage at a time\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright, I\u2019ll let myself get caught,\u201d Blake said. \u201cLet\u2019s do this.\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Joana nor Jasmine didn't notice this. Jak muttered<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Now it's my turn...\"- <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn between Joana's boobs, Blake decided to wait about 10 minutes because if he started immediately, they'd realize about their plan. Jak had to keep dodging in the mean time, which was pretty difficult because Joana regained confidence, and Jasmine was really into this \"game\" (In difference of Joana, I think Jasmine is more than used to be a giantess). Jak started to grow desperate at seeing that Blake hadn't started the plan yet, and barely dodged a stomp from Joana's right foot, then he heard her giggle, she muttered<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Blaake... whaat aaree yoouu dooing?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJasmine, who thought Joana was acting weird, asked her<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What's going on?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"He's m-moving... in there...\"- Joana felt some sort of pleasure besides the ticklish feeling between her 'assets' -\"Blake!! Stop moving!!...\"- <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she started to laugh harder and more uncontrollably, and knelt down. Jasmine had still a raised eyebrow and was confused about Joana laughing and her talking to Blake, then she felt something hit her, it was an energy beam, fired by Jak, who stood on her head doing a victory pose, but dashed away quickly (mimicking Blake's dash ability, which actually uses because he lacks flying abilities), and Jasmine recovered quickly, but Jak climbed to her leg (a bit difficult, since it was very smooth)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJasmine tried to grab him but he timely jumped to her hand, Jasmine then tried to grab him with the other one, and jumped on top of it as well. Then, he quickly jumped to her hand and charged up a beam, meanwhile, Joana was nearly ROFL-ing. Blake had moved to near her armpit so he tickled her a lot, it was a bit weird to her that Blake did this, he would usually be very shy at touching her. Blake admitted that this whole situation was a bit awkward, but reminded himself that he had no special powers and was shrunk, so, this could be a good advantage, and using his natural speed, Joana couldn't grab him, and quickly switched to the other armpit, and he also tickled her sides, and her belly too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Maybe I'm overdoing it, but Joana likes this anyway...'

And Blake didn't stop; he kept moving around to not allow himself to get caught. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJasmine still didn't get up, and Jak was starting to get a bit concerned. He flew down near her face, and she was lying on her back. Jasmine's eyes were closed, and Jak flew near her arm, and leaned near her wrist. She still had a pulse. He then flew to her chest.

Jasmine tried to tickle him with her other foot's toes, but he thought of the same, and started tickling her foot. Jasmine was laughing a lot while Jak started another victorious rant, and Blake, while still inside his girlfriend's cleavage, his head was poking out and was watching the scene...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I guess this stopped being a training...' Blake's thoughts were interrupted by a slight squashing feeling, and noticed that Joana was squeezing her breasts together. She had a very loving look in her eyes, Blake could sense and something like a spark. She said, more seductively than before<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Maybe we should 'train' like that...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'JUST MY ROTTEN LUCK!!! Jak, I blame you for this and your idea of tickling Joana!!! I must've flipped a WRONG switch!!' Blake thought with nearly a T_T face. He regained a bit of composure and muttered<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Well, I promised I'd be more loving with Joana, but this is RIDICULOUS!! I was prepared for her 'normal mode' nor her 'hyper seductive mode'!!\"- He then slapped her forehead, and remembered...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Some time earlier, when he complained about Jak giving him away to Joana, he replied that he wanted to see how much would Blake resist if his grilfriend was set into 'seductive mode' and Blake replied 'Believe me... there's no such thing as Joana's 'seductive mode' '</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I hate karma...\"- Blake muttered, and double facepalmed himself, while Joana giggled in her own small world of happiness<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJak then climbed Jasmine up, and tickled her in his way. He stopped for a while and tickled her thigh, which he enjoyed touching by the way. He quickly climbed up by jumping, and ended between Jasmine's boobs again (though this time, from outside her clothes). He realized that he just fell in a trap like a fly, and Jasmine gave him a mischievous grin, and squeezed her boobs together, trapping him. The warm feeling plus the silky feeling of the clothes made it to feel like heaven for Jak. A tiny droplet of blood dropped from his nostrils, and he covered his nose with a hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJasmine then grabbed him, and kissed him once again, and licked him more. He was completely stunned by this, and when she placed him between her boobs again, he said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Alright!!! I give up!!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Good...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"At least I lasted more than your 30 seconds...\"- Jak crossed his arms, in a hero-like pose<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Actually, you lasted 29 seconds...\"- Jasmine said, showing him a watch<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Wha?!!\"- Blake and Jak exclaimed, if they weren't in their girlfriends' cleavages, they'd have fallen face-first to the floor in disbelief...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I have the slight feeling that this stopped being a training season...\"- Blake said, sarcastically</span></div></div>",

Despite he was a bit embarrassed because his girlfriend saw him changing clothes, he didn't care as much and made it quick. They went to Joana's room but didn't knock, and just opened the door. Joana and Blake were startled by it, and Jasmine and Jak noticed Blake hadn't put his shirt on, then they noticed many scars and marks in Blake's chest, and when he turned around to get his shirt, they also saw scars in his back. Jasmine and Jak gasped, so far, they had only seen Blake's scar in the eye and some small scars in his arms...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"That was rather uncomfortable... let's pretend it never happened...\"- Blake said after putting a white shirt and a black jacket on (Lith gave Joana's several spare clothing for shrunken Blake, and this one looked just like his spare body's outfit, although he's in his original body right now)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"B...Blake...\"- Jak was a bit shocked, but Jasmine was more, and she said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"That guy... Blaze... did he do all that to you?!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"He might, but nope... after our first fight, Karina enhanced my body with some of her experiments to make me more durable... thus, I haven't gotten a scar afterwards... this is from before... These were my own fault... each one is a mark of each thing I've done wrong...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Uh...\"- Jasmine didn't quite know what to say, she felt Blake wasn't happy about them, Jak nudged her, reminding her that she should ask him herself -\"...But...how did you get so much wounds?! Where were your parents*?!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"It's a bit complicated to explain...\"- Blake didn't trust Jasmine as much as Jak, and didn't want to tell what he told Joana some days before, however, before he said anything else, Lith appeared. This time the guys weren't that surprised, and even Blake said nothing about it<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I can help\"- She said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I guess you're going to tell them... I guess you've seen it yourself...\"- Blake said, and Lith denied with her head<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Sometimes, words aren't enough. I'll show you all what happened...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"HUH?!\"- Blake got it faster than the rest, she was going to show them how things happened, and they'd seen themselves. Blake added -\"But... it isn't right!! They don't really want to know!!\"- Blake wouldn't have minded as much as if just Joana saw it, and Lith, reading his thoughts, said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Try to open your heart a little... do you still think you can't trust them?\"- Jasmine and Jak stared shocked at Blake (Jasmine had been previously afraid of Blake's dark form, but after speaking with Joana and seeing how he was outside battle, she got a better image of him). Blake froze, and felt like petrifying and cracking, he muttered<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"<font class=\"size2\" style=\"\">You mustn't say such things!!</font>\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"It's alright... they know that things haven't been nice for you... And both of them are your friends...\"- Lith answered<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I...uh....\"- Blake only considered Jak as a friend of his, Jasmine was more of a friend of Joana's, and the sudden interest in him made it wall weirder. -\"We won't gain anything from seeing my past again...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"It will help. You'll find out later...\"- Lith said, and after aiming her hand to somewhere in the middle of the room, a rectangle made (more like rectangle-like, it flowed like some sort of flame) of golden light appeared. It showed first Blake some days after birth (NOT naked), as soon as Blake noticed that, he started waving his hands, trying to fan away the olden screen thing<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"THAT'S TOO EARLY!!!\"- He shouted<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJak laughed a bit, and both Joana and Jasmine thought baby Blake was cute (I know most of babies are born bald, but that was not my case... strange as it may sound, Blake was born with black and wavy shoulder-length hair already...). Lith also laughed, but quickly changed to a more serious expression, and the image focused on people who they didn't know. All of them were caucasian, there was a middle aged man with black hair, two younger men with brown and black hair, a blond one, as well as a blonde woman, and another black haired woman...all of them looked disdainfully at him from another room. They also noticed that Blake's father was sitting next to his crib...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Who are they?\"- Nor Joana nor Jasmine or Jak knew. However, Blake clenched his fists when he saw them. Lith said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Those people... are Blake's family... from his mother's side...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"But... why do they look so mad about Blake?\"- Joana asked. Lith said 'Shhh' and they heard their voices**...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>-\"What are you waiting for?!! That child must not live!!\"- Said a young man (In his early 20's) with brown hair<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"We can't do much if his father is here...\"- The middle aged man answered<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"How long will you allow him to live, Father? Until he grows enough to kill us instead?!\"- The blond man said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Patience, my sons... One day, he will be alone, and then, he'll die...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"He's nothing more than a dishonor to our family, just think about it, an impure among us!!\"- A blonde woman who looked to be in her late 20's said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"But our father is right... If we try to kill him now, the child's father will oppose resistance...\"- A thin woman, in her early 30's said, she had short black hair<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"We can take him on!! We're 7, he's just one!!\"- The brown haired man answered<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"We can leave no evidence...\"- The middle aged man said -\"I know, that the child is not one of us, and that he will become a threat in the future... but he need to wait for the right moment...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I've had it, father!! It's been 8 days and he's still alive!!\"- The brown haired man said, and grabbed a knife. He walked into the room where Blake was and attempted to kill him, just to be stopped by James, who shouted angrily<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What the hell do you think you're doing?!!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"This is the end, James, you and your son won't live to see the end of this day!!\"- They started to fight, exchanging punches and kicks, and James kicked him out of the room, trying to minimize the violence Blake had to watch. Soon, the brown haired man got up and tried to stab James, but he stopped his hand, and the other men and women intervened, stopping their brother, and the middle aged man muttered<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Are you stupid or what?! Now he knows!!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I DON'T care... I know what's going to happen, you'll let that child live, and one day he will return, and we will no longer be able to stop him... It'll be our doom...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Shut up!!\"- The blonde woman said to him<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I can see it happening... You will regret not killing him when you had the chance!!\"- They dragged the brown haired man out, and all of them left... James was a bit nervous as well, and held Blake in his arms...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Blake...\"- Joana said, and noticed Blake had closed his eyes, and clenched his fists<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"That's just wrong... 2 days old?\"- Jak was really surprised at this, and felt that the understanding he had about Blake wasn't anywhere the real problem's depth... it was less than the tip f the iceberg<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"That's not all\"- Lith said, and showed more things, such as that before that day, Blake was left alone (until night, when James came from work), and nobody went to feed him nor calm his cries. By the second day, Blake stopped crying...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"But... if he wasn't fed... how is he alive? I know babies need a lot of care, specially in their first days... Lith sighed sadly, and said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"As the people you saw, Blake's mother hated him as well... that's something Blake knows for a long time, and hadn't told to any of you...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"It's not like I needed a mother at all... I'm alive, so, I did well...\"- Blake said, and tried to stop Lith from showing ore of his past -\"Can you stop showing what happened when I was a baby?!\"- He then whispered to Lith -\"<font class=\"size2\" style=\"\">It's too personal and embarrassing!!</font>\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"It is necessary... I know that you would never tell this yourself...\"- Lith said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"But who gave you the right to do so?! I know you're a goddess but not even you have right to show things like these to others!!\"- Blake didn't noticed, but it hurt Joana, Jak and Jasmine a bit (The fact that Blake apparently classified as the same as anyone... in the sense that Blake didn't want them to learn about him...)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Lith's answer was a much more serious one -\"I'll show you why I have the right... Not because I'm a goddess...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size25\" style=\"\"><b>*Although Jasmine knew Blake's father was dead, she knew nothing about the rest of his family, thus, assumed his mother was dead or something...<br>\r\n** Blake's mother's family used to speak in Spanish whenever it was a serious discussion between themselves.

That has to be fake!!\"- Blake said -\"How come nobody noticed the green haired woman in my room?!!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"They couldn't see me. I can make it so I can only be seen by whom I want to\"- Lith replied. Blake, as well as Joana, Jak and Jasmine were confused about her presence in Blake's room. Blake crossed his arms and said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Well, you appeared when I was a baby, so what?! That doesn't give you right to anything...\" Blake said, and remained silent to see what would Lith do at such an early time...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake was, as said, laying in his crib, and was very pale and looked weakened. He hadn't been fed since he was born (And by this time, James thought his wife would normalize and take care of Blake as a mother would... or should do...). Lith took him in her arms, and Blake, strangely in a non-naive lapsus, realized what was next, and said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"ALRIGHT!!! THAT'S ENOUGH!!\"- Lith stopped showing what was next, and Blake sighed -\"But that's quite absurd... I mean... you...did... me... you...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Why Blake is so mad?\"- Joana asked, and Lith whispered to them, despite Blake was desperately trying to cover her mouth, she held him away easily. Then they opened their eyes wide for a moment, and Blake facepalmed himself<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"This has to be the most embarrassing moment of my life ever... I hate myself...\"- He sighed and added -\"Before you ask anything, I did NOT know... if I were aware at that time I wouldn't have freakin' let her to!!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I don't see what's wrong, Blake... she fed you because your mother wouldn't...\"- Joana said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"But she's NOT my mother... I have no mother... And that makes everything weirder... a human baby fed by a supernatural being... Mind blow anyone?\"- Blake answered<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Someone had to do it...\"- Lith said, and Blake replied<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"There's a little something called \"adoption\"...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Blake, I have unknown powers, and Jasmine is the reincarnation of a goddess... it doesn't really disturb us...\"- Jak said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I think it was cute. It means you do have a mom!! How many people can say a goddess is their mom?\"- Jasmine said, trying to cheer Blake up<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Pretty much all religions*...\"- Blake answered -\"Maybe she fed me when I was a baby, but I still have no mother...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"That's why I took care of you... However, many things forced me to hold back from fully helping you... But I always watched over you...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Whatever...\"- Blake said, who felt rather humiliated, and Lith resumed showing Blake's past...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Now, the screen-like thing showed a now 4 years old Blake, who was all the time with James, his father, because he knew the true intentions of his wife and her family. He wasn't a normal child, but was far from the lonely and traumatized guy he'd be. At least when he was with his father, Blake was, if not happy, very close to it. However, his mother's family kept speaking, and Lith showed them one day, that Blake was with his father at his work...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"See? It's been nearly 5 years!! And what have you done, nothing!!\"- The brown haired man said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I agree with him this time, Father... if you give him more time, he'll be able to at least escape, and he will come back...\"- The blond man said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I had Lilith** watching the whole time, but James doesn't leave his child alone for a single second. Even when he sleeps, he wakes up easily at the minimal sound... I didn't want to make a mess, but you're right. We're taking both of them on!!\"- The middle aged man said, and hit the floor with his cane</i> (seemingly made of black wood, its tip was made of gold and also had several ornaments of gold. It had the family's shield and other symbols related to their lineage. It was said this cane was held by the family's heads for generations...)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>-\"We'll take care of this, the rest is dismissed...\"- The middle aged man added, and only him, Lilith and her brown haired brother stayed. In matter of minutes, James arrived, Blake walking behind him, and he was received by a nearly fatal slash, that he barely dodged. James then saw his wife, and her father were surrounding him and Blake, who didn't know what to do. James, on the other side, did a risky move, stopped watching over Blake to draw their attention on himself, and started fighting the three at the same time. Blake hid under the table </i>(You can't expect more from a 4 years old child...)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>James moved quickly, as Lilith was armed with two knives, while her father and her brother relied on physical fight. Surprisingly, the middle aged man </i>(which would be Blake's grandfather by maternal side) <i>was exceptionally strong, and soon James took some damage. His mind wasn't fully on the fight as he was still checking on Blake. He knew that if he failed they'd kill him. Then decided to not care anymore, and landed a punch to Lilith's stomach, and disarmed her. He then blocked an incoming punch from her bother and spun around to dodge another incoming punch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe realized he would lose the fight if he kept going, and decided to leave for his own and Blake's safety, so, he took Blake in his arms and escaped through the window. Lilith's brother went to chase him, but, James, who lived in streets a great portion of his life, was able to move a lot faster and with more agility through them than him. The middle aged man stopped him by pulling his arm, and said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"If they get away and don't return, they are as good as dead... We only care for our family...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"They WILL return. I won't trust time anymore. Now, you let them go, and we failed at killing them...\"- The brown haired man said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I agree with my brother. We can't rest until we see that kid's dead body...\"- Lilith added<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Enough!!\"- The middle aged man hit the floor with his cane twice, and his tone was more serious -\"It's over, you return to your houses, and we won't talk about this subject unless it's necessary...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome time later, after the middle aged man left and Lilith went to do her daily business, the brown haired man walked into a bar, and spoke with a few people, then they pointed at a threateningly looking man, who looked to be in his early 30's. A muscular latino looking one...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake clenched his fists tightly when he saw that man, although Joana, Jasmine and Jak couldn't understand why...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size2\" style=\"\"><b>*No offense intended... just take the joke... family guy and other tv shows say worse things about that topic...

Then, the brown haired man left, and so did the other man... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack to James and Blake, they were walking in the streets, James was trying to find a proper place to sleep</i>(because of Blake)<i>But, instead, 5 attackers appeared, James immediately turned in guard position and said <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Blake...run as far as you can...now!!\"- Blake refused to do it, he didn't want to disobey his father but he wouldn't leave him like that. He hid behind a trash box and watched from there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fight started, he dodged fists and connected punches and kicks, it was a fierce battle, they tried to use their numeric advantage against him but he proved to be stronger than them and got rid of 3 of them </i>(he left two unconscious and broke one's neck with a kick, killing him). <i>The remaining two were on guard, and ran toward him, but despite James was prepared, he got distracted by something, seemingly, something in his mind...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, one of the thugs' knee hit him in the stomach, snapping him back into reality, and the other attacker locked his arms from behind, leaving him vulnerable so the other man could punch him freely. James regained reason and hit the one who was holding him from behind with his elbow, thus, getting released, and then he punched him twice in the stomach and once in his jaw, leaving him knocked out, then he fought the other one and defeated him after many punches and kicks. Then he crossed his arms and said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You just are a waste of my time, I don't want to see you again or you'll regret to be born\"- Then he turned around and went to get Blake, but a voice stopped him<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Hehehe... yeah... those guys aren't worth your time...are they, James?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked around and found an unknown man...with short spiked up black hair and black eyes, which looked threatening. James asked, while remained in a fighting stance<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Who are you? And what the hell do you want?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe just laughed and said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You should know it... bro...\"- James' look changed, as he realized who was that man...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Why did you come?\"- asked James, still on guard<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I came here to kill someone, and I found you... and... what do we have in here?\"- He said looking toward the little Blake<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Don't you dare or you'll regret\"- James threatened, the unknown man said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Here is the deal James...if you want to save your life I'll take this child's\"- <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I won't let you!\"- James punched him on the face...he answered with some punches which James blocked and dodged, this time, they were fighting evenly, although James had taken heavy damage and was getting tired because of the previous fights, and after some minutes, the man said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You can't surpass me, Brandon!! I'll avenge my father and you will die!!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"We'll see about that...\" James answered and their fists clashed, so the kicks, which moved around very fast and hit each other many times. James connected a combo of 4 punches and 3 kicks but lost concentration for a split second, and Brandon took that chance, punching him several times in the stomach and face, then kicked him, then he hit James with his knee and threw him onto the ground. It started to rain, and Brandon said <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"It's over James, you can't stand up a chance against me, now I'll do what I came for...\"- And deployed a gun which was pointed at Blake<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Blake, run!!\"- James shouted as he moved quickly and received the shot himself, falling down again...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Heh! What an idiot! You wanted to die before your son? Okay...he'll die anyway\"- James was bleeding, and even coughed up blood, but stood up, saying<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"No...I won't let this happen, my son has a whole life ahead, and I will make sure he lives it... I will not let you destroy his fate!! You have no right to end his life this early!!\"- He ran furiously and took off the gun from him with a swift move, and said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I'll never let you hurt my son... I'm taking you with me to hell!!\"- He said as he fired the gun at Brandon's heart at point-blank, but he stabbed James in the chest in the same moment. They fell down to the ground, Brandon was dead, and Blake ran towards his dying father. He put his hand on Blake's head and said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I-I'm...s...s..sorry Blake...I'm sorry for...leaving you alone in this world...I know...that your mother hates you, we both know it... but... Blake... promise me...that you'll never give up... never... also...\"- he coughed up some more blood, and then continued -\"...Don't ever dare to get vengeance...what happened today was...because my best friend and me took revenge from the one who killed my father...\"- James took a breath and continued<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I'd have really liked to see you growing up...but I'm afraid won't be able to... after all...\"- He coughed more blood, but added -\"I'm dying...Blake...live a real life, not like mine... I failed at everything... everything but you... you're the only reason my life was still worth it... I never found love myself...but you...u-ugh...you will... someday...\"- James stopped speaking as his hand slowly fell from Blake's head, pale, cold... and dead...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake said nothing, but laid next to his father's body, he closed his eyes, expecting to die as well, next to his father, and under the rain... a death fit for orphans, for people the world didn't care about...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe images stopped, Jak and Jasmine were shocked, specially Jasmine, but Jak was shocked as well, despite having an idea of what happened. Joana was even more shocked, and Lith said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"No words can describe what Blake felt... but this was as close as you can possibly get to get an idea...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake remained silent. He was more surprised at his friends' reaction. He had always believed nobody else would care for such a thing, but it seemed that it affected them almost as much as it affected him... though while Blake considers his father's death as the most painful thing, maybe the others associated his family's hatred as the worst thing. Blake couldn't tell... he had lived without a mother, and honestly, didn't miss having one, although Lith left very clear that she took the most essential motherly responsibilities with him...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoana, who was sitting on the bed near Blake (Jak was on Jasmine's lap), picked up Blake and hugged him very tightly, then, she sat him on her right breast, but Lith whispered something to her, and Joana put him on her left one instead... Blake asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What was that for? What did Lith say?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I want you to be more comfy... and, Nothing really important...\"- Joana giggled, and this time, Blake had no idea of what may have Lith told her...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"All of this was a bit too much, you better take a break so you can... assimilate it....\"- Lith said, and snapping her fingers, appeared a chair, which she sat on...</span></div></div>",

(Btw, here, italics will represent telepathic talk)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Dammit!! How could these guys find my pocket dimension?!!\"- Blaze said, while rebuilding the place using his powers<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You underestimated them, you white haired son of a...!!\"- Naraku said while also repairing the place using his insect like parts as tools<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Enough...\"- Aizen interrupted him, while he sat comfortably not doing anything<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Alright...\"- Naraku replied grudgingly<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>-\"Uhm, Blaze, why don't you say anything about Aizen?\"-</i> Seth asked with his mind, who was also working on repairing the place<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>-\"Because he can be a powerful enemy. We better have him on our side...\"-</i> Blaze answered telepathically<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>-\"Geesh... he almost believes to be the leader\"-</i> Seth said in his thought<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>-\"WE are the leaders. Our top priority is to restore Omega and he will unlock my powers, enhance yours,and release the Demon Army!!\"-</i> Blaze said, again, in his mind<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>-\"Alright...\"-</i> Seth said, although he didn't like Aizen's attitude, he knew Blaze and they could take him on if necessary, but Blaze preferred to have him on their side<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater, after they repaired the place, Blaze created some more rooms for them to rest while waiting for something to happen. Blaze tried to watch Blake and his friends, but it seemed to have heavy interference, and no matter what he did he wouldn't be able to see or hear anything, then he realized, and grunted<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Dammit, Lith...\"- He knew that only someone as powerful as her would be the cause of such interference. And she knew he'd watch, so, she would probably have interfered on purpose. He laid on the bed, not having much to do, waiting for the interference to disappear... He even allowed himself to fall asleep for a while (I won't say what he's dreaming, believe me, it's too creepy...). Until, he quickly opened his eyes wide and fell off the bed, as he felt a tremendous presence... no... two tremendous presences...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe rushed outside his room and readied two dark purple energy balls in his hands just in case, Nostory, Seth and Naraku also were outside. And two guys that looked somewhat like Ryan Kasshi and Ryan Shinonome appeared. Nostory and Seth readied dark energy in their hands, and Naraku turned his hands into pincers. Blaze spoke<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Who the hell are you?!!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Blaze, are you serious?!! Don't you see that it's the guys who attacked us some time ago?!!\"- Naraku said, and Nostory answered<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"He's right, Naraku... they aren't the same guys from before...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"They aren't. And what's more, they look like them and their presence is tremendous...\"- Seth added<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"We're your enemies' enemies...\"- The 2 unknown guys said at once<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You look too suspicious\"- Seth said, and Blaze said to him<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"They do, but they aren't the same. Their presence is different. These are definitively other guys...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"My name is Konabagu\"- Said one of the guys<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"And I'm Soekiyogama\"- The other said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Well, what has brought you here?\"- Nostory asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"We're after the same guys. If we work together, we will defeat them!!\"- Soekiyogama said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"If that's true, then you're welcome. I'll make two rooms for you. There's not much we can do right now, someone has been interfering with out ability to watch what they're doing...\"- Blaze said, while created two rooms with his dark power<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Are you going to let them in that easily?\"- Seth asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Yeah. Not everyday some villain comes willing to join forces... It's an example for <i>some</i> people...\"- Blaze replied, and looked at Naraku while saying that, who just grunted and crossed his arms (which went back to normal by the way)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"However...\"- Blaze reappeared behind the evil twins, and whispered -\"I am the one planning the moves. Do anything stupid and/or suspicious and you'll regret the day you met us...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Blaze walked toward his room, and closed the door. Naraku, Nostory and Seth went back to their rooms as well. The evil twins stood for a moment, and smiled evilly, then, they went to their rooms as well...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAizen, who apparently hadn't even bothered to get up, was indeed, hiding behind an invisible field, like this <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://images1.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20100416165534/bleach/en/images/8/86/Stealth_Kido.png\" target=\"_blank\">http://images1.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20...</a> and had watched the whole thing. He also noticed that Blaze kept his position as the \"leader\", and he laughed silently. He was technically more powerful than him, but his healing factor was a decisive advantage which would still give Blaze victory. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, Aizen decided to play along, in the end, he still could impose his will because of his superior power. However, that wouldn't last much longer with these twins. Aizen could feel clearly that they were even more powerful than himself, twice at the very least...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter entering their rooms, Seth said to Nostory telepathically<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>-\"Hey, now that I think about it, is Blaze his real name?\"-</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>-\"Why?\"-</i> Nostory asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>-\"It sounds weird...\"-</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>-\"We ARE weird... at least by everyone else's standards...\"-</i> Nostory replied<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>-\"Not weird weird. Weeeirrd...\"- </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>-\"Uh...\"-</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>-\"And the hair...What's with the hair?!!\"-</i> Seth asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>-\"I don't know...\"-</i> Nostory was rather fed up with such a trivial talk<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>-\"His obsession with that human is quite creepy if you think about it...\"-</i> Seth said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>-\"Meh. It's absolutely normal. It's a perfectly normal nemesis relationship...\"-</i> Nostory replied<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>-\"Whatever... at least ours is a girl...\"-</i> Seth said, and Nostory cut the telepathic talk...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size25\" style=\"\"><b>*In a previous chapter, they were surprise attacked by the Ryans and Powerman, and let some bombs explode there...</b></font></span></div></div>",

But, was that very early flashback really necessary? I could live perfectly without knowing that you...\"- Blake hesitated about continuing, but hoped that Lith got what he was saying<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Breastfed you?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"DON'T SAY IT!!\"- Blake said in a frantic manner, and stood up, while his face turned red -\"It sounds so wrong in many levels...\"- He added, after calming down a bit<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Why? There's nothing wrong with that...\"- Joana said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Don't help her...\"- Blake said to his girlfriend<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Someone had to do it... I couldn't stand watching you crying and be ignored...\"- Lith said, in a sweeter tone<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I didn't need to know...\"- Blake said, and sat down again (on Joana's breast... ironically... I know...)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You insisted on that you didn't need a mother, and that you had none...\"- Lith said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Why me? If you're a goddess, then why don't you take care of the many orphans that suffer in the world*?...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I told you. I can't intervene whenever I want. I must let some things go their natural course...\"- Lith said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"That makes it unfair. I don't deserve anything more than most of those children, what about the many ones that die by this damn world's cruelty?! Or the ones that didn't even got a freakin' chance to ever be born?!\"- Blake said, and Joana was somewhat shocked because Blake had never mentioned he cared about such things, though he looked disturbed when they watched a video about abortion a year ago in Biology class...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"They get a second chance at living...\"- Lith said -\"Most of them are actually happier in there than in this world... where they were disdained...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I know how it feels...\"- Blake said, and thought 'Sometimes, I've envied them, because they don't have to suffer for much longer here, their pain doesn't last for long. I know it's a bit selfish, as possibly they'd appreciate life more than I do, but, to live in a world that hates you... I prefer death... Maybe things would be better if that was my fate...'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Blake!!!\"- Lith said in a shocked and slightly angry manner <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Why do you keep reading my mind?!\"- Blake scolded himself mentally for letting his mind fly<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You really think that would be your solution?!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Someone said dreaming costs nothing...\"- Blake replied<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Death isn't the way, Blake... if you died as a child, many things would've gone wrong...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Actually, if I were dead, Blaze would be screwed for all eternity...\"- Blake said, and Joana suddenly hugged him very tightly<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Don't say such things!!\"- She said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"It's the truth... I've grown tired of many things... and these revelations just made me feel worse... it's unfair that Lith bothered to ave me but does nothing about the others...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Blake...\"- Tears were forming in Joana's eyes, and they were sadness tears<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Blake, haven't you seen it yet? Your life has changed many things, for good... your life was the only thing that was worth for your father... without you, he'd have lived alone, hated by his wife's family, and eventually killed, and he'd die with no reason to live for...\"- Lith said, and added -\"And here is Joana. She really loves you by who you are. She loves you to an extent you can't fully comprehend... do you think she'd be happy with you dead?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"If she never met me, there would be no damage...\"- Blake said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"It would be worse. I doubt she could love someone else like she loves you, and she'd be lonely for the rest of her life...\"- Lith paused for a moment -\"And about Blaze, he'd be still alive, and he would live for all eternity, and he'd be still a threat to mankind. Only you can destroy him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlso, if you weren't here, there's a chance Nostory and Seth won the fights when allied to Blaze, which would mean Jak and Jasmine may be in trouble too. They can handle enemies they know, but, you know more than the rest of us, that he is no joke. And they wouldn't get to train and be safe with the Ryans, as they came to this world to save you... Many other things would be wrong if you were dead, so, stop those thoughts. It only hurts you and the people around you, that cares about you...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake was silent (and was sinking into Joana's breast because her tight hug, so he'd be muffled). Joana released the hug and stared at Blake, who sighed, looked down and said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"This was nothing new. I've thought these things since I can remember... Until I met you, I had given up on almost everything...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Why didn't you tell me before?\"- Joana asked, still saddened<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Because I never talked to anyone about these things. I just watched thoughtfully the sky, and let my mind tell itself what I was thinking... You can say I'm used to not have someone to talk to...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"But you can tell me...\"- She gave him a long, giant (to him) kiss. -\"I always tried to figure out where did your sadness come from... You always had that gloomy feeling in you...\"- She said after breaking the kiss<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I'll try... I promised myself something...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"It's just something pers...\"- Blake started to say when he realized he was contradicting himself, sighed and said -\"I don't want to go into deep details, but I had a horrible nightmare that made me realize I'm really miserable without you, and that I need to be a better boyfriend... I hadn't noticed before how much I pushed you away when you only wanted to show me your love...\"- He felt ashamed by this realization, but Joana kissed him again and said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I'm not mad at you. And I'm happy to hear this...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLith smiled, stood up and disappeared the chair she had previously appeared. She smiled at them, and gave them a n.n face then, she left, vanishing into thin air. Wherever she was going to, she remembered some things from the past, that Blake's words reminded her...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>*This is a trait that isn't very known about Blake, whenever he sees orphans, or street children, he's reminded of his former life. Usually when alone, he gives them food meant for him, or money when he hasn't food. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPS: I mean no offense about the abortion topic, it's a personal decision, though in <i>my opinion</i> (thus, Blake's) when it's done for no reason (such as 'virginity pride' 'keeping the masks and pretending nothing happened' or plain vanity, etc...), I think it's something truly evil</b></span></div></div>",

I'm Blaze... and I just realized someone cut my hair and dyed it black...\"- Blake said sarcastically, but he had to run when Joana attempted to punch him and started running after him<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Blaze!! You bastard!! I can't believe you came here to mess with my dreams!! Blake told me you appeared in his dreams before!! I'm going to kick you out of here!!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Note to self... stop using sarcasm with Joana...\"- Blake said while running frantically, and realized they were running in circles around the room.

I was thinking about you before sleeping...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Really?\"- Blake (again, he IS actually quite naive)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoana moved closer to him, so that he felt her breathing, and she whispered<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Of course. I'm very happy that you suddenly had a change of heart. I've always loved you a lot, but I love the new you even more...\"- She kissed him again, although this time was slow. After it, she added -\"Isn't it sweet that we can be together in our dreams? That means we can be together some more time...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I guess...\"- Blake didn't sound so convinced, but Joana forgave that, he was already trying to be more loving, and she was really happy about that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I don't know how did I bring you here, but I'm very happy I did...\"- Joana said, and releasing Blake's wrists, she gave him a very tight hug. Then Blake opened his eyes wide, as something obvious had dawned to him...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I'M NORMAL SIZE!!\"- He broke the hug and noticed that a PS3 just appeared near the television -\"PS3!!\"- Blake rushed and turned the console on amazingly fast, then, he looked back at Joana, who got a little sadder... and then he sighed...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Meh... It seems I don't get to play PS3 either in reality or dreams, but what the hell...\"- He turned it off, and hugged Joana (for the first time in a very long time, on his own) and kissed her. -\"I'm sorry about what happened 5 seconds ago... I just realized I was normal sized and PS3 was the... err.... second thing that came to my mind...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoana knew Blake didn't tell the truth, but she forgave him again because of his intention, and because he realized she would get sad, and chose her over the console...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Blake didn't know this would be a looong dream...</span></div></div>",

Let me think...\"- Blake started thinking of something there was no way for Joana to know... -\"What am I thinking about right now?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"About spending more time with your girlfriend?\"- Joana said, rather innocently<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"NO!! I was thinking about a PS3!!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Well, that proves it...\"- Joana said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What if you did it on purpose?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Alright, then, would your dream do this?\"- Joana said, and aiming her hand at Blake, he shrunk to 1 inch<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Dammit!!\"- He said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Do you believe me now?\"- Joana said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Alright, I believe you... for now...\"- Blake crossed his arms, and Joana giggled, it was cute to her that Blake was trying to keep faithful -\"Can you unshrink me?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoana snapped her fingers and Blake was back to his normal size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What a relief...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Aw, come on!! Being shrunk with your girlfriend can't be that bad...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You don't get shrunk!!\"- Blake said, pointing at her accusingly...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I know, but, isn't it nice to have much more of me?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"That sounded so wrong in so many levels...\"- Blake said, looking down<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Well, it's fun for both of us...\"- Joana said, but Blake stared at her with a \u00ac_\u00ac face -\"Well... You enjoy it...\"- Blake -&gt; '\u00ac_\u00ac -\"Alright!! I enjoy it!!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake was about to say something, but Joana interrupted him -\"You can't say you haven't really come to like this... I mean, I know the first time was bad...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"BAD?! YOU FREAKIN' SAT ON ME!!\"- Blake said, waving his arms in a frantic manner -\"Do you have a remote idea of what does it feel like to be crushed by countless tons?!!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Hey! I'm not that heavy...\"- Joana said, but glanced behind her<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Even for normal standards... you're somewhat...\"- Blake said, and Joana was glaring at him<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What?!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Uh... well endowed?\"- Blake didn't know what else to say to avoid death, but as strange as it was he saying such a thing, it was a greater flattering to Joana, despite he didn't know. Joana was glad Blake at least recognized it. [I remind you, that Joana and Karina have a bet about what does Blake like from Joana's physique, and that hasn't been told yet. However, prior to that bet, Karina said Blake wouldn't even recognize that Joana was better endowed than several other girls... So, this was sort of a progress to her...]<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoana tackled Blake with another powerful hug, and this time, Blake didn't even know why. Joana then whispered<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"It's nice you noticed...\"- She giggled and blushed, but suddenly, her clothing changed to a black bra and black panties, Blake blushed madly, and he tried to break free from the hug. Joana then asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What's wrong?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"WOULD YOU PLEASE PUT SOME MORE CLOTHES ON?!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You've seen me in underwear before, what's the matter?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"That was just when we went to sleep...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"We're technically sleeping, we're dreaming...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"AAAAAGHHHH!!\"- Blake put his hands over his head in seemingly pain, and he stopped suddenly. He stared at Joana blankly, and said in an emotionless tone -\"My mind has just been screwed... Nothing makes sense anymore... Now, if you excuse me, I'm going to play Super Smash Bros Brawl on that PS3...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I thought that was a Wii game...\"- Joana said crossing her arms<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Who cares?! Nothing makes sense!! I'm going to call Pizza Hut and order a Domino's!!\"- Blake said, but Joana held his left arm, and pulled him toward her, and kissed him for over a minute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Does this make sense?\"- Joana asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"A slap would've worked, you know?\"- Blake replied<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Well... I didn't want to do that, and this worked...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I guess...\"- Blake scratched the back of his head<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"So, what do we do?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Play PS... err... I mean... what do you want to do?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Would you agree to anything?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake saw partially the catch, and he said -\"Anything that does not degrade me, humiliate me, or inflicts me pain... AND NOT SHRINKING ME!!\"- Joana had a wide smile, and she started to grow to 250 feet tall (Roughly, the same proportion as if Blake were shrunk to 1 inch, btw, the room didn't grow, but it disappeared, as if they had been outside, and there was nothing where it should be the department). Blake immediately protested<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"This won't degrade, humiliate or cause pain to you...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"But this is cheating!!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I didn't shrink you...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I need to be more specific...\"- Blake muttered, and Joana gave him a giant kiss, as well as a very tight and immense hug. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You'll like this...\"- Joana said, however, she flashed in a briefly blinding light, and she was clothed as everyday, with a pink blouse and black jeans. She stared at Blake, who said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Whoohoo!! It works!!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"That's so ironic... I bet you any other guy would've done the exact opposite...\"- Joana said, but then she added -\"I love you anyway...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"But I must ask... why the black jeans?\"- Joana asked, Blake looked away, and blushed, then she brought him closer to her face<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Oh... You like me wearing black?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I... Uh...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoana gave him a longer kiss and a tighter hug. Then, she closed her eyes, and the pink blouse was changed for a black tank top, and her black jeans were changed into stretch black jeans. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Much better, for you...\"- Joana smiled at her now small boyfriend...</span></div></div>",

He fell face first on the floor...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Blake!\"- She screamed<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Whoever who said you could do anything in a dream lies... Ow...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"This is nothing compared to the injuries you've got in battle\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Who said it doesn't hurt! Being punched by Blaze hurts! Taking an energy blast from Blaze hurts! Hell, even my light transformation hurts!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Really?\"-  Joana was a bit worried<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Only at 7 times\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Well, the point was that the fact I don't say 'Ouch' all the time doesn't mean it doesn't hurt!\"- Blake said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Then let's do something that won't hurt you\"- Joana smiled seductively<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I don't like that smile\"- Blake said, and Joana tried to pick him up -\"I have the feeling you want to do things I'll regret afterwards\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Why? This is even safer than reality!\"- Joana said, and Blake gulped at her use of the word 'safe'. Joana grabbed him and dangled him over her cleavage -\"You can't say you don't like that\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, they were in a giant version of their room, and Blake was laying on the bed. Joana again was in a black bra and black panties, Joana even swayed her hips. Blake gulped harder, and he said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I feel so wrong\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Why? You've slept with me before\"- Joana said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Yeah but I didn't do anything else!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"There's always a first time\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Uhm... I... You... Me...\"- Blake was getting a lot more nervous, Joana's previous antic already made him blush, now, multiplied over whatever times she's bigger, Blake started to feel like his body needed some blood, as all of it was apparently near his face...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"C'mon, let's have some fun\"- Joana sat on the bed and laid next to Blake, who muttered<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I am so going to be raped\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"It's not rape. You're my boyfriend and we've lived together for more than a year... AND you're already 18\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, it was like something made of glass broke inside Blake's mind, who opened his eyes wide, and screamed -\"RAPE!!\"- And he jumped off the bed and ran outside, screaming frantically, only to be hit by something. Or someone... He was struck by a running and screaming Jak, the impact sent Blake through the department's wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Stupid drunks\"- Blake muttered<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"AAAAHHH!\"- Jak then stopped -\"Uh... What did just happen?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Oh, it was nothing, just you hitting me through a FREAKIN' WALL!!\"- Blake replied angrily, and transformed into his light form, which blew away the rubble. Then he went back to normal. And he said, sounding strangely calm<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Now, if you excuse me, I'm trying to run away from being raped\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen both guys stopped, and stared at each other blankly, after a moment, both of them screamed -\"RAPE!\"- And started to run in circles even more frantically than before... 5 minutes later... Jak stopped, and Blake was still running in circles...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Uh... Blake... do you realize we've been running in circles this whole time?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Less words and more running!!\"- Blake replied, then he stopped, tripping forward, and he said -\"Wait WHAT?!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"It seems we're both trying to get away from...\"- Jak said, and Blake quickly covered Jak's mouth<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"DON'T SAY THE FOLLOWING WORD!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What word?\"- Jak was somewhat confused<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"THE word...\"- Blake said, emphasizing<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Which one?\"- Jak asked again<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"The one that you were going to say to complete your sentence\"- Blake answered<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Umm... what?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"RAPE!\"- Blake shouted, desperate, then both guys stared at each other again, and started running in random directions screaming -\"RAPE!!!! AHHHHH!!!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJak stopped after some more minutes of hysteria, while Blake crashed into a store, and Blake ended up facing an advertisement, which said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Just today! You get a 2x1 in all RAPE<font class=\"size2\" style=\"\">seed products</font>\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake started running hysterically until a car ran over him... he had a tick in both eyes. He muttered<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Dammit Jak... That almost felt as being stomped by the girls...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"It wasn't me\"- Jak said, walking near Blake<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Shut up Jak! I was telling Jak he needs to stop knocking me out...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Did you hear yourself?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"No, your Honor... It was done against my own will...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Blake?\"- Jak asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"OBJECTION!\"- Blake suddenly stood up pointing his finger, then, he fell backwards again<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Whoah... and I was just running away from...\"- Jak said, and Blake suddenly woke up, screaming<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"RAPE!\"- He fainted again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome more minutes later, Blake woke up, and mumbled<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"My head... ow... I'll stop drinking...\"- Jak sighed, and thought Blake was still mad, until he heard -\"WTF?! I don't drink!\"- Blake stood up quickly and looked around. There was a seemingly normal city, Jak, some cars, Jak, a videogame store, a domino's pizza place, Jak, a blockbuster, another videogame store, Blaze waving hello at him, Nostory and Seth reading at a library, Aizen drinking a coffee, Jak...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"WAIT A MINUTE!\"- Blake shouted<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What?\"- Jak said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What did just happen?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Uh... You fainted while we were running frantically to avoid...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"RAPE!\"- Blake screamed, but Jak said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Yeah... I'm sorry about that...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Wait a minute... are you saying that all what just happened was just a dream inside a dream?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What do you mean?\"- Jak asked, then they looked around, and noticed a videogame store, a domino's pizza place, a blockbuster, another videogame store, Blaze waving hello, Nostory and Seth reading at a library, Aizen sitting in a bench drinking a coffee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"WHAT THE...?!\"- Both Blake and Jak screamed, and Blake said -\"Forget the rape!! Enemies!! AAHHHHH!!\"- Blake started running frantically in circles again, then he remembered<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Screw the dream! I have enemies!\"- He stopped, and said -\"Uh... wait... that didn't sound right...\"- Then Blake transformed into his light state, and said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Hell yeah! Screw the enemies! I have power!\"- Blake powered up to 5 times and dashed toward them, punching Nostory and Seth, kicking Blaze away, and snatching Aizen's coffee<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Hey!\"- Aizen protested, but he got Blake's fist sinking in his face as an answer...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"This is so damn satisfying\"- Blake said after finishing the coffee, and after beating Aizen, Nostory, Seth and Blaze some more. Then, he put his arm into Blaze's mouth, and after seemingly digging, he pulled out his stomach and intestines, and wrapped them around his neck, then, he hung him from the highest building he found. Blake was laughing maniacally<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJak had an O.O face at Blake's madness, and started reconsidering about his girlfriend, maybe the rape wasn't so bad...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Actually. We're just part of your delirium. I'm not the real Blaze\"- 'Blaze' said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What?!\"- Blake stopped his maniacal laughing<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"We're just the personification of your dreams and your madness\"- Blaze said, standing calmly besides Aizen, Nostory and Seth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You just had to ruin my fun... BUT I'LL STILL BEAT YOU!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"It it completely unfair. We have no power, we're harmless\"- 'Blaze' said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Shut up, girly boy!\"- Blake replied<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Huh?\"- Something broke inside 'Blaze'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You heard me! Shut the hell up!! Girly boy!\"- Blake laughed, and said -\"I've wanted to say that for so long...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"G...g-girly?\"- 'Blaze' stuttered<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Yeah! Oh, look at me! I am a pretty white haired boy! Tremble at my girliness! I have princess hair, but I forgot to dye it!\"- Blake started doing an impression of 'Blaze'... Blake then added the last straw -\"My name's Blaze! Oh, how terrifying! My name sounds like a popstar's!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Blaze' roared in anger and punched Blake, so powerfully that the whole city trembled, and Blake was sent through nearly half of the city...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake transformed at light x7 and dashed furiously towards them, but they disappeared, and Blake punched nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Aw\"- Blake transformed back to normal... Then he and Jak, who was heading back to Jasmine, felt some tremors, and saw a giant Joana, who smiled at Blake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I hate myself so much already\"- Blake mumbled<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Well, I better leave you guys alone, Jasmine must be looking for me... or something...\"- Jak said, but Blake grabbed his shoulder, while laughing nervously<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Oh. Look. We have a visit. I feel so bad that you won't be able to rape someone now\"- Blake said nervously, not letting go of Jak<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"It's not rape!!\"- Joana stomped her foot on the ground, knocking Blake and Jak off their feet, and falling face first to the floor<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Legally, it's still rape\"- Blake said, while reading a law book which he got out of nowhere<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Jasmine tried to trick me into believing we were married\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"D'OH!\"- Was Joana's immediate reaction</span></div></div>",

But first, he will still stuck on rather running away from his girlfriend, well wife, if you want to be technical. Jak thought long and hard, and then thought, it's just a dream, but at the same time didn't won't to let down on his morals. Jak was still 17 and wanted to get married, so he decided to avoid the sex, dream or no dream.

Much to his surprise, Blake, along the suit, had very heavy weights chained to his wrists and ankles. Jak had an O.O expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"In case it's not obvious, this is to prevent me from escaping... this and the heavy security...\"- Jak noticed several men in black suits and sunglasses, all of them looked identical and he thought he had seen them somewhere else...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"They're agents Smith, Smith, that one is Smith, and Smith, the one over there... Smith... that one, Smith, Smith is the one next to Smith and...\"- Blake said while pointing at them<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I got the message!!\"- Jak said a bit angry<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I thought being aware of a dream was awesome but this has only brought a lot of nonsense to our lives... like this... in reality, there's no way in hell they'd get me to marry Joana, nor anyone else...\"- Blake said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Maybe not... if the alternate universe thing exists, there has to be an alternate you marrying an alternate Joana right now...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I doubt alternate Joana would be giant...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"An alternate you might even be some sort of knight or a mercenary... and the alternate you may alternately be alternately forced by an alternately giant alternate Joana by alternate reasons... or something...\"- Jak said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I think I just got an aneurysm...\"- Blake said, seemingly in brain pain -\"You just raped my mind...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"RAPE!! AAAHHHH!!!\"- Jak was about to run outside while waving his arms frantically, but he stopped, and Blake was giving him an angry glare. -\"Sorry...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Don't worry. I would've done the same if I hadn't these weights on... hmm...\"- Blake said thoughtfully, then, he snapped his fingers and said -\"Screw the weights!! I have light power!!\"- Blake transformed into his light form, but surprisingly, the weights felt like the same. Blake got angered and powered up to 3 times... the weights felt like the same again, then 5 times... and then Blake said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Screw the limits!! I'm in a dream!!\"- Blake powered up... to over 9 times!!! (What? did you expect over 9,000?)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake's whole body was surrounded by continuously flashing golden lightning bolts, and he tried to move, but the weights felt way heavier than before. Blake tried powering up even more, to the point his body was so tightened that every vein and artery was visible, but the weights felt even heavier, and Blake could no longer stand up. Then Jak said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I think powering up won't help...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I just realized...\"- Blake said sarcastically, but Jak didn't get it this time<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Really?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"NO!!!\"- Blake shouted angrily, and transformed back to normal. He could stand normally again<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Uhmmm... well...\"- Jak tried to think of something<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"It seems that while we have certain freedoms in this \"shared dream\", the girls are actually the \"owners\" of this world, and their power over this reality is superior to ours...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Umm... what?\"- Jak looked at Blake with a raised eyebrow and a confused look<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What?! I'm actually smarter than you think!!\"- Blake said, though Jak couldn't help but remember their previous episodes of mad randomness... Then Blake said .\"In fact, I got a great plan!! I'll create some weights identical to these ones, and you'll wear them... then, you can transform into a copy of me...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I see... then what?\"- Jak sounded interested in the plan<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Then... you'd marry Joana and would live with her the rest of your life... or this dream...whatever ends first...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"W...T...F?!! I'm not marrying Joana instead of you!!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What kind of best man are you?\"- Blake crossed his arms<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"A best man doesn't do that!!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Then what's a best man for?\"- Blake asked, and Jak whispered him, seemingly, a lot of things... -\"Really?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJak nodded, and Blake said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"That doesn't help very much...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"We have to think of something...\"- Jak said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Hmm... there has to be some way of breaking these chains...\"- Blake tried firing energy (blue while in normal state) at them but it did nothing. Jak also tried firing (white) energy, but that didn't work either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What do we do?\"- Jak asked, nor more worried<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I don't know!! This is too stressful...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Stressful?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I can't think of anything while I worry about being married to a girl the size of Godzilla!!\"- Blake shouted, then they heard a voice<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Hey!!\"- The mentioned monster said, which surprised both Jak and Blake beyond anything so far. They stared at each other, and Blake said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Forget the rape!! Godzilla!! AAHHHHH!!\"- Blake and Jak started running frantically in circles while screaming, and Godzilla just facepalmed himself. After about 5 minutes of madness, both guys stopped, then Blake said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"One minute!! Why are you here?! We're not in Japan!!<font class=\"size2\" style=\"\"> I hope...</font>\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I was invited to this wedding. A pretty girl who is strangely bigger than the rest of humans told me that her future husband was a fan of me...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Uh... what?\"- Jak said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Well... I have to admit that his movies were one of the few awesome things of my childhood... that and Snes...\"- Blake said to Jak, while scratching the back of his head -\"WAIT!! You're not supposed to talk!! You're supposed to be a monster that saves the Earth from other monsters and destroys cities in the process...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"That's easy to explain\"- Godzilla said -\"Japanese is too difficult to learn... So, I learned english instead... though it was too late, as a damn iguana stole my name...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"If it comforts you, that movie sucked anyway...\"- Blake said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Am I the only sane person here?!!\"- Jak said waving his arms frantically -\"A giant monster that talks is here!!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"It's a dream... and it's cool... well... if it weren't because of the rape...\"- Blake said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Rape?\"- Godzilla asked confused<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"This actually a forced marriage so my crazy giant girlfriend can legally rape me...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Rape? Aren't you 18?\"- The giant monster asked, then, Blake got an idea, and a wide smile formed in his face<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Nope!! I'm actually 17 years old...\"- Blake said, and when Jak was about to say something, Blake covered his mouth with one of his hands<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"This is outrageous!! How does that girl dare to force an underage guy into such a thing!!\"- Godzilla said, before roaring (his well known trademark roar). Then, Godzilla broke the chains tied to the weights that kept Blake with one of his claws. Then Jak took Blake to Godzilla's shoulder and Blake whispered to the king of the monsters<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Thanks for the help. But let's not make this much louder. We need to be discrete. Even without the chains, security is quite heavy...\"- Blake said, and pointed at the many identical agents.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I can take care of them with my atomic breath...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"No!!\"- Blake and Jak screamed -\"It might kill us as well... and... I don't intend to kill my girlfriend either...\"- Blake said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I thought she was forcing you just like that crazy ape tried to do with a woman...\"- Godzilla said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"It's quite complicated, but no. She's my girlfriend... it's just that for unknown reasons she wants to.. well... rape me... Before that she was just overprotective, and gave crushing suffocating hugs\"- Blake said -\"Nevermind...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Alright. Then I'll go back to the hall...\"- Godzilla said, as Blake and Jak jumped off his shoulder -\"If someone asks, I roared because something hurt my foot... and that wall was broken before I came...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What wall?\"- Blake and Jak asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Precisely...\"- The giant monster left</span></div></div>",

Also, I thought of saying 'I object' at the critical moment to make the crowd gasp, and then we get the hell out of here...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Well, I'll call my lawyer...\"- Blake said, taking his crappy cell phone from his pocket<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You have a lawyer?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"No. But this is a dream, and if I dial random numbers, I'll get to call a lawyer that will help me...\"- Blake said, and after dialing -\"Hello? Yeah, I need your services. No, I'm not a prisoner escaping from jail, thanks...It's a case of a forced marriage by a giant girl... Alright... Also, there's some security... Alright. the adress? You know it!! Just look for a pair of giant girls and Godzilla and you'll find the place!!\"- <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake then ended the call, and said to Jak -\"He'll be here in some more minutes, hopefully, before I get officially married...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Hopefully?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"It's a dream. He'll be here in time...\"- Blake said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1 hour later, Blake, who had put the weights back on (the chains are still broken, but he temporarily soldered them lightly with energy so they'd break whenever he did a strong movement) was before the marriage officiant who was giving the typical marriage speech (and seemingly, didn't mind the fact that the 'bride' was 250 feet tall...). When he said <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"If anyone has an objection why this man and this woman should not be wed, speak now or forever hold your peace...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"<span class=\"cred\"><font class=\"size5\" style=\"\"><b>OBJECTION!</b></font></span>\"- A man with spiky hair and a blue suit came in and shouted, and the crowd gasped. Next to him were a green ogre and a donkey, and all of the agents Smith laid unconscious. The crowd gasped once more, and some women dismayed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Fiona, I need to talk to y...\"- The ogre said, then stared at the interrupted marrying couple... -\"Holy mother of Pete...\"- <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I think she took too much vitamins...\"- The donkey said, which made some more people dismay (WTF?!! They dismay at a talking donkey but not at a giant girl?! Meh...)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Hey!! This is not the wedding I came to interrupt!!\"- The ogre said to the man in blue suit, but sighed -\"Nevermind...\"- Looking down, he left in a sad manner, the donkey followed him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJak then shot some energy blasts to create a smoke curtain so they escaped, and as they were running, Jak said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What a good lawyer...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Best lawyer ever!!\"- Blake said, but they noticed the lawyer was no longer there, but they didn't feel like searching for him, and so, they ran outside...</span></div></div>",

After some running (Which roughly is about 160 kms away...). Blake and Jak stopped, and after catching their breath, Blake said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"This was the best random succession of events ever...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Yeah... Made possible by another shared dream... I smell a conspiracy...\"- Jak replied<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I thought that too... it's a bit too suspicious that we ended in the same dream by pure coincidence...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"WHY WON'T YOU BELIEVE US?!!\"- Both guys stopped and got startled when they heard the girls' booming voices at once. Before them, Joana and Jasmine stood with crossed arms, and Joana, who was still dressed in white, had an specially angry look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I... uh...\"- Blake and Jak were scratching the back of their respective heads, and laughing nervously, then, Blake said -\"Hey!! Look! It's Led Zeppelin!!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoana almost by reflex looked toward where Blake pointed, and in less than a second, the guys were gone.

Blake knows they're my favorite band, but I didn't really think he'd do something that low...\"- Joana said, and started running, Jasmine followed her<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, some hundred of feet away...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"And you said that would be useless...\"- Blake said -\"Nobody knows Joana better than me\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I didn't say it would be useless. I said that IN THE END our efforts would be rendered useless...\"- Jak replied<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Why?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You said it yourself. The girls own this dream... and if we keep making them angry I bet they'll pwn us...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Not while I can still run...\"- Blake said, then he noticed Jak was flying instead of running, and he said -\"Oh right. Keep rubbing in my face that I can't fly...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I can't run as fast. And flying is cooler...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Meh...\"- Blake said -\"At least things have gone right so far. Godzilla helped us, we got that awesome lawyer, and we've successfully escaped from being r...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Blake!! You spoke too soon!!\"- Jak said, and both guys stopped abruptly, Blake ended up crashing into a sony building, and after he came out, he said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Remember me that sony's customer service sucks...\"- Blake said as he fell face first to the floor. Jak was facepalming himself, and Blake stood up rather quickly after that brief dizzy moment. Before them, the girls were standing once again. This time it looked like if they had some sort of heat or laser vision, Blake and Jak would be molten long ago...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Blake... I can't believe you tricked me like that...\"- Joana said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Uh... What?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I can't believe you used my favorite band to escape from me...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Are you sure you didn't step on them or something?\"- Blake said, then he changed to a scolding like attitude -\"You need to pay more attention when you're at that size. If you killed them you'll be responsible of a great crime against music...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Blake!!\"- Joana shouted, even angrier -\"You've abused of me for the last time...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Excuse moi, mademoiselle?*\"- Blake then shouted -\"When have I abused of you?! Actually, I'm escaping from being abused by YOU...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Ouch...\"- Jak and Jasmine muttered at once<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Oh, come on!! You haven't abused of me that way, but that doesn't mean you have abused of me...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Give me 7 examples...\"- <br>\r\nBlake said, crossing his arms and with a confident smile, Joana took a deep breath, and started to say<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"In chronological order:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1.- I'm grouping as one all the times you ignored my feelings when we were just friends, and this also includes the many times I tried to spend time with you and you always had some reason to not to...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2.- It was almost impossible to get you to kiss me...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Correction, I said I wasn't good at that...\"- Blake answered, and blushed when he realized what he said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"3.- You also said you didn't like hugs very much...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n4.- You were very afraid of me when you got shrunk by Blaze...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"...Okay...\"- Blake now started to wonder if Joana could really tell 14 examples<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"5.- Ever since Blaze appeared you kept me away from everything, and you didn't even tell me you had been training for 2 years!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n6.-  You kept me away even more after finding I had powers, when all I wanted was to be like you, and to not be afraid of Blaze and the others powers...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd the last one: You've been trying to avoid certain things I won't tell with the excuse you were 16, then 17... Now that you're 18, you have no excuse, but you still run away...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake gulped loudly, he also knew that with the first one she could've made up all 7, which also applied to the 2nd, 3rd and 4th examples... When Joana finsihed, she noticed Blake was writing something in a paper and with a feather, she only could read<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I, Blake, hereby declare that this is my last will and testament...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a minute, he handed the document to Jak, saying<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I don't have much, but I'll let you have my Wii and my PSP. Take good care of them...\"- <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoana screamed in anger at Blake's attitude, and Jak whispered<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I think you pissed her off even more...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I can't be more screwed up than I already am...\"- Blake said, and then Jasmine said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Speaking of screwing...\"- She gave an evilish smile at Jak, who also gulped, and got a paper out of nowhere, and snatched Blake's feather, saying<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Gimme that!!\"- He started writing frantically, then he handed the document to Blake, who read it very quickly<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Whoah... you're giving me your PS3...\"- Jak nodded, and Blake said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Okay, you can die now...\"- And started walking away<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Blake!! I thought you'd be better than that!!\"- Jak shouted, and Blake said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Screw friendship, I have a PS3...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"...\"- Jak was in silent anger, until Blake suddenly shot two golden energy balls, and pulled Jak by the arm<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What?!\"- Jak asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Screw the PS3, I have friendship!!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I never expected you'd say such a thing...\"- Jak said, but then they crashed against a tall column... then they looked up, and it was Joana's ankle... and she was looking down even angrier than before...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Sucks to be me...\"- Blake muttered, then they noticed Jasmine behind them, they had no escape, and were surrounded<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Correction: Sucks to be us...\"- Jak added<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*It's very rare that Blake uses this phrase, however, the very few times he has, it's always in a sarcastic manner...</span></div></div>",

He was being licked and coated in saliva. Then he was being kissed passionately. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAww\u2026\u201d Jasmine then looked at Jak. \u201cSomeone\u2019s getting excited.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJak,\u201d Blake said. \u201cFight the urges! I know you can do it\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGive m-me,\u201d Jak was blushing, but was fighting. \u201cI reason why I should let you rape me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIT\u2019S NOT RAPE!!!!\u201d Both girls said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake then pulled out a book. \u201cActually, it is. Me and Jak aren\u2019t giving you guys the consent or permission to have sexual intercourse with us. Sorry.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSCREW THE RULES!\u201d Joana said. \u201cWe can be in this dream forever!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot exactly,\u201d Jak said. \u201cIF you guys honestly did this by accident, then whenever your body feels like waking up, the dream will be over. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe\u2019s got a point there.\u201d Jasmine said. \u201cRape is the only option we have Joana\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess it is.\u201d Joana said. \u201cIt\u2019s just a dream still\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cW-wait.\u201d Jak said. \u201cYou don\u2019t care, as long if-\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s exactly what we are saying boys.\u201d Jasmine said.  \u201cIf force the only way to get you guys to cooperate, then so be it\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the faces of Joana and Jasmine got serious. Jasmine intentionally dropped Jak to the floor, and he recovered quickly with an Ukemi.  Jasmine and Joana then changed out of their wedding dresses, and changed into bikinis. The environment was also changed to a empty beach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe will fight you guys for the right to screw you.\u201d Jasmine said.  \u201cIf we win, well, it\u2019s pretty much over\u2026.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd it won\u2019t be easy\u2026.\u201d Joana said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJak and Blake looked at each other, and then nodded. They powered up, and reverted back to their normal states. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJak,\u201d Blake said. \u201cAre you sure about this\u2026?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe they will realize how crazy this is\u2026.\u201d Jak said. \u201cJust go with it, and don\u2019t get too cocky, I have no idea how powerful they may be\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls started to power up\u2026.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Blake also remembered that Joana's power was around 5,000, and with her size increase it also multiplied her power further, though Blake couldn't tell how much (Nor Blake nor Joana, or by that, currently, nobody except the Ryans, Lith and Blaze have the ability to sense other presences and also their power. Well, Karina also can, using her machine... Also, Joana can specifically detect Blake's presence, but it's very vague and she can't tell his power yet)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Hey!! You always use the size to your advantage... I bet you can't beat me at normal size, heh...\"- Blake said, intentionally sounding cocky, despite Jak told him not to, but it was because if Blake tricked her into fighting at normal size he might have a chance. Jak facepalmed himself, and Joana raised an eyebrow<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Really? Last time we trained I beat you badly at normal size...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Then you don't have inconvenient in trying again...\"- <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Fine\"- Joana shrank back to normal size, and dashed toward Blake, she almost punched him, but Blake dodged her, then he clenched his fists, and his golden aura became more jagged but still fire-like. Blake was now at 5 times his normal power (18,000), and dashed toward Joana and was about to punch her, but she gave him a puppy eye look, and asked quietly<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Blake... would you really use all your power to punch me?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You just tried to do the same...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoana's bikini, which was white, changed to black, and Joana, blushing, said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I'm doing this because I want to...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"STOP IT RIGHT THERE!!\"- Blake shouted -\"I'm not going to all for such a cheap trick, geez, you could get an Oscar for your acting...\"- Blake said and crossed his arms, laughing a bit. Joana looked down for a moment, then her blushing vanished and her eyes now looked like they had \"I'll kill you!!\" written in them, and she said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"That was your last chance...\"- Joana dashed toward him but Blake punched her in the forehead, and the force was so great that Joana was sent at least half of a mile away, and through many buildings. Blake had a raised eyebrow and said (still in the same position he punched Joana)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Wow... is the aura x5 that powerful? Aizen and Blaze made it look useless...\"- Then Blake cracked his knuckles, and added -\"Heh! This is gonna be so easy...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoana dashed again and shot several white energy balls, that Blake didn't even bother dodging, as he tested his theory. After the smoke vanished, he said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"It seems I was right... Now I know what Blaze and Aizen feel when fighting us...\"- Blake brushed the dust off his suit (he was still dressed as a groom), and said -\"Screw the suit, I can get back my good old clothes!!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake threw away the black jacket and vest, leaving only the white long sleeved shirt, much to his surprise, the clothing he just removed were very heavy (What surprised Blake is that he didn't notice it). Then he decided to change all of his clothes, and focusing on it, in a flash, he had his typical brown jacked with a black short sleeved shirt under it, his black jeans and black tennis shoes as well. Blake then said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Much better... Now, back to beating you...\"- Joana punched and kicked Blake with no effect, and Blake just laughed at her efforts (He didn't really mean to act like this, but he was doing so to make Joana see that she was not getting her way with him...). Again, Blake kicked her with little effort, and sent her over 600 feet away, and crashed into a skyscraper. Blake walked toward her, and said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"C'mon, you must've noticed that Lith's training was better than you thought, and that my multiplied aura is not to be underestimated, despite it wasn't as useful against the actual bad guys... If you promise to stop trying to rape me, this fight would be over...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"N...Never...\"- Joana said, struggling to get up, but Blake fired a golden beam at her, which hurled her against the building's wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Now?\"- Blake asked again<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Nope!!\"- Joana replied, and Blake fired another beam at her, which made her pierce the wall, and she fell at least 100 feet down... This time, Blake fired a lot of golden energy balls that hit her at once, creating a large explosion. Blake could clearly hear her voice<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Before you even ask, NOPE!!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Fine\"- Blake fired two more beams at her, and dashed toward her, punching her in the stomach, then, he put his foot over her belly, and said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Now?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"U...Ugh...\"- Joana tried to push Blake's foot away but she couldn't, as Blake was over 3 times more powerful than her. Blake aimed his hand at her, and charged up an energy blast, and Joana with wide open eyes said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You wouldn't...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Oh, really?\"- Blake gave an evil looking smile, and fired a massive point blank beam that bounced off the floor, resulting in a column made of golden fire-like light. After the smoke vanished, Blake stared at Joana, and laughed madly... Joana was naked (obviously so little clothing can't survive energy blasts) but she was all charred, and her formerly wavy hair looked funny as hell, as well as the fact that she coughed black smoke twice (Even Blake watched some cartoons during his childhood). Her eyes narrowed in anger, and her appearance was restored, including the black bikini...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You should've put on some armor...\"- Blake suggested<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoana powered up in anger, unleashing a white transparent aura that resembled Blake's, although less jagged. They dashed toward each other...</span></div></div>",

'I think Blake's going all out.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked at Jasmine, and thought 'Let's see how much of a jerk I can be.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Jasmine?\" Jak said. \"Why don't you shrink, and let's see how powerful you really are at normal size.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"F-Fine.\" Jasmine said, shrinking, and slightly nervous. \"I can probably mop the floor with you easily at this size anyway.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm.\" Jak said. \"Come on.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJasmine then dashed at Jak and punched him in the face. Jak was taken by surprise, but it wasn't as concerning, as it was wayy better than getting hit by a 50+ punch. Jak recovered quickly, and shot an energy blast at Jasmine, and she dodged it with ease. Jasmine had the :P face, but then Jak dashed after the dodge, and delivered a hard uppercut, and Jasmine went flying upward. Jak then flew quickly to intercept her, but then she vanished instantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not going to be that easy, Luigi-Boogums.\" Jasmine said, tapping him on the shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" Was Jak only response before getting punched harder than the last time, and he would fly...right into Blake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake wasn't blindsided and caught Jak. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jak,\" Blake said. \"What's the matter?

He flew directly in front of her, and then vanished. Jasmine looked around, getting nervous again. And then she heard:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Jasmine.\" Jak said, appearing behind her, and going Omega Form at the same time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJasmine then turned around slowly, only to be met by two unkind words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OMEGA BUSTER!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJasmine was immediately engulfed by the bright white beam that Jak fired. Jasmine couldn't believe it, she felt like she was a home run ball that got hit VERY hard. Jak on the other hand, wasn't tired in the least, thanks to the enhancements made to his powers. And then he made a moderate sized energy ball to throw at Jasmine while she was still in his signature blast. The energy ball caught up to Jasmine and created a mini-nuke explosion. Jak then landed on the warm beach sand, and ripped off his tux to reveal a shirt with a Super Mario Green Mushroom 1-UP on it, and a pair of blue jean shorts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah...\" Jak smiled, and then laughed crazily. <font class=\"size4\" style=\"\"><b>\"THIS IS GREAT!\" </b></font><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

His muscles tightened, and his aura looked electric-like. Blake tightened a bit his grip on Joana's hand, and he said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Hey, could you get me a souvenir when you come back?\"- Then he threw her away with an even more tremendous force, so much that she was out of sight.

Maybe I'll do the same if Joana ever comes back...\"- Blake pulled out a small notepad, and wrote '<b>Note to self: Kick Joana like a football next time she appears in this dream</b>'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Well... now what are you going to do?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"THIS!!\"- Blake replied, and cupped his hands, then drew him toward his left side, and his aura became slightly larger, and with golden electric bolts flashing around him. Then the bolts started to get drawn to the space between Blake's cupped hands, and a golden energy ball appeared. The ball started to emit lots of golden light and golden lightning bolts surrounded it. Jak asked in awe<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Don't tell me you're going to...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Yes... Teh ultimate awesomeness!!\"- Blake charged up more the energy in his hands, and thrust them forward, and he shouted<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Golden Light Kamehameha!!\"- He fired a massive (At least over 30 feet wide) golden beam with some lightning bolts spinning around it. The beam flew toward the horizon, and then, seemingly hitting something, it created a nuclear-like explosion from far away. Jak, who got sunglasses out of nowhere, said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Wow... That's awesome... and you definitively are a jerk...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I'll take that as a compliment...\"- Blake replied -\"Dreams are awesome!!\"- He added, then, they heard Godzilla's voice, who asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Hey guys, what are you doing?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake had another evil smile, and said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"We're destroying cities that are far away from us. Currently the target is shooting in straight line toward the horizon...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Wow. I never thought you little people could do such thing...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Wanna try?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Of course!!\"- Godzilla's eyes were like little stars, and he charged up his atomic breath, and fired a blue fire-like beam, causing another nuclear-like explosion<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Nice shot. I'd give you a 10/10...\"- Blake replied<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Now you're even more of a jerk...\"- Jak said, laughing<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Well, we're all jerks. So, let's be awesome jerks for the time being!!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake charged up another Kamehameha, and Jak asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"How the hell did you learn it? Too much Raging Blast anyone?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Nope. I just think about doing it and I can do it. You should try...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I will!!\"- Jak exclaimed, and cupped his hands, then he drew them toward his right side, and started to charge it up, then, both he and Blake heard another charging up sound, and looked up<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Godzilla?! WTF?!\"- Blake asked with an O_O face<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What? I didn't want to be left out...\"- The giant monster said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Alright. Let's do it at once... 3...2...1... NOW!!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake fired his massive golden Kamehameha again, while Jak fired an also massive, green fire-like Kamehameha, and Godzilla fired a gigantic blue one. The three of them created an even larger explosion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Wow... we must've blown an entire continent... Cool...\"- Blake said, then he asked -\"By the way, why was your kamehameha green and fire-like?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Because it was my brand new Luigi Kamehameha!!\"- Jak replied happily, then, he said -\"Once again?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Sure. If we blow up the ocean at least the girls won't drown. They'll thank us later...\"- Blake said, and the crazy trio charged up again a Kamehameha, and fired them at once, but this time, Godzilla also fired his red spiral atomic breath at the same time, thus, now 4 insanely powerful beams hit the same spot again, creating an explosion that not only destroyed anything in an immense radius, but also damaged a lot the city they were in. At least half of it got blown up by the explosion's shockwave...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Wow... Atomic breath and Kamehameha at the same time. You're awesome... Godzilla\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Thanks...\"- Godzilla replied, then, an alarm from a watch was heard, and Godzilla checked his wrist -\"Oh! I need to go back to work. It was very fun, guys...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Work?\"- Blake asked in a very confused tone (Plus the fact that where the hell did Godzilla get a wrist watch?)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Yeah. Someone has to destroy Sydney this weekend, and Mothra asked me to cover for her...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"...Uh...fine, I guess... Bye!\"- Blake waved goodbye to the king of the monsters, and then Jak said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I hope we didn't kill the girls...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"We're in a dream!!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Yeah, but I've heard that some legends say that if someone dies in their sleep, that person will never wake up...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What... the...?!!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Other versions say that if someone dies in a dream dies in real life...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"So, we are stuck in this place?\"- Blake was now starting to worry<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Either that, or we die with the dream...\"- Jak stared at Blake for 5 seconds, then they started to run frantically in circles screaming<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"AAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHH!!! THIS IS WORSE THAN RAPE!!!... AAAAAAHHHHH!!!!!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Is this really worse than rape?\"- Blake stopped and asked, scratching his chin (by the way, Blake has no facial hair, in case you wonder, and no, he doesn't shave, he just doesn't have facial hair...)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"YES, IT IS!!\"- Replied Jak in a still frantic manner, and without stopping his running in circles<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Alright... now, back to where I left off...\"- Blake said, then he ran in circles while screaming again<br>\r\n<br>\r\n5 minutes later...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"AAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHH!!!!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2 minutes later...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"AAAAAAHHHH!!!\"- Then Blake stopped, and said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Well, if the girls were dead, we'd be already dead. So, I guess we're fine!!\"- Blake gave Jak a thumbs up, and Jak stopped<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Yeah... maybe... but doesn't that mean...?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I don't hope so...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Well... what do we do now?\"- Jak asked, and Blake said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"PS3!!!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1 minute later, in a Blockbuster store... Blake and Jak (still transformed) were playing DBZ Raging Blast 2 in a PS3 with a 52 in' LED screen, and in a comfortable sofa, with sodas next to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"This is the life...\"- Blake said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Yeah...\"- Jak seconded<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Hey!! I hope you pay for all those sodas!! And the console is just for exhibition!! And take that sofa back to my house!! You're breaking many of our rules!!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Screw the rules, we have power...\"- Blake said, not interrupting his playing<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"And money... but we prefer power...\"- Jak said, showing him a lot of 100 dollar bills that vanished into thin air...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Couldn't you just pay for the PS3, the screen and the sodas?\"- The clerk asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Yeah. But it feels more satisfying this way...\"- Blake answered<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"*Sigh* My wife is going to kill me...\"- The clerk left in a sad manner<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Sucker!! We don't have wives!! We have POWER, and GAMES!!\"- Blake said to the walking away clerk.

I'm inside the videogame!! Awesome!!\"- Blake closed his eyes and his clothes changed to a black version of Goku's gi, just for the heck of it. Blake wandered around this new world... It was a stage from Raging Blast 2, Ruined City... He found nobody, and wondered why did the game do that...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen he noticed Jak was laying down on the street, his eyes had a tick, and his mouth also had a twitch. Blake aimed his hand toward his face and charged up a blue energy ball (Blake's energy is blue when not transformed, and also, it's non-elemental energy). Jak opened his eyes wide and jumped up very high. 5 seconds later he fellf ace-frist with a thud<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What the hell do you think you're doing?!!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I had to snap you out of it... and it was either that or saying the 'R' word... But that one wouldn't work because I'd be scared as well...\"- Blake replied, he had cancelled the energy in his hand<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\" 'R' word? You mean r...\"- Jak said but Blake covered Jak's mouth with one of his hands, and with a very serious look, he said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Don't say it... hell, don't even think about it...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"But this is weird!! We're inside the videogame!!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Awesome!!\"- Blake said, and Jak noticed Blake wasn't wearing his typical clothing<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What's with the Goku-like suit?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I'm wearing it because we're in DBZ videogame world...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Aren't you worried... I have a bad feeling about this...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Nah. What's the worst it could happen?\"- Blake asked, and they noticed two shadowy presences<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You just had to say it...\"- Jak facepalmed himself<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Hi guys...\"- The shadowy presences revealed themselves to be Joana and Jasmine, very angry looking... (Still dressed in bikinis)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Want us to mop the floor with you again?\"- Blake asked in a cocky attitude<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Blake!! What are you doing?!\"- Jak felt he was digging their grave deeper<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I can't believe you actually used earth shattering attacks against us...\"- Jasmine said, in a quiet tone, but it could be felt how angry she was<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You'd have done worse things\"- Blake replied, but shuddered at the thought<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Well, that's about to change...\"- Jasmine said, and looked at Joana, who said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You won't escape from us this time!!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls closed their eyes and started to grow, but they were surrounded in a white lightning aura, and they were electroshocked, and reverted to nearly 10 feet, both girls bliked twice in confusion, while Blake was rolling on the floor laughing madly, even Jak had a weirded look. Jasmine muttered<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What did just happen?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I have no idea...\"- Joana replied<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake stopped his laughing, and whispered to Jak<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"That's Raging Blast 2's size limit!! It rules!! The biggest the girls can get here is Broly's size!!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Since when did you know it?\"- Jak asked with an o.o' face <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Since we unlocked all characters. If we were on Tenkaichi 3 we'd be screwed...\"- Blake replied, and Jak nodded in agreement. Blake and Jak turned toward the girls, and Blake said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Time to be awesome!!\"- Blake transformed into his light state x7, Jak transformed into his Omega form. The girls still didn't understand what was going on and didn't realize when Blake and Jak dashed toward them, Jak used an energy ball that launched Jasmine some feet away, while Blake kicked Joana with great strength, sending her  high into the sky and and seemingly out of sight... again...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Whoah... I didn't think you would actually do it...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Didn't you write a note telling yourself to kick Joana?\"- Jak crossed his arms<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Oh... yeah... I had forgotten about it...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"And you still kicked her?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Yeah, it's that or let her R' me...\"- Blake said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Nice censorship...\"- Jak said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Speaking of which... the girls shouldn't be allowed to wear bikinis here...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-You care?\"- Jak said with a suspicious look<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Not really, but it would have been fun if they got another electroshock forcing them to wear something else...\"- Blake said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Whatever... by the way... if this followed DBZ RB2's rules, then why did you send her away Smash Bros style?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Meh... I don't know... You care?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Not really, but it would have been more brutal to slam her through buildings or rocks...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I like the way you think...\"- Blake pulled the same notepad out of nowhere, and ripped off the first note, then he wrote <b>'Note to self: Slam Joana against and/or buildings and/or rocks'</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Why do you bother writing if you're going to forget it?\"- Jak asked, to which Blake replied nothing, but wrote another note <b>'Note to self: Remember the previous note'</b> Jak looked at what he was writing and said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I doubt that'll help...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake then wrote a third note: <b>'Read the previous note to remember about the first note...'</b> Jak sighed and facepalmed himself, Blake added a fourth note <b>'Note to self: Ask Jak why does he facepalm when I write notes to myself. PS: Read the previous note to remember to remember about the first note'</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake put the notepad in his pants pocket, and said to Jak<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"It seems it's time for Round 2!! Too bad Godzilla isn't here...\"- Blake said, in a mix f happiness and sadness<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Well, someone HAD to destroy Sidney...\"- <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You care?\"- Blake asked, and Jak scratched his chin thoughtfully...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n20 minutes later...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Nope\"- Was Jak's answer</span></div></div>",

I don't have the physical limitations...' He started to power up, his muscles tightened insanely, and his eyes not only were golden but also were glowing. His hair was pointing upwards in finer spikes, and his scar also glowed in golden (Blake looked like his real body while dreaming). He flew toward what seemed to be the screen from inside, and passed through to the 'real' world. Currently, Blake was using the golden aura x10, a level impossible to sustain in reality, and even if he cold, it might kill him. His power in numbers was  36,000 (10x his normal power: 3,600)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake charged toward the girls, despite their size, he knew that their size would be rather a weakness if he kept a power high enough. Joana and Jasmine smiled, believeng Blake had fallen for the trap, although, even seeing him was a bit difficult with their current size, and suddenly, he disappeared. Not even a second later, Joana was struck from behind the neck with titanic force, that sent her falling forward several hundred feet (a few feet in her scale). Joana fell face first, crushing some buildings. She stood up and turned around, to see Blake standing on a skyscraper, and glowing in a golden flaming aura, though it looked different from what she knew, it was moving like a flame, but also, had golden lightning bolts flashing around it. It was very jagged and at the same time, it didn't look as stiff as the x7 aura's electric-like peaks<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoana tried to catch Blake in her hand, but he dodged her effortlessly, jumping to another skyscraper, as the one he was before was destroyed by Joana's attempt. Blake said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You know, despite what teachers say, you can learn useful things from videogames... such as God of War...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Huh?\"- Joana knew some things about what was that game about, but she didn't get what he meant, and tried to catch him with both hands, Blake dodged her again and started running on her hand, her forearm, and her arm<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"It taught me to fight gigantic opponents...\"- Blake said with a smile, and disappeared, only reappearing besides Joana's right ear, and he whispered -\"Your size may give you power... but it'll also make difficult for you to catch me...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoana blushed because of the tingling feeling and that Blake was whispering to her ear, and got temporarily distracted, a chance that Blake got, and disappeared again, only to reappear in front of her belly, and punched it, again, with amazing force. Joana fell to her knees and doubled in pain, while Blake stood on her head, and got out of nowhere a white flag with a \"V\" sign, and seemingly stuck it in the ground, although it just got stuck to her hair. Blake gave Jak a thumbs up, and said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I'm awesome!!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Joana flicked him away with her index finger, and sent him with a force even greater than his own, sending him at least a mile away and through many buildings. Blake stood up, and cupped his hands, then he drew them toward his left side, and said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You can't beat this awesomeness!!\"- He fired a massive golden-reddish kamehameha at the girls, although only hitting Joana, Jasmine took Jak in her hand and dodged it. The explosion was massive, and at least twice as powerful as a nuclear bomb's<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Whoah... If my calculations are correct, I'm wielding a power greater than that of Blaze or my dark jerk... Damn, it had to be a dream...\"- Blake had started the phrase with an enthusiastic tone, but ended it with a \"Meh\" attitude, disappointed of being just a dream, although he remembered, he could still do anything he wanted<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoana stood up one again, and fixed her bikini, as well as her whole appearance, as the kamehameha still charred her immense body, she looked at Jasmine for a moment, and nodded, then, both girls started to grow even more... to about 1,400 feet tall... even Blake had a D8 face, the girls had never grown to such sizes, although he was aware that since none of the city was real, they exploited the same \"Screw the rules, this is a dream\" principle Blake did...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Alright, now I'm officially screwed...\"- Blake muttered, but he also said -\"What would Kratos do in sch a situation?\"- Blake thought, and he imagined Kratos killing them in an overly bloody and violent manner too gory to be further described in this story... 'Meh... I don't wanna kill my girlfriend... just not let her have her way with me...' Blake gulped at the thought... At normal size made him nervous... if Joana kept that size... well... Blake was already writing his last will...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, he said -\"At least I won't go down without a fight... until the end...\"- Blake charged up more his golden aura, tightening his muscles to such an insane extent that the muscular fibers were visible from Blake's skin, also, the veins around his head and torso were very visible... Blake was using the aura at 15 times (54,000) and charged up another Kamehameha, but he put as much energy as possible in it... He fired a massive beam, which was just like 1 inch wide to the girls, again, it only hit Joana, who underestimated the blast, and was caught in an insane explosion, Blake wondered<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I did it?' The smoke vanished, and the presence of a not so charred Joana answered Blake's question... And he was breathing very heavily,, even for a dream, he was pushing the limits, and fell to his knees, very exhausted, and said between pants -\"Worst... dream... ever...\"- Joana grabbed him with two fingers, as he was about less than 1cm to her (more accurately, about 7 millimeters in height). Joana smiled, and Blake gulped loudly, knowing that he not only probably pissed off his girlfriend, but also pissed her off in a world where she could grow to insane sizes... Blake closed his eyes, and expected her to shrink and drag him to the wedding... but, an epxlosion was heard, and someone dragged Blake away, he opened his eyes, and saw his dark side holding his arm while flying away...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You can't fly even here, how pathetic...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Y-y-you?!! What the Hell?!! Why are you here?!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"That's how you thank me after I just saved you from your impending doom?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Well... uhh... yeah... you're the last being I'd expect to save me... Even Blaze saving me is not that unlikely, as he wants me alive for some wicked and evil reason...\"- <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Well, I saved you!!\"- Demon Blake said -\"Despite I'd enjoy seeing you suffer, I can't let you have your stupid self destroyed... I'm too awesome to die because of you!!\"- <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Whatever... hey!! How come you are here?!! Aren't you inside my soul? How the hell did you manage to appear here on your own?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"The same way you pulled off a power that surpasses Blaze's by a lot...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"By stupidity and lack of sense?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Yeah... No!!! Because I'm awesome!!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"The more you say it the more annoying it becomes...\"- Blake mumbled<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Whatever!!\"- Dark Blake said -\"So, go and play some games, let the real man handle this...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Huh?\"- Blake was confused by what Demon Blake said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Just go and play some damn PS3 videogame!!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What about Jak?!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"He's already playing...\"- Demon Blake sighed, and pointed to the blockbuster they had been previously playing at.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Alright...\"- Blake transformed to his base state and went to play some more DBZ Raging Blast 2, and let Demon Blake do whatever he was going to do...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n5 minutes later...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Hey!! Why did I trust him?!!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Because you don't want to be r...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"TEH WORD!!\"- Blake shouted, reminding Jak of not saying it<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Oops... well, I didn't say it...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"That was close... next time we might have some nasty 4Kids agents or something...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"But they don't ow this dream!!\"- Jak replied<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Try telling them that... it's like telling Sony to admit that they just screwed up by their own stupidity... or like telling the girls we're not gonna be their toys...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I know...\"- Jak scratched the back of his head<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Still... I don't trust my dark jerk... let's see what is he doing...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake and Jak walked out of the Blockbuster and went to the top of a very tall skyscraper's roof. They watched Joana giggling while Jasmine was trying to seemingly catch a fly, that the guys identified as Blake's dark version... He had been tickling Joana, and after dodging Jasmine's hands several times, he flew right into Joana's cleavage, and Joana laughed harder. Jak had an o_O' face while a vein popped in Blake's forehead and transformed into his light form (2x, 'standard form') and with a closed fist in front of his face, he shouted<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Hey!! How dare you to play with my girlfriends' breasts?!!\"- <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Do it yourself then!!\"- Demon Blake replied from inside Joana's now (well, it was already, but now to a greater scale) large cleavage, while laughing madly...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake facepalmed himself, and Jak noticed he blushed a lot. Then he asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What are we going to do?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I have no idea...\"- Blake replied</span></div></div>",

Blake was standing in front of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Whoah, that was fast...\"- Blake said, and Jak replied<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Actually, he took over 15 minutes to come here...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I was being sarcastic...\"- Blake replied, facepalming himself again<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Hey, I was knocked out, then I went to eat something, and flew toward here after I was donee...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I thought demons didn't need to eat...\"- Blake said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Well, this is a dream, right? Anyway, I always wanted to see what's eating like... Those sandwiches at that restaurant with a big M are actually nice...\"- D. Blake pointed to a McDonald's, while Blake and Jak had D8 faces, as well as being grossed at him liking such a thing<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Do you like McDonald's?!\"- Jak asked to Blake, and he replied with a vein popped in his forehead<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Of course not!! That stupid dark jerk has nothing to do with me!! Anyway, McDonald's is evil...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"So, that's why their food tasted so good...\"- D. Blake said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Shut up... stupid personification of darkness...\"- Blake mumbled<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I'm cooler than you\"- D. Blake replied, and Jak laughed, but then gasped, and they quickly dodged an incoming colossal hand, belonging to Joana, who destroyed the building in her attempt to catch them. Blake asked (standing on top of another building)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Now what?!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Get the hell outta here!!\"- D. Blake replied<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"We can get back to the PS3, there the girls are no match for us...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Alright\"- Blake jumped toward Jak and Demon Blake, and the three rushed toward the Blockbuster, unfortunately, Jasmine stomped on it to prevent them from getting inside again, and Blake fell to his knees, shouting<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"NOO!!!\"- Blake looked down, while still kneeling down, and said -\"That was a very nice PS3... It played its last game... If heaven's fair, that PS3 is gonna have the most awesome graphics ever... and it'll be unbreakable... May God have mercy on that poor console...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Isn't God a girl?\"- D. Blake asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Anyway, that PS3 was not real...\"- Jak said, and Blake glared at them with an \"I'll kill you\" look, and said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You two JUST HAD to RUIN the moment!!\"- Blake said, and stood up, unknown to him, Joana tried to catch him again, but D. Blake moved very fast and dragged him away by the arm. Jak and Blake had O.O expressions, while another building collapsed<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Don't get me wrong... I just did it because I can't let anyone destroy your stupid body... because that would kill me as well, and I'm too awesome to die... If someone kills your soul, good luck with that...\"- D. Blake looked away while saying that<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Well, we have to escape somewhere else...\"- Blake said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Where?\"- Jak asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Anywhere away from here!! If the girls were honest and this isn't other of their mind games, we only need to stall things until all of us wake up...\"- Blake said, and Jak started flying, D. Blake followed him, holding Blake by his right arm, and he said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Be thankful. I shouldn't bother helping someone so lame that can't even fly in a dream...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"How long will you keep repeating that?!!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Uhmm... let me think... yeah...\"- D. Blake seemed to be calculating, then he said -\"Forever!!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I hate you\"- Blake mumbled<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Well, I'm better than you in all possible ways. Live with it\"- D. Blake answered<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"When I finally learn to fly, I'm going to punch you so much...\"- Blake said angrily<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Keep dreaming... oh wait, you are!!\"- D. Blake said, and Jak couldn't help but laugh<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Does it make you feel better to humiliate me?\"- Blake asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Yep. Does it make you feel better to question me?\"- D. Blake said, and Blake sighed<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Nope...\"- Blake said in defeat -\"But you're the worst subconscious thing ever...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Well... I can fly, sucka\"- D. Blake replied, and Blake facepalmed himself with his free hand. Meanwhile, the girls had started to get the hang of their powers at such sizes, and appeared all of sudden in front of the guys, which scared the hell out of them, even D. Blake...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJak and D. Blake turned around and flew at maximum speed, but Jasmine appeared in front of them, and D. Blake aimed his hand charging up a black energy ball at Jak's head, saying<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"One more move and you'll have a headless boyfriend!!\"- <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Aw, c'mon. Do you really think you can threaten us?\"- Jasmine replied<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You're so small now that I might destroy you with just a sneeze\"- Joana said, from behind them<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJak and Blake had OoO faces at that statement, both because it'd be creepy, and because it makes them really pathetic compared to them, however, D.

It will make a huge energy ball, which will be-\u201c<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m going to shop with Karina, I\u2019ll be back\u2026\u201d</b><br>\r\n\u2018I don\u2019t exactly remember what happened\u2026\u2019Joana thought, \u2018But I know I have to stop them from firing that blast, and unfuse them. \u2018 Suddenly,  Joana felt a weird feeling, like she was being restored. \u2018Oh no, we\u2019re waking up\u2026This is not good. I need a strategy.\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d Jakle said, laughing \u201cToo afraid to move?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoana simply, turned around, and started to fly toward Jasmine to formulate yet another plan.  At their current size, Joana thought that the force from her and Jasmine\u2019s fists would possibly break-up Jak, Blake, and D-Blake back to their selves.<br>\r\n\u201cThey have gotten too powerful\u2026\u201d Jasmine said. \u201cWe might not be able to beat them this time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot exactly\u2026\u201d Joana said, \u201cThey are busy making a Spirit Bomb.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAha\u2026\u201d Jasmine said. \u201cThat\u2019s going to take them awhile. At our size, they need to gather lots of energy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow do you know-\u201c Joana said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI and Jak have watched our share of DBZ.\u201d Jasmine smiled. \u201cBut we should be able to do this\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Joana said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFollow my lead.\u201d Jasmine said. \u201cAnd we have to be quick, were about to wake up soon.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoana and Jasmine made fake clones of themselves to keep themselves incognito, and that Jakle wouldn\u2019t suspect anything. And since Jakle was cocky, the clones were perfect.  Jasmine and Joana lowered their energies so they wouldn\u2019t be detected. Jakle was beating up the clones effortlessly while charging up the Spirit Bomb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is pathetic!\u201d  Jakle said. \u201cShow some effort ladies!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoana and Jasmine then was ready to try and punch Jakle\u2019s lights out, and the clones were finally defeated, and Jakle was halfway done charging the Spirit Bomb. <br>\r\n\u201cGuess they finally gave up,\u201d Jakle said.  \u201cI was going to make this bigger, but you\u2019re smaller now, so\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot just yet!\u201d Jasmine and Joana said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWTF?\u201d Jakle said, as the two gigantic fists collided with each other, Jakle in-between them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe force was so great, the Potaras broke, and the fusion canceled, therefore having Jak, Blake, and D-Blake back to their regular selves\u2026.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNO WAY!!!!\u201d Blake said. \u201cNO WAY SHOULD THAT HAPPEN!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDarn it\u2026\u201d Jak said. \u201cSo close\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou guys are screwed\u2026\u201d D-Blake said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI thought we were all in this together!\u201d Jak said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry, but daddy has to lookout for his self.\u201d  D-Blake vanished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat Jerk!\u201d Blake said. \u201cHe\u2019s going to die one of these days\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot our problem now\u2026\u201d Jak said. \u201cWe have to take care of them- Blake, the Spirit Bomb, it\u2019s still up there!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re right.\u201d Blake said. \u201cI\u2019ll finish making it\u2026.STALL THEM.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJak looked up at the 1500 ft. girls. He was slightly enticed by Jasmine\u2019s legs, which he drooled at.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJasmine\u2019s legs\u2026wow!\u201d Jak said. \u201cThey go on for days. But-\u201c Jak then transformed, \u201cI got to help finish Spirit Bomb.\u201d<br>\r\n <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Then, seven pillars made of golden light fell from above, spinning continuously around the pyramids<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Whoah...\"- Jak mumbled<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I can't even perform this spell in real life, but here, it is fully powered and with my aura at 10 times, this has to be one of the most powerful shields I know...\"- Blake said, then resumed raising both hands in the sky, and Jak nodded, he flew toward Jasmine, and fired several energy balls, but their little explosions were nothing to her. Jasmine smiled, and said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Why bothering with trying to hurt me? All I wanted was t get some quality time with you...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJak gulped, and blushed a lot, but he shook the emerging thoughts off and put his hands together, firing a large Omega Buster beam, which only stung Jasmine's skin slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"This is just not my day...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJasmine tried to grab him, but a powerful blue energy ball hit her hand, creating a large explosion, and this one managed to burn her. Jak turned to see nobody other than Gogeta, who had just fired a Big Bang Attack<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Gogeta?! Awesome!!\"- Jak was surprised to see him, and also asked -\"What are you doing here?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Well... it seems that someone stole the Potara earrings...\"- <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake and Jak whistled, pretending innocence...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"So Goku and Vegeta had to do the Fusion Dance to beat Majin Buu... thus, here I am...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Oh... well... How long have you been fused?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Less than 1 minute...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Good. I need help... as you must've already noticed...\"- Jak said, pointing at the giant girls<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I also noticed that your friend is doing the Spirit Bomb...\"- Gogeta said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Yeah, why?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Nothing. Just that he will owe Goku 10,000 bucks...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What?!\"- Jak and Blake had O.O faces when they heard this<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Copyright stuff... But that's Goku's business, I don't care...\"- Gogeta said -\"But don't worry, that's his own matter. I'm here to kick ass and destroy villains, and I'm all out of villains...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"My wallet hurts already...\"- Blake commented, while still charging up the Spirit Bomb inside the shields he created -\"Whatever, since this is a dream, I'll get the money later... So... help me stall them!!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGogeta and Jak nodded, and flew toward Jasmine, but Joana intervened, and tried to punch Jak, but Gogeta stopped her fist with a single hand, then, he fired a Big Bang Kamehameha, which caused a large explosion and caused Joana to fall down. Meanwhile, the Spirit Bomb floated very high in the sky, and was still growing. Blake would need a lot of energy to make it really effective. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoana fired an energy ball at Blake, but the powerful barrier he created proved its worth, destroying the energy blast and taking no damage (the 7 spinning light pillars did the most). However, Joana didn't give up, and charged up a beam, but then, she was struck by a red beam that sent her flying away several miles, as well as creating a huge explosion. Much to everyone's surprise, Godzilla appeared once again...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Godzilla?! Weren't you in Sydney?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Yeah, but it seems that our previous beams blew it up, so, there was nothing left when I arrived, good thing people sighted me and thought I destroyed it all, hehe...\"- The king of the monsters replied, not intimidated even when the girls were 5 times his own size (Girls - 1,500 ft, Godzilla - 330 ft)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Well... I'm charging the most powerful energy ball ever, but I need all of you to keep fighting them...\"- Blake said, Jak and their two allies nodded in agreement. Just then, a green fireball struck Jasmine, who had just gotten up, causing an insane burn, and she fixed her appearance and clothing once again<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Jak!! How long will you keep destroying my bikini?!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, everyone had the feeling that an incredible presence had just come in, and out of the shadows, stepped someone... dressed in green with overalls... wearing a cap with a characteristic \"L\" letter. Jak's eyes were like little starts by this moment, and raising his fist, he said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"This is the best dream ever!! Now we're invincible!! Again!!\"-</span></div></div>",

His clothes changed into green overalls, and a white shirt. He then dashed toward Joana and started to fire a barrage of fireballs. Gogeta continued to fire Ki Blasts at Jasmine. Jak was having a hard time trying to damage Jasmine, but to no avail it wasn't working. Gogeta fired a quick Big-Bang Kamehameha at Joana.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm.\" Jak said. \"Let me try this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJak closed his eyes, and started to power up even more. His white aura got more intense and lightning bolts started to appear, and the pervious transformation was more calm-like, smooth and flowing. Jak then opened his eyes, and he felt something; His energy output was multiplied fourfold, such that greater amounts of the increased energy capacity can be used at once.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright!\" Jak said, looking at himself, this is awesome. \"Omega Form 2 much?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJak then flew toward Jasmine, starting to battle her. He landed near her shoulder, and whispered in her left ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, you really look attractive in this size, Jas.\" Jak said, and then flew to her other ear at a amazing speed. \"Even though you want to R'd me, I just want to say one thing...I Love you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJasmine blushed at this, and her face got cherry-red, she was excited that Jak was being so passionate about his words. Jak turned around, and hoped that the 3 allies were taking advantage of the situation. Luigi was charging a blast in his two gloved hands, while Gogeta was charging a Final Kamehameha(Combination of Final Flash and the Kamehameha Wave), and Godzilla was preparing for a huge atomic flame breath to fire. Jak could tell they needed a little more time, and then Jak charged up even more. Jasmine was almost recovering from her blushing episode, till Jak kissed her. (As much as he could) Jasmine\u2019s eyes widened, and then she closed her eyes. Jak charged up high enough so that she could feel it, and he was charging an attack as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJak, get out of there!\u201d The 3 allies said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJak quickly flew down to Gogeta, Godzilla, and Luigi, and formed two energy balls in each of his hands. He pumped a lot of energy into them, and then said;<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI call this one, the Omega Presser,\u201d Jak said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, Luigi sent a spiral shaped green flame, Gogeta fired his Final Kamahameha, and Godzilla sent his now Greenish-Red Atomic Breath, toward Jasmine. Jak fired the Omega Presser, and the 4 beams (5 if you count the other energy ball from Jak) combined into one large one, and it created a huge explosion, which made Jasmine topple over. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBlake\u2026\u201d Jak said, \u201cHow\u2019s the Spirit Bomb coming along\u2026.?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

After a bit more of struggling, Jasmine managed to deflect it, only to be hit by Gogeta's Kamehameha. Then Jak looked, searching for Joana, and noticed that she was approaching Blake, but she was caught off-guard, and was struck by one of Luigi's green fireballs and Godzilla's atomic breath. The explosion was enormous, although Blake was perfectly safe inside his barrier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJak, who was amazed at looking the action, was caught in Jasmine's hand, and she brought him near her lips, whispering<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"So... you were saying you liked this size...\"- Jak gulped, and as he was blushing, he felt his powers weakening, but Gogeta appeared and snatched him away from her, while Luigi connected an incredible Super Jump Punch, sending her very high into the sky, Jak and even Gogeta had O-O faces, then the realization of what really happened dawned to Jak, and he shouted, while running frantically<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Get.. THE HELL... out of here!!!\"- As Jak left with amazing speed, Gogeta and Luigi were confused and Jak came back, and said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Giant girl is going to fall from insane height... Unless you don't value your lives, I'd suggest leaving...\"- He ran again, getting as far as possible, though Gogeta and Luigi caught up with him, and he facepalmed himself for forgetting he could fly. Blake had a scared expression, as he couldn't move because of the Spirit Bomb. He could only wait, and gulped when he noticed Joana approaching again, charging a huge (to everyone, standard sized for her) white energy ball. The moment she took another step, Jasmine fell on her, and the shockwave was definitively insanely strong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom near a mile away, Jak, Gogeta and Luigi watched, Godzilla was still near but surprisingly, he didn't move an inch. They noticed Blake's barrier was still intact which meant that he was still ok. Jak and his two allies rushed toward the giant girls before they recovered, and Godzilla went ahead firing another atomic breath at them. But Jasmine managed to grab him by the neck, and started squeezing (Think of single handed version of Homer Simpson's 'Why you Little...!!' ), while Joana also got up and cracked her knuckles, and she punched... but not Godzilla... she punched Gogeta, as she had predicted they'd come to help, and the fused Saiyan was struggling against the giant girl's fist, and with her other hand, Joana fired several beams at Luigi and Jak, who dodged all of them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuigi used his green missile technique to tackle Jasmine, and quickly recovered, firing a large green fireball at Joana, which distracted her, allowing Gogeta to appear before her and punch her in the stomach. Jasmine was trying to get up, and said to Joana<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Maybe we need to grow even more...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I'm not sure... if we grow more they might be microscopic to us...Even I wouldn't go that far...\"- Joana said, while brushing off rubble<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Do you want some action with your boyfriend or not?\"- Jasmine asked in a somewhat angry tone<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Well... Yeah...\"- Joana looked down, blushing a lot. This conversation surprised Gogeta, who asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Are these girls your girlfriends?!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Uh...N-Yeah...\"- Jak replied -\"Why?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Let me get this right... you and your friend were going out with these giant evil girls?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Umm... they aren't ALWAYS giant... and despite what Blake will say, they aren't really evil...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake was about to say something but kept shut up, anyway, nobody was paying attention so far, so, he decided he better didn't ruin it...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Then why are we fighting them?\"- Gogeta asked, and Jak whispered to his ear, it seemed to be quite a lot of things, after Jak was done, Gogeta asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You got to be kidding me...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Nope, that's the truth...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Then how old are you guys?\"- Gogeta asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"We're both 17\"- Jak knew Blake would likely be extremely mad if he told the truth<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"17?! That's underage!!\"- Gogeta charged another big bang kamehameha and fired it at the just recovered girls. And while the immense explosion disspiated, Godzilla came next to them and before he said anything, everyone felt a small quake, that corresponded to Joana stomping on the ground, and her voice was heard<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Blake IS NOT 17!!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGogeta gave Jak a \u00ac_\u00ac look, and Godzilla said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I was going to tell you that, but regardless of anything, these guys don't seem to want such a thing... even I know humans are truly mature until after 20's...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Well... putting it that way, I guess I can't blame you... I know the consequences of marrying and that stuff... Stupid Kakarot lets his wife beat him up despite being one of the strongest warriors in the freakin' universe...\"- Gogeta said with his arms crossed, Blake and Jak were really surprised by Gogeta acknowledging such a thing. Then, he felt an increase in the two already massive energies, and the girls were growing beyond their already insane huge size, but Luigi snapped his fingers, and the girls fell face first to the ground, and found they couldn't move as easily. Jak was deeply amazed, and asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What did you do?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I added Brawl physics to this fight... so... their size will no longer be a threat, unless they shrink to about 50 or less feet... larger sizes are very impractical so, if applied here, the girls won't be able to move much unless they shrink... I wonder how can they do that without mushrooms...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Long story. But thanks. You're awesome\"- Jak said, and shook Luigi's hand. Just then, everyone heard Blake's voice, who said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Get OUT OF THE WAY!!\"- Jak, Luigi, Godzilla and Gogeta reacted very quickly, while the girls (who didn't hear Luigi's explanation) were struggling to merely stand up, and when they managed to kneel, they noticed a very tiny silhouette below a huge bluish energy ball. Blake said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I'll send you to the next world with this...\"- Blake was about to throw the Spirit Bomb, when Gogeta pointed his finger at him accusingly<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"HEY!! That's MY phrase!!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Whatever...\"- Blake launched the gigantic Spirit Bomb toward the girls, and they struggled against it... and it seemed they were successful, and Blake said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What?! It's supposed to work against evil!!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I'm guessing these girls aren't really evil, are they?\"- Gogeta said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"EXACTLY!!\"- Joana replied, still pushing the gigantic Spirit Bomb away along Jasmine<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"But you want to do something evil!!\"- Jak said, and strangely, as if the Spirit Bomb itself heard, started pushing the girls with greater force, then Blake remembered the Majin Buu saga, and transformed into his light state x7, and began using his enhanced energy to help the Spirit Bomb. Jak also noticed this and gave Blake a thumbs up<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Nice idea\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I know...\"- Blake then transformed into the x10 form, which increased the force he was using to push the Spirit Bomb, but it was still inferior to the girls'. Jak then fired an Omega Buster at Jasmine, while Gogeta and Luigi followed by firing a Kamehameha and a barrage of green fireballs respectively. Jasmine coughed smoke again, and complained<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Why are all of you attacking me?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I guess you're right\"- Jak said, shrugging, and they attacked Joana this time, who just glared at Jasmine and at them. While Blake was using every ounce of energy to push the Spirit Bomb, and noticed that its energy was already burning the girls' hands slightly. Then a dark purple beam struck the girls from above, while two black beams struck Joana and Jasmine from left and right sides, respectively. Then, three known bad guys appeared, Blake and Jak had O-O faces, and Blake shouted angrily<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What the hell are YOU doing here?!!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I noticed you have a party and I'm mad at you for not inviting us...\"- Blaze replied<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"IhateyousomuchIhateyousomuchIhateyousomuch...\"- Blake mumbled, then he said -\"This is NONE of your business!!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Of course it is. I know these girls want to...\"- Blaze said, and a golden energy ball hit his mouth, and Blake said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You can't say the following word... whatever... why would YOU of all people interested about this?!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Because you need to remain pure to serve as the key of destruction...\"- Blaze answered<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Blake and Jak had O///O WTF? faces at Blaze's statement, and Jak laughed after some seconds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"That has to be the lamest excuse ever...\"- Jak said, laughing<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"So... if I agree to what my girlfriend wants, your plans will be screwed?\"- Blake asked, which surprised Jak and the girls as well, who lost concentration and up to their forearms got engulfed into the energy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Not really. It's just a plot device... I'm just part of this nonsensical dream, you know...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake's answer was to blow his head with a golden beam, unsurprisingly, Blaze regenerated, and said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You want my help or not?\"-</span></div></div>",

He shot another Omega Buster near Jasmine's left knee, and this caused her to kneel down, but on her left knee. The Spirit Bomb was starting to over power Jasmine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice work, Jak!\" Blake said. \"If we can get them to kneel down, we should be able to win this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, good job in indeed.\" Seth said. \"You're getting more battle smarts from this dream.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No one asked you, so you can-\" Jak started, but Nostory appeared in front of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen,\" Nostory said. \"I know how much you want to get a rematch with me and prove your worth, but if you don't focus on defeating your cow of a girlfriend right now-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HEY!!!\" Jasmine said, with a D:&lt; expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You might die, and you'll get-\" Nostory said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine.\" Jak said. \"AND MY GIRLFRIEND'S not a cow!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGogeta then felt a bit strange.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa,\" Gogeta said, \"I'm starting to fade...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is the fusion wearing off?\" Blake said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, it's like, I'm starting to disappear.\" Gogeta said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me too,\" Luigi said. \"What's going on?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just put all of your energy into one strong attack!\" Blake said, realizing what's going on. \"Luigi, Gogeta,and Godzilla do it!!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuigi was preparing for another fireball explosion, except this time, a barrage of them were coming. Gogeta was charging a 100x Big-Bang Kamehameha, and Godzilla was sucking in all the air he possibly could, and was planning for one more atomic breath, but also cupping his hands, prepping a Kamehameha wave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NOW!\" Blake said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three fired, and the beams once again combined, culminating onto beam that got Jasmine leaning back, and holding the beam. Joana wasn't damaged as heavily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice!\" Jak said. Good Job-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen suddenly, Luigi, Gogeta and Godzilla vanished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Crud.\" Jak said. \"Nostory, and Seth, Get over here for a minute, you too Blaze.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it?\" Blaze said. \"We're starting to vanish too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright.\" Jak said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then charged a white beam in his right hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I need you guys to put your strong beams into this energy ball.\" Jak said. \"Then, I need you three to keep rotating it, until you guys vanish, ok?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Got it.\" The three villains said in unison. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNostory, Blaze and Seth pumped their energies into the ball, and the started to rotate it, the ball was similar to the Rensagan. After a few minutes, the ball was ready, and Jak powered back up to OF2 (Omega Form 2)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good Luck.\" Blaze said. \"I hope you guys survive.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks?\" Jak said, his aura very intense.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We just want to kill you guys ourselves...\" Nostory said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course...\" Jak said, rolling his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See ya.\" Seth said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze, Nostory, and Seth vanished, and Jak, Blake, Jasmine, and Joana were left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Joana!\" Jak said, and then he flew toward her at a awesome speed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe charged right into her gut, and hit her perfectly. Joana was tipping backwards, and she was like Jasmine, almost on her back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NICE!\" Blake said, \"Get over here by me, I don't want to risk hurting you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJak flew over to Blake, but then reverted to normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ready for the finale?\" Blake said, smiling, and then went x15. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake then was able to push the giant blast, forcing it to tumble on the girls, both falling down, and the ball created a huge super nuke like explosion, sending Jak and Blake back a good distance, and they both flew far. After a while, they both were able to recover, but barely had any energy left, but were able to stand up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great Job...\" Jak raised his hand for a high five from Blake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem...\" Blake hit Jak's hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look,\" Jak said. \"The environment is starting to melt...Dream's almost over.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good!\" Blake said, \"All we need to do is-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"oh...b-b-boys....\" Two too familiar voices called.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh crap....\" Jak said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe buildings all melted, only to reveal two giant girls crawling toward Jak and Blake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, they must be gased too.\" Jak said. \"They're crawling.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know but still, they are huge...\" Blake said. \"We've come too far for us to fail-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, out of nowhere, a portal from a good distance appeared, and there a neon sign that read:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size5\" style=\"\"><span style=\"font-family:impact, fantasy\"><span class=\"clred\">To Wake Up, You gotta get into this here portal!</span></span></font><br>\r\n<br>\r\n <br>\r\nJak and Blake looked at each other, then at the portal, and then at their GF's. They then dashed toward the portal, hoping they could beat the clock, Jasmine and Joana knew they were almost out of time too, so if the boys got into that portal, the r'd plan was history.</span></div></div>",

It is called Shoshitsu, and it's a very fast move. So far all of us have used the Godspeed technique, which uses raw strength, this one uses energy... And if with the aura at 7 times it was able to keep up with Blaze and Aizen, I bet at 15 times it can get us out of here...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"So, will you teach me or something?\"- Jak asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Does it look like we have time?! We have to do THIS!!\"- Blake grabbed Jak's wrist and both of them vanished, and while the girls had been able to predict or sense where they were, this time they were too fast even for them. Blake and Jak reappeared in front of the portal, and Blake said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Good\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Whoah... too much speed... so much speed...\"- Jak was feeling dizzy, and had a hard time keeping his balance<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Aw, c'mon!! It didn't even last a second...\"- Blake then looked at the portal -\"Well, I guess this is it...I wonder why it had to be so flashy...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"So we could see it?\"- Jak asked, and now looked better, although a little pale<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Hey! You recovered, good!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Well, after vomiting my stomach... I can't be much worse, right?...\"- Jak said, and Blake stared at him blankly<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Just kidding...\"- Jak said, and extended his hand to touch the portal. It felt cold, and like some sort of gelatine -\"Weeird...\"- He said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"It can't be creepier than what our gf's had in store for us... and speaking of them...\"- Blake noticed the girls were running towards them, Blake cupped his hands in an already known pose, and said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Awesome Kamehameha!!\"- And fired a powerful blue beam that exploded in contact with the girls. -\"NOW WE can get out\"- Blake said, and walked into the portal, Jak followed as well... Some seconds later, the girls dashed toward it too...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake opened his eyes, and yawned quietly... then he realized where he was sleeping, and facepalmed himself... 'I totally forgot where I was sleeping... I am so dead...' He thought, and expected Joana to be mad as hell... Then he felt compressed by everything around him<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Just my luck...!!' Joana was stretching a bit while waking up, inadvertently pressing on Blake with her flesh, which surrounded him, as he was in her cleavage... Then, after rubbing her eyes, she picked Blake with two fingers and stared at him, he gulped loudly, and mumbled<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Dammit... there is no awesomeness around... curse you, reality!!\"- Blake then looked at Joana, and felt that he would be in a world of hurt (or pleasure? at least for Joana...) by her look. He clutched his hands together and muttered<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Lith, wherever the hell you are, I need your help more than any other time I've asked, not that I've asked too often... and forgive Joana, as I'm not forgiving her myself... And lead me not into rape, but deliver me from Joana... like... now!!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoana stared at him with a raised eyebrow, as it was obvious what was Blake afraid of, and that his way of praying wasn't certainly the best... (Well, what can you expect from a guy who didn't really believe into supernatural stuff until Blaze appeared?)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Don't bother saying it... I am SO screwed right now...\"- Blake looked down, knowing his \"praying\" had little to no effect... but he still had the feeling that Lith was giggling wherever she was...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Why are you always so pessimistic?\"- Joana asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Well, because I assume you're mad as hell...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I certainly have reasons to be like that...\"- Joana said, giginv Blake a somewhat evil and yet sexy look, Blake didn't even know how to react, and he replied<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What can you expect?! I said I wasn't ready when I was 16... I said again I wasn't ready at 17, and I've already stated that I'm not ready...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"At 18...\"- Joana completed the phrase <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Well... yeah...\"- Blake said, scratching the back of his head while laughing nervously<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Blake... this is not something you need to be ready for... you have to put intelligence and logic away for a moment... You might become 60 and say you're still not ready at this rate...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Ouch...\"- Blake muttered, obviously insulted <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I just don't know what to do!! And I feel like I'm doing something wrong...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You don't have to know, you just have to let your instincts act for a while...\"- Joana said, and Demon Blake smiled inside Blake's soul, to which Blake muttered<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Shut up!!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Huh?!\"- Joana didn't expect something like that, and stared at Blake with a confused look<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Not you... my inner jerk... now he feels he's mighty and great... and wants you for himself...\"- Blake said looking down, however, Joana blushed, as she was aware that Demon Blake was Blake's own instincts, although separated from his personality for most of the time... although, by what little Blake said about him, he seems to be a lot more of a perv than Blake would ever be (He's no pervert, which is a bit strange for a boy that grew up in streets)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Well, Blake, given that you never use your instincts, and rely on logic, then... you've told me before that you always see through people's intentions, so, tell me, didn't you see through mine?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Wha-what the hell you're talking about?!!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Didn't you see through...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Your attempts at raping me?\"- Blake completed Joana's question this time<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"No... uh... well... yeah...\"- Joana looked away, a bit ashamed<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What ELSE can be there?!!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Why would I try to 'do it' in a dream?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Because you're crazy and have weird powers?\"- Blake replied<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Exactl-I mean NO!!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Then?!! I can't see anything else in that dream other than \u00fcber madness, massive amounts of awesomeness, insane amounts of randomness and some weirdness...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Again, why would I try to 'do it' in a dream?\"- Joana asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Uhmm... I have no idea...\"-  Blake replied, and Joana brought him closer to her face, and said in a softer tone<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Because I thought you'd be more willing to 'do it' if it was just a dream... also... since there's nothing really physical, it would be completely safe...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake had a O///O face, and nearly fainted, but Joana kept him from falling with her pinky finger<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"So, now you get it why did I want to?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I still don't agree!! You tried to rape me!!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I even tried to make it 'legal'... but you escaped from the marriage...\"- Joana replied<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You never answered why and how did you drag me into your dream?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"It was OUR dream. You had almost as much control over it as I had... and I said it before, I didn't really meant to, I was just thinking about you while I went to sleep...\"- Joana's answer sounded somewhat cute, but Blake said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Why would you think about me precisely last night?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I ALWAYS think about you!! It's just that sometimes... well... I think about you in other ways...\"- Joana looked away and blushed madly<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"...Too...much...information...so...much...information...just...too...m uch...\"- Blake said, sounding like he just got a mental BSOD<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I didn't really mean to drag you into our dream, but I was very happy when you said you'd try to be a better boyfriend, and I couldn't help but dream of you...\"- Joana said, while Blake had a @_@ face<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Whoah...Wait, what?!!\"- Blake snapped out of his 'screwed mind' moment<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I just want to really show you my love...\"- Joana ended the phrase with a giant kiss, which Blake enjoyed, despite his previous stance on being 'raped'</span></div></div>",

Jasmine and Jak may come here as well...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Yeah...\"- Blake thought very quickly that it was less likely for Joana to get more playful if they weren't alone... too bad he wasn't keeping in account that his logic had a flaw: Jasmine knew almost perfectly how Joana felt (Who knows, maybe she's even a bit jealous that both of them are 'legal'?... Just my stupid theories...) and wouldn't really mind... at least with Jak Blake had a friend he could trust (And also knows what's to be shrunk like, although Jak actually gets to enjoy it more than Blake does...)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Alright, I'm going to cook something then!!\"- Joana said enthusiastically, and Blake smiled as well. Among the lots of qualities of Joana, one of them was that she was an extremely good cook. (It's not that Blake is really bad, he can be pretty good if he puts effort into it, as he even learned how to make extra delicious pizzas from his father when he was 4. But usually, during the years he lived alone, Blake barely cooked things just enough to make them edible... also, he was limited on gas and ingredients because of having little money...). <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoana put Blake in her cleavage, and pushed him down a bit to hide him, while he mumbled <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Why do you always hide me here?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Where else can I hide you?\"- Joana was waring a white short sleeved blouse, and put on black jeans. Then she said -\"You've said before that you wouldn't like to go in my pockets... or do you want to give them a try?\"- Joana said teasingly, and Blake replied, defeated<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Whatever, you win... I stay here...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Joana opened the door, Lith greeted them, and Blake said from inside Joana's cleavage<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"If you tell me that you spied on us the whole night I SWEAR I'll become atheist and support anything against religion...\"- <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoana and Lith laughed at Blake's threat, not in a mocking way, but both women found it rather cute<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I didn't. I just stayed by...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"And WHY?! Don't you have some celestial chores to do or something?! What kind of goddess plays around while leaving the entire universe unattended?!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You make it sound so dramatic... Nothing will happen because I'm here. Anyway, can't I be near my kid?\"- Lith replied, and she knew, by sensing Blake's energy signature, that he was a bit ashamed, and he still couldn't fully assimilate that he was partially raised by a goddess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I'm 18!! I'm not a kid!!\"- Blake said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Oh, NOW you're 18, aren't you?\"- Joana said a bit sarcastically<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Even if you were 100 years old you'd still be a kid to me\"- Lith giggled, and Blake said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Now that you say it, exactly, how old are you?!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Blake!!\"- Joana thought it was rude, but Lith said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"No problem. I'm not mad for being asked. Now, if you just give me a moment...\"- She was seemingly counting, and after 2 minutes, she replied -\"Exactly, I'm 4,540,052,010 years old...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"5 billion years old?!!! How's THAT EVEN POSSIBLE?!!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Those who were created by Chaos directly are among the most powerful beings in the universe. We don't age, but we're not invincible, and can be killed by someone powerful enough... because of Lucifer, most of Chaos' angels died. The ones I created and the ones born by natural means are less powerful, and age very slowly, but so far, over the course of 50,000 years, they still look in their 20's...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Wow...\"- Blake replied -\"Then, you're almost as old as...?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"The Earth...\"- Lith replied rather joyfully, which might be a bit strange for someone who has lived for SO long -\"I assisted in the creation of many life forms, but I'll tell you those stories later. I know what you want right now\"- A dish with hot-cakes already served, with honey, and butter on top, as well as a glass of cold cappuccino coffee appeared in Lith's left hand, and gave it to Joana<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I know you wanted to cook, but let me give you this little gift this time...\"- Lith said with another n.n face. Joana smiled and nodded...</span></div></div>",

He reached the base of the ship, hoping for a better entrance than the front door.  There wasn't.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Zenn.\" This voice didn't come from his mind.  This was real and nobody he recognized.  He spun around, holding his blades out.  \"I'm not here to fight you.  I only want to help you.\" these words came from none other than Powerman.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is this a trap?\" Zenn's reply gave away his near inability to trust anyone.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That depends, are you my enemy?\" Powerman began trying to look into Zenn's mind but was met with a burning sensation and a high ringing in his ears.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm trying to figure out the same thing.  What's your name?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Powerman.\" Zenn stifled his incoming laughter.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, and I'm Sally.\" he says in a voice so covered in sarcasm it actually had weight.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or you may call me Ryan if it suits you.\" This stopped Zenn in his tracks.  Should he go with him?  Should he do what Jaxx says, or defy like he always tries to?  Powerman walks up to him.  Zenn still holds his blades, ready to kill him if he needs to survive.  Powerman fires a beam, which looks like a lighter version of the one Jaxx uses to shrink him.  Zenn tried to jump away bit was too late.  He felt it hit him and prepared to shrink further.  But, to his surprise he began to grow.  Powerman grew beside him and said, <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on.  Let's take you in.\" He opens a portal and then walks through.  Zenn falters, internally his every fibre of being said something very loudly.  DON'T YOU DARE GO IN THERE!  WHAT IF YOU DIE!?  He stood there for nearly thirty seconds until finally looking at the mid-morning sun, stepped in.</span></div></div>",

Well, it was personal stuff in the way. Don't worry, we'll get back to the story's pace in a while. Don't hate the authors... Or Blaze will pay you a visit and kill your puppies...]</b></font><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a good while, Jak and Blake were laying down on their respective girlfriend's laps. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Best...Breakfast...EVER...\"- Jak said, feeling like about to explode<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I can't believe I could eat that much... Normally I can do with 1 or 2  moderate foods a day...\"- Blake said -\"But this was definitively great...\"- Blake had his eyes closed, so, he was not aware that Joana looked a bit sad, because it seemed that it was way better than her own cooking... and that there was no way she could outdo a goddess... however, Blake added<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"EXCEPT the coffee. It was good, but not nearly as good as Joana's coffee...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoana smiled, while Jak and Jasmine didn't really pay attention to the comment. Jak was slightly worried because of two things, his inner dark side, and what Jasmine said about feeling sadistic, which he didn't insist upon to not make her angry. Though this raised a low warning in his subconscious... maybe he would tell Blake about it later (Blake doesn't remember anything from his first fusion transformation, which he used to beat Nostory, Blaze, Seth and damage heavily Yasmin)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake on the other side was a bit worried because of Zenn, who he thinks has something to do with Blaze. His dark side hasn't been a threat in a while, and being in the spaceship, he felt safe. He also felt that Lith was somewhere not too far, and that if Blaze dared to appear again, she'd come to help. Blake didn't want to admit it, but he felt safe knowing Lith was close. He also felt thankful because of the Ryans, who were immensely powerful, and could face their enemies with no problem, depsite Blake knew that Blaze was his own battle, and that he'd have to beat him himself... some day... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Blake looked thoughtfully at the ceiling, he wondered about many things, such as who is really Blaze?, what happened 10,000 years ago in Heaven? why is he the only one who can destroy him? and what does Blaze want him for? why Lith, a goddess, bothered in taking care of him when he was a baby? and why Joana has angel ancestry as well? That last question bothered Blake some more than the rest, because if she had powers similar to his own and Blaze's, well, he didn't want to think about what would happen when she were really mad, or didn't get her way, like in the dream... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat and the fact that it looked like a destined thing saddened him, because he always believed that destiny wasn't written, and that everyone was responsible for their own future. Despite he promised to try to be abetter boyfriend for Joana, that still bothered him. He felt a bit miserable because by how things were explained by Lith, he would've ended up with Joana anyway... Not that he doesn't like being with her, but he always questioned if he was really worth her. Before, Karina and Ayrton were the ones that made him look, and see that Joana was truly happy with him. Now Blake doubted it more than ever...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe also tried to lighten up thinking that surely they'd be forbidden to have children because of their powers... which was actually good news for Blake, who didn't want to think about the things implied in the process of having children... nor about having children. Hell, he didn't even want to be married... being just 18, Blake felt it was too early for such a thing. Maybe at his 30's he may, but Joana probably wouldn't wait for that long...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake was snapped out of his thoughts when Joana petted his head with her index finger, she was looking at him, warm and lovingly. He forgot about the questions in his mind for that moment, and decided to relax. </span></div></div>",

What's that supposed to mean?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Since you implied my girlfriend is someone who is not you, well, I don't have the least remote idea where's that unidentified girl...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"...\"- Joana couldn't beat Blake's argument, and he laughed silently, and said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"That's logic for you...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoana smiled, and picked Blake up, and placed him in her cleavage, and he asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What was that for?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Well, that's seduction for you...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You see? You aren't helping to leave the stereotypes in the past... you can't beat logic with that... and feminists will kill you anyway...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Nah. They won't be more than a little annoyance...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake gulped because of her wording, but he knew, or at least, hoped to Lith, that she was just joking. Still, Blake felt conflicted because a part of him liked it, while the other was telling him not to...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoana saw Jasmine saying she would like to play with Jak, her \"Luigi-boogums\", picked him up and licked him, before putting him in her cleavage, and gave her a thumbs up, and Jasmine said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Works every time\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Same here... sort of...\"- Joana said, still aware that seduction still didn't work fully on Blake, and then there was the bet she had with Karina, but she didn't want to think about that for now. Although she was a bit impatient on getting intimate with Blake, as he was already 18, but had been evading the topic, or anything implying it. His determination to not get married was something a bit contradictory, because Blake had said some times previously, that he couldn't imagine himself with anyone else in any future, but, yet again, he refused to tie the knot, although it was just a dream. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoana didn't fully understand what Blake thought of their relationship, but that was probably the problem, Blake didn't want to think much about their relationship to not take things any further. Also, now that she thought about it, Blake didn't really want to think about the future. By some things he said, Karina deducted Blake was actually afraid of getting older, something a bit strange for a guy who had gone through much worse things, as confirmed by Lith. Karina suggested Blake didn't like the idea of getting old, and he tried not to think about it, until it happened. Karina told Joana not to stop trying to get him to open up his mind, because there's no other way his mind could be healed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKarina herself admitted that it's a natural fear, latent in everyone, but she didn't know why it seemed a bit more intense in Blake, specially being him a guy who acts mature and has taken care of himself for most of his life. Now that Lith has revealed some things Blake would never tell, Joana considered asking Lith more about him. Playfulness aside, she still worried about Blake's mind state, Karina once said that despite having a very thick shell protecting it, it was actually very fragile if hit in the right spot. This was confirmed when Blake snapped nearly completely, when he thought Joana had been killed by Blaze during a training session, which succeeded, and Blake's dark side was unleashed...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, she knew it would take time to help Blake to heal his mind, and she didn't want to think further about it, for now, her boyfriend as alive and well, and in a \"safe place\" at least according to herself. She giggled at the thought, she always liked when Blake was shrunk, though, she could only admit it later, as at the time, Blake was too freaked out about everything, that he could have believed Joana was implying she wouldn't help him to get back to normal. Then, she heard fingers snapping, and saw that it was Jasmine, who said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Did you get lost in your thoughts?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"A bit. But I'm fine... How about you?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I'm good. So, should we go outside, or play with our bf's some more?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoana was thinking about that decision, on one side, she would like to play more with Blake, but she also felt that she should give him a rest from that...</span></div></div>",

Zenn sighed and prepared to fight.  Joana and Jasmine both started to circle him and Zenn chose not to use his powers, assuming that they had very little power beyond the forcefields and a few other light techniques.  The shrunken boys kept their distance and watched.  None of the three attempted to strike.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't want to do this.  We could just not figh-\" Zenn was interrupted by Joana's hand hitting him in the face.  \"Ow.  Alright then.\" Zenn followed with a punch to her stomach and then threw her into Jasmine.  He backed up a bit, not allowing himself to get surrounded.  The two girls came at him again.  He ducked and punch from Jasmine and then blocked one from Joana.  He still felt slightly jarred from Joana's punch and assumed she had augmented strength.  Joana pointed to the spot on her cheek where he cut her.  The girls continued to attack together, leaving Zenn only able to block for a bit.  Finally, he found and opening.  He kicked Jasmine onto the ground and landed a combo of four body blows and two facial hits on Joana.  Jasmine nodded to Joana, who apparently got the idea from that nod.  They both started to grow at the same time.  They capped off at each a bit under twenty feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay then.  That was.... interesting.\" Zenn knew he could beat these two if he didn't let them grow their boyfriends back to their size.  Zenn clenched his fists to catch the blades of fire he formed.  \"Let's get down to business, shall we?\" Joana spoke up.  \"Blake, get your other body.\" one of the shrunken boys ran into the ship.  Zenn thought about how he had found yet another of the names Jaxx had given him.  The girls now attacked much more aggressively and Zenn kept dodging, until Jasmine landed a punch fully to Zenn's chest.  He fell to the ground and seeing the incoming foot, blasted himself away with fire.  While he flew, he threw a fireball that grazed Jasmine's side.  He still didn't use his blades or try to kill them.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething in him told him that they were not his enemies.  He ran up about fourteen feet into the air with his platforms.  The girls kept coming at him and he put his swords away, instead coating his hands with fire.  He punched each of them quickly, throwing them down.  He didn't notice Jasmine slip away towards Jak.  Blake came back in his spare body, doing again that weird transformation, with his hair rising up, and golden glowing eyes, surrounded by a golden fire-like aura, and Jak was now at full size, he transformed as well, surrounded in a white aura...  To make matters worse, both girls grew to about fifty feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't like these odds....\" Zenn was about ready to fire a huge fireball into them and run, until a voice sounded.  The same guy from earlier.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's enough!  He isn't here to fight us.  But since you were willing to fight, I thought I could really see what Zenn here's made of.  He held back, while you attacked him at full power.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPowerman stepped out of the forest.  Zenn breathed a sigh of relief.  Grudgingly, all four reverted to their original forms.</span></div></div>",

But before Blake inserted the DBZ raging Blast 2 disc, Jak showed Blake a Naruto Ultimate Ninja Storm 2 disc, and suggested playing that one instead. Blake replied<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Sure, why not?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake had just played the game twice before, but quickly remembered the necessary combos and stuff to fight almost evenly against Jak's characters... although Blake was still losing...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Heh, Hokage Naruto rocks!!\"- Jak said after winning a match<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Meh... the Rasengan technique is somewhat cool... but, it'd be more awesome to make it a beam... you know, like the Kamehameha or something...\"- Blake replied<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Rasen-Shuriken is cool!!\"- Jak replied<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I have to admit that it's quite original... but still, a beam would've been awesome, like the Demon Fox's...\"- Blake said -\"But... I doubt it would work in a battle against Blaze and the other freaks, I mean, seriously? You need yo run and hurl that thing into your enemy?!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"If it hits it packs a punch...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I still think it's a bit unpractical...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Yep. Now, how about a rematch?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Fine... I uhh.. will use this guy...\"- Blake selected Minato Namikaze for his next match (Jak kept using Hokage Naruto, and btw, Blake did NOT know who he was, other than the fourth hokage. Fun fact: I didn't even know he was the guy who created the rasengan... That happens when you play a game about an anime you haven't watched XD)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMany matches later...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoana and Jasmine had been seeing from time to time what their boyfriends were doing, and giggled, they were very alike at least in the gaming tastes. But they had other kind of \"games\" in mind... too bad Dr. Powerman told them not to keep trying to... Then Jasmine snapped her fingers, and whispered<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Well... Powerman said that he didn't approve our plans for them... so... IF we don't rape them... technically we can do anything else...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You just sounded so perverted right now...\"- Joana giggled<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Anyway!! You get what I'm saying, right?\"- Jasmine replied<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Yep... What should we do?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I don't know, I have to think about it...\"- Jasmine said<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, not so far from there...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I hope the Ryans are right about this...' Lith thought, and did some quick hand signs, then, her hands flashed in white greenish light briefly... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack to the guys... They were having an interesting match and were fighting evenly, until Jak yawned<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"C'mon!! This isn't boring at all...\"- Blake said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I know! But I feel... sleepy...\"- Jak replied<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"That's not possible... it hasn't been long since we woke up...\"- Blake added, but soon felt his body heavy, and before they could think or say anything else, both guys fell asleep... and unknown to them, so did their girlfriends...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>[AUTHOR'S NOTE: I know, this chapter is a bit short...

I mean... we're in another freakin' world in another dimension!! How does this make <br>\r\n<br>\r\nsense...?' Blake thought as he stood up. He noticed Jak was near him, seemingly unconscious as well<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"The hell?\"- Blake muttered, and Jak got up, yawning and noticing he wasn't in his room at the Deathray<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Where am I?\"- He asked to nobody in particular, not knowing he wasn't alone<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"And what's more important, where's THE PS3?!!\"- Blake added<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Blake? Uh... I guess it's the least of our worries right now...\"- <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"PS3 is NEVER the least of anyone's worries!!\"- Blake said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"How about the 360's RROD?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake stared at the sky thoughtfully, scratching his chin, and after a few minutes, answered<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Okay, you got me with that one...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Anyway... why are we here?\"- Jak wondered<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I have no idea, but maybe if we play some PS3 we might get some clue...\"- Blake said with a <font class=\"size4\" style=\"\">:D</font> face<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Blake, please. Let's be serious this time...\"- Jak said with a <font class=\"size25\" style=\"\"><b>\u00ac_\u00ac</b></font> face, and sighed, thinking <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Sometimes I wonder who's the older one...' While he also wondered about why they were back in their world, and why there was no people... It couldn't have been a dream, because then meeting Blake and Joana would've been part of the dream, thus, he would've woken up alone... No, it has to be something else, assuming everything so far has been real, except for their previous \"shared dream\" with their girlfriends... but it was relatively early, so they couldn't have gone to sleep, nor could Blake and him just fall suddenly asleep... Jak kept considering some more ideas when he felt the ground shake and the wind turning violent, and much to his shock and dismay, Blake was powering up in his light form...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Blake?!! What in the freakin' earth do you think you're doing?!!\"- Jak then noticed that some golden bolts flashed around Blake, and that his aura was very jagged, then, he turned it all off and went back to his normal form<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Jak, this is not good... I transformed into my light form with the golden aura at 8 times...\"- Both Blake and Jak had <font class=\"size4\" style=\"\">D:</font> faces as it could only mean they were in another dream, then they stared at each other with those worried faces, and 30 seconds later, both guys shouted at the top of their lungs<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"<font class=\"size5\" style=\"\"><b>DAMN!!!</b></font>\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Which means... we're yet in another Lith-damned dream... which means...\"- Blake said, and again stared at Jak with a <b><font class=\"size5\" style=\"\">D:</font></b> face<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"<font class=\"size5\" style=\"\"><b>RAPE!! AAAHHHHH!!!</b></font>\"- Both guys screamed, and ran in circles frantically screaming that for a few minutes, which they felt was an eternity, and a possible impending doom (Specially for Blake, who doesn't have the excuse of being underage anymore...)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Found you at last...\"- Blake and Jak stopped, and Blake quickly looked toward where the voice came from... it was Blaze, on top of a building, smiling evilly<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Can't I get a break?!\"- Blake asked angrily, with veins popping in his head (comical angry face)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Nope\"- Blaze answered as the jerk he is, and next to him appeared Nostory and Seth, at his left side, Aizen, Naraku and Orochimaru at his right side, all of them, except for Aizen, giving an evil smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I hate these dreams...\"- Blake mumbled, and assumed his fighting stance -\"At least I'm going to punch your face to get rid of that nasty smile\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Aww, jealous? You can't stand that I'm better than you?\"- Blaze taunted, keeping his evil smile, which clearly showed his demonic fangs by the way, which along his red eyes, and white hair, actually makes him look creepy... perhaps Blake already got used to it... Jak on the other side shuddered... for some reason Blaze was creepier than Nostory and Seth who just looked plain evil... wait... \"just\"?... Who writes this?!!... Uh... whatever... let's just continue and pretend nothing happened...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"<font class=\"size4\" style=\"\"><b>OH REALLY?!! IN WHAT?!!</b></font>\"- Blake asked, annoyed by Blaze's statement<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"EVERY-THING...\"- Blaze replied -\"Strength, speed, power, skill, talent, intelligence, heck, even looks...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Oh yeah, I missed the last fashion mag, what's this month's tendency? Lame attempts at looking evil and girly?!!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA vein popped in Blaze's forehead -\"It seems you want to have a slow and painful death...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Meh... It's still better than rape...\"- Blake shrugged, and Blaze opened his eyes wide (barely visible since his hair covers most of them)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I officially hate you...\"- Blaze said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"That's an understatement... and likewise...\"- Blake gave a taunting smile before adding -\"Bring it on, bunch of losers!!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite the taunting, only Nostory, Seth, Orochimaru and Naraku dashed to fight Blake and Jak. Blaze and Aizen stood in the same place, and the former crossed his arms. Blake was the first to dash toward Orochimaru and Naraku, and started to exchange punches with the former, as Naraku stepped back and waited for an opening in Blake's fighting. Jak had a <font class=\"size3\" style=\"\"><b>O_O'</b></font> seeing Blake fighting untransformed... something Jak himself couldn't do<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Hey, I thought you'd take advantage and end this in a single shot...\"- Jak said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"2 reasons: One, I'm not so fond of using cheats, not in videogames, not in real life... unless it's against the girls...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"But this is a dream!! And two...?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Yeah, but you get my point. I'll only hax when necessary... And two, I want to punch Blaze until I get fed up with it... it wouldn't be fun if I erased him with an uber awesome beam or something...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJak sighed, and transformed into his first Omega form, just in time to dodge an incoming punch from Seth, he also kicked Nostory while at it, sending him a decent distance away. He was certainly quite strong at his first transformation, but couldn't help but notice that Blake was strong and skilled enough to fight similar enemies without transforming... then again, it has been revealed that Blake descends from an angel... which probably explains it...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake, meanwhile, punched Orochimaru several times, but he only laughed and called Blake's attacks useless<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I've faced stronger enemies in the past... You don't have what it takes to beat me...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake's answer was dashing and punching him in the stomach, with enough strength to send him over 50 feet away... and crashing into a large rock... still, he heard Orochimaru laughing, and saying<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Well... It seems you weren't fighting seriously... this will be interesting...\"- Orochimaru then turned his legs into a snake tail and slithered at great speed toward Blake, who dodged him and attempted to kick him in the back of the neck, but Orochimaru caught Blake's ankle, as well as his right fist, when he tried to punch him to break free. Then, Orochimaru took out a sword from his mouth, and tried to pierce Blake with it...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe failed... Blake dodged the blade, and using his left hand, strangled Orochimaru, tightening his grip on his neck, until he released, and quickly kicked him in the stomach, not satisfied with that, Blake ran closely, adding more punches as Orochimaru was practically flying away, each hit adding force, until he crashed through a bunch of trees. Naraku growled, as he hated to admit that Blake was slightly stronger than before. Blake then extended his hand and closed his eyes, and the large sword Lith gave him appeared in his hand (looks like this <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.tantra.ph/mudha/images/nikrato.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.tantra.ph/mudha/images/nikrat...</a> but it has a pointy tip instead of being blunt )<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Very interesting...\"- Orochimaru said, while taking two kunai out of his mouth, then he laughed...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n[Author's Note: I know, I took too long writing this chapter, to be honest I've been having some difficult to get inspiration to write.

Simply sort, it sucks for Jasmine and Jak when it comes to doing things that normal teenagers would do. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why must you insist...on being....jerks!\" Jak said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why must you and your COW of a girlfriend, interfere in our plans?\"  Nostory said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's my duty, I kinda let you into the real world, so I have to get rid of you..\" Jak said. \"But I do appreciate one thing you two have done.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And that would be?\" Seth said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you introduced me to the girl of my dreams.\" Jak said. \"The same girl who's been fighting for me for the past 3 years. That same girl that I enjoy waking up next to. But now, since I have these powers, she doesn't have to fill in for me anymore.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJak's aura was rising more intently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, I mean,\" Jak continued. \"So thanks for giving a girl to love and care for.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJak then quickly put his arms out and made a force by using his ki, and the sent Nostory and Seth flying. Blaze noticed the spike in Jak's power level, Blake, also felt it, but was still firmly focused on Orochimaru. Meanwhile, Joana and Jasmine were coming upon the battle ahead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, here we are...\" Jasmine said. \"We found the boys.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But it still doesn't make sense....why are we all-\" Joana started to hesitate. \"Unless this is the work of Blaze and Nostory....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It can't be, it has to be another-\" Jasmine hesitated and was watching the scene. Their boyfriends were fighting Blaze, Nostory, Seth, and the rest of the other bad guys. Joana and Jasmine were somewhat worried the villains found a way to have the four of them to fall asleep, and then attack them in their dreams. Jasmine started to slightly panic and freak out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"T-this is nuts.\" Jasmine said. \"We have to help them, I bet that Nostory or Blaze had something to do with us falling asleep!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's not jump to conclusions...but let's go help them.\" Joana said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJasmine and Joana grew to 200 feet, and dashed to the battle. Jak was being strangled by Nostory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You thought you were being heroic?\" Nostory said. \"Think again....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJak was charging an energy ball in his right hand, and kicked Nostory in the leg, and then he fired the energy ball into his gut, sending him away a distance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I've gotten a bit stronger, Nostory...\" Jak said. \"I'm not the same kid you bullied 3 years ago, I'm almost 18, and I have powers now!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You forget, there's two of us bo-\" Seth was dashing toward Jak, but then a giant fist hit him, knocking him back very far. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, you forget, that he has a girlfriend who's always going to be near his side...\" Jasmine said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJak smiled. \"Blake, I think we have reinforcements.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake turned, to look, after deflecting the kunai that Orochimaru threw. \"Well, I guess, we can get some answers....</span></div></div>",

There was a brief smoke explosion, and a giant purple snake appeared, with Orochimaru standing on its head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Now the real fight begins!!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Hey, Orochimaru, why the hell did you call me?!\"- The snake asked angrily<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I brought you some fresh food... don't snakes like to hunt it themselves? You can have the giant girl...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What giant...girl?\"- The snake turned around and noticed a brown haired and well endowed girl... at an impossible size for almost any human... -\"IS THIS OTHER OF YOUR WEIRD EXPERIMENTS, OROCHIMARU?!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Shut up, Manda. It seems to be the boy's summon...\"- Orochimaru pointed at Blake, who was now on Joana's shoulder<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I have never seen such a summon...\"- Manda said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"They come from another world, and who knows, it's possible they have jutsus we don't know about...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You are seriously messing up reality...\"- Manda added -\"I don't mind, but you'll have to give me 200 sacrifices and the girl for my help!!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Yeah yeah, keep the girl, after I perform some studies on her...\"- Orochimaru said a bit annoyed<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Then it'll be 300 sacrifices...\"- Manda looked a bit more and focused on Blake 'His presence feels strong, but it isn't chakra... it is truly something from another world...' <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I would like to enjoy this fight, but unfortunately, I have business to do...\"- Orochimaru then bit his thumbs, performed quick hand signs, and 4 caskets emerged, Blake stared at them as they opened, and with a wide eyed look, he said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You GOT to be KIDDING me...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ones who stepped out of the caskets were Pain, Ulquiorra, Grimmjow, and Frieza. Blake noticd that only Pain stepped once more, indicating he would fight him first. Blake rushed toward him, and Pain quickly extended his arms, saying<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Shinra Tensei...\"- He created a force field, but it didn't repel Blake, as he stopped before getting into its range, and as soon as the force vanished, Blake landed a punch in Pain's face, sending him away a short distance. Pain quickly stood up and extending his arm, while pulling out a chakra blade (Pain's black blades) with his free hand, said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Bansho Ten'in\"- Blake was attracted by a tremendous force, and was to be impaled by the chakra blade, but instead, only a metallic clash was heard... Blake used his sword to block the chakra blade succesfully. Pain opened his eyes slightly more than usual, surprised to see a metal object that wasn't shattered by his blade. The attracting force subsided shortly after, and Blake attacked Pain with the sword, the latter catching it in his hand, but it cut his hand a bit and bled somewhat. Blake then kicked and punched Pain several times but his attacks had little effect, and Pain managed to grab one of Blake's ankles and threw him away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake then saw that Pain threw a chakra blade as a harpoon at him, and could barely dodge it. Blake felt that his current power wasn't enough to face him, and without saying anything, transformed into his light form. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What's that?\"- Pain asked rhetorically, in a somewhat arrogant tone, however, Blake disappeared before his eyes, and heard behind him<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Your doom\"- Pain was quick to turn around, only to find nothing, and got kicked in the back by Blake, this time, sending him a fair distance away and crashing into several large buildings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake then turned to look at Joana, who had already started her fight against Orochimaru and Manda... the resurrected villains didn't d anything though. 'With that snake is enough of a problem...' Blake thought... it was a good thing that while Joana wasn't fond of snakes, at least didn't fear them... scorpions on the other hand, were a different story....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You should pay attention to your own fight\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake, without turning around, whispered<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Purge... light of the heavens... banish from existence those who worship the wicked god...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe turned around and fired a very wide beam at Pain, who still blocked it with his Shinra Tensei, but barely made it. The beam still split after hitting the force field and destroyed some of the city's buildings. When the force field vanished, Pain was hit by a barrage of energy balls, and heard Blake muttering<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Gold as the sunlight... the light that pierces through darkness... burn the enemy down to ashes...\"- Pain opened his eyes wide for real, as he was hit by a golden beam, and couldn't block it because he needed a few seconds before using Shinra Tensei again. There was a large explosion, and Blake stared into the destruction<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPain had been caught in the blast, but he used Shinra Tensei to repel the flames that would've otherwise burnt him. Then, a bird's sound was heard, and a small girl with orange hair and the chakra piercings dropped from a giant bird with three legs and a strange beak, and while falling, she did some hand signs, and summoned other people... Blake already knew what it meant<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"In attendance, the Six Paths of Pain!!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Oh great\"- Blake said annoyed, however, a small light bulb lit up in Blake's head, and he smiled -\"Two can play that game\"- He placed both palms on the ground, and there was a smoke explosion. Pain was a bit surprised to see a guy with no knowledge of ninjutsu do a summon, but he wouldn't show it. However, he showed it a bit as Blake's \"summons\" appeared, two humanoid cats, a humanoid dog, and a humanoid turtle, and they all seemed to be confused about where they were<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Where are the infinite bones?! My happiness is all gone!!\"- Rocky said, falling to his knees, while everyone looked at him with a WTF face. He cleared his throat and added -\"Hey, a dog has dreams too...\"- Then he looked at Pain, and then turned around to see Blake<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Hey, master, isn't he the freaky guy from the ninja thing?\"- He asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Yep\"- Blake couldn't help but laugh a bit at Rocky's description of Pain<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You dare to call that a summon?\"- Pain asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I would like to ask you the same question... Let's see, I have two humanoid cats, a dog and a turtle, all of them with their enhanced senses multiplied to an unknown extent, thus, they are vastly superior to most people... and, what did you get? A bald cyborg, a small girl that summons large but useless animals, a guy that supposedly absorbs attacks, another that summons an ugly thing to rip out people's tongues, and a mind reading guy?... Guess who wins...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of the Paths of Pain were angered, even more as each was referenced, but the straw that broke the camel's back was <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"And the summoner himself, a frustrated emo guy who plays with gravity, thinks he's a god, and can't even beat a 16 years old in a battle with a 6 vs 1 advantage... What makes you think you're even worthy of being a villain?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf Pain's bodies were alive, they would've all had their blood boiling and their forehead veins would've popped out. They all dashed toward Blake, but his pets also reacted very fast and went to fight them. Still, the main Pain and the attack absorbing one took on Blake, engaging into a melee fight. Blake punched the attack absorbing Pain very badly, but couldn't give a hit that took it down definitively, and kept annoying him while he focused on the main Pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake kicked the absorbing Pain away and disappeared, quickly reappearing behind the main Pain, kicking him in the back, and slashing him with his sword, however, the absorbing Pain tackled him, and locked his arms from behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I've already seen that\"- Blake said, and silently, increased his power temporarily up to 7 times, and with a swift motion, he freed his arms and dislocated the absorbing Pain's, finishing with a quick slash with his sword, slicing him in two. Blake's power went back to just 2 times (normal light form) and he attacked the main Pain, who was surprised by that burst of power.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"It seems that other worlds offer some challenges...\"- He then used the bansho ten'in to attract Blake, and pinned him down grabbing him by the throat, Blake kicked him but Pain didn't let go and pierced Blake's right arm with his chakra blade, driving it into the ground, then, he stabbed him in the chest with another chakra blade, but instead of Blake seeing the Rinnegan in his mind, Pain saw two white, evil-looking eye, and felt some darkness coming out of Blake, then, a hand emerged from Blake's chest (without causing physical damage, more like coming out of a portal) taking out the chakra blade, and in a few seconds a guy that looked like Blake came out, but with darker grayish skin, his hair waving continuously upwards, and those evil eyes Pain has seen before. The guy also smiled, showing that he had fangs...</span></div></div>",

I had to get used to the schedules and that stuff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother note: Demon Blake can suppress and increase his power at will with no problem, and without Blake's drawbacks when increasing too much. However he only does it as 'he feels' and not having fixed increases like Blake has. The only way to determine Demon Blake's state is by his appearance [and after advanced stages it can be misleading]. Currently, he only looks like Blake, with irisless eyes, and slightly grayish skin, as well as his continuously waving upward hair... in case you ask, yeah, Blake's dark side is still far superior to him by a lot, but it's because he incarnates instinct, while Blake needs skill and to learn to use his powers. Just as Blake can't currently fly yet Demon Blake is perfectly capable of...]</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What is this?\"- Pain asked, although his tone seemed rather calm after the initial surprise, something was telling him that there was danger in whatever it was. Blake on the other side had an annoyed look, and said angrily<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You again?!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Hey, he woke me up!! I was having a good sleep!!\"- Demon Blake replied<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake sighed in annoyance, however, even he admitted that his dark side was very powerful, far more than himself, as it was him and not Blake who achieved such power that even Blaze feared...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"So, you were fighting this wimp? Man, if you want a real fight I'm the one you're looking for!!\"- Demon Blake said to Pain, smiling and pointing to himself<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I was going to do that anyway...\"- Pain answered and ran to attack him, while Blake decided to stay back, as he would only need to beat the remaining one, whether Pain or his own dark side, and Blake honestly didn't care if his dark counterpart got killed. However after a seconds of thinking he decided to go and help his pets. Blake was very surprised, as they had already beaten 4 of Pain's bodies, the last remaining one was the one that absorbed attacks, all the others had been utterly destroyed (and Blake didn't really bothered in finding out although there was evidence that his pets just used their natural abilities, such as Rocky's bone crushing bite... and the cats' claws). <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Did we do well, master?\"- Tabitha asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Way better than I thought. You may leave, I'll take care of this one...\"- Blake said, however, none of them felt like leaving, specially not after they noticed Joana was gigantic and fighting a nearly equally enormous snake. Blake, who was in his normal form (to save energy) quickly transformed to his standard light form and dashed toward the last of Pain's bodies (besides the one fighting Demon Blake) and using the shoshitsu technique for a great burst in speed, sliced it in two with no effort, as this Pain had no defense against physical attacks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Well, that takes care of it...\"- Blake sheathed his sword, only to hear a low booming sound, and felt two great forces clashing... just then, Pain got sent away very fast crashing into a mountain... Blake used shoshitsu to see what happened, and found Ulquiorra standing before Demon Blake, the latter had caught a punch from the former...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I've sensed a strange power in you. I shall be your opponent now...\"- Ulquiorra said. Blake quickly used shoshitsu to reappear a decent distance away... he was aware Ulquiorra was on a higher scale of power, but couldn't really compare it to his own, although it seemed Demon Blake had finally found his match. Blake also was fully aware of Ulquiorra's abilities and that he hid far more power than he was showing right now. Still, even if it was a dream, it wouldn't hurt to get his inner demon's ass kicked to shut him up. Blake climed a nearby building to see how was Joana doing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was fighting the snake, and had landed some hits on it, but she was also cautious, the snake seemed to be angry, and Orochimaru was still watching calmly the battle from the top of Manda's head. Frieza was also there, doing nothing but watching the fights with a bored face. Blake gulped, as he couldn't really comprehend what kind of power Frieza would have if he were to face him... If it was just like in the series, then Frieza would be stronger even than Blaze, and by a great deal... it would render Blake's strongest forms useless. Just then, he heard the sound of a sharp thing flying very fast and barely dodged a black chakra blade, thrown by Pain, who was badly wounded but still alive, and seemingly, still strong...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I tought you were dead!!\"- Blake shouted<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I'm beyond your concepts of life and death... someone like you can't kill me, nor your inner demon...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'where have I heard that?' Blake mentally said with sarcasm, however he was surprised about Pain finding out Demon's Blake true nature<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"It wasn't difficult to figure out that that thing was the source of your power, not so well hidden within you... as I saw it with my Rinnegan...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Oh really?\"- Blake got in fighting stance, and engaged into hand to hand fight against Pain, who now lacked the numerical advantage, but still proved strong enough to be more than a challenge for Blake. He had slightly underestimated Pain's power, and transformed into his light form once again...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You say that beast is the source of my power? Not quite. This power comes from something else, which I won't bother explaining you... The beast just happened to be there as well...\"- Blake punched Pain in the face with great strength, sending him away and off the building. He looked at Joana again, who dodged Mande and kicked it in the head, keeping some distance between the two. For someone who wasn't skilled on fighting Joana was holding her own reasonably well, although Blake knew she had been only using her (newly found) sheer power so far, and that this fight in particular required a bit more than just that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Ulquiorra had been fighting Demon Blake barehanded, each time their fists and feet clashed they created tremors, and shockwaves, after some minutes of this, Ulquiorra dashed back a bit, and said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"It's pointless to keep on. Show me your true power, otherwise you'll die...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I can say the same about you\"- Demon Blake replied, wiping off a bit of blood from his lips' left corner, and dashed toward Ulquiorra, who stopped the incoming punch with an arm, and fired a green Cero with the other. Demon Blake took the full blast, but was barely harmed, then, he grabbed Ulquiorra by the face and slammed him against a building's wall, then, he fired a black beam, which Ulquiorra deflected with a hand, although it got slightly burnt<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I've seen that sorts of things before. Try harder...\"- As he spoke, Demon Blake had suddenly disappeared, and Ulquiorra was caught off-guard for a very brief moment, in which he took a full powered black beam from above at nearly point blank... The explosion that followed cracked several buildings around and shook the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Is that enough?\"- Demon Blake said arrogantly<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Yes. You've proved worthless, and I have no more use in fighting you...\"- Ulquiorra replied, and then he muttered -\"Enclose, Murci\u00e9lago...\"- And transformed, gaining two large bat-like wings, his broken helmet-like mask now is fully formed with two long horns extending outward to the sides. toward the front. His clothes also looked now more like a robe, than like a jacket as before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"This is more than you can ever comprehend. However I'll let you see the form of your death...\"- Ulquiorra said, and formed a javelin made of green energy, throwing it, and piercing through Demon Blake's right shoulder, and he fell backward to the floor, apparently dead...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Hmph... I shouldn't have bothered...\"- Ulquiorra said to himself, turning around, only to see Demon Blake in front of him, staring at him with his irisless eyes, and a crazy smile<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Just kidding!!\"- He said somewhat happily, and added with the same happy-creepy tone -\"I can play that game too...\"- He got surrounded by a black aura, and the ground shook, the nearby buildings' windows shattered, and Demon Blake's fangs grew slightly longer, his skin turned darker, now evidently was dark gray, and the scar in his eye glowed in red. Then he added, with a more metallic-sounding voice -\"Let's play\"- He disappeared and almost caught Ulquiorra off-guard again. but he formed another green energy javelin and used it to slash him, although it missed. Then they started a high speed series of clashes...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Their power is monstrous... it's nearing Blaze's power...' Blake thought as he watched the fight (although he could still match them with the higher level golden aura), despite what he thought, deep inside he wanted his dark side to win... on the good side, he would be heavily worn down after beating Ulquiorra, if that happened... and Blake should have no problem finishing him off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe continued on watching Joana, until he got a bad feeling, and jumped from the building's top to another's, only to see it destroyed by a red beam... and saw Grimmjow</span></div></div>",

This is nature, and it's always in war. Either kill or be killed, it's been like that from the beginning and it will always be that way...\"- Grimmjow replied<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I can't let myself die yet\"- Blake got into a fighting stance with his sword (holding it with two hands, despite he can wield it with no problem with just one)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Oh, you speak like you're going to kill me?\"- <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Take it however you want... if you attack me I'll fight back, that's all you need to know\"- Blake anwered, and with that, both of them started the fight, their swords clashed, but immediately Blake felt the difference in strength... he wouldn't be able to take on him untransformed, and he immediately transformed into his light form (golden aura, spiked p hair, golden eyes) to counter...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I've seen that trick you do... do you really expect it to work?\"- Grimmjow said while they were struggling with their swords, and quickly disappeared using Sonido to stab Blake from behind, but the latter was able to dodge by using his own high speed technique, shoshitsu, reappearing  a few meters away from Grimmjow. Blake dashed at Grimmjow and their swords clashed again, however, this time, Blake was hitting repeatedly and didn't allow struggles, and suddenly, Blake hit him with more strength than before, then, he jumped backward and threw his sword at him (so that Blake's sword was spinning toward Grimmjow), which Grimmjow blocked, surprised by that unexpected move, he failed to see Blake above him, and the moment he looked up, Blake landed a powerful punch right into his face, sending him down and through the building, which collapsed. Blake slid along another building's wall to land safely. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake's pets were surprised to see him fighting like that. Blake definitively had more trouble against Blaze, although there was something in Grimmjow that none of them liked. Even when they were unable to truly feel their powers, they were still amazed by their speed and the damage they caused. And they could appreciate the fight more than a regular person due to all their enhanced senses. However, Blake maintained the transformation, as he didn't expect an easy victory, and knew that it wasn't enough to get rid of Grimmjow. Strangely, Blake had the feeling he could beat Grimmjow, even though it'd take some effort, while he also had the feeling that he wouldn't be a match for Ulquiorra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich by the way seemed to have a difficult time with Demon Blake, who just nearly equaled his own power. and after multiple high speed clashes, and several beam collisions, stood in the air, above the destroyed buildings. Both of them had gotten damaged and had bleeding wounds, just then, Ulquiorra formed two energy javelins and threw one, which missed, as Demon Blake disappeared and before he could react, Demon Blake had a hold on his right arm (the one he used to throw the javelin) and ripped it apart, then crushed it by clenching his fist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"That's what happens to anyone who messes with me, piece by piece...\"- Demon Blake said confidently, but Ulquiorra swung the remaining javelin, cutting off Demon Blake's hand<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I can say the same about you...\"- Ulquiorra replied coldly -\"However, you're fool if you think this really affects me...\"- Ulquiorra regenerated his lost arm at an incredible speed, and opened and closed his reformed hand a few times to test it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You were wrong if you thought that physical strength and power were my greatest abilities... My greatest power is this, instant regeneration... something most of my kind abandon in exchange for more power...\"- Then he gave a cold stare at Demon Blake <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You are clearly not human, not hollow, and not shinigami. Tell me, aberration, what are you fighting for? Are you protecting him?\"- Ulquiorra pointed with his look at Blake, who was fighting Grimmjow -\"Foolish. Either way he's dead, whether by Grimmjow or by me, or by Lord Aizen if he wishes so... Anything you do leads to defeat...\"- Before he continued, Demon Blake attempted to punch him, causing a shockwave that cracked the buildings' (below them) windows<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Protect him, you say? Nah. I just can't let the stupid die 'cuz I'm the only one who will destroy him, and absorb all his power for my own. I don't care if your friend bruises him a bit, I don't care if he feels pain. I don't care about his friends. I only care about his powers, which belong to me. And anyway, I felt like destroying someone, and you just offered yourself...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I see. You don't see through appearances, you don't understand that this is a lost battle and a lost cause for you. I'll do a single favor to you, I shall enlighten your pitiful existence, I shall make you know true despair...\"- All of sudden, the air felt heavy within a kilometer, and the sky turned black, as Ulquiorra transformed into his Segunda Etapa (Second Stage), losing his long white coat and his mask, and acquiring a more bat-like appearance, as well as a bat-like ears and tail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone stopped by this moment, as everyone noticed the change, although Blaze, Nostory, Seth, Frieza and Aizen were unaffected. Naraku, Orochimaru and Manda did feel the air growing heavy and that worsened Manda's ability against Joana, who had kept at a decent distance and used ranged energy attacks to damage him, the wounds were getting worse, and he was growing exhausted, still, the giant snake refused to give up, and attempted to bite Joana, although he failed, and got stomped in the head by her, which created a small earthquake, and after which, Manda vanished, against his own will, he was too damaged to keep fighting. Orochimaru and Frieza quickly went to the same building top where Aizen and Blaze had been the whole time, and Joana turned around to see the source of the sudden change... Blake's dark side was standing before Ulquiorra, who had just transformed into his strongest form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I certainly hadn't seen that form before...\"- Aizen briefly commented<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"HA HA! Your subordinates lie to you...\"- Nelson popped out of nowhere and disappeared just as mysteriously...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Let's pretend that never happened...\"- Blaze added. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack to Demon Blake and Ulquiorra...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I told you, two can play that game...\"- Demon Blake said with his crazy smile, while Ulquiorra replied<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You don't understand despair's meaning, do you? You still think you can actually fight me? That's so stupid it's not even funny to laugh at... You...\"- Ulquiorra's speech got cut off when Demon Blake gave a tremendous metallic roar, and the black aura appeared again, and grew even more, as everything below was shaking, cracking and shattering by the sheer power he was releasing. Ulquiorra then watched how Demon Blake's skin turned darker, and his eyes, still white and empty, now glowed slightly in the darkness, the scar in his right eye glowed more, then, two bone-like things tore Demon Blake's back as they extended, still dripping with blood, they began to grow black feathers, revealing them to be 2 black feathered wings. Demon Blake smiled, showing that his fangs grew even longer this time (Probably they're like an inch long). He also had grown black claws, they were no longer nails.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"So, even beings from other worlds seem to follow a similar course of evolution... I see that you're not a true individual of that kind, as there are a few things vaguely human left in you...\"- Ulquiorra said, and Demon Blake's answer was a punch, which Ulquiorra caught, and proceeded to strangle him with his tail, while Demon Blake slashed Ulquiorra's chest with his claws, and then fired two black beams at point blank. The explosion wasn't as large as the previous one, but it was far more destructive. Both Ulquiorra and him reappeared using their respective high speed techniques (Rakurai and Sonido)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack to Blake, as he watched the two demonic monsters transform and exchange a few hits, he thought<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'That just seems insane... is that the power I fought Blaze with?' However his thoughts were interrupted by a red Cero blast which Blake dodged<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What are you looking at? If you don't pay attention you DIE!!\"- Grimmjow shouted, and dashed closer to Blake, their swords clashed again, although Blake used his more defensively and tried to distract him with the blade while connecting a punch or a kick, Blake jumped backward to another building's top and Grimmjow fired several red Balas which Blake was forced to block with his sword (which fortunately, is wide enough to be a decent shield). When the smoke dissipated a bit, Grimmjow was already in front of Blake, but instead of fear, what Grimmjow said was a confident look, and noticed Blake had his right palm on the ground...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size2\" style=\"\"><b>[According to Naruto's info at the wiki, Orochimaru implants something on the revived ones with his forbidden jutsu which alters their personalities to varying exents. So, I think this explains why Ulquiorra would go all out despite being seen, as well as to justify whenever these characters act out of character (besides the obvious such as not questioning Orochimaru who is by the way much weaker than all those villains). I know, it sounds like a plot device, but well, this is semi-filler anyway &gt;.&gt;]</b></font></span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>-\"Purify, soul vanisher... Bring the judgement of light...Consume the darkness, sentence to death... Incinerate, heavenly lights!!\"- Blake said as a circled heptagram  made of golden light formed below Grimmjow, and as Blake finished the spell, seven pillars of fire-like golden light emerged from each tip, which continued to grow, fusing into a single, wide light pillar, which engulfed Grimmjow, and rose up into the sky, piercing a bit of the darkness that surrounded everything (and the darkness did not regenerate, and it looked like there were tiny golden flames around the borders of the 'hole')<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake had to jump to another building as the light pillars destroyed the building he was on. He had reverted to his normal form and was breathing heavily, as that spell took a lot out of him. Then he turned to see Joana who was done with Manda, and was watching him, she rushed toward him (still gigantic) and hugged him, Blake groaned in pain, both from Joana's strength, size, and that the spell he just used strained all his body. She let him go but picked him up and kissed him several times, then she said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"There's still the others, I should heal you...\"- Blake was standing on her palm as it began to glow in soft white light, and Blake himself got surrounded in a spherical field made of that same light<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"We should help Jak and Jasmine after this...\"- Blake said, now that he could think a bit more clearly, Joana nodded. Blake was actually relieved about Joana coming to help him, as it soothed his almost instinctive fear to rape. Blake expected that the presence of these enemies would make Joana forget about her original purpose in the other dream. Unfortunately, he wasn't aware that Joana was able to perceive his thoughts, and mentally giggled. But she also got a bit more serious as she looked around<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Are you sure about leaving your dark side on his own against Ulquiorra?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Yeah. Like I would help that jerk anyway. I'll just finish off whoever remains, and they are going to get severely damaged and worn down for sure...\"- Blake said -\"And perhaps, if I'm lucky maybe Ulquiorra gets rid of him for a good while...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I HEARD THAT!!\"- Demon Blake shouted, although neither Blake nor Joana could see him, as he was high speed fighting Ulquiorra<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I hate that guy. If Blaze weren't up to something really evil I would let him get away with him. I don't need a dark beast in my life\"- Blake added<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Lith said you needed him\"- Joana recalled<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Nah. I'm betting she said that because I hadn't learned to use light power...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What about the balance between the two forces Lith talked about?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Okay, you got me...\"- Blake said with an annoyed \u00ac_\u00ac  look -\"Still, he deserves a good beating...\"- After a few seconds, he was done with the healing, and Joana was about to walk toward their friends, when a blue beam came from the ground, aimed at Joana, who blocked it with a white light barrier, although her energy shield broke and the explosion afterwards was tremendous. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What...WAS...THAT?!\"- Joana wondered<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Gran Rey Cero...\"- Blake and Grimmjow said at once, the latter emerged from the collapsed building, and rose up to Joana's hand level. He had gotten a great deal of damage, he was badly burnt and had several bleeding wounds. His clothes were also damaged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"YOU THOUGHT THAT WAS ENOUGH TO BEAT ME?!!\"- Grimmjow said very angrily, and then, with his still bleeding hand, he charged up another Gran Rey Cero, this time, Blake quickly transformed into the light form x5 and fired a golden beam with his two hands together (opposed to Blake using his left one while holding its wrist with the right hand, which is how he fires energy most of the time), the two beams were fired too close and the explosion that followed pushed them away. Joana covered Blake in her hand so they didn't suffer any damage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Grind, Pantera...\"- Grimmjow said before transforming, getting a white segmented bone-armor as well as many feline traits, long hair, cat-like ears, teeth and a tail. All his wounds also were healed instantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"And I thought the guy was already ugly...\"- Tabitha commented while looking this new enemy transform into what to her looked like an insult to cats<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Joana, I'll have to do this alone, go and help the others...\"- Blake said in a slightly more serious tone than usual (which is mostly serious)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"But, Blake...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"He can cause massive damage, and your size would be a disadvantage against him. I'll fight him, and at least, hold him for long enough...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Hold me?! Heh. Your abilities have intrigued me, whatever you are. I don't feel like killing you yet, so, let's fight for the hell of it!!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"It's one on one, and both are healed. But let's do this somewhere else...\"- Blake said while giving him a cold stare, then, he jumped to a building's top and then to another, getting a fair distance away from Joana. However, Blake's pets also followed him and stood surrounding him<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I feel the danger, master, we have to help\"- Rocky said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Don't\"- Blake said -\"I also know he's dangerous. That's why I have to fight him alone. Make sure Joana is ok...\"- The firmness in Blake's tone indicated them that he wasn't going to say that twice, and a bit reluctantly, the dog, the two cats and the turtle left. Grimmjow somewhat noticed that Blake was protecting all of these beings, and it sort of reminded him of his own Fracci\u00f3n, but he shook those thoughts away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Fine...\"- Blake said, and closed his eyes, then, his hair rose, and a golden aura surrounded him, however, this time, it changed to a more jagged version, instead of the fire-like aura Grimmjow had seen before, also, a few golden lightning bolts flashed around Blake, whose muscles tightened, and some veins became visible, then, as his power grew, the building's roof cracked. Grimmjow observed that Blake was releasing a great power but in amore controlled manner than his own or anyone else he knew... Blake then opened his eyes, which were golden and glowing this time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore anyone could even blink, Blake dashed and punched Grimmjow, the destroying the building's top in the process. Grimmjow clenched his teeth when he felt the sudden change, and attempted to slash him with his claws but Blake caught his hands, and kneed him in the stomach, then added two punches in the face, and an axe kick, which sent Grimmjow crashing through the building, which collapsed. This time, Blake jumped to another building and then jumped over the collapsed building, putting his two hands together, and closing his eyes for concentration, he said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Sacred flames...in the name of Chaos... delete this evil soul!!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake fired a crimson fire-like beam that struck the place, creating something similar to an explosion, but it wasn't, it was only that crimson fire what lingered. Blake slid along another building to slow his descent but he noticed 5 green crystal-like things, and remembered<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"The missiles!\"- He muttered, and used shoshitsu to escape from them, the sheer force of Blake's impulse dented the building, and was soon destroyed by Grimmjow's missiles axploding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake reappeared on the ground, and the moment Grimmjow emerged from the debris, their fists clashed with incredible strength, and Blake kept attacking very quick and fiercely, disappearing and reapearing very fast trying to catch Grimmjow off-guard, but he was holding his own, and also used Sonido to evade Blake's attacks. As they also fought going upwards Grimmjow noticed that each time Blake had to jump so he could take impulse from the buildings' walls, he decided to pat attention to this detail, and dashed backward, standing on mid air, Blake climbed by running very quickly and then took impulse to attack Grimmjow with a kick, which he also used for additional impulse to return to the building and get a grip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrimmjow had realized Blake couldn't stand on air, nor fly, which was an important weakness, he smiled, and dashed toward Blake to engage in close combat, only to slowly go backward, forcing Blake to follow him, however Blake was aware of his limitation and had seen the catch, and clenched his fists in frustration that Grimmjow had found out an exploitable weakpoint. Grimmjow, standing at a distance Blake couldn't reach by jumping, smiled and said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What's wrong? Weren't you going to fight me? Why don't you come over here?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake was a bit desperate, as every second that passed in his sevenfold light power used up a great amount of energy, and despite knowing it might be suicide, he decided to fight Grimmjow for as long as he could mantain his state. Blake stopped for  a moment, thinking 'Wait a minute... if this is a dream, how come I have limitations?!' Now he was suspecting of Blaze really influencing his dream which probably meant he was blocking the \"limitless mode\" in the dream... Blake decided to investigate on this later, as he now had to beat Grimmjow and help his friends. He dashed from a building's top using shoshitsu, destroying it in the process. He began to exchange punches and kicks with Grimmjow in mid air, while falling down </span></div></div>",

His bone armor cracked a bit, and he laughed<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You're such a pathetic bug, I shouldn't have bothered!!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"This pathetic bug is giving you a run for your money, ain't I?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrimmjow growled in response, and dashed angrily toward Blake, who drew his sword and slashed him swiftly in the chest, and Blake said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You have more powers and abilities than me, but if you only fight like a beast blinded by rage, your power means nothing...\"- Blake said, as he swung his sword to shake off the blood and put it back in its sheath (worn similarly to Trunks'. I don't really know how else to describe it)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You speak as if you were superior to me!! You feel you're going to beat me?! I...CAN'T..STAND THAT!!\"- Grimmjow dashed toward Blake who blocked the incoming punch, and this time both received some damage, Blake got some wounds by Grimmjow's claws and Grimmjow got his armor further damaged by Blake's punches and kicks, Blake dashed backward and began firing several energy balls, which hit Grimmjow until he began countering with numerous Balas. Blake suddenly disappeared and reappeared several times in quick sucession, attempting to confuse Grimmjow, and managed to catch him off-guard, starting a ver fast combo of punches and kicks mostly to his stomach, then, jumped above him and with his two hands together, he said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Purge... light of the heavens... banish from existence those who worship the wicked god...\"- A golden circle with a heptagram inside it (made of light) appeared before turning into a wide golden beam, which struck Grimmjow with tremendous force, it sounded like thunder, and even its shockwave damaged a lot the surroundings. However this beam didn't explode and just faded away, leaving some fire behind, as well as a more damaged and angry Grimmjow. Blake was breathing very heavily, using a high level technique further powered by his own power increase took a hell of a lot of energy out of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake landed somewhat safely, and then felt a sharp thing piercing his left shoulder, it was a chakra blade, thrown by Pain, wo was standing up, with a cold look, that somehow revealed anger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Just what I needed...\"- Blake muttered, breathing heavily, momentarily, he lost the transformation but quickly regained it, groaned a bit in pain and then stood in a fighting stance<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Hey, you lost your chance!! Go and mess with Ulquiorra's prey!!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"My fight with him isn't over yet...\"- Pain said coldly<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You...son of a...\"- Grimmjow growled<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Grimmjow... fight alongside him...\"- Aizen ordered calmly, while giving him a creepy stare, which in itself didn't flinch Grimmjow, but the fact that Aizen was focusing his spiritual pressure on him brought him down to his knees<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Alright...\"- Grimmjow agreed reluctantly<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Hey!! I'm the one who controls them!!\"- Orochimaru complained<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Is that so?\"- Aizen replied, and did the same to Orochimaru, who, being a human, felt the pressure even worse than Grimmjow did, and angrily said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"...Sorry...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"That's better...\"- Aizen replied, while drinking a cup of tea (Which we don't know where THE HELL did he get from)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n[Background Music: Bleach - Stand Up Be Strong <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZSp8CJLZg8&amp;feature=related\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZSp8CJLZ...</a> ]<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake was breathing heavily, struggling to keep the transformation, which was costing his body too much effort. His aura began to fade away, and struggled to keep it, he dashed toward Grimmjow and punched him, but Pain pierced Blake's right shoulder with a chakra blade and pinned him to the ground. Grimmjow aimed his hand at him, and began to charge up a Cero, while Blake struggled to break free, and in a sudden burst of power, he did break free, kicked Pain away and punched Grimmjow in the stomach, which interrupted his charging up, and nullified the Cero he would've fired otherwise. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Blake, aware of the danger of letting those two get away, kept the transformation, and dashed toward Pain, exchaging some punches, as Blake overwhelmed him with his strength, while also dodged attacks from Grimmjow, Blake's aura grew slightly and punched Pain hard in the face, who crashed into a building's debris. Blake was feeling weaker, and Grimmjow kicked him in the face, then added a combo with punches, slashes and kicks, Blake fell to the ground breathing heavily. Grimmjow stomped on Blake's back, and pinned him down<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Was that it? All you could do?! Is this as far as you'll fight, human?! You're changing my mind about killing you, if you're this weak, you aren't worth my time\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake struggled to get up, but his body didn't respond, his eyes lost their glow, but regained it, and it became more intense, as Blake was forcing himself beyond his own limits, his aura turned more electric like, and his muscles tightened to an extent that made obvious he was forcing himself, the chakra blades that wee still piercing his shoulders broke to pieces when his power increased as well. Blake stood up, and fired a golden beam right into Grimmjow's chest, pushing him away a few meters. Pain, whose resilience had been proved to be impressive, fought Blake again, mostly barehanded, but when he pulled out more chakra blades Blake drew his sword, and they clashed. Pain began to throw some chakra blades at Blake as harpoons, but Blake dodged and blocked them. Still, he got some wounds by their sharpness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake forced his energy to keep the increase, even if it was damaging his body from the inside, and extending his arms to each side, he fired two massive golden beams at Grimmjow and Pain, and they hit their target, causing two large explosions. Pain was more damaged, but Grimmjow, who protected himself with just his arms, seemingly avoided most of the damage by brute force<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake fell to his knees, sweating and breathing with difficult. His whole body was struggling to maintain the transformation (Blake's hair reverted to normal and regained its transformed form in quick succession, as well as his eyes, which flashed from golden to green [spare body's eye color. his original body has black eyes]) Blake's aura also seemed to extinguish, but then grew again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'He can achieve incredible power, but it puts a heavy strain on his whole body... something to expect from such techniques...' Pain thought, his Rinnegan allowed to somewhat see Blake's energy flow, although not as clearly as typical, as Blake's energy was different from what he knew (chakra). Blake was clenching his fists, and managed to hold his own against the two villains, despite each second Blake grew more tired, and weaker. Yet, he refused to be defeated, as he stood up again, charging up energy in his hands, while his eyes revealed anger, angst, and desperation. He slammed both hands (open) on the ground cracking it, and struggling to keep his aura, he muttered<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Strike with lightning force, devastating disaster, carve two tombs in the ground, eternal grief, burn the souls down to ashes, a blood sacrifice... Strike! Sacred Twin Pillars!!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrimmjow and Pain had been locked in place when the incantation began, and both were hit from above by two massive golden energy pillars, which didn't immediately explode, but rather dug deep in the ground, and then exploded, with insane power. Blake finally lost the transformation, and fell unconscious. Grimmjow and Pain emerged from the huge craters though, this time, they sustained major damage, but were still angry, and seeing Blake was knocked out, approached to him, but a giant foot stomped in front of them, that foot belonging to Joana, who picked Blake up while aimed her other hand at the two villains. She was also healing Blake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'That spell took longer, and Blake could barely do it... maybe he was right when he said those weren't meant for humans...' Joana thought, while also keeping an eye on Blake, as well as on Grimmjow and Pain, who dashed toward her, attemtping to attack her, she escaped using high speed (Not shoshitsu. Just raw physical high speed, called Godspeed according to Blaze) and began running away. She easily got a fair distance away but Pain and Grimmjow managed to keep up and soon they were getting closer to her, she stopped running and fought them with kicks and a single hand. Pain got stomped twice by Joana, but Grimmjow dodged all her attacks, until she began firing energy, which was massive due to her size (200 feet).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrimmjow roared angrily, and rose up to Joana's eye level, then, he did a slashing motion with both hands, and that formed giant claws made of solidified energy<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"My strongest attack, Desgarr\u00f3n (Laceration). I didn't expect I'd have to use against someone like you...\"- He did another slashing motion, and the giant energy claws effectively hurt Joana, slashing her skin, although she protected Blake with both hands. Grimmjow tried to slash her in the neck to finish her off, but...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Blake had been fully healed and regained his energy once again, transformed and used his sword to stop Grimmjow's Desgarr'n, and fired a golden energy beam that destroyed it. He immediately increased his power up to seven times, and before going into fight, he said to Joana<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Thanks. I was right when I said I would be nothing without you...\"- Blake used shoshitsu to disappear, and reappeared above Grimmjow, punching him down into the ground. Blake landed safely and waited. He sensed danger, and dodged Pain's chakra blades. Blake now realized that he had decayed very quickly because he let those things touch him, and he already had felt that they distorted his energy in some way he couldn't describe. His aura grew, and some golden lightning bolts flashed around him, as he added <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"It won't be like the last time...\"- <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPain exchanged punches and kicks with Blake, who was stronger than him, but was still surprised because Pain had taken so much damage and still could stand up. Just then, Blake could barely side step to dodge a blue beam, another Gran Rey Cero from Grimmjow, which caused a tremendous explosion, and actually hurt Joana in the process. Blake's eyes suddenly flashed in a brighter golden glow than usual<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You're dead...\"- <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake used shoshitsu and combined that great speed with a punch, which Grimmjow blocked, but completely broke his left arm's armor, as it resulted in a powerful hit. Grimmjow slashed Blake but it wasn't a deep wound, and began to do many spinning kicks, which Blake dodged<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Come on!! The fight's not over yet!!\"- Grimmjow laughed maniacally as he kept trying to attack Blake, until he realized Pain wasn't attacking, and heard<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Chibaku Tensei...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What the h...?!!\"- Blake got cut off as a black sphere Pain created with his hands rose to the sky, shone in a strong golden light as it aligned with the sun, and began to attract everything to it, debris, parts of buildings, trees, the ground itself, the earth below the concrete as well... and Blake... who was getting attracted because a large piece of the ground below him began to rose up, and Blake jumped off it, but as he landed another part of the ground rose, as well as many around him, Blake kept jumping off them yet it was futile, despite his efforts he was getting closer to the giant mass that now looked like some sort of mini planet. Blake used shoshitsu, and began to regain some distance, and noticed Pain was getting really strained from the technique, however, Grimmjow shot several Balas, which, attracted by the growing gravitational force, hit Blake and pushed him toward the new celestial body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake slammed against its surface, and began to shoot golden energy beams at the incoming pieces of earth, debris and rock, but it proved useless as they still piled on top oh him, and compressed further. Blake forced a lot of energy out of his body as an aura to escape it by brute force, but he wasn't able to, and soon all he could see was darkness, all he could feel was cold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake fired several beams, piercing the giant earth mass, but the were rather small compared to its size, and it kept growing, its gravitational pull was weakening the buildings that still stood in the damaged city... While Grimmjow laughed <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Who would've said such trash could have such technique?\"- He said, although Pain ignored him<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Excellent...\"- Blaze said from afar, but his satisfaction didn't last as Joana, who had seen everything rushed toward Pain's Chibaku Tensei and punched it, causing some damage, and she realized that to her, it felt fragile, and added some more punches to weaken the sphere. Pain coughed, as he was straining himself further, but was helpless against the giant girl destroying his jutsu.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrimmjow rushed toward her but a golden beam pushed him away, as Bake managed to break free when the sphere weakened, and shooting another beam, hitting its core, the whole sphere exploded, breaking to pieces... Joana aimed her hands at Blake, and they glowed in white light, as they were refilling his energy and healing the minor injuries he got.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Impossible!!\"- Pain exclaimed when he saw one of his most powerful techniques fall apart, he fell to his knees in exhaustion. Blake used shoshitsu and appeared in front of him, and aiming his hand at him, fired a huge golden beam at point blank, which made a large hole in the city, next to the much larger one made by Pain's technique. Pain was still there and stood up, although his clothes were badly burnt, as well as himself. Grimmjow appeared behind Blake, but he elbowed him in the stomach and fired an energy ball to him, sending him away. Blake returned to his normal state to save energy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then when Blaze got desperate, and said to Orochimaru<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Send Frieza as well! We can't risk losing this battle\"- Orochimaru said nothing, but nodded, a bit reluctantly as he didn't like to take orders from Blaze, but if he was immortal for real, Orochimaru would just have to find a way to steal his secret for himself... Frieza flew rather slowly toward them (by the way he's in his first form). He quietly stood before Blake, Grimmjow and Pain, the latter two felt his immense power, and reluctantly, stayed away. Blake due to his inability to feel powers couldn't really tell, but he was aware Frieza was probably a whole lot stronger than these guys...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'If this were a dream where I could do anything this would be great... but limited to my real power, I'm not sure if I can even hurt him... I mean, he destroys planets like nothing!! I can barely blow up a building...' Blake thought, however, he stood in a fighting pose, while telling himself 'Just keep aware. Look at every detail... Don't lose your composure...' He transformed in his light form, his hair rose up and spiked upward, while his eyes changed to golden, and a flame-like aura surrounded him, which immediately became more electric-like as Blake increased his power 7x. His muscles tightened and a few golden lightning bolts flashed around him, and rushed toward Frieza, punching him in the face as he didn't react, and actually pushed him away a few meters, as he underestimated Blake, however, he was unharmed<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Was that all you could do?\"- Frieza asked, although the fact Blake had a golden aura surrounding him still made him uncomfortable, Blake's answer was two golden beams that hit Frieza, and exploded, but Frieza didn't have a single scratch. Blake put both palms on the ground and said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Purify, Soul Vanisher... Bring the judgement of light...\"- A circle made of golden light formed below Frieza, and locked him in place, a heptagram symbol appeared within the circle as well, and Blake continued<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Consume the darkness, sentence to death... Incinerate, heavenly lights!!\"- Seven pillars of fire-like golden light emerged from each tip, which continued to grow, fusing into a single, wide light pillar, which engulfed Frieza, and rose up into the sky (This one was larger and more powerful than the one used on Grimmjow, because Blake used it at full strength). After the smoke dissipated, Frieza was still there, with only minor injuries<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"That's enough!!\"- Frieza disappeared and before Blake could even blink, Frieza was behind him and as he turned around, he kicked him in the face, sending Blake away several hundred meters, and crashing though several buildings. Frieza appeared before him, and stomped on his head, pushing it further into the ground. Blake felt as if that single kick nearly broke everything inside him, and struggled to stand up, but he was unable to, as Frieza's power was overwhelming. Still his aura grew an he was puting all his might into trying to get up, but all his efforts were futile. Annoyed, Frieza looked at Grimmjow and Pain, who were heavily damaged and tired<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"And you couldn't take down this kid?!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrimmjow growled angrily but refrained from attacking, as he felt Frieza's tremendous power, as well as that he had seen him defeat Blake with a single hit, while they fought evenly. Pain also kept from answering, as he could feel and somewhat see the immense power within Frieza. However, he opened is eyes wide as Blake managed to use shoshitsu to get away, although only a few meters, as he was quickly decaying... Blake was breathing heavily, bleeding, and in horrible pain, his aura shrank and it began to fade. He attempted another shoshitsu to escape but Frieza was already in front of him...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size25\" style=\"\"><b>*Btw in my personal opinion, Frieza is way underrated, and in a somewhat reasonable comparison with my own universe's power levels, Frieza can singlehandedly defeat pretty much anyone in his first form and without real effort. Except for Lith, Blaze (if he restores his former power), Omega 17 and a few others. Obviously he wouldn't beat Chaos or Lucifer, all of which are Gods... Also, check out the latin american dub sometime, his voice there was actually badass and didn't sound like an old librarion -no offense but to me it did- He's called Freezer in that version which sounds a bit better... in my opinion at least</b></font></span></div></div>",

Jak was surprised a bit, he had certainly gotten stronger in his Omega Form, and it almost seemed normal to him, as the strain from when he first used the transformation exhausting. But after training, numerous battles, and insane dreams, Jak was better prepared and ready to take on challenges.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJasmine was handling Seth pretty well, and of course had more than 3 years of fighting two deamons. But now, secretly, Jasmine was a little happy that Jak could defend himself. She didn't have to fill in anymore for the both of them. But she always vowed to protect Jak at all times. And she was glad Jak understood why she would stay by that promise.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't get what's going on?\" Jak said. \"Why is this happening, why is there a dream again?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not sure why.\" Jasmine said. \"It wasn't us again!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you guys get knocked out as well?\" Jak said. \"If you guys ended up falling asleep too, I have a feeling that something sinister is behind it this time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yes.\" Jasmine said, fearing the worst. \"We literally just woke up. And we weren't supposed to be asleep again. Unless Nostory and Blaze had something to do this.\" Jasmine fired a energy blast toward Nostory, who was going to attack Jak from behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice one,\" Jak said. \"Oh by the way, DUCK!\" Jasmine immediately realized what Jak meant as he flew up to Seth and delivered a devastating knee to his face. And then Jak used a new technique to follow Seth without flying after him, as he instantly transported to where Seth was about to land. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-how?\" Seth said. \"You weren't supposed to be this strong! This isn't right at all!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You got to realize this, beat down was coming.\" Jak said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJak focused his energy into both his hands, kicked Seth upward, and stood there for a minute. Seth was able to recover in mid-air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You didn't pursue after me, boy!\" Seth said. \"You actually think you're well experienced?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJak then transported behind him. \"Well, hey this is easier sometimes, and with a strong left hand punch, he sent Seth flying toward Jasmine. Jasmine then delivered a heavy kick, which was pretty painful, as we know Jasmine is about 200 feet tall, and that shouldn't end well. Then to top it all off, Jak, who hadn't used his right hand that was filled with energy, flew toward Seth at an amazing speed, and literally crashed into him, placing his hand on Seth's chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is impossible...\" Seth said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Impossible is nothing.\" Jak said. \"I call this one Drill Cannon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJak then unleashed a large current of energy point blank into Seth's upper torso. Jak also was flying upward as the beam was\" drilling\" (hence the name) Seth. After a few seconds of the blast being fired. Seth was barely moving, and was severely injured. Jasmine started to give Jak a round of applause.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bravo, Luigi-Boogums,\" Jasmine said, giving him a big hug and kiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you know...\" Jak slightly blushed. \"I've been trying to develop my own fighting style. But we're not done here yet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know,\" Jasmine said. \"I'll go assist Joana, you should probably help Blake with- Is that Frieza?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be random, why would-\" Jak then turned around and saw Frieza. \"That's not a power to take lightly, even at his first form.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Be careful.\" Jasmine said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You too.\" Jak said, smiling. \"I promise I'll be fine. And by the way, I don't think Seth wasn't fighting me seriously, or at full strength.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He didn't?\" Jasmine said. \"You roughed him up pretty bad, but we'll talk about this later. You just go help Blake.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJak gave Jasmine a thumbs up and dashed toward Frieza and Blake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You sure are making this boring...\" Frieza said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJak then side blinded Frieza and kicked him away a far distance. Blake face was O_O<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey there buddy.\" Jak said. \"And Trust me when I say this. That kick I just landed was possibly the luckiest kick I'll get against Frieza. He seems to be quite strong in his first form.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd say.\" Blake said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know you've said you don't like to have an advantage when fighting, but I'm asking you as a friend here. Can I please help you fight Frieza?\" Jak said. \"I felt the power that he has before I got here, and plus I don't want Doctor Powerman to be spazzing out over your body again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake thought about it...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>(Jak was become way more comfortable with his powers now, as you can see here.)</b></span></div></div>",

Suddenly, a golden light that seemingly came out of nowhere illuminated both him and Jak, healing their wounds and replenishing their energy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Whoah, I don't know how this happened but sure someone is on our side\"- Blake said with a half smile<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"God?\"- Jak asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Nah. Lith's too lazy to help us...\"- Blake said, and they heard a thunder somewhere far away <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You meant busy...right?\"- Jak said after gulping loudly<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Yeah yeah whatever...\"- Blake stood ready to fight -\"Now all we need is a good strategy to beat Frieza...\"- Jak assumed a fighting stance as well, and before anything else happened, a book fell from the sky, hitting Blake hard in the head<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Oww!! What the hell?!\"- Blake picked up the book, it's cover was rather simple, made of brown leather, and its title read 'The step by step guide to beat Frieza' -\"I thought this dream was more realistic... Who cares?! Let's check this!!\"- Blake opened the book, and Jak came over next to him to read as well, the book read<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'The step by step guide for beating Frieza... For dummies'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake and Jak stared at each other with the \u00ac_\u00ac look before resuming reading<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Step 1: Train to be a warrior with superhuman powers' Jak gave Blake a thumbs up with the :D face<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Step 2: Train more to acquire a powered up form' Jak gave two thumbs up to Blake<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Step 3: Acquire a glowing aura.

[It was sort of smudged, rendered unreadable]<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStep 6: PROFIT!!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"WHAT...THE...?!!!\"- Blake was shouting angrily but Jak covered Blake's mouth with his hand<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"It was too good to be true...\"- Jak said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Someone has just convinced me to go on an atheist crusade...\"- Blake muttered<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"So... what do we do?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Fight him, and somehow profit from it...\"- Blake replied, throwing away the book. Then he and Jak transformed, Jak into his first Omega form, while Blake went all-out with the light form sevenfold. Then, both of them dashed toward Frieza as fast as they could. Blake and Jak disappeared right before Frieza, catching him off guard, as they quickly reappeared, Blake connected a fast punching combo and sent him away with a kick, Jak caught up and kept punching Frieza before he crashed into another building, then, Blake reappeared, and both fired a golden and a white beam, respectively, hitting Frieza, causing a large explosion and causing it to collapse...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake reverted to his normal form, and gave Jak a thumbs up<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Team attack WIN!!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I wouldn't agree with that...\"- Frieza's voice as heard, as he rose from the debris left from the collapsed building -\"You really called that an attack? Even my weakest soldiers would be more than enough to take care of you...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Well, where are they, Mr. emperor of the galaxy?\"- Blake mocked, guessing that if Frieza was revived from the dead he had long lost all his conquests, Frieza only gave them a death glare, and when he took a step forward, a golden beam struck Frieza from above, and just then he noticed Blake disappeared from being next to Jak. Blake added a lot of golden energy balls, and as he fell, he also fired several beams, all of them hit Frieza... however, he was only lightly burnt<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"This isn't good... I'm sure those attacks would've damaged Blaze...\"- Blake said while landing safely, again, reverting from light x7 form to normal to conserve energy<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I guess this is what happens when you bring beings from other universes...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Demon Blake was fighting second form Ulquiorra, it was an even fight, but Ulquiorra began to tire out, as his constant regeneration was costing a lot of energy, and Demon Blake seemed to regenerate no matter what and retain all his strength and stamina. He started to get desperate, but wouldn't show it, and put his hands together creating a ball of green energy, then he said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Lanza del Rel\u00e1mpago\"- he formed a spear made of green energy, and just then, Demon Blake appeared in close range to attack with punches, Ulquiorra dashed backward and threw the spear, which seemed to be going to hit Demon Blake, but he disappeared in the last moment... quickly reappearing, with an evil smile...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack to Frieza and the guys, Blake transformed once again into his light x7 form, and Jak asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Doesn't it waste  lot of energy to keep transforming and reverting?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Nowhere near what it takes to keep this form, and let's not speak of the physical strain...\"- Blake replied, and both guys remained silent for like a minute, then Blake said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Alright!! IT'S HELL, THE PAIN!!\"- Blake shouted, and noticed a certain orange haired ninja popping out of nowhere -\"Not THAT Pain....\"- Blake added, and Pain disappeared -\"Anyway, can we fight the bad guy now?\"- Blake asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"DUCK!!\"- Jak shouted<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Jak, don't be random... what has a duck to do with th-OMGWT...\"- Blake quickly ducked, as Jak did, and a spear of green energy flew past them, hitting Frieza, and causing a monstrous explosion... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake and Jak got up, watching the immense fire that followed the explosion -\"Talk about luck...\"- Blake said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Yeah...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"THAT'S ENOUGH!!\"- They heard Frieza shout, and before they could react, Frieza appeared, punching Blake and Jak in the stomach, and sending them hundreds of meters away from the tremendous force.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Hey, we didn't even fire that thing...\"- Blake said, dusting his jacket off, Jak only facepalmed himself, and said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Will we fight the bad guy or what?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I guess...\"- Blake said, transforming again, this time, he started to gather energy in his hands. Golden lightning bolts were flashing around them, as the power intensified<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Do you have an idea about what you're doing?\"- Jak asked Blake, but Blake didn't respond, and kept on charging for at least one more minute, after which he replied<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"No...\"- Blake then fired a wide yellow/golden beam from his left hand, which Frieza didn't bother dodging, Jak then noticed Blake had disappeared and was behind Frieza, and fired another equally powerful beam from his right hand. Frieza was heard muttering something, before the enormous explosion drowned all other sounds. Blake disappeared and quickly reappeared next to Jak, reverting to his normal form<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"That had to be my luckiest attack on Frieza...\"- Blake said, breathing a bit heavily from the effort -\"Bardock would've been proud...\"- Jak gave Blake a thumbs up and nodded<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"That saiyan? He was a weakling... but still was far better than that\"- Frieza said, appearing suddenly before the guys<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"FRIEZA... Y U NO DIE?!\"- Blake said [Check out the meme if you haven't already]. He then looked around, and realizing what he just had done, cleared his throat and said -\"I mean... WHY AREN'T YOU FREAKING DEAD ALREADY?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"It takes more to kill the Emperor of the Universe...\"- Frieza replied<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Hmm... the guy goes for the same tittle I intend for myself... I'll get rid of him later...' Blaze thought, before dodging a punch from the still giant sized Joana, who decided to take care of him directly. Jasmine tried to kick him but failed, and destroyed a building in the process. Blaze disappeared and appeared on top of another building, saying<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Ladies. You should think more of the environment before...\"- Blaze was interrupted by a powerful sound, as he got caught between Joana's and Jasmine's open hands, crushing him like an insect. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Eww... Blake was right about calling Blaze disgusting...\"- Jasmine said as she wiped the remains of Blaze off her hand<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Still not as bad as scorpions...\"- Joana said, wiping off her hand as well, while Jasmine stared at her with a confused look<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I HATE scorpions...\"- Joana said, but in her mind, she said 'I think they're damn terrifying...' Jasmine nodded, Joana not knowing she read her thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"That wasn't very nice of you...\"- Blaze said, on top of yet another building.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"BUT WHAT THE...?!!\"- Joana said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I'm immortal. GET OVER IT\"- Then he cracked his knuckles, and said -\"I guess I'll have to teach you some life lessons... before I kill you...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack to Frieza and the guys...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrieza was giving both Blake and Jak the most monumental ass-kicking of their lives, any attack they tried was useless, and Frieza didn't bother dodging their attacks, instead, showing them how useless they were by taking them and coming out practically unharmed. Blake and Jak also attempted to use their speed, but it was no match for Frieza's, and after crashing into many buildings, Frieza tossed Jak away, and began to strangle Blake with his tail, saying<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"There's something about you I just don't like...\"- His tail tightened its grip on Blake's neck, and Blake remembered the fight in the anime, and proceeded to give a strong bite to Frieza's tail, who flinches and releases him from the sudden pain, screams<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"AGAIN?!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake spits and wipes off his mouth, saying<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Who said anime didn't teach people how to save their lives?\"-</span></div></div>",

Jak and Blake got knocked off their feet when the ground shook powerfully, although for just a mere moment, and, a few meters away from them, Ulquiorra had fallen to the ground, and cuased a large hole in it. Above, was Demon Blake, crossing his arms, with a wicked smile similar to Blaze's<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Pretty good, at least better than Blaze and his lame lackeys...\"- He said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Why you?!!\"- Blaze, Nostory and Seth found themselves looking like the Y U NO meme, and then cleared their throats and muttered -\"Let's pretend this didn't happen\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Meh. Who's Next?\"- Demon Blake added arrogantly, and looked at Frieza and the battle-damaged Jak and Blake<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Aww c'mon guys, you can't defeat that cheap Alien ripoff? Seriously?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"WHAT DID YOU JUST SAY?!!\"- Frieza exclaimed angrily<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Why bother talking to a mutant lizard?\"- Dark Blake added, descending in front of Blake and Jak, facing Frieza -\"Enough child play. The pros will fight...\"- He said, to Blake and Jak<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Are you freaking stupid? Not even you can fight Frieza!! He destroys PLANETS like nothing...\"- Blake said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Yes, PLANETS!! Are you out of your mind?\"- Jak said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Answer 1, meh, planet destruction is overrated... and 2, I'm not out of my mind, I'm out of his...\"- Demon Blake replied, pointing at Blake, who facepalmed himself<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Jak let's make a bet, if the idiot lasts less than than 5 seconds against Frieza, I get your PS3 and your games...\"- Blake proposed<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"And if he lasts longer?\"- Jak said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Then you get... ummm... Joana?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"WHAT?!!!\"- Joana's voice boomed<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Just kidding...\"- Blake said with a nervous smile, and whispered to Jak -\"Ok you get my Wii and all my games if you win the bet...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Deal\"- <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake and Jak noticed there was a cinema behind them, and decided to get in, grab popcorn and sodas, and climbed to its top to watch the fight. Frieza had been dusting himself off, and prepared himself for the fight<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Bring it on, freak!!\"- Demon Blake said, assuming Blake's fighting stance, something never seen before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I'll let you try your attack first, to show you how...\"- Frieza was speaking arrogantly when Demon Blake disappeared, to quickly reappear in front of him, punch him hard in the stomach, quickly reappear behind him, and kick him with tremendous force, sending him crashing through several buildings, and yet again, reappeared above him to connect an impressive air combo at an insane speed, then, punching him, sending him downward with even more force, causing somewhat of a quake and a very deep hole in the ground. Not content with this, Demon Blake added a gigantic black beam that made an explosion that rivaled that of Ulquiorra's lanza del rel\u00e1mpago...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDemon Blake crossed his arms, smiling, and said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"That's how a real pro fights...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Blake and Jak had o.O O.o faces <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"BUT HOW STRONG IS THAT BASTARD?!!\"- Blake shouted<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I don't know, but, one thing for sure, it'd suck have him as a neighbor...\"- Jak said, Blake stared at him with a face that only could say 'Are you kidding me?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Frieza's voice was heard, laughing<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Did you think that would hurt? Maybe you're stronger than the two little fools, but you're still weaker than the bald saiyan monkey...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"So... we're weaker than Nappa... seriously?...\"- Blake said with a ._. face<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Well, Nappa destroys cities...\"- Jak added<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"WHAT?!! Nobody mocks me!!\"- Demon Blake shouted, and charged at Frieza, who didn't bother dodging, and caught his fist, while the ground behind him cracked. Demon Blake began to glow into his black aura, powering up, but Frieza was still stopping his fist single handedly. Demon Blake grew angrier, and his dark aura became more flame-like, and then with black electric bolts flashing randomly around him, his muscles tightened and the veins became more visible, and added another punch with his other hand, only for Frieza to stop both, and the surrounding area cracked more, and began to break. Demon Blake forced even more energy, making his aura similar to Blake's light sevenfold state, that is, looking rather electric like than flame-like, and the concrete collapsed and sunk. But Frieza wasn't even bothering on increasing his power, after a minute, he grew bored,  and threw Demon Blake away like a toy, with a force that made Demon Blake's previous hit look weak. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe crashed through a lot of buildings and in the last one, it collapsed as well. Demon Blake's aura grew larger, blowing away the debris around him, and stood, heavily damaged and angrier than ever. It even seemed that his healing factor was having trouble dealing with all the damage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"So, now you know who are you messing with, right?\"- Frieza said -\"I'm tired of this game...\"- Frieza aimed his hand and fired an energy blast, which Demon Blake laughed at, and intended to wave away with his right hand, but, on contact, it exploded, and Demon Blake's entire right arm had been destroyed, and he had an utter confused-angry expression, while he stared at where it used to be his arm, now a burned hole, that still bled a bit<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You thought you were powerful enough to just wave that attack away? You should have dodged. I hate the crybabies that excuse themselves for being disabled in a fight...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDemon Blake's face revealed some pain, but his arm reformed, although slower than previous regenerations, and it was briefly seen how the bones formed first, then the muscles, nerves and finally the skin. He even opened and closed his hand just to make sure. Jak remembered how in the fight against Aizen and Blaze, Dark Blake (Blake possessed by his dark side out of anger and desperation) seemed overpowered, took a lot of damage without flinching, and regenerated wounds like they were nothing... Frieza was definitively far beyond that level of power...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"YOU...WILL...NOT...GET AWAY WITH THIS!!\"- Demon Blake disappeared, but Frieza only moved slightly, dodging Demon Blake's incoming punch, and before he could react, he punched him hard in the stomach, and hit him with his tail, and appeared above him to finish with a barrage of energy blasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDemon Blake looked this time almost like a zombie missing part of his left side, and the right forearm, as well as horrible overall damage. But he healed back once again<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You're beginning to become real annoying...\"- Frieza said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Well, that's impressive... Demon Blake can take some punishment from Frieza and is still not destroyed...\"- Jak said -\"Hey, that means, I WIN YOUR WII...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Like I'd give away my Wii...\"- Blake laughed, and Jak looked down<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"However, Frieza is not even fighting full powered and you know it... and I think Demon Blake might be destroyed if this keeps on...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Won't you help him or something? I thought you wouldn't let him die because he's a part of your soul and that...\"- Jak said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Meh. He can burn in hell...\"- Blake replied<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Thanks for the appreciation...\"- Demon Blake answered, although pain could be noticed in his voice<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Go kill yourself already\"- Blake replied<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Umm, Blake... he's been covering us... he's taking on an enemy that we couldn't even hurt a little bit...\"- Jak said, after thinking a bit more deeply about the situation, Blake thought about what Jak said, and remained silent<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Come on, if all you can do is cause wounds then you'll never win!! Fight like a... whatever you are...\"- Demon Blake stood in Blake's fighting stance, waiting for Frieza to attack, he just laughed, and disappeared. Demon Blake couldn't even feel where did it come from, but he felt an insanely fast barrage of punches, and kicks. Then, Frieza pierced through his chest with one of his fists. Still with his forearm through Demon Blake's chest, he said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Will you heal from this?\"- Then he proceeded to blow away Demon Blake's head with an energy beam, finally letting the headless hollowed body fall down. -\"By your looks I can tell that he was the strongest one on your side... so... can't you just give up and finish this?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake and Jak were shocked... even when Blake sorta wished for it, it was shocking to see someone who looked like himself die that horribly, and, since he always seemed to be an indestructible berserker, it didn't seem as likely that Demon Blake would reach his limits and die. Blake and Jak transformed, and looking at each other, Blake said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I guess it's up to us...\"- However, Frieza appeared before them, and knocked them down with a swipe from his tail, then, aimed both hands at them<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I'm not in the mood for more games, surrender or die\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake and Jak moved swiftly, and fired energy balls at Frieza, who only dusted off his shoulders, and when he attempted to fire an energy blast, Demon Blake appeared, taking it himself, and exploding. Now all what remained was blood, and shapeless remains that were probably burned tissue, but it all reformed back into Demon Blake, and said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I'm not dead you idiot!!\"-</span></div></div>",

WHY CAN'T YOU UNDERSTAND FRIEZA IS STRONGER THAN US?!!\"- Blake asked a bit angry<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Umm, because if we don't fight, Blaze, Nostory and Seth will capture us and most likely kill us or use us for evil purposes?\"- Jak said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I don't agree either, except for the evil purposes. But I'm nobody's pet!!\"- Demon Blake added<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Am I the only one with a working brain here?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Does it matter the answer?\"- Demon Blake said, and Blake muttered 'No' as he looked down in disappointment<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"3 little bugs trying to gang up on me... why doesn't it surprise me?\"- Frieza said, and charged at them, Demon Blake catching his forearms in an attempt to lock him, while Blake assumed the sevenfold light form and Jake the Omega form, and shot energy beams at the former galactic emperor. However he was still unharmed, and disappeared, appearing behind Blake, and knocking him down with his tail, and without looking back, blocked Jak's attacks only using the tail, then turned around and blasted him with an energy ball.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDemon Blake punched Frieza in the face, shaking the ground and cracking the concrete beneath them, but Frieza didn't even move an inch, and grabbed Demon Blake's right arm, and ripped it off, but taking a little advantage of the moment, Demon Blake shot a point blank black energy beam at Frieza with his remaining arm. However, Frieza was still unharmed, and still holding Demon Blake's arm, clenched his hand, crushing it. Demon Blake grew the lost arm back and dashed backward a bit. Instead of going for him, Frieza went for Blake and Jak who were getting up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe 2 guys tried a combined beam but Frieza deflected it, hitting a nearby building, making it collapse. Then, aiming his hand at them. shot another energy ball, but Demon Blake appeared in front of them and took it himself. After the smoke vanished, it was seen that Demon Blake had lost both arms and was partially hollowed at the chest - stomach from the explosion. He regenerated it all, but was breathing heavily<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"This... doesn't seem like a fight... this seems to be rather an onslaught...\"- He said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Finally you understand it. Even one of the humans I killed once time ago was far stronger than this...\"- Frieza said arrogantly<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake and Jak stared at him with blank faces, the human he was referring to was obviously Krillin... and now they fully understood how nightmarish was Frieza in his WEAKEST state<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I guess all I have left to say is, it was nice to fight along you...\"- Blake said, reassuming the sevenfold light form<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Aww don't ruin the fun of this,  you are supposed to be terrified before dying...\"- Frieza complained, he then laughed and pointed his hand at them, ready to fire a lethal beam. However, he felt a sudden pain, it was Rocky, giving one of his strongest bites to Frieza's tail. Then, Tabitha, Max, and D'Artagnan arrived near Blake, Jak and Demon Blake. Frieza was comically trying to get Rocky to let go of his tail<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"A galactic emperor that destroys planets... struggles with a dog biting his tail...?\"- Blake and Jak wondered, while holding their laughter, and Demon Blake began to laugh hysterically until he fell, rolling in the floor laughing. After a while, Frieza could, after several attempts, get his tail released, although it got a deep mark and bled a bit, Rocky jumped backward, near the others. Blake gave him a thumbs up<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Good one\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrieza said nothing, but aimed a finger at them, and shot a thin beam, Demon Blake shot a wide black beam to counter it, but it was being pushed back by the thinner beam. Blake and Jak added their energy beams to aid Demon Blake, and with a lot of effort, they managed to win the energy struggling and hit Frieza, who this time had covered himself with his arms and tail in a defensive position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake, Jak and Demon Blake were all breathing heavily, it had taken a lot of effort to beat Frieza's beam. Frieza dashed toward them, taking everyone by surprise, punching Blake, kicking Jak, and stopping Rocky from biting him, then threw him away and dodged Max and Tabitha's slashes, however, before he could punch them D'Artagnan kicked him from behind and also bit his tail, using it as a grip to throw Frieza away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJak got up, Blake, who had lost the transformation reassumed it, and Demon Blake stood up as well. Frieza dusted himself off, and said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"More pests to take care of. This isn't fun anymore...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe desperation was clearly visible in Demon Blake's eyes, even when they lacked pupils and irises, and saying no words, went back into Blake, giving him his power. Blake looked almost like Demon Blake except he still had irises and pupils. The feeling of dark power within him wasn't one Blake was really used to, but he could feel his energy refilling, his wounds healing, and an immense, growing power. For the first time though, there isn't that evil influence trying to take over his thoughts. Jak had his jaw dropped when seeing all this<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Desperate measures I guess. Knowing the jerk, probably this kind of thing will never happen again...\"- Blake said, and stood in a fighting stance. A bit curious to test the dark powers near freely for the first time in his life. Jak decided to also increase the bets, and forced the muscled transformation to increase his power. Bake's pets quickly came to their side, but Blake said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Thank you. But I'm afraid only Jak and me can fight him...\"- They knew Blake was serious about this, and obeyed. Blake's voice had a slight metallic tone to it though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake and Jak charged at Frieza, this time, engaging into an exchange of punches and kicks, Jak got some lucky punches and Blake then kicked Friea into a building, destroying it, but knowing that wasn't enough, added a barrage of black energy balls. Frieza emerged from the smoke, and smiled<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Who would've thought you could still deliver a bit of entertainment?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrieza charged at Jak, but disappeared, going for Blake instead, who managed to stop both of Frieza's fists, and engaging into a struggle of brute strength. Blake decided to push his luck, and increased his power, more and more, and there was no strain. His power had gotten past the level achieved with the sevenfold golden aura, although not by too much. His muscles were tightening, and his black aura got black electric bolts flashing randomly around it. Even with this power increase, Frieza was much stronger, but Blake kneed him in the stomach, which caught him off guard, and Blake took the chance to get released from the struggle, and dashed a few meters backward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Blaze suddenly felt something strange, and turning to see, he noticed Blake was fused with his dark form, although not completely. He said, with some desperation in his voice<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Orochimaru!! Tell your minions to take Blake down NOW!!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Orochimaru said nothing, Pain, Ulquiorra and Grimmjow appeared in front of Blake, who extended his left arm outward and attracted his sword (which had been left on a building's top). Jak also quickly came by Blake's side, as well as his pets. This had gone past the hell category. Everyone charged, with Blake's pets taking on Pain, Jak taking on Grimmjow, leaving Blake against Ulquiorra and Frieza.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I have already fought your aberration of nature friend, and I'm mostly sure being merged with you tones down his powers... Why fight a lost battle? It's beyond my comprehension...\"- <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I could tell you why, but I won't bother...\"- Blake said, disappearing*, catching Ulquiorra off-guard, and punching him with great force in the stomach, sending him away, he then swapped the sword from his left to his right hand, and attacked Frieza, who overconfidently, blocked the blade with his forearm, and got cut, and Blake's slashes actually did small cuts on Frieza, but he fired an energy blast, which Bake shielded from with the sword, and before exploding the blast did push him back a bit, allowing Frieza to get a bit away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake then senses danger, and barely dodged a green Cero beam from Ulquiorra, Blake then fired a black beam at him, but Ulquiorra deflected it away with his hand, and said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Just like I said... weaker than the beast alone... fusing with you was a stupid decision on his part\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Agh!! That bastard!! Let me take over and I'll destroy every single particle of him!!' Demon Blake spoke inside Blake's mind<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'No excuse for taking over will ever work... just give me your damn power without restrictions...' Blake replied<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'You don't deserve to use my demonic abilities!!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Then we're both dead... and remember, you die if I do...'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I hate you so much... still no...'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Do you have any other idea?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size2\" style=\"\"><b>*Even when Blake is partially merged with his dark side, it still retains the full abilities from him, and as such, Blake still can't use the demonic Rakurai for fast movement, and still needs Shoshitsu.

However, it's weak. I will show you true darkness...\"- He then muttered -\"Cero Oscuras\"- And fired the infamous black cero, which was too fast for Blake to dodge. The explosion was so immense everyone moved away from it, as it destroyed almost all of the city at once. Once it ceased, Joana, desperated, (still giant sized) rushed toward where the explosion's center had been.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake thought he was going to die, but he was still alive... although he was in a lot of pain, and his body was badly damaged. He then found that his whole body was badly burned, and could barely move, but began to regenerate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'You owe me a big one... that's the kind of attacks only I can survive...' Demon Blake said, and ocne Blake was fully healed and his energy fully recovered, he defused from Blake, and said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I have an idea, but it will take a few minutes for it to work.

Frieza appeared behind Blake, ready to attack, but a giant fist struck him from above. Blake looked up, and saw Joana, who was angry and worried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I appreciate the reinforcements\"- Blake said, but was lifted and got a near crushing hug from his girlfriend, and after a few seconds she let go of him, and he said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I know why you're worried... I thought I was dead too... the jerk actually saved me this time...\"- Joana kissed him, and then he said -\"Not to ruin the moment, but we have an insanely powerful bat guy and a planet destroying emperor wanting to kill me right now...\"- Blake jumped from Joana's hand, and Frieza flew toward him, their fists clashed mid air, but Blake smiled and said -\"Lol... Bye...\"-, and kicked Frieza to gain impulse to jump to Joana's shoulder. Frieza was falling down, but he stopped, and before he could do anything, Joana kicked him away like a football.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Why you---?!!!\"- Frieza said as he disappeared into the distance<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Field goal win\"- Blake added<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Cero osc...\"- Ulquiorra appeared in front of Blake, and was about to fire another cero oscuras*, but Joana swatted him down, saying<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I hate bugs\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake laughed and gave Joana a thumbs up.

Jak dashed toward Grimmjow, and vanished at the last second. Grimmjow was confused for a moment, and was delivered a blow to his face. Jak had caught the Arrancar off-guard, knocking him back a bit. Grimmjow was suprised, and angry at this, so he immediately teleported behind Jak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You insolent fool.\" Grimmjow said, angrily. \"Do you who the hell-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJak immediately shot a ball of energy in his face. Grimmjow screamed, and then Jak kicked him in the chest, and this action caused the Arrancar to cough up blood, and Jak was starting to find his groove in this fight, and it seemed that he'd do just fine...until suddenly he found himself in a situation where Grimmjow used his Zanpakut\u014d to fight now. Jak started to dodge a lot of the hits, ducking, flying, and even shooting energy beams at Grimmjow, but it was either dodged or deflected by this manic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, your combat skills are pretty good.\" Grimmjow said, \"but my Zanpakut\u014d skill is also excellent, as I've been trained well...\" Then his hallow mask started to form around his face. \"But now I think we've had enough playing around haven't we?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJak looked up and started to fly away, trying to formulate a plan to dodge this crazy guy. He was running out of ki, due to using it on Frieza and also had to fight Seth, and Nostory earlier. Grimmjow appeared before Jak again, now pointing the sword at Jak's neck. Jak started to close his eyes, and hope for the best, and then Jasmine kicked Grimmjow as she appereared on the scene.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jasmine?\" I thought you were fighting the Seth and Shadow. \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was,but I need to make sure you were okay. Jasmine said, winking, \"Besides when we work together,we do some serious damage.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well</span></div></div>",

All it takes is time and practice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJasmine then kissed Jak, and suddenly the sourness and pain in his right arm went away. Jak smiled and then was given a big hug by his girlfriend. However, the loving moment wouldn't last too long, as Grimmjow was flying toward Jasmine, and he has hoping to catch her off guard.

Jak eventually settled down, and realized that he didn't need to win, but just stall for time. Blake and Joana were handing Frieza and Ulquiorra pretty well, since Joana hates bugs, and Blake, well Frieza was the only one to take on. Surprisingly, Jasmine was letting Jak take on Grimmjow by himself, and this was good for her, as she wasn't going to try and hinder him from battling, unless she absolutely had to. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go Jak!\" Jasmine was cheering. \"I'll be here if you need me!\" She had the ^_^ expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks!\" Jak said, as he smiled slightly, and then he continued to fight Grimmjow. And things were going well, until Jak saw a flying Frieza coming towards him. Jak dodged being hit by Frieza, as the self-proclamed Galactic Emperor crashed into a boulder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry about that Jak...\" Joana said. \"Didn't see you there...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's cool,\" Jak said. \"You guys seem to be holding up well against Frieza...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yup.\" Blake appeared alongside Jak. \"I guess we can go back to working together, since we're both here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Swee- BLAKE DUCK!\" Jak screamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jak, what is it with you and saying duck, I'm- HOLY CRAP, WTF\"  Blake ducked to avoid a flying Grimmjow, who crashed into Frieza. Blake, Joana, and Jak turned to see who attacked Grimmjow, and it was none other than Jasmine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry guys...\" Jasmine had a sweat drop. \"I kinda got a little excited when Blake said we were going to fight together.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem.\" Blake said. \"Let's do this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJak and Blake stepped back a bit, powered up, and started firing energy blasts at both Frieza and Grimmjow. Joana and Jasmine also added a few fireworks by adding their own beams to the mix. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what's this crazy plan that your dark side is working on?\" Jak said. \"Surely he won't try and leaves us like last time?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No...\" Blake said, but Jak raised his eyebrow. \"Well, I don't know, but we need to count on him, even if might he leave again...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Joana, what happened to that bug-like guy you were fighting?\" Jasmine said. \"I just realized he isn't around us yet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I kinda stepped on him, a few times, and smacked him around and you know...I hate bugs.\" Joana said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile Ulquiorra was in a crater, with the O_o' expression, shocked by Joana's power. \"How is she able to be so strong...this actually hurts. I guess you can never take women lightly anymore. I think I'm going to rest here til Frieza needs me...regain my strength. Not face that giant girl again....\" He then peaked up and saw Jasmine as well. \"There are two of them? Impossible...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Understandable, me neither, but I hate spiders the most. They kinda terrify me a bit...\" Jasmine said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrieza ultimately rose from assault that the 4 teenagers were dealing him, and he flew high in the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"ENOUGH!!! I WILL NOT BE DEFEATED BY MERE BUGS!\" Frieza screamed. \"YOU ALL ARE NOTHING COMPARED TO ME! I WILL KILL YOU ALL! JUST LIKE I WIPED OUT ALL THOSE MONKEYS ON PLANET VEGETA!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy crap,\" Jak said. \"We aren't even hurting him that bad, and he's pissed....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Temper, temper,\" Blake said. \"But yeah, this isn't good. If anything, we better hope that-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YOU! WITH THE WAVY HAIR. I'M GOING TO MAKE YOU SUFFER THE MOST OUT OF ALL YOUR FRIENDS.\" Frieza was still enraged and annoyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm assuming that he's still upset that you bit his tail...\" Jak said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, if Goku used it in battle, then why not?\" Blake said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrieza then used his signature Death Ball, which was a huge energy ball capable of destroying planets, on Jak and Blake. Jak and Blake knew they couldn't hold that off, so they started to dash super fast. Jasmine and Joana quickly followed suit and ran along side them. Blake's pets, who had been fighting Pain, also left, running at a similar speed to that of Blake's dash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We have to get as far as possible.\" Blake said. \"That thing is too huge for us to try and push back. But as long as we get away from it, we should be good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Didn't think he'd resort to that...\" Jak said, then he was suddenly grabbed by Jasmine and stuffed in her cleavage. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" Blake was also grabbed by Joana in put inside her cleavage. \"It's Frieza, you don't know what to expect...Anyway, I wonder if Grimmjow has any idea that there's a red energy ball of death coming near him?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good for us,\" Jak said. \"He gets killed, that's one less guy to worry about!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Demon Blake appeared. Blake powered up just in case his dark doppelganger was trying to pull a fast one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You better had come up with a good plan...\" </span></div></div>",

You just don't ask people about freaks!!\"- Vegeta facepalmed himself, but Goku descended to the city. There, he found a guy, with a dark-weird look, but Goku, smiling, said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Excuse me, have you seen anything out of the normal today?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Umm\"- The guy said, walking near Goku, then said -\"Actually yes, I just saw Majin Buu over there\"- Just then, there was an explosion, and Majin Buu (Gohan absorbed) came out, laughing maniacally<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Thanks... wait... how do you know about Majin Buu...?\"- Goku said, but the guy had suddenly disappeared -\"Weird.\"- Goku added, and went to face the evil monster. Vegeta arrived next to him<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Told you Vegeta, people can be helpful, now all we have to do is to wear the potara earrings and...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"And?\"- Vegeta asked, exasperated<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I can't seem to find them... I swear I got a pair from the supreme kai\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Are you kidding me Kakarot?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Nope\"- Goku desperately fumbled in both of his leg pockets, but there was nothing, and then, Majin Buu stood before them, with an evil look<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Crap...\"- Goku said</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n*End of flashback*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"And that's how I got these things... Now, all we have to do is fuse and kick Frieza's butt...err...tail, or whatever...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake and Jak gave him an 'Are you freaking kidding me?!' look<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"So... you FOUND freaking GOKU and VEGETA...\"- Blake said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"...and INSTEAD OF ASKING FOR HELP, YOU STOLE THE POTARA EARRINGS FROM THEM?!!\"- Jak added<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"ARE YOU FREAKING KIDDING US?!!\"- They said at once, while Demon Blake stared them with a poker face -\"WHAT...THE HELL...WERE YOU THINKING?!!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Give me a break!! I rushed to save your sorry lives!! Sheesh\"- Demon Blake said, and handed the earrings to Blake and Jak. He said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Anyway, WE can win with this...\"- He returned to Blake, and gave him near full dark power again. Blake, still with the earring in his hand, stared at it<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"If you ask me, I'm not exactly comfortable with having my boyfriend wearing earrings...\"- Joana said, Blake gave her a ._.' look -\"But if that saves us, I agree\"- She gave Blake a thumbs up. Jak nodded, and put the earring on his left ear, and Blake did the same with the right one. They were drawn together and fused. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"And here comes...Jakle? Man, I need to work on my name... but there's no time for that right now...\"- Jakle, the fusion of Blake and Jak, emerged from the light, differently from before, this time, he had Jak's skin tone, Blake's brown jacket over Jak's clothes, and hair that was a mix of Blake's and Demon Blake's. Also, one of his eyes was completely white, with no visible iris nor pupil.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe flew toward where the explosion had taken place. Frieza was there, and stared angrily at the newcomer<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Who are you and what do you want?!!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I'm here to play videogames and kick bad guys... and since you destroyed all videogames in miles around...\"- Jakle smiled, and disappeared, reappearing in front of Frieza, and kicking him in the face, with great force, sending him crashing into the remains of a building.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"WHAT?!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJakle walked calmly toward him<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You've had your fun so far, haven't you?\"- He then cracked his knuckles -\"Game over\"- He punched Frieza in the stomach, and fired a bluish energy beam to his face, the beam was actually wide enough to engulf Frieza before exploding. Frieza had a shocked and angry face, and rushed to punch Jakle, who took the punch in the face, but didn't move a single inch, although the ground around them cracked and sank from the punch's strength.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrieza dashed backward and, while looking at him, Jakle noticed Blaze, Aizen, Nostory, Seth and Orochimaru were standing on a neraby building, which was damaged but hadn't collapsed. Blaze threw a scouter at Frieza, who caught it, and put it on, but before pushing the button, Jakle fired a thin beam from his finger, destroying it. Frieza had again the shocked and angry expression<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Nuh-uh. No cheating\"- Jakle then fires a beam that destroys the building Blaze and the others are standing on, and they disappear, but reappear to somewhere else nearby. 'I'll take care of these guys later. Big fish first...well, lizard, or whatever...'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrieza charged at Jakle again, but he countered with a black beam from one of his hands and a white beam from the other. This beam pushed Frieza away some distance before exploding. Jakle then began to fire a barrage of dark energy balls along white non-elemental ones. Frieza, for the first time, took actual damage, and had some burns from the attacks he received. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Last time I hadn't gotten to use darkness. Cool\"- Jakle said, looking at his hand, and Frieza appeared again, but Jakle, seemingly absent minded, backhanded him away with the other hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"YOU...WILL...SUFFER!! I'LL CRUSH YOU, INSECT!!\"- Frieza charged again at Jakle, but he caught his forearm, and aimed his other hand at Frieza's face, very close. Then, with a somewhat psychotic look, said calmly<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I don't think I'll be the one suffering\"- And blasted him away with a large black beam. Then, appeared before Frieza (Note: So far, Jakle has been using only raw physical speed, a.k.a godspeed), and unsheathing Blake's sword, slashed him, although Frieza disappeared, had only gotten cut, not very deep, but the cut was long enough to go across his whole chest. He put a hand on the wound, feeling his own blood, and with even more anger, he shouted<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"THAT'S IT, YOU ARE DEAD!!\"- Frieza then<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You mad?\"- Jakle asked, laughing, then Frieza proceeded to transform, assuming his second form -\"Oh...\"- He said, and Frieza disappeared, reappearing behind him and attempted to punch him, however, Jakle blocked Frieza's fist with Blake's sword, and then, their fists clashed, creating a shockwave that further sank a large portion of the fround around them and damaged the surroundings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoana and Jasmine, who had walked toward them, but keeping their distance, watched how their fused boyfriends were beating Frieza.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"It's amazing that just by fusing they can surpass someone that powerful...\"- Joana commented -\"Although I can't feel his power... it feels like if it were blurry. So far, I can only feel Blake's presence and power...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Well, Potara fusion is quite a powerful thing, no wonder it's much better than the fusion dance...\"- Jasmine said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I thought they were about the same\"- Joana said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You need to watch dragon ball and pay a bit more attention\"- Jasmine said with a n_n face -\"Potara is more powerful than the dance, and it's actually flawless... doesn't need to balance the powers, doesn't need to do the dance, and, has no time limit...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Wait...\"- The last part rang an alarm in Joana's mind -\"If it has no time limit...how do they defuse?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"That's the point, they don't...\"- Jasmine had said with just the same expression, but then, realized what was Joana's point, and said -\"...wait...wait a moment......they DON'T defuse...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth girls had poker faces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack to Jakle, he was fighting Frieza's second form, and despite Frieza was twice as strong as before, Jakle was still fighting near evenly, and maybe Jakle's only advantage was to keep cool and not blinded by rage, as Frieza, who is angered at the humilliation he's got, and that he can't stand the existence of people stronger than himself. Frieza then used energy blasts against Jakle, but he blocked most of them with Blake's sword, and countered with his own, using dark ones because it was a bit stronger than regular energy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrieza was growing angrier, and transformed to his third form, the power making air feel heavy in a large radius. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"And I hated the Alien movie... this is just as bad...\"- Jakle commented, and stood in a fighting stance...</span></div></div>",

He got up, with only the ringing pain from the attack, but no other damage, and thought<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Maybe I should be called Jablek... I dunno...GAH!! Why am I thinking about trivial stuff during a fight?!!\"- Then he cupped his hands to make his voice sound tronger, and shouted -\"Hey, I'm here, pirate copy of a Xenomorph!!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrieza instantly rushed toward him, attempting to punch him, but Jablek(?)* smiled, and, after transforming into Blake's light form, used shoshitsu to disappear. and reappear above Frieza, firing an immense golden beam, that blew up all the debris around, and also created a huge fire. Jablek reappeared somewhere near but safe from the fire, and looking at his hands said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Wow. The basic light transformation works awesomely. Who needs steroids when there's potara fusion?!!\"- He laughed, and saw how the angrier Frieza got out of the fire, with some burns, and began to fire a barrage of finger lasers at him. He began to dodge them using shoshitsu, but realized that the speed and firing rate was increasing, and undoubtedly, his power had to be increasing**<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then was hit in the left cheek by a laser, and it caused a small wound that bled<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You HAD to hit me in the face...\"- He said angrily, then, increasing the golden aura power to 5 times his base power, he flew, and punched Frieza in the stomach, and performed an insane air combo of punches and kicks, and aiming his hands at Frieza, he fired a whitish golden beam<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Celestial Drill Cannon!!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd added to the beam being fired, he flew toward Frieza, drilling him down all the way until he hit the ground. The beam also made a nuclear-like explosion of golden fire. Jablek stared at the column of fire that reuslted from his attacks, and muttered<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"This is even more awesome... Drill cannon + golden aura x5 = epic win\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA laser beam that slashed his left shoulder was what he got for an answer. -\"Huh?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrieza emerged in his final form, and Jablek, having a bad feeling, powered to 7 times, and prepared to counter attack. Frieza disappared, and so did he, they clashed at extreme speeds multiple times, and then, Jablek managed to hit Frieza with a golden beam, which made another large explosion. This time, Jablek didn't leave it just like that, and began to fire multiple beams. In difference of Blake, the sevenfold light form didn't strain Jablek, who was much stronger, resistant and had way more stamina and vast energy reserves. The energy usage wasn't an issue for him, even if he was using enormous amounts of power that would have drained Blake dry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJablek then charged up the next beam to make it stronger, but when he fired it, it hit some sort of shield, the beam dispersed upon impact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Shinra...Tensei...\"- Pain was the one who blocked the beam, and Jablek, knowing there was a delay between reuse of the shinra tensei technique, charged at him, but was forced to dodge Ulquiorra's and Grimmjow's Ceros (Cero Oscuras and Gran Rey Cero respectively). Frieza came from inside the flames, with only light damage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Ganging up?\"- He assumed a fighting stance, similar to Blake's, and said -\"Come!!\"- He fought Ulquiorra, Grimmjow and Pain at once. Blocking the incoming punch from Grimmjow, and punching him away, breaking a part of his chest bone armor. He also caught a Lanza del Rel\u00e1mpago thrown at him by Ulquiorra, and threw it back, effectively hitting him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPain, who had gotten enough time to recover chakra, used the Shinra Tensei to repel Jablek, but by pure strength, he was able to stand in place, and hit him brutally. Pain tried to stab him with one of his black chakra blades, but Jablek caught it, and by squeezing it, broke it to pieces. Pain tried again with two chakra blades, but Jablek shattered them with his bare hands, and took the chance to fire an energy beam right to Pain's chest, pushing him a great distance away and exploding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrieza then attacked Jablek, and they exchanged ounches and kicks. This time, as Frieza kept increasing his power, Jablek took more and more damage, although it didn't incapacitate him and kept fighting in the sevenfold state. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJasmine and Joana watched the fight, but still had their poker faces upon realizing that the fusion was forever...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJablek began to realize that despite he wasn't getting badly kicked, he was getting worn out from damage and from the energy he had been using up, although his enemies were suffering far worse damage, except Frieza who seemed to be even with Jablek, and his power still rising. He charged a death beam and fired it as a blade, then, he added two death cannons (energy spheres) which made two nuclear-level explosions along an electric aura around the explosion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJablek was heavily damaged from this, and was breathing heavily. He used shoshitsu to dodge a finger laser from Frieza, and after getting somewhat away, reverted back to his base form. Then, he was surrounded in a black aura, and assumed Blake's dark form. It also healed all the damage he had taken, and refilled his energy reserves. He said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Problem, Frieza?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"YOU WILL DIE ANYWAY!!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrieza charged at him, and Jablek kicked him, but received some punches from Frieza. Then, Jablek hit Frieza with two large golden beams. During the explosion he let the dark power replenish his energy once again. However, Frieza appeared behind him, and hit him with his tail, sending him to near the opposite side of the city.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"The hell?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You had been fighting me at 1% of my power...\"- Frieza laughed -\"I have increased it to 10%\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"...the...hell...10 times stronger?!\"- Jablek was unable to do anything else as Frieza again disappeared, and reappering above Jablek, added <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"20%\"- And fired a barrage of finger beams. Jablek covered with his arms, but they got badly burned. He changed to near full dark mode, to allow the energy replenishing and healing factor to work all the time# and dashed to fight Frieza. Jablek forced as much dark power as he felt he could, and managed to land some hits on Frieza, who answered by powering up further.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"50%... I can't believe I have to go this far against you tailess monkey...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Stupid Darwin and his evolution...\"- Jablek mumbled 'Hmm... while using dark powers I begin to feel the urge to act pervertedly... stupid dark jerk and his influence...' He shook those thoughts away and focused on Frieza, who even toyed wit him, moving so fast there were 4 afterimages, and the 4 charged at him. Jablek couldn't dodge any of them, and Frieza punched and kicked him like there was no tomorrow. Grimmjow, Pain, and Ulquiorra emerged again, and while Pain threw chakra blades at him, Grimmjow and Ulquiorra charged their ceros (Gran Rey and Oscuras respectively). Jablek was nearly knocked out by this point, and as he fell to his knees, he said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Damn it... I thought the Potara fusion would make us invincible...\"- He then laughed, saying -\"If Frieza was this bad, I don't want to even imagine Cell or Majin Buu...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"TOLD YOU!! YOU DIE!!\"- Frieza charged a death ball, as well as yet another Gran Rey Cero and a Cero Oscuras from Grimmjow and Ulquiorra. Pain prepared his Chibaku Tensei... However, 4 mysterious figures appeared, neutralizing the attacks. After the smoke vanished, Jablek saw them, and could only have an amazed face...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><font class=\"size25\" style=\"\">*Name still undecided<br>\r\n**Blake and Jak still can't sense others' energies, so, there's no way Jablek can get that ability. The only one with the ability is Demon Blake but it's one of the abilities he has kept from Blake, along flight and rakurai (fast movement). Jablek gets his flying from Jak.<br>\r\n# Interestingly, unlike Blake, Jablek can still access at least shoshitsu while in dark form. Blake has to use godspeed (physical speed) due to him being unable to use either shoshitu or rakurai. <br>\r\nAs a secondary note, yes, I know Frieza doesn't have the afterimage ability, however, in other animes it's a technique done by just extreme speed, and well, Frieza's power is abysmally above even Jablek's by this point so...no debates about particular anime physics in a universe where they are guest characters...<br>\r\nLast note... Jablek's phrase is indeed a reference to one of Vegetto's, although I don't know exactly where it's from, I heard it in a Baby Vegeta vs Vegetto fan video</font></b></span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jablek, still on his knees, was offered a hand to stand up, and he accepted it, but couldn't hide the surprise in his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Goku...AWESOME!!\"- He then looked -\"Ichigo... AWESOME!!...Luigi...INCREDIBLE!!\"- He then noticed the fourth one -\"Uhm...Naruto? Meh...\"- (By the way, Ichigo is at Shikai, Goku and Naruto are in normal form)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"How dare you...?! Why I'm the only one who is not AWESOME!! I'm the next Hokage!!\"- Naruto reinforced his phrase by poiting at his coat, which was in fact Minato's<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Yeah yeah whatever...Anyway YOU stole my idea... one of the guys that fused into me wears his father's jacket for way longer than you...\"- Naruto had a -.-\" face<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJablek and Naruto began to argue comically, but Goku told them to calm down. He then stared at the villains<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"We meet again Frieza\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"YOU AGAIN!!\"- Frieza had a face very similar to the raisins meme ( <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://k03.kn3.net/B1A0E2F6F.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://k03.kn3.net/B1A0E2F6F.jpg</a> )<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUlquiorra and Ichigo stared at each other, and Grimmjow said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"DON'T...EVEN...THINK ABOUT IT!! Ichigo is MY rival!!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Good. We'll capture the Kyuubi as well\"- Pain said, and Naruto's answer was to laugh at the damaged Pain. Luigi said nothing, but gave Jablek a thumbs up, and Jablek thought 'I feel the strong urge to have this guy's autograph...why, though?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"...Hey...\"- Goku said, paying more attention to Jablek, and noticed he was wearing the Potara earrings -\"So... that's where the Potara earrings ended up...\"- Jablek gulped, having Frieza as an enemy was already bad... angering one of the strongest beings in all the universes has just no comparison, and all he could manage to pull off was to do a poker face, while thinking 'Damnitdamnitdamnitdamnit' followed by 'Stupid dark jerk and his idea of stealing the potara earrings...'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, there was no anger in Goku, who had a n.n face, and added -\"Vegeta achieved super saiyan 3 recently and decided to take vengeance on Buu himself\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then looked at the city, and that Jablek had healed all of the damage -\"I have to give you merit. A human fighting Frieza to such level. I'd bet Vegeta would be mad\"- Goku gave a thumbs up to Jablek, who had an overly amazed face. Ichigo had been mostly silent at first, not really too surprised of someone being able to fight Ulquiorra or Grimmjow, but, when he noticed Frieza's presence, it was overwhelming, somewhat neutralized by Goku's. The he noticed what Frieza would be capable of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen they charged at each other, Naruto went for Pain, Ichigo went for Grimmjow, and Goku for Frieza. Jablek stared at Ulquiorra<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I guess I get to beat you...\"- However, Luigi stepped forward, signaling he would fight Ulquiorra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Are you sure? He's somewhat strong...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Oh yeah\"- He replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Nonsense. What can a italian plumber do to fight? Nevermind, I'll just kill y...\"- Ulquiorra was cut off by Luigi's Super Jump Punch, which sent the 4th Espada rocketing in the sky, and seemingly vanishing as a star, even with a slight blink sound. Everyone had O.O faces except for Grimmjow who just tried to attack Ichigo, but had to cover from a Getsuga Tensho.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuigi waved at the sky, saying -\"Bye Bye\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"That was a lot easier than I thought...\"- Jablek said<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, they heard a low sonic boom, and Ulquiorra was standing before them again<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"That was certainly annoying\"- <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJablek was quick to draw Blake's sword, but then heard another voice<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You should check better who are you fighting with...\"- Blaze was standing behind Jablek, who quickly dashed away and turned around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You're pretty stupid to come and fight me...\"- He said, and they charged at each other, their fists clashing, cracking the ground below them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack to Luigi and Ulquiorra...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUlquiorra fired a Cero Oscuras but it missed, as Luigi dodged it, shooting his green fireballs. And they engaged into a high speed combat, even more surprisingly, with Luigi being able to keep up with Ulquiorra's speed*.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Grimmjow, who was in his Resurrecci\u00f3n form already, fired a Cero at Ichigo, seemingly hitting him, but after the smoke vanished, he emerged in his bankai state, and charged at him. Goku confronted Frieza in his normal state, seemingly having an even fight**.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUlquiorra used sonido to get behind Luigi, and was ready to fire a point blank cero oscuras from behind, but Luigi's eyes glowed in white, he put his hands together, and chanted something while doing a strange dance, and suddenly they were surrounded by a green force field, and Ulquiorra felt a crushing weight that prevented him from moving... similar to Aizen's reiatsu when he punished the Espada...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuigi then started a fast combo of punches, kicks and fireballs, while Ulquiorra was unable to move. His wounds also couldn't regenerate while inside the field. When the force field began to vanish, Luigi used another super jump punch, sending Ulquiorra high in the sky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Phew!\"- Luigi wiped off a bit of sweat from his forehead, and waved 'bye bye' again to Ulquiorra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile... Blaze's plan wasn't going too well... In fact, he was being badly kicked and punched by Jablek, who did so almost effortlessly<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Ha!! I knew you weren't anywhere near Frieza's level... You suck Blaze!!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze's usually covered eyes glowed in bright red, and he shouted -\"I...SUCK?!!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Yes. A lot...\"- Jablek replied<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"...\"- Blaze growled in anger -\"Screw releasing Omega!! YOU...ARE...DEAD!!\"- Blaze charged at him, with two dark purple energy balls in his hands, and surrounded by a dark purple as well aura. It seemed that Blaze was putting all his power in this attack, and ground the two energy balls into Jablek's chest, causing a large explosion, and a tower of purple fire-like darkness rose afterward. Blaze disappeared and reappeared some distance away from the explosion's remains.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Who sucks now?!!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You...\"- Jablek replied, laughing. He was only slightly burned, and even his clothes were barely damaged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"W-What?!!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"HEH!! I knew grinding an energy ball into someone is plain stupid...\"- Jablek said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You SHUT UP!!\"- Naruto shouted from the distance<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze was more damaged by his own technique than Jablek. And he was breathing heavily<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What kind of sorcery is this?!!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Potara earrings. Pretty awesome, aren't they?\"- <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I hate you...\"- <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Jablek and Blaze felt the ground shake, as Joana and Jasmine rushed toward them after the explosion<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Bla...Jak...Blejak...Ah!! Whatever your name is... are you ok?\"- Joana said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Jablek please... and yeah... this guy did nothing more than lift up some dust...\"- Jablek replied (he flew up to her face level)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Wow...\"- Jasmine added -\"By the way...Jablek... How are you supposed to get defused?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Defused?\"- Jablek scratched his chin thoughtfully, not understanding the question... a minute later, he had a poker face, and the girls realized about this as well<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Um... If you don't defuse... how are you...we...supposed...?\"- Joana mumbled<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of Jablek's eyes turned completely blank, and he laughed<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Don't worry ladies... There's enough Jablek for both of you...Not at your current size, but still...\"- Jablek punched himself to interrupt the perverted lapsus -\"Sorry... jerkish influence kicked in for a moment, but I'm alright... Anyway, I have no idea... I guess we can ask Goku after the fight's over...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, Aizen, Nostory, and Seth appeared in front of them<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I guess you can't take this guy down by yourself. I shall join the fight to ensure success\"- Aizen said, unsheathing his zanpakuto<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Yeah. I want to kick this guy's ass anyway\"- Seth added<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoana and Jasmine stood in their fighting stances, with Jasmine saying<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"It'll be 3 you'll have to take down...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"It's not like I'm going to let any of you hurt my half-boyfriend\"- Joana said, and mentally laughed at her own phrase.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Fine\"- Blaze said<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so... yet another battle started...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size2\" style=\"\"><b>*Super Mario Bros.

Blaze would be knocked back a bit, and Nostory would weave under the energy wave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You fool,\" Nostory said, as his sliver mask shined. \"You know good and well, that me and Blaze aren't to be toyed with. Just because you two are fused doesn't make you un-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa whoa whoa...\" Jablek said. \"Listen, Toy Story, did you see what I did a few minutes ago? GIRLY BOY here struggled!\" Jablek then laughed for a brief moment. \"Like you're going to do any better!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze's response was a demonic roar, flashing red eyes, and he would deliver a punch to Jablek's face. The impact of the hit was so strong, that a shockwave was felt. A huge crater was made in the middle of the spot where Blaze and Jablek stood. Everyone's eyes turned to see what had occurred. Jasmine and Joana instantly got worried about their now-fused boyfriend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, how's that for a punch.\" Blaze said. \"Now do you regret saying that-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah not really,\" Jablek said, Blaze's fist still in his face, \"But isn't it funny?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze's face: O_O<br>\r\nNostory's face: O_o<br>\r\n\"H-how-\" Blaze got kicked in the face in response, and went flying though the air. Jablek then pursed after Blaze to lay a beating. Nostory would fly after Jablek and fire a energy ball at him, but it was deflected. Blaze stopped flying though the air and would charge right at the fused fighter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Joana and Jasmine were fighting against the team of Aizen and Seth. Joana was handling Aizen, merely standing and using her fists to attack and elbows to defend. Jasmine was of course handing Seth, and she was under heavy fire from a storm of dark purple energy balls shot by the deamon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hah.\" Seth said. \"Come on Jasmine...You finally ran out of batteries haven't you? I really don't blame you. Fighting us for many years make take a toll.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Seth!\" Jasmine said, smiling. \"Here's your gift back...there were too many pieces of it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJasmine had broken though the raining energy balls, and her fist was glowing with light inside of it. \"So here's a full package!\" Seth took a heavy blow. Seth stood there, in shock, but continued to fight on, with Jasmine and him continuing to exchange kicks and punches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoana was also handling Aizen with ease, punching him in the air, and knocking him around, literally like a pinball. Aizen pondered. 'I see why Nostory and Blaze place the highest priority on these girls. They are very powerful...I guess we should take them a bit more seriously...'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAizen then seemly stopped Joana's barrage of punches with just using both his hands to hold her right first. Joana immediately fired a blast at Aizen with her left hand. Aizen's eyes widened and he braced himself...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile Goku and Frieza were going at it, just like in their classic battle that happened at Namek. Goku used his Kaioken briefly to punch Frieza with more power and speed. Frieza stepped back and started to fire his Death Beams, and in a rapid fire like fashion, but Goku dodged all of them, teleported in front of Frieza and fired a Kamehameha wave at point blank range, and the former galactic emperor widened his eyes as the blue beam hit him...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuigi and Ulquiorra were going back and forth, trying to stay even and not giving an inch, with Luigi firing a barrage of his green fireballs at Ulquiorra. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not bad for an a plumber...\" Ulquiorra said, kinda of shocked. \"But enough of this nonsense. Lanza del Rel\u00e1mpago...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUlquiorra then held a Javelin like blade made of energy, and promptly threw it at Luigi, and sensing the danger of the attack, Luigi dodged the blade, and it flew near Ichigo and Grimmjow, who both were fighting very intently, both of their  Zanpakut\u014ds clashing, suddenly there was an huge explosion in that spot where the two were fighting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto and Pain were dueling, with Naruto just using the Big Ball Rasengan on Pain. The Akatsuki Leader dodged one, and the other one hit him, sending him in the air flying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was beams flying everywhere, it was pure chaos, and everyone was fighting hard...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The explosion was enormous, and left golden flames lingering aftewards- Nostory charged at Jablek from above, but his kick had no effect on the fused hero, and was elbowed in the stomach by him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Naruto, who had been fighting evenly against Pain, entered Sage Mode, formed 2 big ball rasengans with the help of 2 clones and attacked Pain with them. Goku used a Kaiokenx20 Kamehameha on Frieza, and Ichigo used his hollow mask and unleashed a massive Getsuga Tensho on Grimmjow. Luigi used the Negative Zone (his final smash in Brawl) to paralyze Ulquiorra and sending him high i the sky with a perfectly done Super Jump Punch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAizen managed to stop an incoming punch from Joana and used shunpo to come near Orochimaru, on top of a building.

I guess...Jebl...Jabl...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Jablek...\"- And he flew to her hand, kissing it kinda gentleman-style<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"HEY!!\"- Joana shouted from some distance away<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Relax... technically she's my half girlfriend...\"- Jablek said to her<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"That sounded so disturbing and weird...\"- Jasmine commented<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Maybe, but it makes sense in this context...\"- Jablek then seemed to be lost in thoughts briefly, he suddenly said -\"Whoah... to be a fused guy is kinda complicated... at certain times one of the halves kinda kicks in, you know?\"- He waved goodbye and flew to where Joana was, and also helped her to fight Aizen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever fighting Aizen was much more difficult. Aizen was armed, so Jablek had to call Blake's sword. Also, he kept his guard on because of the potentially fatal danger of falling into Aizen's hypnosis. AND also Aizen was an extremely skilled fighter, with knowledge of many kido spells and impressive strength and speed. Still, Jablek managed to punch Aizen away through a building, and Jablek himself flew to Joana's shoulder<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Seriously to be fused is messing me up a bit... You're also a nice girl. Your boyfriend is very lucky. Heh, I am half as lucky\"- He joked. After that he also gave her a kiss on a cheek, and went to continue fighting, while also telling her to rest a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Hey, Aizen-nerd, Girly Blaze, and you two stupid morons whose names I don't care about enough to even remember... COME!!\"- Jablek was indeed cocky, but on purpose. He really didn't want neither girl, Joana nor Jasmine, to be harmed by these bad guys...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"How unoriginal... I don't even wear glasses anymore...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Hey Nostory, remember the fist-sandwich we owed that kid? This one wants today's special. Supreme fist burger with triple fist shoved down a throat, accompanied by kicks...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I have the feeling you are just hungry...\"- Jablek said to Seth<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Let's just split this guy in half so we are over with this...\"- Nostory said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I swear that if you call me girly ONE...MORE...TIME...I WILL KILL YOU!!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Uhhh......................................GIRLY!!\"- </span></div></div>",

I'll be writing a chapter of pure awesomeness with some epicness. This might be considered as a teaser.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs powerman appeared, zenn was with the other ryans, their friends, and family.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\u201cThose four should know better than to jump to conclusions.\u201d- ryan k. said as his friend nodded<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Zenn, we too are also ryan so not to confuse you; the ryan you just met is powerman, I\u2019m ryan k., and the other ryan is animan.\u201d- ryan k. explained to him and zenn nodded<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Zenn, you came in on our domain and we have some rules for you to follow.\u201d- ryan k. said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\u201cYou can go anywhere of the ship, but you have to use your manners and don\u2019t judge our friends.\u201d- ryan s. said as zenn nodded<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\u201cThat is fair.\u201d- he said<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAniman felt some feelings from zenn and he knew the feelings all too well. Animan took zenn to the training field and he has an angered look on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\u201cYou need to drop those feelings and change your way of thinking about friendship and do things on your own.\u201d- animan said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You won\u2019t change my mind.\u201d- zenn said<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAniman smiled as zenn took his defensive stance and his fists are in their position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\u201cLet\u2019s see if you can beat me.\u201d- animan said still smiling<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn that minute, animan vanished and punched zenn in the chest resulting in zenn sliding back some feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\u201cYou must be strong.\u201d- animan said<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAniman charged at him at full speed and he threw a punch, which would have landed in zenn\u2019s stomach; but zenn caught it and started to do a big combo with massive damage. Zenn launched his opponent into the air before sending him into the ground. Zenn is back into his defensive stance while animan was getting up and healing his wounds, but the smile never left his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\u201cWell, you know when to strike big and your defensive is good for a normal fight; but we both know that we have powers and it\u2019s time to use them.\u201d- animan said as he started to raise his power level<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZenn followed suit and summoned his fire swords quickly, which are 2\u20191/2\u201d feet long and one is slanted where the blade is tip is next to his head while the other one is nearly touching the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"So this is going to be a fire fight, then I better take it up a level.\u201d- animan said as the swirled around him fiercely and the howling wind can be heard<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKarina looked at her scanner and she was surprised to see animan\u2019s power level raising where zenn power level is at 18,000. Animan\u2019s power went from 0 to 20,000 in seconds flat and it is still raising; but who knows when it will stop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\u201cHe must be trying something.\u201d- powerman said watching the fight, but he is concentrating on his brother<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\u201cOur creator ran away from everything when his mother passed away and I was trying to bring him out of his depression. I used almost everything to get him out, but it only worked to a certain extent.\u201d- he said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\u201cWhat haven\u2019t you tried?\u201d- Claire asked him<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\u201cThe one thing that worked; I used force and rage to take over and I had to be Ryan Hostetter till we had gotten to this point.\u201d- powerman said with a frown<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\u201cHe had given up on everything and just worked on getting out of high school before taking a year off before starting college. During that year, he was depressed and that was when ryan and I tried breaking the grief and guilt that he was feeling; but he was able to finally push those thoughts away.\u201d- he added with a sad smile<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\u201cHe truly cares for his mother and her death did so much damage to him, but no one can stop death only delay it.\u201d He said as he walked toward animan\u2019s family<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe used a hand to caress animan\u2019s mother and his sister\u2019s face before he caught a fireball from animan who was still gathering power.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\u201cHe still feels that pain and he hasn\u2019t learned to let go even though I have learned to let go, but he has a problem of letting go of the past.\u201d- he said as he absorbed the fireball<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe turned to their ashley and the other girls from animan\u2019s homeworld.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\u201cHe had a feeling of protection towards all of you and he wants to protect you, but he never said a word about caring for you.\u201d- he said to them<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKarina looked back at her scanner and noticed that animan\u2019s power level stopped at 100,000.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\u201cHe is showing no strain or tiredness.\u201d- she said as she was looking at animan<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\u201cThat\u2019s nothing.\u201d- powerman said looking at the scanner<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\u201cRyan and I must have stopped at 500,000 or higher; but that was only when we were dealing with some strong monsters and they were after aizen. Naraku on the other hand kept using his demon puppets to escape death while that snake orochimaru used other people so he could live forever, but we won\u2019t have to worry about him anymore.\u201d- he said<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone turned back to the fight and animan was cracking his joints before making his body relax. He revealed his zanpakuto and he charged at his opponent even faster than before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\u201cZenn, you can make friends and then have true friends who will never stab you in the back.\u201d- he said before he clashed swords with him<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZenn pushed him back before throwing fireballs at him and he merely absorbed them easily, but zenn started another combo attack on animan. He broke the attack before zenn could do more damage to him and started to do some real damage by using his speed and zenn finally got some cuts on his face and on his chest before he could get away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"People are corrupt and twisted. You don't know the real face of the world.\" Zenn ran alongside two fireballs, quickly reaching Animan. He dodged the fireballs, but received a hard kick that sent him into the air. Zenn jumped after him, only to be smashed down by Animan. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've met bad people. We can show-\" A beam from Zenn interrupted him. He slid a bit, and Zenn took a few swings at him. Animan dodged them, kicking Zenn onto the ground. Animan moved to step on his chest and restrain him, but instead met a solid wall of fire. Zenn threw it up, throwing off Animan's balance. He kicked into his chest with both feet, forcing Animan back a few yards. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It seems like there aren't good people. We're all corrupted. You think you aren't? Or anyone with powers isn't? Give someone power and they use it for their own gain.\" Zenn spoke only what he had found to be true. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You haven't had time to get to know any of us.\" Animan attempted to hold his ground, but Zenn's problem ran deeper than he had thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I won't even get a chance! I could be in another world tomorrow! I don't have any control of it! Jaxx. Stole. My. Life.\" with each of these four words, his power flared up. He hovered around 75,000. He fired a beam that Animan barely sidestepped. He clashed with Animan again, his blades getting much hotter, with flares of blue flame. Animan was burned around his wrists and arms, while Zenn was barely holding his ground with Animan in a contest of brute force. He finally broke away, unable to hold ground any longer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZenn began showing strain from extended time above normal state. Animan however, looked fine. His burns began to fade. Zenn made another charge, clashing with Animan in a true duel. Animan fired a beam from point blank, which exploded on Zenn's chest, sending him rolling away. Zenn looked at Animan, breathing heavily. He threw his swords into the air and watched them disappear. He fell back to normal state and started walking away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You win.\" Zenn walked away and left Animan in the training ring.</span></div></div>",

YOU GOTTA BE KIDDING ME!!\"- Naruto exclaimed<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Alright... time for another round!!\"- Goku said happily, transforming into a super saiyan<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What is wrong with that guy?\"- Naruto wondered<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Complaining won't stop them. We better fight anyway...\"- Ichigo said, activating his hollow mask, ready for another round against Grimmjow. Naruto entered Sage Mode again, and then nearly dismayed when the 6 paths of Pain stood before him, screaming<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"WHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAT?!!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"It was obvious all of us would be fully healed, moron...\"- Pain (Deva) said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Stupid guys they get to fight one on one and I have to deal with these 6 idiots...\"- Naruto mumbled<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNostory, Seth and Blaze were fighting Jablek, who used the golden aure to power himself up. Aizen wasn't even bothering to fight, but was watching, possibly to land a finishing strike in the best (worst for Jablek) possible moment. Blaze used a spell to create energy chains, and used them to restrain both of Jablek's arms with Nostory's and Seth's help, then Aizen unsheathed his zanpakuto and charged at Jablek, intending to impale him in the chest. However, it didn't... as Aizen's zanpakuto met a white-transparent energy shield, protecting Jablek, who laughed and said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Sorry to disappoint you... but I have a guardian angel, you see...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoana was standing behind (and towering over) Aizen, who had no time to react as she stomped him. Surprisingly, Aizen was strong enough to hold up Joana's foot although with difficulty. Blaze, Nostory and Seth were surprised, and didn't notice Jasmine crouching, and taking Nostory and Seth in each hand, and squeezing them, Blaze stepped back, and said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Uh... guys... we can talk about this... maybe if y...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJablek punched Blaze in the stomach, and said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"DENIED\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, he began to suspect... Blaze wouldn't just back out, and then heard Blaze's typical maniacal laugh, while he was chanting<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Eternal flames that rise from hell... Darken everything, burn their souls down to ashes... The name of the Devil... The mark of the ancient beasts... Ten thousand dead claiming for blood, ignite the light and extinguish it forever... Obliterate, Flames of Tartarus!!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAizen, Nostory and Seth quickly disappeared from where they had been, letting Jablek, Joana, and Jasmine get caught by Blaze's spell, which shot dark purplr flames that extended all over the place. The flames rose tens of meters high into the sky, and din't seem to be exintuishing anytime soon<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Heh... even with my current power, that is a dark version of one of the most powerful spells ever... Their flames consume everything, specially light natured energy, so, these flames will just feast on those 3...\"- Blaze said and laughed again -\"Those idiots fell for it!! My clone was the perfect decoy!!\"- However, he abruptly stopped laughing when he noticed the flames suddenly vanished... in the center of the damaged area, Jablek was standing, heavily damaged and badly burned. He actually managed to take most of the spell himself, so, Joana and Jasmine had just been knocked out, but were safe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"HEH!! So you still wanted to act like the big hero and take all the damage yourself? You suck!! And now you're in no condition to protect those overgrown girls anyway...\"- Blaze said. Jablek only gave him a very angry glare, and disappeared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe quickly reappeared, and punched Nostory and Seth away, and pierced Blaze's chest with his fist. But, instead of reacting only to the pain, Blaze laughed, as Aizen appeared behind Jablek, and slahed him several times with his zanpakuto, then, Blaze removed Jablek's arm from his chest and healed the wound, while Aizen used Hado \u00b763, Raikoho, to fire a powerful lightning beam at point blank, striking the fused hero down with tremendous force, as well as destroying a few buildings around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, Jablek got up, willing to fight, and Blaze answered by creating hundreds of clones of himself to attack, while Naruto angrily shouted from afar<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"HEY!! THAT'S MY JUTSU!!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Shut up orange guy with whiskers...\"- Blaze replied [NOTE: Blaze's cloning ability was not actually based off Naruto's, as Blaze's first instance of cloning was written way before I even watched the anime.]<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJablek defeated the clones effortlessly, but they seemed to be infinte, Aizen asked Blaze how many clones could he make, and Blaze answered<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"As many as I want. It'll be near impossible for him to get me tired from just making clones...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNostory and Seth also joined the fight, making things more difficult for the now wounded Jablek...</span></div></div>",

DIE!\" Jablek would fire a piercing beam that would take out most of the clones. But Jablek knew that he, even with this incredible power, couldn't keep this pace up... especially with four bad guys all targeting him. He then turned and looked toward Joana and Jasmine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know what to-\" Jablek was interrupted by a punch from Blaze, sending him flying upward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There is nothing you can do, loser.\" Blaze said, laughing. \"It's all over...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up, Girly-\" Nostory intercepted the fused warrior in the sky, kicking Jablek in another direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Didn't I tell you not to get too cocky?\" Nostory said, then went ahead to cross his arms. \"You can't handle of the weight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I..SHUT-\" Seth then drop kicked Jablek, and this caused the warrior to fly toward the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Silence...\" Seth said. \"It'll be over soon...you are weak and weary. You should have been able to win...but you had to protect those girls...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJablek then crashed into the ground, creating a small crater from the impact. He looked up, and wondered...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just want to live in peace...is that too much to ask for?\" The fused warrior said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's welcome Chaos...\" Aizen said, walking toward the crater. \"Gentlemen?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNostory, Seth, and Blaze were starting to close on Jablek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJablek was struggling to get out of the crater. He knew that he needed to wake up his girlfriends. He also wanted figure out who was behind this whole dream...and why? 'Well, this is a dream....I guess I could end this.' Jablek thought. 'I've had enough of this...but to wake up the giant sleeping beauties...'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok...\" Blaze said. \"Finally, the moment is at hand! We can finally use him!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNostory then posed a question. \"Wait, what about Jak? He's fused with Blake.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shouldn't matter, either way.\" Blaze said...\"His power will be of great use...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze, Nostory, Seth, and Aizen started to charge beams in their hands, and were about to blow Jablek sky high....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"GUYS!\" Goku said, screaming, \"CLOSE YOUR EYES!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith every single good guy realizing, (except Naruto) they did so, without question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why are we-\" Naruto said. \"GAHHHHHHH\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"SOLAR FLARE!!!!!\" Goku said, blinding all of the bad guys, and Naruto, who of course, started to complain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HOLY CRAP!\" Naruto said. \"I CAN'T SEE A THING!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoku punched Frieza which sent the tyrant flying, and sent a Kamehameha wave to ensure he could buy some time. The Super Saiyan then flew near Jablek, and started to converse with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here, take these....\" Goku revealed two Senzu Beans, which were inside his Gi. \"This will fix you up nicely...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks.\" Jablek said. \"But I don't need it...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You sure?\" Goku said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll take them,\" Jablek said, starting to stand up. \"I know who I could give them to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, well hurry!\" Goku said. \"They won't stay blinded for long!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoku then powered up in his gold/yellow aura, and flew away to combat Frieza once more. 'If this weren't filled with bad guys...this would be the best dream ever...' Jablek thought, 'But never mind that, I have to get these to the girls!\" Jablek then flew over to Joana, and she was still knocked out. 'I guess I have to put this in her mouth...this is kinda weird, but yet it's pretty cool at the same time...' Jablek then threw the Senzu Bean into Joana's mouth, and then charged up a beam.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"JOANA!\" Jablek said, firing it at her, \"Wake up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoana started to show signs up coming back fully, and she started to chew on the bean. \"AWESOME!\" Jablek then looked up at the four main villains that were targeting him. 'No time, have to get this last one to Jasmine!' and he dashed right over to her. 'I hope she's ok...if all of me was here, she'd be happy. But never mind that!' Jablek used the same method in order to wake Jasmine up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"JASMINE!\" Jablek then fired a beam, \"You have to wake up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze then appeared in front of Jablek quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-Huh?\" Jablek said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Trying to wake them up, I see?\" Blaze said, then he quickly delivered a punch to Jablek's gut. \"Hmm. Not so fast...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJablek then coughed up blood, and stepped back a bit, then found himself on one knee. Nostory, Seth, and Blaze appeared beside Blaze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-no....\" Jablek said. \"I'm not going to die. You won't use me Blaze...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What can you do?\" Blaze said. \"You literally have no energy left to spare.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJablek knew this was a big risk...but he flew up into the air, and started to power up....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can't do anything,\" Jablek was then covered in a orange aura. \"I'm doing this for the sake of the world...if it means stopping you, then so be it...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You wouldn't...\" Blaze said, eyes widening. \"You're bluffing...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think you're in over your head...\" Nostory said, his mask shining. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nElectricity sparked around the fused warrior, and everyone realized that Jablek was making a bomb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA bomb out of himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJasmine and Joana, were starting to stir a bit...and they were fully healed... </span></div></div>",

Smoke is coming out of the crater, but something is coming out of the crater so it has footsteps. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThey decided to come back in your dreams.\u201d Was heard from the crater as a man wearing a black cloak hiding his face<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm, it seems I came at the right time.\u201d He said before looking around and walking towards orochimaru<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou on the other hand are not immortal.\u201d The man said before teleporting right in his face and sending him flying<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man took aizen\u2019s zanpakuto and shoved it up his ass* in the span of several minutes. He looked over to see some shocked faces, but he smiled and took off his hood. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe was asking for it and it should stop him from using his shikai.\u201d He said<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was Animan or it looks like him, but he activated his watch and there was a small flash after a second or two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s good to see you guys again, but I have a job to do.\u201d He said before triggering his aura saiyan power to gold form<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnother one?!!!\u201d frieza yelled surprised, but he just nodded<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYep and I have more than that.\u201d He said before readying a kamhameha and pull off an instant Kamehameha on frieza sending him flying into the air all the way to the moon<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked at goku with a smile and a thumbs-up before using his watch to switch forms to his normal form. He pulled out a sword and started to glow fire, but he transformed into a fire-winged angel like animan. He charged after the other two espada at the same time before burning them with his fire blast attack. They were sent flying as well, but he quickly return to normal and donned his ninja garb before starting to do hand signs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cForbidden Jutsu.\u201d He said as his hands has two very familiar jutsu attack form in his hands<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cChidoran.\u2019 He said before charging at pain and his five paths<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey charged at him, but one by one they were pushed back and zapped by his single move, but he had to keep using some chakra to refresh the move before getting to the final pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFrom the mind reader to the attack blocker now you.\u201d He said before releasing the justu and pulled out a certain scroll<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis one is for you.\u201d He before opening the scroll<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cForbidden Summon: Ten-Tail Beast.\u201d He said before the summoned creature came out of the scroll and surrounded him like a protector<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow is that possible?\u201d orochimaru scream at that and the real pain just looked surprised, but the man just smiled<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can do the impossible and even make the impossible happen.\u201d He said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEat him.\u201d He said while looking at the real pain and the beast charged at him<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of the heroes looked at him like he was sort of cruel, but he turned back at orochimaru with a darker smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAll I have to do is kill you and they are gone for good from this dream.\u201d He said referring to the summoned villains<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour experiments are second rate and a joke.\u201d He said with a tone from powerman<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe area started to become distorted, but the heroes were fine this time as the man was controlling it somehow. He moved his hand making the remaining enemies (blaze, seth, nostory, and orochimaru) slam into each other including aizen with his sword still up his ass except for pain getting eaten by his beast blood was on the ground from pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou won\u2019t escape from this.\u201d He said before gathering both energy and chakra for his final attack<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cForbidden Jutsu.\u201d He said before looking at jablek<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is only a dream when you see this move.\u201d He said before looking back at the stuck group<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRasen-<br>\r\nKame\u2026\u2026\u2026ha\u2026.me\u2026.ha!!\u201d he fired the attack at the group destroying them with one shot and he fell to a knee<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe got up and walked over to jablek who was standing where he hit the ground before taking the potara earrings off to end the fusion, but he gave them back to goku. He made the ten-tail beast go back into its scroll before closing it and putting it away. He stopped using his reality power so everything went back to normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNice move huh?\u201d he said with a smile as he put on his cloak<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe made the girls shrink back to their normal sizes.

Zenn simply began walking again.<br>\r\n\"I think I'll take a rain check on the lesson. Maybe we can reschedule.\" He was stopped by an invisible wall. <br>\r\n\"You will be staying here. A random portal won't just appear.\" he said. Zenn looked over at him. <br>\r\n\"You might be right, but most likely I'll be gone before the end of the month. You can excuse me for not getting too close, It makes it easier to move on to the next \"lesson\". I'm sure the people here are great, but unless Jaxx is taken care of, there's no good reason to throw my trust to anyone who comes my way. Please let me through. I'll be out of your hair soon enough.\"<br>\r\nThe walk began again, both of them getting annoyed.<br>\r\n\"Didn't he say that you need to learn a lesson or two from us?\" <br>\r\n\"He said the last world I went to would be a break. I don't usually consider a war against giant psychopaths a break.\" Zenn looked to him. \"Thank you for letting me stay, I appreciate it, but getting buddy-buddy with me isn't a good idea.\" One last time, Zenn turned away.  Animan let him go this time. He sighed and watched as the boy walked off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZenn found himself a quiet spot to relieve some stress. He put barriers around the place he found, ensuring that no fire would spread and started shooting fire. Between streams of flame, he began to think. At first, he reassured himself that this was the best way. He would only make it harder on himself if he let himself care about the people. He'd been stabbed in the back a few times. Worse, the genuine people seemed to drop dead around him. Very few made it to the day he was forced to disappear. Despite it all though, he doubted if he made the right decision. Was shutting everyone out the best thing? It kept them safer, but these people seemed more than competent in a fight, unless they have spontaneous heart attacks. After that thought came one that he realized. He had likely burned bridges already. He had fought one of them, slashed one in the face and he doubted he'd be able to make up for either. An especially large pillar of fire came after that before he fell back, tired and unhappy.  He was still torn.  His brain fought itself for awhile.  He wanted friends, but he wasn't sure he would even be able to make friends.  It turns out that burning people's friends and fighting with them isn't actually the best way to start out a friendship.  Then again, maybe he could at least make up for what he did.<br>\r\n\"Shit. Maybe I could use some help.\" Zenn laid back against the ground looking to the sky. \"Looks like I'm going to take some friendship lessons.\" He laid there for a bit, resting from his stress relief.  He rose to his feet and headed back the way he came.  <i>Maybe he'll put on some Dora the Explorer to help teach me how to make friends.</i></span></div></div>",

Not anybody can hold his own against Frieza without gravity training...\"- Goku said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"That reminds me... sorry about the potara earrings, you see, it was another guy's idea and he stole them...\"- Blake started to apologize but Goku signaled him with his hand to stop it<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"It's not a big deal\"- He laughed casually -\"Vegeta is mad though. He wanted to get revenge on Frieza or something\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"WHY YOU, LOW CLASS BASTARD?! HOW COULD A BUNCH OF WEAKLINGS STEAL SOMETHING FROM YOU, GODDAMNIT!!\"- Vegeta yelled, Goku whispered to Blake and Jak<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Nevermind him. He'll be happy when some other villain pops up and he gets to beat him up\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I have to give you credit as well. I wouldn't have imagined someone could actually fight Aizen without reiatsu\"- Ichigo commented as he walked closer to the group, then he pointed at Blake's sword -\"Although that stupidly huge sword isn't the best weapon...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Look who's talking...\"- Blake pointed at Ichigo's zanpakuto<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Uh... Ahem... Anyway, how come that thing could even hurt a shinigami?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"No idea. Lith gave it to me and taught me some basic swordsmanship\"- Blake replied -\"Well, you figure that if freaking God gives you a weapon it has to be badass at the very least... unless it were a prankster god, which I hope Lith isn't\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJak laughed at Blake's remark but also commented that it's insanely heavy and apparently unbreakable and incredibly sharp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"If this happens to be any form of adamantium* we are SO sued...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe conversation went on to more casual things while Naruto was somewhat annoyed not to be included. Joana and Jasmine finally interrupted after a while, both of them glomping their respective boyfriends<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What's with the sudden hug?\"- Jak wondered<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"<font class=\"size2\" style=\"\">Can't...breathe...HALP...</font>\"- Blake said as his face was turning blue<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Both of you have neglected us lately\"- Jasmine said<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter regaining his breath, Blake answered -\"This is a dream. We are supposed to be free and play PS3-I mean have fun\"- (Author's comment: LOL, Blake's obsession with a PS3 now will seem obsolete ._. )<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You guys are already married?\"- Goku scratched his head -\"I wouldn't have thought you would have also fallen for the food trick\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoana and Jasmine gave him a death glare that managed to intimidate even the strongest guy in the known multiverse<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Are you stupid, Kakarot! These brats are way too young for that. Not even saiyans marry at such a young age, although we'd have destroyed several planets by then at the very least\"- Vegeta said as he suddenly appeared, and laughed nostalgically a bit with the latter words<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Okay...\"- Goku couldn't think of anything else to say <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"HEY YOU BUNCH OF WEIRDOS!! Y U IGNORE ME!!\"\"- Naruto angrily pointed at them while yelling<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"He was still here?\"- Ichigo wondered out loud<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Weirdos? What about your whiskers?\"- Jak said while struggling not to laugh too much<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You win this time... still, what's with you guys? I'm a famous hero! I SAVED KONOHA!\"- (Note: I stopped at about ep 222 of shippuden, before the war started, because there would be fillers afterwards but I'll catch up to new stuff when i have time)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I saved the spiritual world\"- Ichigo said with a bored face<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I saved the universe\"- Goku said casually, then, all of them looked at the couples<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I helped to save the dream world we were in\"- Jak said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Okay you got me. I have only temporarily saved my friends because I'm still training to defeat that stupid faced, white haired girly bastard\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I AM NOT GIRLY!!\"- was heard from very far away<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Still. Pain was the easiest villain to deal with after Orochimaru. Aizen and Frieza were the real threat, so shut up, frog eyed ninja\"- Blake added<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Pain, easiest...\"- Naruto had a O___o face -\"Orochimaru even easier?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"It's alright, all of you are pretty young, I'm sure you will get a lot stronger with time\"- Goku said and patted Naruto in the shoulder, but didn't realize of his strength and sent him flying until he crashed into a nearby building, Blake, Joana, Jak and Jasmine laughed a lot at that while Naruto yelled angrily as he stood up, brushed the dust off and walked back to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Well, given the villains were taken care of, I have no idea what to do\"- Blake sighed<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Play PS3?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"YES!! PLAY PS-wait...\"- Blake's enthusiasm was seemingly cut off midway, and he looked thoughtful -\"Playing PS3 with the best martial artist we know is sort of a waste, now that I think about it\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Then what? An autograph?\"- Joana suggested<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"This is a dream...\"- Blake had a -_- face -\"Of course it would be the absolutely most awesome autograph to have ever but it will vanish when we wake up\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Then what's your idea?\"- Jasmine asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"LET'S TRAIN!! If you don't mind, that is...\"- Blake said to Goku -\"This would be pretty much any guy's ultimate dream. The very best thing EVER to happen in anyone's life\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoana gave him a death glare and Blake cleared his throat -\"AFTER finding a soulmate, of course\"- He laughed nervously. Then he regained his composure and added -\"You, Ichigo and Naruto, could also learn a bit from the boss. Who knows, maybe you can get to defeat your respective villains...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Yeah, why not?\"- Ichigo said. Naruto remained quiet as he used his perception ability to sense everyone's chakra 'It's quite similar but these guys have all an energy vaguely similar to chakra, and Goku's is certainly insanely powerful. 'Maybe he's right, I could learn something' the ninja thought<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake and Jak used their willpower to get changed into a black with red and a green with blue Goku-like gi<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Boys...\"- Joana and Jasmine sighed, despite being amused internally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVegeta wouldn't participate but he thought he would find some amusement seeing these guys beat each other. Goku had them fight between themselves before they sparred with him. First match was Jak vs Naruto. Jak stood in a fighting stance when a kunai almost grazed his face and Naruto started throwing kunais and shurikens. Jak was dodging them and even ray away a bit<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"THAT'S UNFAIR!\"- He shouted, Naruto just laughed at his apparent suffering and chased him, but Jak already had a plan and performed a backflip while transforming in his Omega form. He caught Naruto totally off-guard and punched him in the face, crashing him into a building. Blake gave Jak a thumbs up. Naruto came back from inside the building somewhat annoyed and with minor injuries. He stood still while Jak wasn't sure what he was doing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"He\u00b4s going to transform to sage mode!!\"- Blake realized about almost too late, Jak himself couldn't dodge Naruto's punch but punched him as well, and a higher speed battle began, with Naruto having advantage at mid range and Jak at close range. Jak fired an energy beam that did a small cut to Naruto's face and took advantage of that distraction to punch his eyes and trap him with a juijitsu lock. Instead, Jak found himself hugging a tree stump<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"The hell?\"- Jak wondered while Blake was laughing, until he noticed Blake got serious again and was looking somewhere else. Naruto wasbehind him and had formed the rasen-shuriken<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"How can this guy do Kienzan?\"- Goku wondered<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto threw the rasenshuriken, but Jak managed to dodge it and increased his omega form power, making his muscles grow somewhat and knocked out Naruto with a single punch to the chin. Then he noticed Blake was laughing while Joana and Jasmine were trying not to. Jasmine showed him a mirror and he saw his hair got a stupid cut because of the rasen-shuriken. Jak facepalmed and Blake stepped forward to fight Ichigo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Just so you know, I am using my zanpakuto\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I guessed. Bring it on\"- Blake was in a fighting stance even though his sword was left near Joana. Naruto woke up in time to see the next fight, but not before making a fuss about his loss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fight began, Blake suddenly disappeared and reappeared, kicking Ichigo, although he blocked it with his zanpakuto. Blake disappeared again and punched Ichigo in the left side followed by a punch to the face, dashing back before Ichigo could reach him with his blade.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I didn't know Blake was capable of taking on someone armed\"- Jak commented<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You'd faint if you knew how many knife-armed guys Blake has fought\"- Joana giggled, since this was a dream she wasn't worried about real harm anymore<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchigo wiped off the blood from the corner of his lips and assumed a fighting stance with Zangetsu<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Try that again if you have the guts\"- He taunted Blake, who promptly disappeared and tried to punch Ichigo again, but the substitute shinigami blocked with his zanpakuto again. Blake kept punching the sword regardless, forcing him to defend until Ichigo backed into a lamp post and Blake used that moment to perform a low sweeping kick that knocked Ichigo off his feet, landing a powerful kick to his stomach and sending him away, crahsing into a nearby car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><font class=\"size2\" style=\"\">*It's not actually adamantium</font></b></span></div></div>",

Ichigo formed another Getsuga and launched it after using shunpo to appear in front of Blake. An explosion of blue flame-like fire was all that was seen, and then, smoke, and no trace of Blake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Did I overdo it?! Man, for someone capable of fighting Aizen this guy was sure a fragile one...\"- Ichigo said as he sheathed his zanpakuto with its bandages. Then he felt a sword's sharp edge barely touching his neck from behind<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Guess who?\"- Blake said, although his tone was serious and it wasn't clear if that was a joke or sarcasm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"So you have finally decided to use that thing\"- Ichigo mocked Blake's actually strange sword. The two stood in guard for a moment before disappearing and al that could be seen was rapidly moving color flashes, as well as the ground cracking in random points as their swords clashed. Goku had no trouble seeing the fight though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchigo was surprised that a seemingly ordinary human could match the shinigamis' power and speed, but was confident on the fact that they appeared to be even, and he had still a card up the sleeve. Ichigo used a Getsuga Tensho while clashing his sword against Blake's intending to have him take the full attack, but instead, the sword took it all and sustained no damage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What the hell is that sword made of?!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake smiled and he struck Ichigo's blade with such strength that he made it vibrate a lot. Ichigo decided that it was time for no more games and extended his right arm forward while holding Zangetsu, and grabbed his right wrist with his left arm<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Bankai...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wind changed from calm to very violent around Ichigo, and he was surrounded in black flame-like fire. After the flames extinguished, Ichigo has slightly different clothing and zangetsu was now a seemingly normal black katana instead of an oversized cleaver. Ichigo appeared and disappeared so much that multiple Ichigos could be seen<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"And this guy can do Afterimage technique? I seriously have to talk to Master Roshi about this...\"- Goku commented<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake stood still and smiled, then, Ichigo tried to attack him from behind but Blake blocked it with his sword and quickly transformed into his basic light form (x2). His hair rose and his eyes became golden, he was surrounded by a flame-like golden aura, and was prefectly capable of blocking Ichigo's enhanced attack without moving a single inch. Blake then gathered golden energy in his free hand and said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Celestial Light, Crown of stars. Glory of the Heaven, Bind the Darkness Forever, Tie! Halos of Repentance\"- He then fired 3 rings made of golden light, which bound Ichigo's shoulders, arms and feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"And here I thought you weren't one to learn annoying spell crap\"- Ichigo complained, remembering the very first day he met Rukia and how she bound his arms with a Kido spell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"They're fairly useful\"- Blake replied and laughed a bit, but got serious again, and started to charge energy in his right hand while grabbing his right wrist with the left hand. He fired it at nearly point blank and there was a large explosion. Once the smoke dissipated, Ichigo could be seen, he had taken considerable damage but had managed to break free and block some damage with tensa zangetsu.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"That was more bark than bite\"- Ichigo remarked and the 2 resumed their high speed combat. Blake noticed that his strength almost matched Ichigo's but his speed had vastly improved. Blake got some light cuts as he could only manage to dodge once the blade touched him, however, Ichigo was already seeing his dodging patterns (Blake almost always tried to counter-attack during the vulnerable moments after swinging the sword) and during one of his attempted counters, Ichigo landed a point-blank Black Getsuga, which Blake blocked with his sword but it still pushed him away and shortly after exploded into black flames.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake emerged with just superficial burns, but his aura now flowed faster and was more jagged, as he was now using 5 times his regular power. Blake disappeared and reappeared behind Ichigo, just to disappear again to reappear in front of him and punch him in the face as well as quickly firing a golden beam at point-blank. Ichigo had some visible damage but still charged at Blake and created another black getsuga but didn't launch it and retained it in his zanpakuto while attacking Blake, who kept blocking the hits with his sword. Ichigo realized that every time their swords clashed he felt the damage from the impact, Blake was significantly stronger than him and just as fast if not faster, however, he had an incantation free technique that could be used almost limitlessly, and thus, he concluded he had nothing to fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchigo added more power to his Getsuga, making it massive and launched it at Blake. He blocked it but was struggling, and Ichigo dashed to hit him while he was busy, however, before he reached Blake he felt a sharp pain in the stomach... Blake had thrown his sword at him, and was holding the black getsuga with just one hand. Then, Blake did some gestures with his free hand as he said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Stab his heart, burn him to nothing, explode, mighty blade!! Erase the evil by using my soul!!\"- <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJak and Jasmine were impressed. They had already seen Blake use that spell against Blaze, and it had nearly destroyed him. However the 2 of them wondered if Blake wasn't overdoing it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake's sword, firmly stuck to Ichigo's stomach, started to glow and erupted into golden flames. Blake commented<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I hope not to have overdone it. The time I used this on Blaze i was using my power at seven-fold\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchigo's scream could be heard, but it was less of a scream of pain and one more of anger or madness. His voice had acquired a strange echo to it, and Ichigo emerged from the flames wearing his hollow mask. Blake's aura changed into electrical-looking, flowing very fast and even more jagged. They charged at each other and started to punch and to attack each other with their swords. Again, they seemed to be evenly matched, though Ichigo had a slight advantage in speed while Blake had an advantage in physical strength.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth fighters got some severe wounds and were breathing heavily<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Ok guys, that's enough. I can sense that whatever you use to increase your power to that extent also strains your bodies to unhealthy levels\"- Goku interrupted the fight while both guys were catching their breath<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"However. If this had gone on, Ichigo would have lost. Blake was preparing to cast spells at full power, and Ichigo's only chance would have been to wear Blake down enough to run out of energy before himself. It was a good fight regardless\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoku gave both guys a senzu bean which they immediately ate to heal, and shook hands. Blake thought it was a little awkward as he never fought for sport, only to defend himself, attack those who are a threat and during training. Still, it felt good to have stood on nearly even grounds with a hero. Shortly after that, Blake was again hugged-suffocated by Joana, although she wasn't so worried this time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoku told them to rest a bit and catch their breath before they fight him. He also told the girls that they could join the fight, as he could tell both girls were hiding great powers. Meanwhile Naruto was like o_____o\" as his chakra sensing ability couldn't tell as much stuff as Goku's, but he concluced that maybe their energy forms could be more similar. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so, our heroes along the guest ones went to the empty game store for a break, soda, and possibly videogames.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"How many times have we been in this store?\" Jak said, slightly laughing. \"It's been destroyed on multiple occasions as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Doesn't matter. All the matters is that we get to play PS3.\" Blake said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe empty store didn't really have anyone working in it, of course, was outfitted with an HDTV, two gaming chairs, a Xbox 360, PS3, a endless collection of games and was pretty much gaming paradise. Jasmine and Joana rolled their eyes a bit, and didn't understood their boyfriends' obsession with gaming...but figured it comes with dating them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What should we play first?\" Goku said. \"There's a lot of games here-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoku stopped and spotted a copy of Raging Blast 2, seeing himself, his son Gohan, and many of the other Z Fighters on the case. Goku was at a loss for words, as he was little shocked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't know they had games based on our battles!\" Goku said. \"Broly, Buu, they even have Frieza!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVegeta simply scoffed. \"Freaks all of them. If they were around now, I could kill them now. If Frieza was around he would feel the wrath of my SUPER SAIYAN RAGE!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto ran into a copy of Ultimate Ninja Storm 2. \"Heh heh, it seems I'm popular too! This is awesome! We should play my game, my cover looks the coolest anyway!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo one was paying attention to Naruto, as the Heroes were watching Goku and Vegeta fight as themselves on Raging Blast. Jak and Blake were simply amazed. Their anime idols were dueling each other, and they were competitive as usual, screaming at each other, but it was clear that Vegeta was a natural at playing the game. He was beating his follow Saiyan in the game, and for Vegeta, this would be a huge win, even though it was just in a video game.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I got you Kakarot! No escape! I'm going beat you here!\" Vegeta shouted with excitement, He was in his Super Saiyan 2 transformation. Goku was a Super Saiyan 3, and was shocked that Vegeta was going to defeat him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way! Not fair!\" Goku said. \"There's no way you're going to beat me like this!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"BIG BANG ATTACK!\" Vegeta screamed. The attack would connect with Goku, and in the end Vegeta won. Goku had a \"O_o\" expression. He was puzzled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJak and Blake knew what was coming next. Knowing how Vegeta was, he would start to gloat and become cocky (as if he needed any more reason to be more cocky) but for them this is exactly how they pictured this. It was great and amazing to see two great characters compete against each other in a friendly manner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HAH! I WON. I BEAT THE CLOWN. AND HE WAS AT A STRONGER STATE THAN ME!!! I, THE PRINCE OF ALL SAIYANS IS THE KING OF VIDEO GAMES. I CHALLENGE ANY OF YOU WEAKLINGS TO TAKE ME ON!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoku didn't expect any less out of his rival, and simply thought that Jak could quickly shut his gloating down. Ichigo and Naruto immediately started to point at Jak. Jak noticed this right away...and quickly realized why he was being chosen by the two heroes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why me?\" Jak said, still being hugged onto by Jasmine. \"I mean, I could probably beat Veg-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT WAS THAT!?\" Vegeta said. \"YOU REALLY WANT TO GO AGAINST ME?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" Blake said. \"You can totally beat him Jak. You own the game anyway, and I'm sure you'll make quick work of Vegeta.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can do it Luigi-Boogums...\" Jasmine said. \"You're too good, and this is a chance to play with one of your favorite idols.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well fine...\" Jak said. \"Yes. I challenge the Prince of all Saiyans to a duel in this game. I'm sure I'll be able to quickly end your streak.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really...\" Vegeta said. \"If you can beat me, I want to test your strength outside of these games. You intrigue me earthling...your willingness to battle me is interesting.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awesome!\" Jak said. \"This'll be fun!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so, the Heroes would continue their small break time from training. Blake had ordered 10 pizzas, Naruto also made a quick run to get some ramen. Jasmine placed her head on top of Jak's head, and Jak didn't mind at all. He was already locked into the matter at hand, and that was to defeat Vegeta at least once...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Vegeta and Jak started up the system and chose their characters. Jak was a veteran in most of the DragonBall Games. He went with his usual go-to, which was Cell. This shocked a few of the heroes, especially Jak\u2019s opponent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy!?\u201d Vegeta said. \u201cWhy play as that weakling?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe\u2019s my best character.\u201d Jak said. \u201cHis moveset is pretty cool, and I love his play style.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFine\u2026\u201d Vegeta said. \u201cEither way, I can avenge my defeat to Cell! He wouldn\u2019t stand a chance against me now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis\u2019ll be interesting\u2026\u201d Goku said. \u201cWhen Cell regenerated, he seemed to be on the same level as Gohan when he was a Super Saiyan 2.\u201d*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJak and Vegeta then began to engage into battle with their Characters. Jak started to use a few energy attacks to slow down Vegeta\u2019s pursuit of him. He knew that in order to win, he had to transform into the Super-Perfect form of Cell. He usually did a little hit and run, so that he could fill his gauge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Vegeta had dashed and closed in on Jak. He started to pound on his opponent, knocked him away and then used his signature Galick Gun blast. Jak quickly used the afterimage ability to avoid taking any more damage than he needed to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHeh.\u201dVegeta said, laughing. \u201cGood one earthling, but don\u2019t think you\u2019re out of the clear yet.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere we go\u2026\u201d Blake said, clearly into this battle. \u201cLooks like Jak will be in trouble.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake was right, as Vegeta would transform himself into a Super Saiyan. Jak was waiting for the transformation to be completed. However, once it was completed, it wasn\u2019t what he expected\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCrap\u2026no good.\u201d Jak said. \u201cI need to transform myself and quick!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVegeta bypassed the first transformation of Super Saiyan, and went straight to the next level. Jak knew that Cell\u2019s character wasn\u2019t able to do the same thing, as he would manually have to do it by absorbing each android. Jak had formulated a plan, and he\u2019d have to execute it quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJak started to fight with Cell, using energy attacks and blasts to keep Vegeta at bay, at least to build his gauge faster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAwesome!\u201d Jak said, realizing he had enough to transform into Semi Perfect Cell, and in this situation, he knew that the drain life ablity would be a regular attack too. So he could turn it into a case to where he could get some life back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cImpressive\u2026\u201d Ichigo was sipping on a soda. \u201cMaybe this\u2019ll be more fun.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI DON\u2019T GET ANY OF THIS!\u201d Naruto said. \u201cWhat\u2019s with the Blonde hair going on and off?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again, no one turned to play attention to the Leaf Village\u2019s prankster ninja.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA little later into the bout, Jak was able to transform into Super Perfect Cell. But had to work for it. He was on his last bar of Health. Vegeta happened to be on his yellow bar, it was halved. Jak knew he had to be nearly perfect (Pun intended) on this run. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoing quick, Jak used Cell\u2019s death beam blast, which wiped out Vegeta\u2019s yellow gauge and sent it to red. They both were on equal ground now. The battle would be decided shortly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDAMN IT!\u201d Vegeta said, transforming into a Super Saiyan. \u201cI WONT LOSE, NOT HERE!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere we go\u2026\u201d Goku said, with a sweatdrop. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJak was a little pumped up too, so he started to stand up. Dashing away, he allowed himself to charge up his Ki gauge to Max Power. Jak decided he was going to end this on a Solar Kamehameha blast. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBIG BANG ATTACK!\u201d Both of the Vegetas screamed in sync. \u201cEAT THIS!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSOLAR KAMEHAMEHA!\u201d Jak said, and he was excited and transformed into his Omega Form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Jasmine who was near Jak, got blown back instantly. She was taken off guard and was knocked back into a wall. Joana immediately ran over to make sure she was ok. Blake had the \u201cO_o\u201d expression. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth of the beams collided, and Jak and Vegeta started to spin the Analog Sticks on the PS3 controllers extremely fast. Both the Saiyan and the Omega Powered Teen screamed, their golden and white auras clashing and electricity sparked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then, there was a great flash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n When the smoke cleared, Cell was victorious, and Jak had won. Vegeta had thrown down his controller, looked at Jak. Nodded to him in respect.  Then simply said, \u201cLet me know when you\u2019re ready to battle earthling. I like your spirit.\u201d The Prince of all Saiyans then flew away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cToo Cool!\u201d Jak said, still transformed. \u201cI never have had so much playing this-\u201c He then turned around. \u201c\u2026.oops.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJasmine said, \u201cI\u2019m fine\u2026Luigi Boogums\u2026.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDidn\u2019t mean to-\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s ok. You were excited\u2026\u201d Jasmine said. \u201cYou\u2019re so cute when you get into a game.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell\u2026\u201d Blake said. \u201cI guess Jak and Vegeta will battle a little later\u2026But I\u2019m sure others want to battle.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI want to see what these girls can do!\u201d Goku said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJak and Blake gulped. They didn\u2019t want to know what they could do. And hoped that their ladies would be content with just watching\u2026.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJasmine and Joana were slightly more cuirous about their boyfriends\u2019 anime idols, so they wanted to ask questions\u2026..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n* <font class=\"size3\" style=\"\"><b>Cell is my favorite DBZ Villain, fun fact.

We're being a bit unfair with Naruto... It's true he might be...\"- He noticed Naruto made a clone and was starting to make his signature technique -\"Not as strong as others... But he still kicked ass in his own universe. How he defended his village is something respectable...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I OBJECT\"- Ichigo blurted<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"If I recall correctly you left your city defenseless\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Because I had to rescue Orihime!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"We're getting nowhere...\"- Jak pointed<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Hey, Goku, are there enough senzu beans?\"- Blake asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Of course! Never battle a villain without these!\"- Goku showed them the bag with said beans and made a thumbs up gesture, which somehow ended up seeming like a tv ad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Only in HIS universe...\"- Everyone said with a disappointed tone<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Well. I think I could give it a shot. Naruto, if you want to save your reputation, fight me with all you've got...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What...\"- Joana was baffled<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What do you mean with all he got? Didn't he fight properly before?\"- Jasmine asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I hadn't stopped to think of this but Naruto didn't use his full strength against Jak. Reason one: He could barely gather any natural chakra so his sage mode wasn't going to last long. Second, Rasen Shuriken expands when arriving at target location to trap the enemy, the one he threw at Jak vanished in a puff of smoke...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"That was just a transformed kunai...\"- Naruto said while laughing. Jak had a -_- face -\"The real Rasen Shuriken does cellular damage. I would only use that on villains\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I will give you time to gather enough sage chakra and use your real moves. I've already fought Ichigo so I want to see how do I hold up against you...\"- Blake said end immediately Joana grabbed his arm and dragged him nearer to her<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Are you crazy?! Cellular damage!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"It's a dream. And even if I got some damage, I have someone who can fix it up\"- Blake casually replied<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I am NOT your personal nurse!! That's what that woman is for anyway!\"- Demon Blake's metallic voice sounded from Blake's head but everyone heard it<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"The hell was that?\"- Ichigo asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"It's just a dark entity of sorts that lives inside my soul or something. Nevermind, he's just a jerk. But can be useful at times\"- Blake replied, and noticed the \"I know that feel\" look in Ichigo and Naruto himself<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Just hurry up and charge up your sage chakra\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes while sitting in a meditating pose, Naruto's eyes changed to toad-like, and Blake caught the hint, assuming his fighting stance. Joana, Jak and Jasmine were a surprised that Blake wasn't transforming right away, and they observed Naruto dash at great speed to attack Blake, who could only block the incoming punch. It hit with enough force to sink and crack slightly the ground beneath them. Naruto dashed back and stood still, recharging sage chakra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Well, that hurt\"- Blake commented<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You told me to go all out, why aren't you doing your shiny weird flashy lights?\"- Naruto asked somewhat mockingly<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Unlike you guys I can't sense others' presence or tell how strong they are, the only way for me to learn that is to fight them. But you're right, I underestimated you\"- Blake said as he transformed into his light form, getting surrounded by a gently flowing flame-like golden aura, his hair rising and spiking up, his eyes turning to golden. Then, he dashed at Naruto and they started a very fast exchange of punches and kicks. Both managed to land hits on each other but it was a punch from Blake the one which seemingly broke the exchange, as he dodged Naruto's fist but still got punched. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Frog Kata... I can't believe still fell for that\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Huh?! How do you know?!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Long story. To make it short, your story is somewhat popular so I know up until defeating Pain\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Damnit\"- Naruto was a bit frustrated that he didn't have the element of surprise<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake charged at Naruto again, but upon punching him, it vanished, as it was just a shadow clone, and meanwhile, Naruto had readied a rasengan in each hand and hurled them into Blake's back, pushing him away with tremendous force. Naruto noticed that while it destroyed part of Blake's jacket and shirt, his skin was just bruised. Blake turned around and resumed fighting, knowing that close range was still his environment while Naruto probably had an edge on mid-long range. He punched Naruto twice in the face and kicked him in the stomach, but had his leg caught. Another Naruto appeared charging at him with a rasengan, but Blake fired an energy beam at him, piercing his chest, after which it vanished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I don't fall for the same tricks more than once\"- Blake then transformed briefly into his light x7 form and swung his leg, sending Naruto crashing into a nearby house. He quickly reverted to the regular form (x2). When Naruto emerged, he had a clone alongside him and they formed a larger Rasengan, to everyone's surprise, Blake gathered golden energy into his left hand and formed a sphere with it, and charged at Naruto with it, both energy spheres clashed and there was a large explosion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto had slight burns and scratches but was mostly ok, although shocked to having his signature skill countered, that is, until Blake became visible once the smoke dissipated. Blake himself was about as damaged as Naruto, which wasn't very much, but his hand had deeper wounds and was bleeding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"To think a simple energy ball can do that much...\"- Blake said -\"I admit i had wanted to test this since a while ago...\"- <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"SIMPLE?! IT WAS FRIGGIN HARD TO LEARN!\"- Naruto was a bit angered<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake formed another energy ball with his damaged hand, and charged at Naruto, who had no time to counter. There was a small explosion, and Naruto had some more burns. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What you're doing is not even close to Rasengan. It's ball shaped but it doesn't have the spinning force or the density\"- Naruto commented as he managed to see it from up close this time<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Well, that just means I can't go around hurling energy balls at my enemies. It's not like it was my usual tactic anyway\"- Blake dashed at Naruto while firing golden energy balls<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Me and my big mouth!\"- Naruto shouted as he was dodging the energy attacks, until he noticed Blake wasn't in front of him anymore<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Halo of Repentance!\"- Blake suddenly appeared behind Naruto and fired a golden energy ring that bound Naruto's arms. Blake then aimed his hands at Naruto while saying -\"Gold as the sunlight, the light that pierces through darkness, burn the enemy down to ashes. Burn to oblivion, Solar Beam!\"- Blake fired a powerful golden beam that hit Naruto in the chest and pushed him away until he hit a nearby lamp post, and the beam engulfed him like high pressure water before exploding with both normal and golden flames. When the smoke dissipated, Naruto was still bound by the golden ring and was also burning with golden flames.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Anyone smells ramen?\"- Naruto mumbled before noticing he was burning, which prompted a comical scream while trying to blow the flames on his shoulders<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Shouldn't you tell him that those flames aren't fire but light?\"- Jak commented<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Nah\"- Was Blake's answer, as he was amused. However, Naruto managed to break the golden light ring and tossed aside his red coat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"How come he could break that thing? Didn't the spell summon 3 of those anyway?\"- Ichigo said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I'm not skilled enough to use that spell without the proper incantation. Skipping it summons a weak, incomplete spell, and I still required the name to cast it...\"- Blake replied -\"At least it held Naruto long enough for a full Solar Beam\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Speaking of which... He's not there anymore...\"- Goku said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Huh?\"- Blake then heard something like a high pitched razor<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Wind Release: Rasenshuriken!\"- Naruto threw the chakra shuriken at Blake, who stepped aside to dodge it, and then, the Rasenshuriken expanded<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Crap...\"- Blake muttered as he was caught<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Blake!!\"- Joana was in hyper panic mode now, Jak and Jasmine were having a hard time trying to restrain her and remind her that it was just a dream. Goku laughed at the resemblance of Joana's behavior to his own wife's. Ichigo frowned at Naruto<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Think you overdid it?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Oops?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Hold your horses. This isn't over yet...\"- Blake emerged from the explosion. Everyone was shocked when they saw Blake was missing an arm, the left one<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I think we can call it quits\"- Goku said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I'm alright. Round 2 starts now...\"- Blake said, apparently calm despite bleeding</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Blake charged at Naruto, using shoshitsu to disappear and reappear in different places until he got in front of the Konoha ninja and punched him in the face. They started another high speed close combat, and surprisingly, Blake was keeping up with just one arm, using it mainly to block and attacking with kicks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Now that I think of it, this isn't the first time Blake fights with just one arm...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"HUH?\"- Jak and Jasmine were surprised<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"2 years ago, Blake was just a more ordinary human, he always had amazing fighting skill, strength and endurance but on formerly believable levels, on par with martial artists... One day, some gang of bullies caught Ayrton, one oh his best friends, off guard and gave him a horrible beating, leaving him barely conscious. He managed to get near Blake's locker by the time school was over, and Blake took him to infirmary after taking a note that was taped to his back. The bullies told Blake to show up for one final showdown to either end their gang or Blake himself, and if he didn't show up, they threatened to do the same they did to Ayrton to the rest of Blake's friends and me... So he went. When he arrived he found all of the gang members brutally murdered from physical wounds, some had holes in their chests, and one even had his heart ripped out. Others had broken necks or gouged out eyes, and there stood a certain guy with pale skin, long white hair and an evil smile...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I'm 99.999% percent who it is... so that's how they became enemies...\"- Jak commented, he didn't know what had been Blake's first encounter with Blaze<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Blaze told Blake that he has been watching him and that it's time to test his strength and skills, and challenged him to fight. Blake at first refused because he only fights to protect himself or others, but Blaze threatened to attack his friends and probably me as well, forcing him to fight. They fought and appeared to be somewhat even, except that Blaze wasn't breaking a single sweat drop. After about an hour, Blaze told Blake that he was disappointed, and that he was much stronger than he had been led to believe, and, demonstrating part of his power, disappeared using raw speed, a technique he calls Godspeed, and appeared behind Blake just to scare him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake wasn't scared but was falling into despair as he had never fought something supernatural, and there was no escape. He kept fighting the much stronger Blaze, who single handedly broke one of his arms. Blake kept fighting with all his might despite having just one working arm, but he was growing tired, by this point, Karina arrived after finding Ayrton in the infirmary and learning that Blake probably went alone to face a gang. Blake didn't even know that the gang intended to ambush and kill him, as their leader had gotten a gun.\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJak and Jasmine had o___O faces<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Now I see why Blake was such a good fighter even without transforming\"- Jak added, feeling like his own school problems weren't anywhere near as scary/creepy/dangerous. Jasmine sort of read his thought just from seeing him and hugged him<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Blake didn't want Karina to get involved, but also admitted that she was the second best fighter after him, and Blaze was not an ordinary human, so, they took him on together. They fought with everything they got, even Karina was amazed that Blake could still fight with just one arm and broken ribs. However, Blaze laughed at them and overwhelmed them with his superhuman strength and durability. He took several kicks from Karina to the face and wasn't the least bruised, not even from neck breaking kicks, or from Blake's punches... in past fights, Blake was able to even rupture someone's spleen with just one punch, but Blaze took no damage. He thoroughly beat Blake, breaking every single bone in his body after knocking out Karina. Then he shrunk Blake and vanished after telling him to survive in the now tougher world, and if he managed to survive, find him in 7 days to challenge him and regain his size. Apparently, he also knew Karina had received a prototype healing machine to use, because otherwise Blake would've died from those wounds... That's how he got shrunk for the first time\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"And I just found myself in a shared dream where I was giant... wow... That Blaze guy is wicked as hell\"- Jasmine said<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Blake was holding his own well against Naruto despite his obvious disadvantage, dodging another Rasenshuriken. However, after that attack, Naruto was breathing heavily and lost the sage mode. Blake stood normally and said to Naruto<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Regain your sage chakra. This hasn't finished yet...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What about your arm? Can Senzu Beans heal that?\"- Naruto wondered<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Actually yeah. SENZU B...!!\"- Goku said and was about to shout 'senzu bean' and throw it at Blake but said no with his remaining arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"That would be cheating. I have a way to get this fixed...\"- Blake said before closing his eyes and entering a sort of meditating state...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Hey, what are you waiting for? Fix this!' Blake said inside his mind<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'You have grown quite cocky lately, haven't you?' Demon Blake replied<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'We have no time for petty arguments, just regenerate the freaking arm'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'And why should I?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake remained thoughtful for a moment before getting an idea 'So... I am to remain one armed? Fine by me. Don't complain when you ever get some time with Joana...' Blake was no pervert but realized of a good reason to get the dark jerk to do what he's told<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'OH DAMNIT I HATE YOU!!' <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake's arms started to grow back until it fully regenerated. He opened and closed his hand a couple of times to test it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Good as new. Was that so difficult?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I ONLY regenerated that arm so I can get MY hands on the girl you have neglected so much. Those soft b...'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Yeah... Not happening lol'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'WHAT?!!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake stood in his fighting stance and ignored his dark side's ranting and yelling until he got tired and just stopped. Naruto regained his sage mode and they resumed their fight. Blake already knew he probably wasn't going to get anywhere with just his regular light power, so, he changed to his light x5 power form and dashed at Naruto, disappearing before Naruto could land either a punch or hit with the frog kata. Blake reappeared behind Naruto, and the blond ninja turned around, noticing Blake smiled, then, all of sudden he felt many of punches in every part of his body at an insanely fast rate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Godspeed barrage... That was the move Blaze finished Blake with 2 years ago... It still amazes me he could copy it...\"- Joana commented<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto was pretty battered now, but didn't want to give up, creating 2 clones to form another Rasenshuriken and throwing it at Blake. This time, Blake transformed to the light form x7 and fired a beam with both hands, the beam clashed with the Rasenshuriken but their clash didn't result in an explosion, but a struggle. Blake was pushing the Rasenshuriken away. While he was busy, Naruto prepared his second and last Rasenshuriken to hit Blake from behind, however, Blake smiled and laughed slightly, freeing one oh his hands to fire a beam that Naruto could barely dodge, disrupting the creation of the second Rasenshuriken, Blake then stopped pushing the Rasenshuriken away and used shoshitsu to punch Naruto in the stomach plus the hyper speed momentum. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Blake smiled and said -\"I told you I don't fall for the same tactic more than once...\"- He disappeared just right before the first Rasenshuriken struck Naruto himself. All that was seen was the circular explosion of white chakra. Joana hurried to hug Blake before scolding him for being crazy in that fight, but was interrupted when Goku appeared using his instant transmission, with an almost knocked Naruto on one of his arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"That sure was dangerous\"- Goku said before placing Naruto on the ground, then he gave a thumbs up to Blake -\"Brilliant tactic to have him struck by his own attack.\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You did that against Frieza but yeah, thanks for the compliment\"- Blake replied, feeling a bit tired as well as feeling Joana's hug increase in tightness<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Blake, I don't know if to slap you or kiss you...\"- Joana said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"How about neither?\"- Blake said doing the how about no gesture<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'THE KISS!! PICK THE KISS YOU IDIOT!' Demon Blake shouted inside Blake's mind, again, heard by everyone, which prompted a good laugh. Goku gave senzu beans to Blake and Naruto, and they shook hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Good fight. I'll have to train more if I ever happen to face more akatsuki guys that are on your level\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You fought well too. I'm not underestimating energy based techniques again\"- Blake commented<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Well, are we all set to go fight Vegeta?\"- Jak asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I guess, but it seems Vegeta would have liked to face you one on one at least for a while, so, I leave that up to you, think about it while we're going...\"- Blake said as they started to walk</span></div></div>",

You haven't really experienced enough combat yet and I just don't want you to get hurt.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on earthling.\" The Saiyan Prince said. \"Let us battle in the mountains.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVegeta started to fly off north and Jak followed. The others started to head in that direction. Jak was a little nervous. He didn't know how he'd be able to handle his opponent. However, his use of energy was starting to develop nicely, Jak wondered if he could try to damage Vegeta in an efficient way. Either way, Jak went ahead and shook those thoughts. He figured, just have fun and enjoy the experience. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey soon landed in an area that was very barren and isolated. There were many rock formations, and the sun was beating down on the two...Jak then took a breath, and then he let it all in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright. I'm ready.\" Jak said. \"Whenever you are.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright then. Let's do it.\" Vegeta dashed at Jak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJak was taken off guard, but quickly got into the swing of things. He chose not to transform, and to go at Vegeta normally. They were exchanging blows, all the while dodging their fair share of them. Jak was surprised, as before he hasn't been able to keep up with anyone at his normal state. Vegeta was very appreciative of Jak's effort, and it showed, as he was hit by a few blows, and it dealt decent damage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJak then started to change things up by using his patented combo, by charging at Vegeta, going for a kick, punch, and then energy blast. Vegeta was able to block the kick, the punch was blocked, but grazed the Saiyan's face, and then Jak focused his energy into the blast, which caught Vegeta off guard. The blast sent Vegeta a fair distance, as he crashed to the ground. Jak slightly pumped his fist, but realized he wasn't done and continued to pursue Vegeta.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVegeta was shaking off the rubble, but before he could fully finish doing that, he had to avoid another punch from Jak. Jak got nothing but the ground, but then focused his energy, landed on the ground, and then immediately flew up to Vegeta again at a very high speed. Vegeta's eyes widened, as Jak was able to get a fairly clean shot of Vegeta's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis sent Vegeta crashing into a mountain, the impact taking down the rock formation. Jak was surprised at how well he was performing in this battle so far. He didn't make any assumptions quite yet. If anything, he knew that this was far from over. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was rumbling...and an golden like aura sprang from the desolated rubble of the mountain. Vegeta returned the favor quickly, as he started to pound on Jak. Jak was of course, taken off guard...and was getting beaten down by Super Saiyan Vegeta. Vegeta ended his beatdown with a elbow to Jak's back, sending him down quickly. Jak immediately hit the ground and before he crashed, he transformed into Omega Form...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Finally...\" Vegeta said. \"He powered up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJak looked up at Vegeta. The familiar aura from the form engulfed him, and his dark brown eyes changed to the green-blue color he's become used to. Hair didn't change, but Jak blamed that on the nature of his hair. The teen charged, and so did Vegeta. However, Jak would pull a funny on his opponent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"VEGETA!\" Jak said, talking in a gruff, funny,  sounding voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Vegeta said, stopping and having the O_o face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can fly...\" Jak said, and started to laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Um.\" Vegeta said. \"I can see that...earthling.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry about that.\" Jak said. \"I had to. Let's continue.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVegeta brushed the strange remark, and the two continued to fight. Jak...however was struggling to keep with with Vegeta, even in his Omega Form. The Saiyan seemed to be a few steps quicker than his opponent. Jak was going to struggle bus if something didn't change.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake, Joana, Jasmine, and the anime heroes were coming across the battle. They decided to just walk over and not really get far ahead to watch the fight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See?\" Joana told her younger friend. \"Didn't walking here and talking to me and the others get your mind off Jak?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It did...\" Jasmine said. \"I'm sure he's doing fine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah!\" Goku said. \"Hopefully it isn't to the point where they're both hurt severely.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um guys...\" Ichago said. \"Isn't that-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJak crashed in the area where the heroes were arriving...and he just so happened to crush right in front of his girlfriend. Jasmine eye widened and she started to do her usual worrying of her Luigi-Boogums.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OMG ARE YOU OKAY!?\" Jasmine said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, I expected more from you out of this form, earthling!\" Vegeta said, landing on the ground. \"You're really making me doubt you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"LEAVE HIM!\" Jasmine said, covering Jak. \"This fight is over!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVegeta got a somewhat twisted idea to motivate Jak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...\" Vegeta agreed. \"I agreed, this fight should be over..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"....Hm.\" Blake had some idea of what Vegeta was going to do but didn't stop it. 'I'm sure Jak will instantly get back into this' he thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVegeta then walked over to Jasmine. The teenage goddess got uncomfortable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing.\" Jasmine said. \"I said he's through, dont yo-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVegeta backhanded Jasmine to knock her out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"VEGETA!?\" Goku said. \"Why would you do that! Boy you're crazy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJak's vision was a bit blurry as he opened his eyes, but he saw Vegeta standing over his girlfriend...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Trust me, it's for the best.\" Vegeta said. \"We'll see something-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wind suddenly picked up, and dust started to form. This was occuring around Jak, as he quickly stood up, and something was different...the energy level that Jak was giving was unreal. The aura was accompanied by white lighting bolts, and the power increase was apparent. Jak felt it again...he knew that this was a more enhanced type of his Omega Form. He used it before, to escape from Jasmine in once instance when he and Blake were flying around the Deathray and then outside. But he didn't care. he wanted Vegeta to get away from his girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey.\" Jak said, \"Step off. Get away from her. Did you do this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I did.\" Vegeta said. \"It was the only way to-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJak dashed at Vegeta and as he dashed, Vegeta found himself flying at a extreme speed. Jak didn't even touch him, but he went flying. Jak then teleported and delivered a hard punch to Vegeta's back. This made the Saiyan cough up blood. Jak took the opportunity to kick him into the air. Vegeta would go flying once again, but stopped and charged up his power. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"BIG BANG ATTACK!!!!\" Vegeta screamed, and fired his signature blast at Jak. Jak didn't flinch, and just flew towards the blast. The blast seemed to engulf Jak, but after a while, a white blast over powered the orange blast. And Vegeta's eye's widened as the blast covered him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJak then suddenly reverted to his normal state, as he wasn't able to quite hold the powered up Omega Form once again. 'MAN! I need to find a way to hold that. Felt almost unstoppable. Seems to be triggered by my emotions...'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJak tried to aim his landing near his girlfriend, as he slowly fell to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Incredible!\" Goku said. \"His power increased by lot!\" He then looked over at Vegeta who teleported next to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Give me a Senzu Bean, Clown.\" Vegeta said. \"He gave me trouble when he powered up again...Reminded me of Gohan when he battled Cell.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It did...but leave him be for now.\" Goku said. \"Him and his girlfriend are out cold because of you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Natural badass.\" Vegeta said. \"But it's amazing. If he trains more, I'm sure he'll be able to sustain that powered up form he assumed, with training of course.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what next?\" Blake said, who was quiet...</span></div></div>",

Slightly surprised by this, Vegeta was caught off guard, and Blake punched him in the stomach, and tried to knock him down with a low circular kick, however, Vegeta didn't fall, and merely floated in the air before disappearing and reappearing behind Blake, he punched him in the face this time, sending him crashing into a bunch of rocks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake got out from under the rocks rather quickly, and dusted himself off, while Vegeta frowned -\"Why are you not using your full power?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I had to see how would I do with just my normal strength\"- Blake commented, and stood ready to fight again, Vegeta's eye twitched a little 'This Earthling is even holding back during a fight... AGAINST ME!' he thought annoyed. Blake simply disappeared and reappeared in front of Vegeta, he tried to punch him in the stomach but Vegeta caught his fist, but in the meantime, Blake punched him in the face, making him release his hand, and he added 2 spinning kicks to his face and one to the stomach, he sent him a good distance away, and hit his back with a rock, although it didn't break, it cracked noticeably.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVegeta growled a bit and dashed at Blake, blocking his punches while landing a powerful kick to his stomach, although Blake still punched him in the face, but Vegeta caught his arm and smashed him to the ground and started walking away -\"You're not using you full power, this battle is pointless... Maybe I have to hit your girlfriend as well to see if y-\"- Vegeta was cut off in the middle of his taunt as a full powered light form x7 Blake punched him in the face with tremendous power, sending him through the rock from before, and further away into a large boulder, which collapsed on him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVegeta stood up, and wiped a little bit of blood off the corner of hi slips -\"Now that's something, comparable to the other Earthling...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"He's actually a bit stronger, Vegeta\"- Goku commented, as he sensed Blake's power 'However, it flows violently, it doesn't look like a stable release of power' he thought while observing the battle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"That's just better\"- Vegeta then disappeared, but Blake followed suit, and the two started an insane high speed battle, with powerful shockwaves every second at different locations, and the ground shaking and cracking. Blake was actually holding his own very decently against Vegeta, and landed a few good punches, however, Vegeta caught on something Blake seemed to lack. To confirm his suspicion, he fired an energy ball, which Blake countered with one of his own, making a small explosion. Then Vegeta flew up and stayed in mid air, Blake started attacking him with energy balls and beams.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'It appears this guy hasn't gotten the hang of flying...' Vegeta thought, and simply deflected or countered Blake's attacks, but remained flying, and decided to taunt him -\"What's wrong? Can't fly?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake clenched his fist in anger while Vegeta laughed, however even his laugh was cut short when Blake crouched, and did a powerful jump, kicking Vegeta in the face, as well as punching him several times as they fell, Vegeta tried to fly away but Blake grabbed his neck with one hand while punching him with the other one, and Vegeta started kneeing him, but Blake wasn't letting go, and Vegeta's face started becoming blue. Goku had a hearty laugh at his current predicament, and, as angry as he was, he was still forced to land safely on the ground, with Blake, who promptly let go, but only to kick him in the stomach and crash him through a few large boulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVegeta growled angrily and cracked his knuckles, and flew up and then towards him, but he noticed Blake was performing some sorts of hand signs while muttering<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Sacred Power, Gold as the sunlight, the light that pierces through darkness, burn the enemy down to ashes. Burn their sins, destroy the evil...\"- As Vegeta approached, Blake said the rest of the incantation -\"Strike three times, holy beams of light!\"- Blake fired with both hands 3 powerful golden beams that spiraled around each other, and Vegeta was totally caught off guard with this kind of technique, he used one hand to stop it, but the energy was engulfing it, and he used both to try and stop it, but it was still pushing him away, and he could hear Blake again<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Shards of sunlight, pieces of heavenly force, made into knives, piercing the enemy, stab to death the wicked and evil, slice the darkness, Light Knives!\"- Blake said with his hands clasped together, and a bunch of roughly 50 knives, all made of golden light, appeared above him, and they immediately went after Vegeta, who was still trying to block the triple beam, the knives struck him and at the same time, the beams exploded at him. Naruto, Ichigo and Joana had all completely baffled faces, while Goku had an impressed look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"If anything, it seems a bit too long to chant those techniques, but they look worth it!\"- He said giving Blake a thumbs up, he just smiled and gave a thumbs up back, however, the smoke dissipated, and a noticeably burned Vegeta floated in the air, he smiled though<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I hadn't seen this kind of technique in all my years of fighting. You used them wisely\"- He floated down until he landed on the ground -\"However, you used up quite a bit of your ammo with those shots\"- He said, observing that Blake was breathing heavily -\"Just like with the other guy, you need endurance, you can't be sure just a few powerful attacks can defeat an enemy, in the worst cases, you'll have to keep firing your best attacks\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake raised an eyebrow at Vegeta giving him actual advice, but then he remembered that it had been a long time since he was evil, and just nodded -\"We're fairly early in our training, but yeah, I'll keep those things in mind\"- However, by the look in Vegeta's eyes, he knew the fight wasn't over yet, and they charged at each other, exchanging fast punches and kicks, and then they dashed away from each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Your size does help you a bit, hmph, longer reach of punches and kicks is just as annoying, regardless of the power level...\"- <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake himself laughed at the mention of his own size being even relevant in a fight, considering his girlfriend and Jak's took that to a much greater level. He noticed that Vegeta powered up for the first time in their fight -\"I shall honor your power, by using at least the super saiyan form!\"- Vegeta said, and Blake had a small sweatdrop in the back of his head, still remembering that he, fused with Jak using the Potara earrings still failed to beat freaking Frieza.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVegeta turned into a Super Saiyan, and even chuckled at the resemblance of their auras, although Blake's was plain golden, while his varied from yellowish to a more gold like tone. He disappeared, and when he reappeared, Blake fired an energy blast from his hands at point blank at his face, but when he dashed back, Vegeta was already next to him and kicked him into another boulder, and started firing a quick series of small energy blasts (Vegeta's characteristic spam tactic). Blake put his arms in an X shape to protect his face and vital organs and slowly advanced forward, taking many of the shots Vegeta was firing at him. Even the proud saiyan was impressed, and stopped firing,  allowing Blake to dash at him and try to attack him, but Vegeta caught and blocked every single punch and kick, until he heard him muttering again...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Celestial Light, Crown of stars. Glory of the Heaven, Bind the Darkness Forever, Tie! Halo of Repentance\"- Blake fired from his hand 3 powerful rings made of golden light that homed in on Vegeta and bound his legs, arms and mid section. He started struggling to break free and observed Blake putting his hands on the ground<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Purify, Destroyer of souls, Bring the judgement of light...\"- He said, and a golden circle appeared on the ground beneath Vegeta -\"...Consume the darkness, sentence to death, Incinerate, heavenly lights!!\"- Blake finished the spell, and a golden heptagram formed within the circle, and then, pillars of light started rising from each point, and they converged into a single powerful pillar of golden fire-like energy, which caught Vegeta completely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Whoah...\"- Goku said, impressed by the attack<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I can tell that had to cost a ton of energy\"- Ichigo commented, while Naruto nodded<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"That's the kind of heavy artillery one can only use a few times\"- The ninja said, although Goku raised an eyebrow, remembering he could do Kamehameha quite  a lot of times, but his super saiyan 3 form actually drained energy from him quickly, and the spirit bomb took very long to charge...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pillar eventually dissipated, and Vegeta was still burning with some golden flames on him, his clothes had somewhat severe damage and he had burns all over his body, but didn't look weakened...</span></div></div>",

Blake tried his best to push it away from him but it was too powerful, and it ended up exploding. Joana gasped at the immense explosion, but she sighed in relief when she saw Blake's silhouette standing up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVegeta's eyes widened suddenly, and he dodged Blake's sword, which had been thrown at him and sliced easily through the rocks behind, and because he turned to see the sword, he didn't see Blake appearing in front of him, who delivered a few powerful punches to him before Vegeta regained his rhythm and started blocking... Only now he noticed that Blake had been punching him with his right arm, the left one was burned deeply, and he guessed he used that one to block most of the damage. Blake managed to land a punch to Vegeta's jaw, but Vegeta kneed him in the stomach and kicked him against a rock. Blake's hair stopped spiking upwards, and his golden aura vanished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"It was a good fight. I want to see how they develop in a few years\"- Vegeta said dusting himself off, Goku went and brought the now unconscious Blake in his arms<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Vegeta is a little crazy and tends to be carried away, but he enjoyed these battles, your, uh... husband... whatever, fought well. When these guys wake up I could give them some classes and maybe a sparring match\"- Goku said to Joana, and handed her senzu beans for Blake, Jak and Jasmine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile Naruto and Ichigo were shuddering -\"What kind of power WAS THAT?\"- Naruto asked angry at nobody in particular<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"That guy makes the Arrancar seem like nothing...\"- Ichigo said -\"That guy Blake is not to be taken lightly either. I already fought him, and I can tell for sure that he's used to fighting opponents stronger than himself. His abilities all seem focused on overcoming his own limits to equal or surpass the enemy's power. I thought we were on about the same level, but he used that same level and managed to keep up with that other guy, and used powerful attacks that at least did some scratches on him... Maybe he would've put up a fair fight to the Arrancars I've battled if not outright beating them\"- Ichigo said, and walked to where Joana was<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"He also has friends to protect, perhaps we're not so different\"- He said with a slight laugh<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Uh... I'm his girlfriend...\"- Joana replied<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"HUH?!\"- Ichigo was taken by surprise, but then just laughed and scratched his head -\"Well, all the more reason to fight, to protect someone so special to him. Congratulations you two\"- He said, although he felt a bit awkward, as this slightly reminisced him of Orihime, but he shrugged off the thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"So, not only he has those powers but he also has a girl... I'm starting to believe life isn't very fair...\"- Naruto said with a frown<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Well, he's actually had it really bad since he was a kid, and I can barely help him... For someone who's been through a lot for 18 years, one good thing wouldn't hurt\"- Joana said although she blushed a little, and fed Blake the senzu bean while caressing his hair<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"18? I thought he was the same age as me\"- Ichigo commented with a ._. face<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Yeah, people say that a lot. Except for being taller, he hasn't really changed much since I met him, and that was when he was 12\"- Joana added, smiling<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoana fed him a senzu bean while resting his head on her lap, and she observed that his injuries all healed quickly, but still, perhaps by reflex, she focused power in her hands, gently infusing her own power into him. Vegeta apparently sended this, and turned around, observing her<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I wouldn't have thought Earthlings could have a healing power like that of those Nameks...\"- He said, and focused a bit into sensing Joana's power -\"You're stronger than you let us think before. But I'm guessing that boy wouldn't like it if I were to battle you, at least for now\"- He said with a very subtle laugh and turned around once again<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What are you gonna do Vegeta?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I thought of going to grab a bite of something, haven't eaten since we arrived to this place\"- He said while walking away<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Huh, food? Hey Vegeta! Wait for me!\"- Goku ran after the proud saiyan prince...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"For some reason, I am not surprised...\"- Ichigo said, remembering that quite a lof of shinigami like Yoruichi and even humans like Orihime could eat quite a lot themselves -\"How do they even fit all that much food in their stomachs?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"It's pretty easy when food is delicious\"- Naruto replied while laughing a bit and scratching the back of his head -\"I could empty a good Ramen store before I got full\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Figures...\"- Ichigo said, still baffled<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Hey, you, uh, is there Ramen in your universe?\"- Naruto said to Joana, who giggled<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Actually yes, and it's even one of the stereotypical foods for young adults... We don't eat it often because Blake or me can cook other stuff\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"That guy looks like he can beat up people, but I wouldn't have thought he would cook...\"- Naruto commented<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"He does, and while he knows less recipes than me, his seasoning is better. And you haven't ever tasted the pizza he makes...\"- Joana smiled, imagining it, without realizing she drooled a little, and some of it splashed on lake's face, waking him up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Huh...\"- Blake groggily woke up -\"It's raining?\"- A little bit more of drool hit him in the face, and he felt it was warmer and kinda stickier than water he touched it with his hand, and examined it, intrigued, however, then he looked up and saw Joana looking distracted and that some of her drool was what fell on his face, he immediately sat up with a jump from the shock<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Holy hell!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoana finally snapped out of it, and got startled by Blake's sudden reaction, while Naruto was laughing, and Ichigo stayed baffled, he mumbled<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"So, healing saliva, again?\"- Ichigo scratched his head in confusion<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Scratch healing, but yes...\"- Blake said, and he started to very quickly and thoroughly wipe his face with his jacket -\"Seriously, what the hell?!\"- Joana wiped her mouth dry<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You're overreacting\"- She said, trying not to laugh but she was having some difficult<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You weren't the one woken up by freaking drool on your face!\"- Blake replied annoyed<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I agree, it was not nice...\"- Ichigo said, looking a bit paler than usual<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"See?\"- Blake said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"These guys...\"- Naruto mumbled but he couldn't help and started laughing frantically<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Blake, we've been boyfriend and girlfriend for 3 years so far, and by this point, that should be the last of your concerns\"- Joana said with a flirty look and before he could react she pulled him for a passionate kiss<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Now that's a counter argument I hadn't seen before...\"- Ichigo said, feeling even more baffled, but he noticed Naruto was still laughing -\"How come am I the only sane person even with people from other universes?\"- He muttered<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Nah, she's actually kind of right...\"- Naruto said after he stopped laughing<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"...what...\"- Ichigo said, not even looking at him<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"It's boyfriend and girlfriend things, heh, I should know...\"- Naruto said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"...YOU have a girlfriend?\"- Ichigo asked even more baffled<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Yeah, Hinata. She's a pretty girl, a little shy, but yeah...\"- Naruto answered, and observing Ichigo and his baffled 'I don't get this' face, he laughed again -\"You're telling me you're still single?!\"- He then laughed even more uncontrollably<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I'M JUST 16 DAMNIT!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"ME TOO!\"- <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I HATE YOU!\"- Ichigo crossed his arms, slightly frustrated, meanwhile, Joana let go of the kiss, and smiled at Blake<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Ok, I did overreact, but still, why the hell...?\"- He said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I just got distracted when thinking of the pizzas you make\"- Joana giggled<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Next time give me an umbrella\"- Blake joked, and Joana playfully frowned, and shrunk him before he could do anything else, the 2 anime heroes had been arguing comically but they noticed what happened and stopped in their tracks. They were baffled beyond anything they had seen before as she dropped the now shrunken Blake into her mouth<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Holy crap! You ate him?!\"- Naruto said in disbelief<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Hey, Maybe I don't know stuff from other universes, but come on, you don't do that to a good guy\"- Ichigo said, subtly griping his sword<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoana merely grabbed Blake's notebook, which she took before shrinking him without anyone seeing and wrote on it 'I did not eat him. Let's  just say this is a different variant of kissing. Don't worry, I take care f him with my life, but sometimes I like to mess with him. Also, I was driving my point about his overreaction'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchigo and Naruto just had ._. faces and looked at each other -\"Uh, alright...\"- They said in unison, and decided to follow the saiyans to go get something to eat as well...</span></div></div>",

Jasmine nudged him a bit. \"Jak, you ok?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJak was moving around in his sleep. \"I don't want to go to class today, there's a test on Algebra and I didn't study.\" Jasmine giggled a bit at this, then shrinking him to about four inches and putting him inside her cleavage, although his head was still poking out. Jak continued to snuggle and sleep. Jasmine then licked Jak, getting a reaction and waking him up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa!\" Jak said, finding himself covering in saliva. \"Ew...Did you lick me? Oh, sometimes I wonder about you.\" Jak smiled. \"So...yeah.

Jak did fight for you, he powered up and started to turn the tables on Vegeta. Almost beat him for you...\" Blake gave Jak a thumbs up, while still stuck in Joana's mouth. \"All these years, and I even still can't figure you out....\" Blake commented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Ichigo and Naruto looked at the two couples. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So strange...and here I thought my life was abnormal.\" Naruto said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're different that's for sure.\" Ichigo said, smiling. \"But they have heart, courage, and strong wills.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJasmine heard Blake and pulled Jak from out of her cleavage. \"I couldn't let him get away with hitting you like that,\" Jak said. Jasmine looked at him with her gigantic blue eyes, and she then grew him back to his normal height and jumped on to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJak blushed a bit, and was confused, as Jasmine hooked her legs around Jak's torso, while he was holding her. \"I just wanted to show anyone what'd happen if they touched my Goddess of Awesomeness, and I just lost it, but I do car-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJasmine then leaned in for a long french kiss, causing herself and Jak to fall down, but they proceed to go on with their kissing session. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"GET A ROOM!\" Naruto yelled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoana looked on and smiled. \"Maybe it'd be cute if you called me little names like that.\" She said to Blake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Curse you Jak! How many switches of Joana affection mode are there?\" Blake blushed as well, but then smiled himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so...the Goddess and her Dreamer finished their kiss in the rocky terrain they were in, both smiling and blushing a lot.

Soon his pose changed so he is standing in the air before his feet touched the ground and he snapped his fingers. Clones appeared surrounding him in every direction forming a circle around him, but his eyes hasn\u2019t opened yet as he is still focusing his mind. The clone circle around him grew as they put distance between themselves and him. He had taken off his shirt so his muscles can work without any restriction of movement and he finally opened his eyes, which are glowing white. The next evolving power is his inner power since the inner power seal appeared underneath him on the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\u201cInner Power Seal: Shatter.\u201d- Powerman said as the seal broke away and his power increased before smiling at the clones<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ring of clones made more clones to shorten the distance between them and him as he got into his stance as he tense his muscles before relaxing them. He took out to finish off the rest of his personal flask before the first clone charge at him. With his foot planted where it is on the ground, he dodged the first strike and hit the clone in the face with a hard right punch. Soon clone after clone was defeated with one powerful strike while he never moved from that spot where his foot his planted as his eyes never blinked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe started to spin in the spot as the wind started to swirl around him, but it turned into a whirlwind. A few of the clones were lifted about 50ft off the ground when they were hit by something wet, but it was blurred by the wind.

Max accepted, thnking that anything was better than doing homework, and because of that, Blake would put his name in all works as he had worked with them. Blake gave him few instructions about the school, leaving it to Max's judgement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDays later...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Hey dude, I got good news!!\"- Max rushed into Blake's department, not knocking the door, Luckily Blake and Joana were just studying for the exam. Blake smiled and asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What is it?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You won't believe it, we got admitted in AAC!!!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"AAC? What the hell is that?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"The school!!! And we need no exam, what's more, we got in there for free!!\"- Joana stopped her typing and turned her chair around, not believing it<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"For...free? No exam?...Max...what did you do this time?!\"- She rose an eyebrow and looked at him suspiciously<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I did nothing this time, believe me!!\"- Blake rose an eyebrow and asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What does AAC stand for?\"- Max took out a pamphlet and read, mumbling <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Hmm...then this is it...\"- <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What?!\"- Both Blake and Joana exclaimed<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Anthro Autonomous College...So that's why a cheetah was the secretary then...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"WTF?! You got us in an all anthro school?!!\"- Blake exclaimed and added<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"If our school's bullies were already a problem imagine a real bull...or an elephant...a rhino...or a shark anthro!! They are gonna kill us!!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I thought you could kick bullies' asses like always...\"- Max said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"HUMAN bullies...anthros almost have superstrength and other stuff...they're far stronger than a human!! And we'll be their snack!!\"- Blake replied<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Don't worry, it's an all girls school...\"- Both Blake and Joana fell to the ground face first when heard that, then Blake, after getting up, asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Even worse...What THE HELL did you do?!! I'm not gonna wear girl's clothes...and I'm not gonna borrow yours\"- He said the latter looking at Joana who was laughing, then she said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You lack chest and hips to wear mine\"- Blake closed his face with his left hand and Joana kept laughing until Blake said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Well...if you go in that school it'll be almost like we went to a male school...anthro girls will have you for lunch\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Aww c'mon, don't be like that, I think there are good anthros, anyway they don't need to eat us...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Well, whatever, how the hell did you get us into an all girls school?! I can understand Joana got in there, but why did you have to lie, man, there were plenty of open schools!!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"They had a special promotion, it was in a big sign inside the attendance office, it said 'For the first time, we admit humans for free and with no exam' \"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"But how did you get us among all people?\"- Joana asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"WE were ALL PEOPLE. Nobody else had come to there...and I asked about it to the secretary, a cheetah, she was very nice to me, and told me that even human males were admitted, but females would have priority\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"And you got us in there just like that? I guess I can't complain...there are no currently open schools...that's what I get for leaving something to your judgement...\"- Max patted him in the back and said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Cheer up man!! There will be plenty of girls!! And I'm sure there will be several niiice ones...rawwrr\"- He mimicked a tiger, and Blake knocked him in the back of his head, he asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What was that for?!\"- Blake replied with an *Ahem!* and pointing at Joana with his eyes<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Uh...sorry...No problem, more for me heheheh!!\"-</span></div></div>",

And I'll be with you so you won't be lalone\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"No...I...must...run...must...survive...\"- Joana greeted Max and he did so. Blake, knowing he wouldn't be able to run away, stopped trying to, and Joana let his arm free. Max said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Well...I got our schedules...and it seems that the principal wants to talk to all us after class...\"- He handed the schedules and they noticed that they were all the same, and Blake sighed, saying sarcastically<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What did they bother for?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Maybe because we're a rare group in this whole school...\"- Joana began to say and Blake replied<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Yeah!! We are three HUMANS in an ALL GIRLS FRICKIN' SCHOOL!! And it's an ANTHRO school!!! At least you're a girl. I won't fit in here I know that for sure\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I wouldn't tell until I meet the girls...\"- Max said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Hey! What about a plan to get outta here, huh?\"- Blake whispered to him, and Joana pulled him by his neckchain<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I heard it!! You're not going to escape to your first day of college!!\"- Blake struggled and then Joana wrapped her arms around his neck and said, with puppy eyes<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Will you leave your girlfriend alone?\"- Blake stared at her and replied<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I...uh....Arrrghhh!! I hate emotional blackmail!! I won't fall for that...\"- Joana kept staring at him with the puppy eyes until he said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Argh...okay...I'll stay...\"- Joana kissed him and then he muttered<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Like I had another option anyway...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey followed Max to where it seemed to be their classroom, and just in time. Joana knocked the door <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I hope they don't make us do the stupid introduction stuff' Blake thought. When they arrived the students were already there and the teacher ( Looked like this <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://chalosan.deviantart.com/art/Field-Cowgirl-Alejandra-62888016\" target=\"_blank\">http://chalosan.deviantart.com/art/Field...</a> -&gt;Just that she's wearing more formal clothes as a teacher) said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Oh. You must be the new students. You're right on time\"- Blake thought 'Oh crud!!' The teacher stood up and said to her students<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Today we have three new students. As you know, this year, our school has invited humans to study here. Well, here are they, they were assigned to this clasroom, so be nice to them\"- Joana was the first one to walk in, and after her Balke and Max entered, and that's when everyone gasped<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"May you introduce yourselves please?\"- Blake and Max stared at Joana forsome seconds, with the 'You go' look<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Um...Hi...My name is Joana and I'm 19...\"- Then, she quickly nudged Blake, who sighed and said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"My name is Blake...I'm 18...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Hi girls. I am Max, I'm 19, and is very nice to meet you\"- He bowed like a gentleman, and Blake whispered to him<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Don't you think it's too soon for that? Wait at least a week!!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Well. Is there something you want to ask to our new classmates?\"- The teacher asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What race are you?\"- A cute vixen asked (Looked like this <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://chalosan.deviantart.com/art/BBQ-Ann-120701976\" target=\"_blank\">http://chalosan.deviantart.com/art/BBQ-A...</a> )<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Err...what?\"- Blake rose an eyebrow<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Humans...I guess...\"- Joana replied<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe teacher giggled and said <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Human is your species, she meant what variant of that are you..Don't worry I think it's in the records they gave me in the morning...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Umm...miss...\"- Blake said<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe teacher mumbled something while searched for the files, then she said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Gotcha!! Well, let's see...according to this, Joana, you're a Spanish...Max is an American and Blake is a latino\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake asked,, hiding the anger<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Uhm...miss...may I ask...who filled in these files?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I don't know. If you weren't maybe the person who signed you in did it\"- A vein popped in his forehead and looked at Max with a killer look<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Hey!! Calm down...Accept it, you are a latino, and not even you know where are you from...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Ok. I guess I can't blame you...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe teacher said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Okay.

After thinking for a long time, I decided that this story is better than the originally intended sequel. This is the canon sequel</u></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><div align=\"center\">SWGF/GTS CHARACTERS</div></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>This story is set 2 years after the events of SWGF/GTS original story</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">Main Characters:</div><br>\r\n <br>\r\n<b>Blake</b>: Tall and strong 18 years old latino boy (long black wavy hair and black eyes, tanned skin). He's grown fighting since he was very young, but his overall stats increased after his first encounter with Blaze. He's reached a higher level than most of people and can put up a fight against Blaze, being able to move at inhuman speed and being able to take a lot more of damage than an average person. He's been training very hard for 2 years<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the way, He's very smart and even gets high notes without studying for exams. And, his latino look is because of his mexican heritage, despite Blake's 3/4 Spanish and just 1/4 Mexican. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake stands at <b>6'2\" (190 cm)</b>. He has a rare custom, sleeps with more ease in a hammock, because when he lived wit his father, that's how they slept. This particular custom comes from Mexico's Southeastern region, suggesting possible Mayan heritage in Blake's blood, though he doesn't resemble mayan people at all. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe resembles mostly his Spanish heritage, but with Mexican skin tone. His wavy hair is a Spanish trait while its black color is because of the mexican blood. Has several scars on his body, one on his chest, some others in his back and in both arms (near his elbows, he has a scar in each one, slightly above the elbows) and his most noticeable, the one on his right eye (The eye isn't harmed and works perfectly)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe likes videogames but doesn't get to play too often. He likes Hard Rock and mostly Power Metal. He tolerates the rest of music except possibly country, reggaeton (Blake hates it) and pop. He's usually silent, and rarely talks to people he doesn't care about. However, he will protect his girlfriend and/or friends at any cost. Most of his personal motivations and thoughts remain a mystery and only tells about his life to people he trusts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe's also shy (to girls, specially Joana) and amazingly innocent for someone his age (despite he can coldly calculate his enemies actions and intentions, even analyze their psychology). acting shy even with his own girlfriend, and not showing any particular taste in women.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Joana</b> (Blake's girlfriend): 19 years old beautiful girl. She met Blake in the first day of 7th grade and they've been together since 10th. She's somewhat tall, standing at <b>5'9\" (180 cm)</b>. Her hair is light brown and very long, almost reaching her waist, and is wavy. She usually wears it as a ponytail. Her skin is white and she's Spanish. Her body however resembles more a latina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe surprisingly started liking power metal after hearing it, much to Blake's surprise. Yet she listens music a typical girl would She still acts girly as typical, though in her relationship she takes the initiative. She's smart but just a little above average. Blake's intelligence and maturity are higher than hers. However she's a lot more outgoing than him. And her intuition has proven to be superior to Blake's<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer parents are full blooded Spanish, and she was born in Mexico, where she lived her childhood, until 11 years. For some kind of problem with her being foreign, she lost a school grade, ending up in Blake's class next year. Also shares Blake's custom of being more likely to sleep in a hammocks...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Blaze</b>: The evil guy. Age unknown, but might be almost half of Lith's... A weird unkown being who likes to fight and has found in Blake a tough rival. He looks like a 16 years old boy with long white hair which covers his eyes. (Dark red but they can glow when Blaze's furious or powered up). Stands at Blake's height and seems to have the same body type, though his skin is very pale.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvil, sadistic, irresponsible and somewhat strange at his methods. He has the power  to shrink people, or to do other things like cloning himself at industrial scales, creating powerful armies entirely of clones of himself. He's powerful enough to challenge gods and be at their level, he also has super strength, hyper speed and a lot of durability, being nearly immortal, but his weakness is that only a mortal can kill him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlso he has a lot of stamina and is difficult to hurt him. He also possesses dark powers and magic, and he can heal back from injuries, though the only one known who deals true damage to him is Blake, and the damage caused by him doesn't repair itself as quick as ordinary damage. Most of time he isn't serious at fights<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe always looks the same and doesn't age. He looks like this<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a class=\"blue2roll\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://chibisnowangel.deviantart.com/art/Yami-no-Bakura-13342118\" target=\"_blank\">http://chibisnowangel.deviantart.com/art/Yami-no-Bakura-13342118</a> <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a class=\"blue2roll\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://korone.deviantart.com/art/God-of-the-Moon-13273184\" target=\"_blank\">http://korone.deviantart.com/art/God-of-the-Moon-13273184</a> -&gt;The hairstyle covers his eyes like this one but the rest is like the previous one. Only add that he has red eyes and dresses in white and gray. Some times appears with an angel-like suit. That one will be shown later. Also, wears a black inverted cross in a black necklace)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Lith</b> (Millenniums old): Nothing more and nothing less that World's Goddess. She's very kind and supportive. Can grant powers, heal and even resurrect people, though she can't destroy Blaze nor Omega 17. She has naturally green hair and aqua eyes. She is Mother Earth<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looks like this<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a class=\"blue2roll\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://faeriefaeria.deviantart.com/art/mother-earth-21436225\" target=\"_blank\">http://faeriefaeria.deviantart.com/art/mother-earth-21436225</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a class=\"blue2roll\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://latiscity.deviantart.com/art/Mother-Earth-4504413\" target=\"_blank\">http://latiscity.deviantart.com/art/Mother-Earth-4504413</a> -&gt; Her face is more like this one, but with aqua eyes. The rest of her looks like the previous link<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Omega 17</b> (Millenniums old): Unknown being called by many names like the Fallen One or the Dark One. Is mentioned to be the Evil God. Sealed long ago somewhere, in a remote temple. Currently he has no body, and usually appears as a black flaming silhouette with red eyes, but also can appear as The Beast, like this<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a class=\"blue2roll\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://dj88.deviantart.com/art/Lucifer-Number-of-the-beast-113444372\" target=\"_blank\">http://dj88.deviantart.com/art/Lucifer-Number-of-the-beast-113444372</a>  He has another forms but those will be revealed in story's flashbacks. Stay tuned! His true body and form will be shown later in story<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">Secondary Characters:</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nKarina (18 years old): A good friend of Joana and Blake, she's cute but isn't Blake's type. She doesn't seem to have more interest about him than friendship and she probably would help if Blake was in trouble (But Joana was the one who has done that the whole time).Blonde with green eyes and short hair. She's Ayrton's girlfriend. Longest female friend of Blake, they met at 4th grade and she was a fighting since those days.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe has still fighting skills, and helps Blake in fights where he's losing by physical disadvantages or numerical...Her body is possibly B cups but hard muscular thighs, and nice hips (as one of her most used attack was kicking). Green eyes. In height she's average, but looks like the petite type (she's shorter than Joana and much lighter) <b>5'5\" (168 cm)</b>. approx.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Claire</b> (18 years old): Blake's friend (since 3th year, second longest one since Karina). Very beautiful and the only one even Blake has thought could rival Joana's beauty. Her differences with Joana are that she is actually 3/4 American and 1/4 Japanese, though she retains the japanese eyes, which make her look really sensual (Joana hates this), while Joana's are big, light brown and cute. Stands at <b>5'6\" (170 cm)</b> approx.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlso, though Joana's thighs are thicker, Claire's seem slightly thinner and longer, the other difference is that she has a bit of tummy (and Joana hasn't, because she plays volleyball and basketball. Still, it's not enough to call Claire fat, in fact, it makes her to look kinda cute.). She has black straight hair worn as a ponytail. She hugs and kisses Blake (in cheek) a little often, causing Joana to be jealous of her (that and the obvious rivalry they have over the same guy).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough she's aware Blake has a girlfriend, most of times she doesn't pay attention to it, as she \"only acts friendly\". Her feelings to Blake have never been clear as she acted as protective as Joana in the time they didn't know each other. Some times it seems Joana wants just to kill her (And Blake has to appear to prevent it)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe's very likely to help and taking care of Blake, but due to her relationship with Joana, it's not very probable she'd give him back to her (She also acts some times jealous as Joana has a better body and is Blake's girlfriend)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Rocky </b><b>(8 years, in dog form, he'd look like 20's in anthro form)</b>: Black Pitbull belonging to Blake. He's half English Staffordshire and half American Pitbull. A good dog, who often helps Blake when fighting in streets (though in school Blake fights alone or with Karina's help)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIs bigger than an ordinary pitbull, standing almost as tall as Joana when on two. He's not skinny nor fat like rottweilers. He's toned and his body is a bit thick but muscular. His snout is a bit longer and sharper than a pitbull's. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs an anthro, is a big guy, with a thick yet muscular body. He would stand at <b>6'3\" (195 cm)</b>, but looking far bulkier than Blake, who has a balanced musclar body (NO STEROIDS, but still, larger muscles than average people). Very strong and is the most resistant. He can take more damage than any other anthro. His bite easily crushes bones and his hand-paws can cause big wounds. His face would look like this: <a class=\"blue2roll\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.bull911.com/img/black-pitbull.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.bull911.com/img/black-pitbull.jpg</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Max </b><b>(6 years, would look 18 in anthro form)</b>: White half-siamese cat. Not much to say besides also protects Blake's department and is Rocky's best friend besides Blake himself. Very shy to a female cat called Tabitha<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs an anthro, Max is very fast and has the best reflexes. His claws on both hand-paws and feet-paws can slash deeply. As an anthro he'd stand almost as tall as Blake, at 6'1\". A little disadvantage is that his energies run out faster due to being a feline (all felines have low stamina)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe'd look like this, but the darker orange parts are brown instead, and the light orange fur is white. He has zaphire blue eyes also: <a class=\"blue2roll\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://media.photobucket.com/image/half%20siamese%20cat/SeriestaSalamare/Warrior%20RP%20Charries/flame-point-siamese-cat-bonsaibu-1.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://media.photobucket.com/image/half%20siamese%20cat/SeriestaSalamare/Warrior...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Tabitha (5 years, would look 19 in anthro form)</b>: Female bicolor cat (black and white, with half of her face white and other black, also, most of her legs' fur is white and look like long boots)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs an anthro, she has most of Max's traits though she looks more delicate as her body is shaped more femininely. Tabitha is faster than Max but even in her animal form it was obvious she was a female (delicate face and body, some female cats are practically identical to males). <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe has better reflexes and even in her animal form, was far better at hunting than Max, which proves her superior speed and agility. However, Max was the one who along Rocky, protected the house and themselves from stray animals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe as an anthro would stand at 5'5\". But her body is thinner and more the petite type. Possibly C-cups and moderate hips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn her animal form she looked like this: <a class=\"blue2roll\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://thecatsite.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2008/06/cat_81_reg-400x181.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://thecatsite.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2008/06/cat_81_reg-400x181.jpg</a><br>\r\n<a class=\"blue2roll\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1002/542211514_c824b82668.jpg?v=0\" target=\"_blank\">http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1002/542211514_c824b82668.jpg?v=0</a> -&gt;she doesn't wear collar<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd yeah, half of her face is white and other is black. Green eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b> D'Artagnan (5 years, would look 17 in anthro form)</b>: A Belize slider turtle. As an anthro is pretty well balanced and has a good level of strenght and speed, plus the shell as an armor, light and very resistant. His claws are sharper than Rocky's but less than Max's, though they're smaller. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf for any reason a fight gets taken underwater, D'Artagnan definitively PWNS anyone. In ground is very fast, and can resist very much, even possibly more than Rocky due to his shell, but is not as fast as Max. He uses most advanced fighting moves based in Blake's own moves. Has yellow eyes. Also, his body is very flexible, specially his neck. Weakness: Cold weather<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looks like this (animal form): <a class=\"blue2roll\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Belize_slider.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Belize_slider.jpg</a><br>\r\n<a class=\"blue2roll\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Mexican_slider.gif\" target=\"_blank\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Mexican_slider.gif</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt his anthro form he'd stand as tall as Max, but he'd have his long flexible and muscular neck. His legs and arms would be more muscled than Max's but not as bulky as Rocky's. He has a medium toned body, resembling Blake a lot. For some reason, he's the smartest of Blake's pets<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOther recurring characters may appear but with minor roles (As Cinthya and her friends, or Lillian, though her role would be even minor.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><div align=\"center\"><span class=\"noselect\" style=\"cursor:pointer;\" oncontextmenu=\"uport_ajax_rt_opts (event, this, 'doctorlove', '', '', '', '10', '', 'ON', '100661752'); hide_uport (); this.shown=1; return false;\" onclick=\"uport_ajax_opts (event, this, 'doctorlove', '', '', '', '10', '', 'ON'); hide_uport (); this.shown=1;\"><a title=\"Username: doctorlove\r\nMember Since: November 7th, 2008\r\nClick for links!\" style=\"line-height: 1em;font-size:1em;cursor:pointer;\">Friendly Thinker</a></span> <span class=\"noPrint\">(<a title=\"View doctorlove's Community Recognition\" class=\"blue2roll\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"javascript:LaunchPop('https://www.Writing.Com/main/authors/action/overall/user_id/doctorlove',%20'CommunityR_100661752',%20'400',%20'650')\">57</a>)</span> <a class=\"imgLink imgPortLink\" onmousedown=\"if(event.which == 3) { event.preventDefault(); var mywin = window.open('https://www.Writing.Com/main/portfolio/view/doctorlove','_blank'); mywin.focus (); event.stopPropagation(); return false; }\" href=\"https://www.Writing.Com/main/portfolio/view/doctorlove\" target=\"_top\" onmouseover=\"uport_ajax2 (event, this, 'doctorlove', '&lt;span style=\\'color:#990000;font-weight:bold\\'&gt;Offline or Private&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt; Last On:  Yesterday', 'Yesterday', 'November 7, 2008', '', '', '10', 'Registered Author');\" onmouseout=\"hide_uport ();\"><span style=\"padding:0px 2px 0px 0px;vertical-align:middle;\"><img src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/costumicons/ps-icon-regular-10.gif\" width=\"30\" height=\"15\" border=\"0\"></span></a><a rel=\"nofollow\" onmousedown=\"if(event.which == 3) { event.preventDefault(); LaunchPop('https://www.Writing.Com/main/em/action/new/toid/100661752',   'mess100661752_1603544833', '710', '540');  event.stopPropagation(); return false; }\" href=\"https://www.Writing.Com/main/em/action/new/toid/100661752/in/1\" target=\"_top\" title=\"Email User: doctorlove [Offline / Private]\" class=\"imgLink imgPortLink noPrint\"><span style=\"vertical-align:middle;padding:0px 0px 0px 0px;\"><img src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/mail-off.gif\" width=\"22\" height=\"15\" border=\"0\"></span></a><span class=\"noPrint\"><span id=\"new_ffdoctorlove\"><a class=\"imgLink\" style=\"cursor:pointer;\" onclick=\"doAjaxO('ffdoctorlove', '', 'post', 'https://www.Writing.Com/main/my_favorites.php', 'action=fanfav&amp;fav=1&amp;user_id=100661752&amp;nopad=1&amp;new=1&amp;ajax=new_ffdoctorlove');\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"Click to add doctorlove to 'My Favorites'. \r\nClick again to become a 'Fan'. \"><span id=\"ffdoctorlove\" style=\"padding:0px 3px 0px 3px;vertical-align:middle;\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/favplus.gif\" style=\"padding-right:1px;\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"></span></a></span></span>'s CHARACTERS</div></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of them are main...<br>\r\n<b><br>\r\nRyan Hostetter, a.k.a Ryan H. (19 years old)</b> A boy who lived a normal life until after high school when he went on a journey that lead him to find himself and found his inner powers, but some others were given to him like his flowing blade.

Soon she and her former coworker met again in a tournament when she is wearing the same ninja suit so she was still excepted into their family and the suit was bugged so the suit went haywire. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyan neutralized it without hurting her and found the bug while also giving her a check up.

She has the crystal heart necklace that her made for her with special beads and she has always worn it since her 10th birthday. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeing his daughter was strange because people would want to be her friend for a reason and she said no except for Ray because he was like her.

He is 17 years old. He is a guy who takes life calmly, and tries to be optimstic about everything. Jak has some Brazillian Jutsu skills. About 5'8, has brown eyes, his body is not fat but not too skinny, and has light-darkish skin, and has African-American traits. He's more of a passionate video gamer, playing since he was 4, and likes almost all types of music, except country. (Taylor Swift is an exception.) Likes to Joke around, but at the same time gets serious when needed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJak is very likeable because of his genuine kindness towards others, more of a peaceful guy. Had a rough start with high school, but hes a very smart kid, getting As and Bs. In his free time, he makes dancing and singing vids, which are very popular among his classmates.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAccording to the prophecy and Nostory, Jak was the key and the dreamer to the existence of Angels and Deamons. Nostory added that \u2018The Great War will begin anew, and a dreamer will be the precursor to the Chaos.\u2019 However, what role the Jak play in the hands of Nostory? Is there more to Jak than meets the eye?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Jasmine</b> is another main character. She is 18 years old. She is Jak's girlfriend. She is a little curious at times, and she's always been kind to others, but can be a little too excited at times. She is also the recarination of a goddess, so she has growth powers. About 5'3, has blue eyes, and has more of tanned skin color, and she has caucasian traits. She's your typical girly girl, going out with friends, and is very smart. She's a volunteer and is in most school clubs. She's a bit more thicker, and just a beauiful person.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJasmine is a cheerleader, as well, smart and is very protective of Jak. She feels that she has a duty to protect her boyfriend, powers or no powers. Being a Goddess, Jasmine\u2019s abilities go beyond just growth. She has a fast healing factor, and can make a few energy blasts. She also can shrink people, although it\u2019s not used for battle, she\u2019s used it to her advantage before. She\u2019s mainly a tough and gritty brawler, knowing the art of Brazilian Ju Jitsu. Jasmine also has a sixth sense when it comes to Jak, allowing her to sense when he's hurt, injured, or near danger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Nostory</b> is the Deamon who commands all of the Deamon Horde. His goal is to take over the real world, but Jak, Jasmine, and the others have stood in his way for a few years. Nostory will go to extremes to get what he wants. He is a very powerful foe, who can rival any power.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Seth</b> is Nostory's powerful Ally. He sided with Nostory years ago. And he hates Shadow very very much. He killed an old friend that made Seth want to kill Shadow. Her name was Lylthe. Seth is just as ruthless and cunning as Nostory is, and he's just as powerful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Yasmin</b> is the clone of Jasmine, so she has the same growth powers, and she has some dark powers as well, so she can be considered the \"false goddess\" who rivals Jasmine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeamons are beings of darkness, who all have traits of beast, like claws or talons. They are an older breed of regular demons<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Shadow</b>. Secondary character. He is a Deamon. He used to work for Nostory. He helped Jak and Jasmine to go against Nostory. Before Jak and Jasmine went back to the real world. He told them that they would meet again. Age is Unknown but seems to be in his mid 20's. Shadow is a very formidable opponent. He also has a little thing for Kate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Kate Berlin</b>. Another secondary character, she works for LOR, a rebel group who is determined to stop the Deamon race and put their plans to rest. She met up with Shadow, Jak, and Jamsine and joined them to stop Nostory. She isn't a part of the real world, but also would meet Jak and Jasmine they would meet again. Age is 23, she's very active, and has very good sword skills with her katana. She's also a little attracted to Shadow. Kate is also a human-angel hybrid, showing that she has exceptional agility and strength than the average human, being a able to keep up with Nostory in sword combat with her trusty Katana.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b><span class=\"noselect\" style=\"cursor:pointer;\" oncontextmenu=\"uport_ajax_rt_opts (event, this, 'videogmr', '', '', '', '10', '', 'OFF', '100810279'); hide_uport (); this.shown=1; return false;\" onclick=\"uport_ajax_opts (event, this, 'videogmr', '', '', '', '10', '', 'OFF'); hide_uport (); this.shown=1;\"><a title=\"Username: videogmr\r\nMember Since: August 4th, 2010\r\nClick for links!\" style=\"line-height: 1em;font-size:1em;cursor:pointer;\">Pen</a></span> <span class=\"noPrint\">(<a title=\"View videogmr's Community Recognition\" class=\"blue2roll\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"javascript:LaunchPop('https://www.Writing.Com/main/authors/action/overall/user_id/videogmr',%20'CommunityR_100810279',%20'400',%20'650')\">51</a>)</span> <a class=\"imgLink imgPortLink\" onmousedown=\"if(event.which == 3) { event.preventDefault(); var mywin = window.open('https://www.Writing.Com/main/portfolio/view/videogmr','_blank'); mywin.focus (); event.stopPropagation(); return false; }\" href=\"https://www.Writing.Com/main/portfolio/view/videogmr\" target=\"_top\" onmouseover=\"uport_ajax2 (event, this, 'videogmr', '&lt;span style=\\'color:#990000;font-weight:bold\\'&gt;Offline or Private&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt; Last On:  9/30/20', '9/30/20', 'August 4, 2010', '', '', '10', 'Registered Author');\" onmouseout=\"hide_uport ();\"><span style=\"padding:0px 2px 0px 0px;vertical-align:middle;\"><img src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/costumicons/ps-icon-regular-10.gif\" width=\"30\" height=\"15\" border=\"0\"></span></a><a rel=\"nofollow\" onmousedown=\"if(event.which == 3) { event.preventDefault(); LaunchPop('https://www.Writing.Com/main/em/action/new/toid/100810279',   'mess100810279_1603544833', '710', '540');  event.stopPropagation(); return false; }\" href=\"https://www.Writing.Com/main/em/action/new/toid/100810279/in/1\" target=\"_top\" title=\"Email User: videogmr [Offline / Private]\" class=\"imgLink imgPortLink noPrint\"><span style=\"vertical-align:middle;padding:0px 0px 0px 0px;\"><img src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/mail-off.gif\" width=\"22\" height=\"15\" border=\"0\"></span></a><span class=\"noPrint\"><span id=\"new_ffvideogmr\"><a class=\"imgLink\" style=\"cursor:pointer;\" onclick=\"doAjaxO('ffvideogmr', '', 'post', 'https://www.Writing.Com/main/my_favorites.php', 'action=fanfav&amp;fav=1&amp;user_id=100810279&amp;nopad=1&amp;new=1&amp;ajax=new_ffvideogmr');\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"Click to add videogmr to 'My Favorites'. \r\nClick again to become a 'Fan'. \"><span id=\"ffvideogmr\" style=\"padding:0px 3px 0px 3px;vertical-align:middle;\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/favplus.gif\" style=\"padding-right:1px;\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"></span></a></span></span>'s Characters</b></div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nZenn: 17 years old. He lost everything he ever had. His family is dead, all thanks to Jaxx. Everytime he gets close to someone they disappear or use him for their own selfish reasons. Due to this he doesn't connect with people, filling all of his time with training himself to fight Jaxx. Jaxx has sent him to other places seemingly training him for his own reasons. After spending time in a world with a master race of giants, he doesn't trust people that are big enough to kill him easily (or anyone else for that matter, but beyond regular people with the giants. He has long black hair and orange eyes, with average features otherwise. Skinny but he is a bunch of ropy muscle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUses 2 techniques mostly for fighting: Fireblades (swords formed from fire) and Flamerunning (forming foot-sized platforms of fire in the air, allowing to get high up without exerting a lot of energy<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaxx: Zenn's Enemy. Not sure how old he is, probably around 40. Seems to be training Zenn for something by sending him to different dimensions to fight and survive. Dresses in a full black cloak with a white mask with eye slits only. Uses the same techniques as Zenn, but the fire is also fueled by darkness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsp: A spirit of ice. For its own reasons, bent on freezing over many dimensions. In battle it takes three forms. One, a huge beast made of ice. Two, a huge humanoid form, also made of ice. Three, a human form that has many ice powers at it's disposal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRULES:<br>\r\n-No gay/lesbian stuff<br>\r\n-Joana's not evil.(Other characters can go free about their behavior to Blake or James)<br>\r\n-Feet are ok but take on count that Blake doesn't like them more than an average boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd, though Friendly Thinker, Luigi P and me will be adding, I invite the readers to try, there will be a lot of free choices, as in my other stories. You can be a better writer if you just try (I was myself a reader for a long time, afraid of adding but I decided to try and write by my own, because I'm not as good with characters I don't know)</td>",
