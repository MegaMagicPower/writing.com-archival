He rams his socked foot into the left shoe then turns his attention to you. His foot stretches you out painfully and as his foot settles and he ties your strings, his full weight crushes down on you. Just before he takes a step jake says \" you gonna be long i need them for some errands later\" while pointing at you. 2 more voices from the bedrooms shout out \"me too\"i need them\". You have a busy day ahead of you. \"Nahh jake, couple hours, gotta go...</span></div></div>",
