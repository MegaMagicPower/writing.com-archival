The wand demands it be used, very few people can hold it and not want to use it. Though the wand is not good or evil, it encourages the user's inner desires whether they desire curves, status, skills, or vengeance.<br>\r\n2. The wand will always leave the targets in the positions they were in. IE when swapping bodies, the bodies will move, not the person inhabiting it.<br>\r\n3. The wand can swap anything that can be defined as a trait, whether it be physical or mental. It can swap skin tones, body parts, articles of clothing, friends, and skills. The wand is capable of making multiple swaps at a time.<br>\r\n4. The wand will adjust clothing to fit the body it is swapped to, but only alters clothing when the clothing is the target of a swap.<br>\r\n5. The wand most often makes swaps so that only the holder will know, but because the wand knows the desires of the wielder of the wand intends to use it maliciously the wand will leave both the holder and the victim know of the swap, but the victim either not be able to say what happened to them, or people would not believe what they are saying. For Example, D.Va makes Mei upset, so Mei uses the wand to swap Roadhog's fat onto D.Va. Only D.Va and Mei know of the swap, Mei as the holder, and D.Va as the victim. As result of this swap D.Va's mech is adjusted for her new weight, D.Va knows that all of a sudden she is fat and can't admit it, Roadhog now has very little fat on his body so his huge, mech tossing muscles are exposed for the world to see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that we know what this wand can do! Let's see who get's this wand!</span></div></div>",

After successfully defending the objective she investigated the strange artifact. It was a wand, she figured it was in a pot that had been shattered during the mission\u2014Junkrat always had a way of breaking and scattering objects all over the place. The wand was rather simple, it looked like it was carved from a short branch, it's fat end fit well in her palm, for some reason just holding this object made her feel powerful. The wand had the faintest of etchings that she would have scanned for Winston to analyze. Mercy decided to pocket her find and try to keep it for herself until she found out why it seemed so powerful.<br>\r\nIt became difficult for Mercy to concentrate during the mission debriefing. \"This mission would not have been a success without Angela's healing, I know combat medics tend to be overlooked, but our Angela always does a superb job!\" Soldier said, regaining Mercy's attention. \"Now that we have thwarted Talon's attempt to bypass Helix's security, we must plan our next move. Dismissed.\" The team began to disperse. Mercy was among the first to get up and start to leave.<br>\r\n\"Angela?\" Pharah tried to get Mercy's attention \"You alright? You've been fidgeting a lot since we got back, it's worrying.\"<br>\r\n\"Oh, I had a good idea towards the beginning of the debriefing,\" Mercy lied, though she didn't know why. \"I want to get to my lab and start working on it right away.\" Mercy said, starting to rush past Pharah. Mercy continued rushing towards her lab, she was almost there, she made a turn into the final corridor of her journey only to bump into D.Va, sending both of them to the ground.<br>\r\n\"Are you alright Ange?\" D.Va asked, having recovered faster than Mercy. She was already on her feet and offering Mercy a hand.<br>\r\n\"Oh, yes my dear, but a better question is: are you okay?\" <br>\r\n\"Never better!\" D.Va responded with a bit of a bounce.<br>\r\n\"Oh, the joys of youth,\" Mercy began to reminisce, \"If only I were your age.\" She began to trail off, only to be brought back to current times by a warmth in her pocket, where she had stored the wand. She felt a wave of relief flow over her, she had began to shrink a little bit, her breasts firming up and shrinking a bit, her skin regained the little elasticity that had been lost to age, her muscles became more defined as they de-aged. She felt amazing, but what she was seeing invoked terror in her. She D.Va age rapidly she watched D.Va grow a few inches, her breasts became larger, then gained a little sag, some wrinkles appeared on her face, and her figure gained a little bit of pudge, as she almost doubled in age. Mercy swore she saw D.Va make painful faces during her transformation, but as quickly as the changes happened, her face took on a warm smile.<br>\r\n\"Well I'm glad we're both okay.\" D.Va said, her voice had taken on a more adult tone, \"I'll be on my way, I'm sure you've something great to work on, honey.\" She continued, before turning around and continuing on her way. As D.Va walked away she noticed that D.Va's suit  was pulled really tight against her body, straining to hold the curves she had just gained\u2014not all of which were good curves\u2014and the legs of her suit were tight on her calves, Mercy couldn't let her walk away, could she? Mercy didn't know what to do...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Mercy credited D.Va\u2019s slender form to a high metabolism and good genes, but it appeared it wouldn\u2019t help much as she\u2019d get older. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMercy felt the wand warm up in her pocket followed by regaining a few of her inches and a cup-size from D.Va, and vice versa. The gamer hadn\u2019t seemed to notice the change, so the wand could possibly have the power to alter others\u2019 perception of reality.

He had bombs around his neck, hopefully fake, and his peg leg had menacing lighting at the knee. For once, Roadhog was the one hogging (heh\u2026) the attention. He was wearing a shark on top of his mask, it adorning a pirate style bandana. He was bare-chested, proudly showing of his jolly roger tattoo and nipple piercings. Dark- and light blue striped pants finished the look. <br>\r\nThe last two in the room was Reinhardt and the blonde Zarya, arm wrestling, neither of them giving an inch.

Looking down towards the floor, Mercy\u2019s previously slim stomach had been inflated to impossible proportions. Her turtleneck had seemingly adjusted to her increased girth, as well as her skintight jeans. She had been quite proud of her ass, filling out her pants quite well, but she had nothing on Roadhog. Not because of curves, but rather his massive volume. The investigation of her new body was interrupted by Reinhardt, or rather the new inhabitant of his body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHej, Angela. [Hello, Angela.]\u201d Through all the years Mercy had known Reinhardt, she could count on one hand the amount of times she\u2019d heard him speak in a normal volume. If she didn\u2019t know better, she\u2019d think it was her old German friend sitting in a comfy chair knitting a sweater. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho do you think will win?\u201d Brigitte looked at Mercy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho?\u201d The doctor was still a bit dizzy from the swap. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know, Junkrat or Roadhog.\u201d She pointed over at the ping pong table and Mercy did a double take as she looked at the changed junkers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoadhog was now the proud owner of Brigitte\u2019s body, while Junkrat had the body of a Russian athlete capable of lifting half a metric ton. But despite having the body of the strongest woman alive, his technique was still miserable, so Roadhog had no trouble keeping up. What caught Mercy\u2019s attention, however, was that like her and Brigitte, they also wore the same clothes as before the swap. In short, Brigitte was watching her own bare-chested body with nipple piercings seemingly playing against a still blonde Zarya with an open shirt, breasts jiggling like crazy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know, maybe Roadhog,\u201d Mercy said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlancing over at the other end of the lounge, she could see her own body arm wrestling with Junkrat. Being a healer, she\u2019d been focusing more on being a support than working muscle.

She didn\u2019t care who, she was going to swap with the first person she saw. As she walked down the corridor, she could hear sounds of buttons being pressed, accompanied by near-silent chuckle. Passing an open door, she discovered Sombra trying to hack into the system. The wand did its work, and as Mercy closed her eyes for a moment, she heard Roadhog\u2019s voice say, \u201cAlways leave yourself a back door,\u201d in a Mexican accent. The next moment, the now obese spy from Talon had made her escape with her translocator. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, at least I\u2019m not fat anymore,\u201d Mercy said with a sigh. Instead she was 3\u201d shorter and 7 years younger than her original body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had stolen Zarya's hair, then lost her and Brigitte's body to the junkers, who had disappeared to God knows where. Her own body was gone, and Brigitte was stuck in Junkrat's. The chances of encountering Sombra in Roadhog\u2019s body were close to none, and Mercy\u2019s current ethnicity was hispanic. This should\u2019ve caused her some panic and stress, but she was running out of fucks to give. As long as nobody got hurt, well, nobody she knew, things should work out fine. After all, she was the only one aware of the changes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething she'd noticed with the last few swaps, was that they started to turn her on. She hoped she hadn\u2019t had a boner as Roadhog, but at least Brigitte hadn\u2019t mentioned it even if she noticed. It was easier hiding arousal with a female body, either that or wearing baggy pants. As she was nearing the kitchen, wandering about without any plan other than performing more swapping, she could hear someone approaching rapidly behind her.</span></div></div>",

She saw Lena shrink a little in her seat as she lost some of her \"cushion\" while Junkrat's ribs became just a little more buried than they were before.<br>\r\nMercy made notes on this, she swapped them back and decided to make a more dramatic swap. She pointed the swapped Roadhog and Junkrat's weight, originally she thought it'd funny to swap Roadhog and Lena's weight, but decided that it if their clothes didn't adjust it would be better for Junkrat to be the target.<br>\r\nRoadhog rapidly shed his weight becoming a very gaunt skeletal figure, this scared the practiced physician as there is no way that Roadhog was in a healthy state, not that he was before, but it was miraculous that he could even maintain a sitting position. He looked like a Halloween skeleton with an airbrushed on skin, Mercy barely noticed that his clothes remained in tact and fit him perfectly. Junkrat had become a meatball, as his weight gained his prosthetic leg slipped off the table's edge as he proclaimed his genius, this roused Roadhog's deep chortle, and silenced the cafeteria as everyone gawked at the scene. Junkrat was quickly back up and opted to ignore his recent encounter with the floor. Angela saw that even with his extra couple hundred pounds he seemed to maintain the same attitude and stamina, as well as his clothes.<br>\r\nThe two junkers were returned to their original weights before anything more could happen. More notes were jotted down, and the next swap was decided upon. Mercy wanted to try to swap a more general trait, she targeted Junkrat and Tracer again. Angela saw Junkrat shrink an inch or two, his skin soften and watched as breasts formed under his harness that he wore his suicide grenades on. His harness seemed to changed a little too, it covered his chest much more, though she supposed that could have been on account of Junkrat's smaller stature. <br>\r\nAngela had also watched Lena increase in height, her shoulders broadening, she watched Lena's hourglass waist flatten into a masculine V shape, she witnessed a grand feminine butt become an equivalent masculine butt, it awakened feelings within Angela, she considered attempting to make a move on the now young man, but she still had questions to answer and pried her eyes from the tempting flesh displayed in a similar yellow material, though it seemed thicker than the spandex it was before, looking up she noticed that Lena's aviater jacket no longer had the same cut, it's bottom hem was not straight, it had a white fleece now trimmed the bottom, and her collar was no longer popped, it laid flat, also with the same trimming the bottom had had. Lena's Chrono-accelerator harness had faded through the jacket as Male Lena wore it under his jacket. Angela noted how Junkrat's style hadn't changed while Lena's had rather significantly. <br>\r\nMercy now examined Lena as he sat next to Emily, they now sat further apart, they didn't look at each other the same way as they had before, well, Lena looked at her with longing, but Emily was not receptive. The wand activated, Angela was shocked by the wand's activation but quickly saw that Emily and Lena were now sat closer and shared a longing gaze. The wand had swapped Emily's sexuality, Angela had been considering doing this, but hadn't made the wish. Mercy frantically looked around, trying to figure out who's sexuality Emily had received.</span></div></div>",

Pharah sat next to soldier, eating and chatting, though the conversation tended to one side. Her mother Ana did much the same.

Alarmed that Junkrat would get away with Leena\u2019s gender, she gave the wand a small flick and the australian suddenly lost his hourglass waist. At the same time Leena shrunk by a few inches in her seat and her proportions settled back to feminine curves. Angela hardly saw the two junkers leave as she slowly inspected Tracer to ensure everything was exactly where it was supposed to be. After an internal debate she decided that her teammate had most certainly lost some definition in her generous rear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMercy\u2019s careful inspection was cut short as she noticed Pharah walk into the cafeteria, the two locked eyes for a moment before Angela shifted her gaze away with a blush. She had never admitted it to Pharah personally, but Mercy had the slightest of girl crushes on her. <i>Maybe that was a bit of an understatement</i> she thought, as her gaze followed Pharah\u2019s rear to the cafeteria\u2019s counter. Pharah spent nearly every hour she had off in the rec center and it showed. Her defined curves filled out the spandex of her leggings well, which naturally drew the eyes upwards. Leena wasn\u2019t the only girl in Overwatch who was <i>packing</i>, if anyone could challenge her for Best Bottom it would be Pharah.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Angela\u2019s thoughts strayed to the more intimate, the swap wand in her pocket activated. With a startled look she quickly scanned the room. Tracer and Emily sat a little farther away from each other but maybe that was just her panicked mind. Ashe and Brigitte were still conversing as normal and so were Mei, Soldier and Symmetra in the corner. Pharah was finished picking out her breakfast and was walking away from the main counter, nothing looked out of place on her, in fact her sports bra and exposed midriff looked very\u2026 right. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMercy had little time to think before\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Mercy smiled warmly as Pharah approached her table, trying her best not to stare at the woman\u2019s chest. \u201cAngela, feeling better today?\u201d asked Pharah as she sat down. \u201cYou were worrying me at the debriefing yesterday\u2026\u201d Mercy was reminded of the day before; she\u2019d been up for at least a full day now. During the debrief Fareeha had been concerned for Mercy. She must have noticed her excitement for the wand and mistook it for nerves. \u201cOh yes I\u2019m feeling much better, I was just tired is all\u201d. The wand should be kept secret for now thought Mercy, at least until she could fully understand its power. \u201cAnd you didn\u2019t spend the night in your lab? You look like you haven\u2019t slept a wink\u201d. At this Pharah placed her hand reassuringly over Mercy\u2019s own. Angela intended to look Fareeha in the eye to convince her otherwise, but the egyptian\u2019s gaze stole her breath away. Even though Pharah had just done up the basics before her workout she looked as beautiful as ever. The sun coming from the nearby windows streamed through her coal black hair. Golden beads twinkling as she tilted her head in concern; they helped draw an inquisitive eye past her neckline and to her--<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAngela?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, I- Fareeha I\u2019m fine, I\u2019ll take a nap after breakfast and be right as rain\u2026\u201d If Mercy was being completely honest with herself, she\u2019d need more than just a nap. Pharah spoke again but Angela didn\u2019t quite hear. She had once again started fantasizing; silently admiring her teammates\u2026 assets. Maybe if she was a bit bigger\u2026 Mercy\u2019s steamy thoughts were cut short by a warmth in her pocket. She hadn\u2019t even been touching the wand this time, great gods what did it do this time?? It didn\u2019t take long for her to find out exactly what the wand had done; as Fareeha\u2019s sports bra shifted and expanded, in order to accommodate her rapidly growing breasts. Angela watched intently as her crushes\u2019 boobs grew enough to sag downwards despite her sports bras support. Frustratingly the cut of her undergarment slowly morphed to hide the most of Pharah\u2019s expansive cleavage. The growth stopped short of grapefruit size- Mercy was sure of it; she\u2019d seen Mei walking out of the shower enough\u2026 times\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell Angela?\u201d Mercy\u2019s train of thought was once again stopped short, this was starting to become a theme. \u201cSorry what?\u201d she replied. \u201cI said you should take that nap soon; Reinhardt mentioned another mission tonight at the debrief\u201d. The doctor sighed; she should really get out of here before she accidently swapped something again; sleep deprivation must make the impulse harder to control. Mercy interrupted her pause by replying, \u201cYou\u2019re right Fareeha I\u2019ll go right now in that case\u201d. Mercy took the opportunity to scan the room as she rose from her seat, her fears instantly confirmed. Mei was getting up to leave too but the change was obvious, her outfit now clung even tighter to her chest. It appeared that in this reality she was at least 2 cup sizes smaller. Mercy considered swapping Pharah back, she even reached for the wand\u2026 Yet as her teammate rose from her seat, the resulting tectonic shift of her breasts stopped her. She\u2019d get to putting everyone back to normal after her rest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPharah interrupted her train of thought again as they put their dishes away; \u201cGood, I\u2019ll tag along, I need to get a few more reps in the rec room anyway\u201d. \u201cOh, you don\u2019t have to Fareeha plea- \u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPharah moved in close to Mercy, placing a hand on her shoulder. The Egyptian was so close Angela could smell the spicy odor blocker Pharah liked, she even picked up the after notes of a good workout. Mercy inhaled slowly before looking upwards into her teammate\u2019s eyes. \u201cAngela, I insist, I worry about you sometimes; always stuck in your lab. When was the last time you had dinner with everyone?\u201d. \u201cI- sometimes I get carried away with a new discovery\u2026 and you know how busy a doctor\u2019s schedule is\u201d. Pharah pulled away slowly, and the pair began moving towards the exit; \u201cDon\u2019t you think you should care for your own health first and foremost?\u201d she questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMercy was deep in thought as she led the way to the dormitory; failing to notice just how far Emily and Leena were sitting apart from one another. Their conversation stopped short, instead the pair sat staring at their phones.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Before the two reached Angela\u2019s room the doctor halted, bracing herself against the wall. \u201cAngela, what\u2019s the matter?\u201d Pharah moved in close to her friend, placing a hand on her shoulder. \u201cI\u2019m fine Fareeha, it\u2019s just a dizzy spell; I must be more tired than I thought\u201d. Pharah reflected inwardly as the pair continued onwards. She hated seeing her friend like this; It seemed the years were beginning to take their toll. Pharah herself had begun to feel the effects; and although she wasn\u2019t sure, Mercy was certainly several years older. Of course, that didn\u2019t stop the older woman from acting as though she was still in the cadets. Always putting herself at risk before others, never a care for her own health. Pharah was much the same, and this similarity helped forge a strong bond between the two. Though she had never admitted it to anyone, Pharah hoped that that bond might grow into something more someday.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was slow going, but the pair finally reached Mercy\u2019s room. Before she was even through the door, Angela let her lab coat slide to the ground. Pharah followed her friend in, stopping to place the garment on a nearby hook. \u201cI\u2019ll make sure that no one disturbs you Angela, have a good rest\u201d. Mercy fell face first onto her mattress, replying with a muffled thank you. As Pharah turned to leave she noticed something strange, a small stick was laying where Mercy had dropped her coat. Intending to place it back where it belonged, she picked it up and immediately felt something within her. A swelling crescendo of strength and vitality filled her chest and spread throughout her body. Pharah had never seen anything like it in Mercy\u2019s lab before. Upon closer inspection it reminded her of a wand; carved out of wood, it started at a fat base and tapered to a blunt point. Pharah was torn, she had never invaded Angela\u2019s privacy before, but this wand felt too important to just ignore. Was this why Angela hadn\u2019t slept last night?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoes Pharah leave the wand where it belongs? Or try to understand its nature more\u2026</span></div></div>",

It certainly didn't look like anything she had ever seen in Angela's lab. If anything, it appeared to be pulled straight from a children's story book. That said, it was not unlike Angela to have a flair for the fantastical. The woman flew around with angel wings strapped to her back out on the battlefield.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah...\" Pharah murmured to herself, finally feeling that she understood. The energy she felt upon picking the item up said it all. This was surely one of Angela's new experiments, meant to give someone a little pick-me-up. Perhaps even an upgrade to her usual healing staff. \"Well in that case,\" she said, pausing to give Mercy a short look, \"I suppose holding onto it would help Angela get better results.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll doubt erased from her mind, she pocketed the item and continued down the hall to the rec room. While certainly not buzzing with activity, it hadn't fully emptied out just yet. Off in one corner she saw Reinhardt hoisting up a gigantic barbell as Brigette stood off to the side, counting off. Every now and then she took a bite out of the sandwich she had taken with her from the cafeteria.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPharah decided to settle in at one of the machines next to Zarya, and set it for a weight just above her usual. There was no point trying to compete with <i>the</i> weightlifter herself, but she didn't want to come off as too puny. It wasn't long until she was breaking a sweat yet again, having already stopped by the room once today. Stopping to take a breath, she stole a glance at Zarya's settings, noting that they were easily twice what she was doing, and the pink haired woman wasn't even breaking a sweat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPharah could only shake her head in amusement, reaching over to give Zarya a friendly slap on the shoulder. \"I wish I were you sometimes, Zarya, or that I could lift so much.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZarya gave her a wry grin, punching Pharah's shoulder in return. \"Give it some time and dedication, and maybe you'll get...\" She jokingly 'thought' for a moment, \"Halfway to my record.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pair of them laughed as Pharah felt a warmth in her pocket. Looking down, she spied the wand glimmering, and looked up just in time to see it working its magic. Suddenly Pharah...</span></div></div>",

At the same time, Pharah experienced the opposite, muscle mass flowing from nowhere into her body. The Egyptian\u2019s perspective shifted as she gained half a foot in height, in seconds Pharah now had to look down at her teammate as they seamlessly switched physiques.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2026\u201d Pharah was in disbelief as Zarya turned back to her bench as though nothing was amiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, did I misspeak?\u201d Asked the Russian. \u201cEnglish confuses me, I meant to say that I am jealous of you, only kidding of course.\u201d She laughed at that, before resuming her workout. Only now the weight she had on was twice as much as she could ever hope to lift. Mumbling in Russian, Zarya removed some weight to a lower amount. All the while Pharah silently stared, mouth agape at what had just occurred. Her comrade had just lost fifty pounds of pure muscle and didn\u2019t care, or for that matter even notice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost subconsciously Pharah went back to her reps, her mind a haze of questions and few answers. Of course, now her workout was laughably easy; she marveled at how she could effortlessly workout with 400lbs of weight on. Within 5 minutes of this, she hadn\u2019t even broken a sweat, while her now much smaller companion was grunting with exertion. Pharah soon found herself idly admiring Zarya, while trying her best not to be too obvious. Zarya had seemingly chosen to wear as little as possible for her work out; in fact, her attire also seemed to have been transformed to fit her new mass. Her form-fitting top would have looked ridiculous on her had it not shrunk to fit her less massive frame. Indeed, Zarya\u2019s Adidas leggings had also shrunk; although to Pharah\u2019s eye, they were even tighter than before. A blush tinted Pharah\u2019s cheeks as she continued to inspect her friend. It was hard to tell at first but when Zarya moved to get more comfortable; the positively massive camel toe she was sporting became more than obvious. A flirty joke suddenly crossed Pharah\u2019s mind, <i>I\u2019d love to lift <b>her</b> instead of this bar</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith growing horror, she registered a searing heat in her pocket; tearing her gaze away, she began to see the artifact glowing through the fabric of her pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell Pharah, what are you waiting for?\u201d Asked Zarya, only now her voice came from directly behind. Startled, Pharah whipped back around to see that now in place of her weight bar was indeed Zarya, lying across an enlarged holder. Where the Russian had last been was the old bar, sitting on the bench forgotten. Does Pharah\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

In an increasingly manic manner, she couldn't stop looking between the two, trying to process just what exactly the wand had done. Was Zarya a weight lifting bar now? A human bar? She peered at the machine where the bar now 'sat', noticing that it still had settings for weight registered on it. Was the bar...Lifting weights?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pharah?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZarya's voice brought her out of her stupor. Looking back up at Zarya again, something finally clicked in Pharah's brain. Or broke. She let out a blood curdling scream, as she suddenly realized the situation her desires had set up, stumbling forward away from the bench. She went much faster than expected, hurled forward by her stolen girth. Pharah managed to stop herself just a few inches from the wall, which she could only assume would have been dented inward if she had actually made contact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom her position above the bench, Zarya bent upward, mouth agape. \"Are you...Are you okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPharah shook her head, looking once more at the bar. An idea formed, one that might fix this. \"I was. I was just thinking.\" Her shaking finger pointed at the bar, \"I was thinking how much I'd love to lift that bar.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe felt her thigh set ablaze once more as the wand did...Whatever it did. She looked down just in time to be blinded by a light. Upon looking up again, Zarya was still staring at her, except this time she was sitting at her machine as she had been before. There was no small amount of confusion as she spoke, glancing about to see if anyone else was as dumbfounded as her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then...Then lift the bar, da?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPharah looked at the bench, letting out a relieved sigh as she found everything truly back in its place. Shakily standing up, she peered around the rec room, noticing that Reinhardt and Brigette both had stopped to stare at all of the commotion. Reinhardt had a giant barbell in each hand, one paused mid-rep as he watched Zarya and Pharah. Brigette mirrored him, except instead of a barbell, she was holding her sandwich halfway to her mouth, which stood agape waiting for a bite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure you're alright,\" Zarya asked again, looking rather concerned by this point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPharah opted to...</span></div></div>",

She rushed down the corridor and into her lab to find Sombra had began to hack her computer, luckily Sombra hadn't noticed her yet. Mercy pressed a button next to her door, it'd send for help, then she took matters into her own hands. She reached to her side and pulled out her weapon, though this time she only found her wand\u2014she had let her guard down, and stored her weapons with her Valkyrie suit. She wasn't sure what to swap, the wand sensing her desire to stop this took action, swapping Sombra's knowledge of hacking with Mercy. Sombra staggered for a second as she lost a lot of knowledge, only for it to be replaced with very little in return. Mercy was faster to recover, and briefly understood what was on the screen before it flickered returning to the log in page, a password seemingly half typed in. \"What are you doing?\" Mercy demanded, closing the distance between her and Sombra.<br>\r\n\"Huh!\" Sombra exclaimed reeling back from the screen and looking at the approaching Mercy. <br>\r\n\"Angela, what's wrong?!\" A gruff voice asked as he ran into the room. It didn't take more than a second before Soldier had his sights trained on the mocha skinned woman and demanded \"Drop your weapon!\" Mercy had stepped aside as she'd heard Jack enter, and Sombra had complied with his demand immediately, letting her gun drop to the floor. <br>\r\n\"Awe, suppose I was a little late.\" A new voice, smooth and masculine came from the door way. McCree continued in and asked that Sombra place her hands behind her back. He already had some handcuffs ready. \"We've got some questions for ya, 'fore we can let you go to the proper authorities.\"<br>\r\nAll of this happened so fast, Mercy barely had time to respond.

First she accidentally swapped ages with D.Va, it felt amazing being so young again, though she felt she'd have to give D.Va's age back next time she saw her. Then she found Sombra and stole her knowledge of hacking, she was glad knowledge and lack of knowledge were an acceptable swap. Mercy suddenly became alarmed, she'd have to check her computer, just to make sure it wasn't compromised.<br>\r\nAt her computer she found that it was on her log in page, her desk was shuffle through, as if someone was looking for something\u2014probably something with my password on it\u2014the password entry field had a few black dots it, Sombra really had been just trying to guess my password. At least in this current reality, she'd seen that before reality had properly shifted Sombra was uploading data to Talon.<br>\r\n\"So, Sombra, what were you up to before I interrupted you?\" Angela asked inquisitively as she swiveled towards the woman bound to the table. Sombra just looked at her, clearly not willing to tell. \"Oh, well if you don't want to talk to me I'm sure one of the boys will get you to open up.\" Angela said with a shrug. Mercy walked to Sombra's side and started looking at the implants on Sombra's nearest arm, \"Wanna tell me what these implants are for?\" Mercy asked, \"I'm sure they're not just for show.\"<br>\r\n\"And what if they were?\" Sombra replied cockily. <br>\r\nMercy shook her head disapprovingly, \"Guess I'll have to do this the hard way.\" She pulled out a scanner, she was able to see how the implants connected, they connected to her spine. They don't seem to serve a tangible purpose she thought, perhaps they're somehow sensory...<br>\r\n\"They're custom built, you'll never be able to guess what they do.\" Sombra taunted smugly. Angela replied by pressing a few buttons under the table, and Sombra's bindings became uncomfortably tight. <br>\r\nAngela returned to her thoughts, I know they interacted with computers before, but I'm certain that's changed, unless she has indeed become a walking flash drive. Then a new idea hit her, the wand. She could just swap some knowledge again, or just test the wand, after all Sombra in no longer as great a threat to Overwatch without her ability to hack.</span></div></div>",

She points the wand at Sombra and thinks of knowing the purpose of Sombra's implants, as well as how to use them. Angela could see Sombra flinch, her head rolled upwards as new thoughts flooded her mind, she was now unsure of her implants and their purpose, conversely Angela was filled with knowledge of them, she now knew that the implants on her head and arms were for Sombra's cloak and a custom interface for hacking, but reality settled and it became clear that they now were just for show. All the glowing bits were meant to seem intimidating, people would assume she could integrate with computers like a tech wizard, but they're just lights the spinal implant powered them, the only other piece of tech was a microphone so Talon could listen to Sombra's captors if she were caught.<br>\r\nAngela felt bad for how the new reality has diminished Sombra to nothing more than walking microphone and a gun. Angela weighed her actions, was it better to strip a terrorist of her core skills, or to leave her to a life behind bars\u2014though Talon members tend to escape them from time to time. She briefly considered swapping Sombra's allegiances, but that would just make a new villain if she were to swap another Overwatch member, or another armed microphone for Talon.<br>\r\n\"You giving up already?\" Sombra interrupted Angela's thought, she didn't sound so cocky anymore, though she was trying to.<br>\r\n\"Nope!\" Mercy replied chipperly, seeing through Sombra's facade. Angela grabbed her laptop and walked over to the operating table, she was going to put some of her acquired skills to the test. She reached under Sombra and grabbed at the top of the spinal implant.<br>\r\n\"No, what are you doing!?\" Sombra shouted, struggling to escape the doctor's grasp. \"You don't know what that will do to you if you mess with it!\" Sombra tried to recover face, she wasn't scared, that was a threat\u2014obviously.<br>\r\n\"Hush.\" Mercy said dismissively, grabbing the tip of the implant and pulling it loose, revealing a USB cable. \"Figured it would be harder to access, toys are more protected that this.\" Mercy mumbled under her breath. She paused, why would she know that? Then it came to her, the wand rewrote her past too, she grew up taking electronics apart for fun, eventually she began repurposing stuff, but it wasn't until Genji got hacked that she really became the hacker extraordinaire she now is, after the hack she devoted herself to learning how to hack to maintain proper care on her patients.<br>\r\nBefore her recollections had ended she had finished deactivating the microphone in Sombra's implants, her bed side manners kicked in and opted to keep the lights on so Sombra wouldn't become too spooked. <br>\r\n\"Done.\" Mercy said, putting the USB back in place. \"Now it's just you and me,\" Mercy said with a smile on her face, \"You can drop the act, you didn't know what your implants were capable of did you.\" Mercy asked, playing into the new reality. Sombra looked away, as if doing so would excuse herself from the doctor's questions. <br>\r\nAngela a little high from the excitement of using her newly acquired skill wanted to use the wand more, she...</span></div></div>",

Angela moved to the side of the examination table, and gingerly fixed Sombra's hair, it'd become disheveled in her struggles against the doctor. \"I don't like seeing people get hurt, especially if it's avoidable, you, Ms. Sombra have a chance out. If you cooperate, and are willing to abandon Tallon, I may be able to tell the rest that this little implant of yours was mind controlling you.\" Sombra looked into Mercy's eyes, she saw no malice behind them. Sombra began to consider the offer. \"You wouldn't be the first member to have been brainwashed, your Widowmaker was once a dear friend...\" Angela said allowing sorrow to show on her face, not that she wasn't upset by it, but she was well beyond sorrow. \"Was there a reason you joined Tallon?\" Angela asked, making it sound as if she fought back her emotions.<br>\r\n\"I thought they would help me, teach me to become something great...\" Sombra trailed off, her emotions coming out, she was no longer the cold hearted hacker who made herself great with sneaky tactics, but an echo. A girl who thought she could be just that, but in the end was tricked. Sombra was on the verge of crying.<br>\r\n\"There, there,\" Angela began, reaching a hand towards Sombra's restrained hand.<br>\r\n\"Could you release me?\" Sombra interjected. Alarms went off in Angela's head, Angela may not have put the pieces back together just right, Sombra was no longer a hacker, but could she still had those sneaky tactics? It's possible the sneaky tactics came about because of her hacking skills, but if it were the other way around this could be dangerous. Angela put her hand on the girl's, holding her hand as she weighed her options.</span></div></div>",

Angela immediately jumped to action, approaching her head and shoving the wand back into her pocket, she made a show of reaching her empty hand towards Sombra as she pocketed the wand\u2014her sneaky tactics are already shining through, and working in conjunction with her empathy. \"Are you alright?!\" Angela asked urgently.<br>\r\n\"Si, uhh, yea.\" Sombra responded, she had defaulted to her native tongue for a sec. \"The mind control has really messed me up.\" She continued. Angela finally caught up with reality, this was no longer about cutting deals, she's looking at a girl who was brain washed and used by Tallon, the device in this reality was indeed a mind control device, Sombra was artificially sneaky thanks to the device, her whole attitude changed when the device was deactivated. Angela knew of the super hacker, but could only see a scared, confused child.<br>\r\nAngela removed the restraints, and held the girl, \"Its alright now, they can't hurt you any more.\" Mercy said quietly into the girl's ear as she did so Sombra began crying into Mercy's shoulder. Angela rubbed Sombra's back as she thought about her actions, she safely eliminated a threat, no blood, no anger, no fear of backstabbing, just an echo of a former self, freed from that former self's wrong doings. Angela was proud of this, but on the fence about the morality of her actions. The temptation of messing with Sombra's traits was tempting though, as was the temptation of studying the wands effects on reality, her scientific mind knew that studying reality would likely be a fruitless effort though.<br>\r\nAfter calming Sombra down she tells her what she's going to do, and calls in Jack, Angela explains to Jack the mind controlling and recommends that she be given a room and receive frequent therapy. Jack begrudgingly complies, only because brain washing is something he's seen on the field, but does make it clear that Sombra will be closely monitored for a while, which Sombra is understanding of.<br>\r\nJack goes to have the room prepared while Angela does a routine check up on Sombra.

Jack opened the door and walked in, he looked around briefly before focusing on the girls.<br>\r\n\"You settled in then?\" Jack replied looking at Olivia.<br>\r\n\"Yes.\" Olivia said.<br>\r\n\"Good, now while we have reason to believe that you were indeed brainwashed, we will be careful about letting you stay. Your online interactions will be monitored as well as any calls you make, also, this door will be locked from 2200 to 0800.\" The old Soldier motioned towards the door. \"You will remain in this room for those hours until further notice.\" Jack finished.<br>\r\n\"Got it,\" Olivia said. Jack turned towards the door, \"Thank you,\" Olivia almost shouted at the soldier's back. \"Thank you for letting me stay.\" Olivia added as Jack turned back around.<br>\r\n\"Don't thank me, if I had my way you'd be restrained, imprisoned, and most importantly still brainwashed. Angela did all the work, she's to thank.\" He turned around and left, \"Night.\" He said before vanishing behind a closed door.<br>\r\n\"Thank you.\" Olivia replied quietly, hugging the girl next to her. \"I have my life back. Even if I live in this room for the rest of my life I'm grateful, I'm me again.\" She was again on the verge of tears, Angela rubbed her back, soothing the older woman.<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry you had to deal with all you did,\" Angela whispered, \"I recommend you take some time and think about what you want to do with your life. Now I have to go deal with some stuff around the base, so if you're ready I'll take my leave.\"<br>\r\nOlivia gave one final squeeze before releasing the smaller girl, \"I'm alright, see you tomorrow.\"<br>\r\n\"Night.\" Mercy said leaving the room.

As soon as the blue faded the cunning sniper did two things simultaneously she opened fire spraying bullets into the space Tracer had recently claimed and shot a gas mine to the spot Tracer previously stood.<br>\r\n\"You got me good!\" Tracer said between coughs and closed eyes as the gas faded. Lena had figured she'd be gone when she opened her eyes and chased after the shadow she briefly saw disappear in an alley. Lena knew the plan and pressed a button a certain gorilla had told her to when the time had come. <br>\r\n\"I'm on my way!\" A lovely voice projected from a speaker in her accelerator.<br>\r\n\"Thanks, love.\" Tracer said as she ran. As she approached the alley Widow launched from below shooting at her position, just as planned Lena blinked towards the sniper as a gorilla grabbed the sniper by the arms. The impact from the gorilla changed her trajectory and loosened a piece of wood that must have been caught in her belt.<br>\r\n\"Unhand me you monkey!\" The sniper said as she landed with the \"monkey\"<br>\r\n\"I don't think so...\" Lena stopped paying attention, clearly Winston had her handled for the moment. Lena retrieved the sniper's gun that had landed on the edge of the roof. Lena noticed a shattered box in the alley below. <br>\r\n\"Winston, we might want to have Mercy take a look at her ankle before leaving her to rot.\"<br>\r\n\"Understood.\" Came the deep voice. A jet swooped in on the opposite side of building. \"You ready to go Lena?\"<br>\r\n\"Just a sec Winst!\" Lena turned around, sniper's gun in hand. As she jogged towards the jet the wood Widow had dropped caught her eye and impulsively she picked it up. As soon as she'd grasped it she'd paused as the wand touched her mind filling it with information about itself. \"I wonder if Widow knows about you...\" Lena silently said to the Swap Wand as she pocketed the stick and continued to the jet.<br>\r\nAs Lena stepped into the jet she was greeted. \"Good job Oxton!\" It was Pharah, \"I'd feared we'd need cavalry for the cavalry.\" she jested.<br>\r\n\"You know full well Tracer can handle Widowmaker, she's practically studied her.\" Soldier called from the cockpit.<br>\r\nWidow was bound to a chair in the back of the jet, she was staring daggers at all around her. Winston had already reclined in a hammock hung in the corner of the room.<br>\r\n\"Thanks for the welcome guys.\" Lena replied to the room. \"I'm beat.\" She stated as she plopped into a seat and relaxed as if she may catch a quick nap. That was her plan at least, but a recent event brought up some tantalizing hypotheticals...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Much as she wanted to ponder any number of possibilities, there was one thing that asserted itself before she could do so. Her eyelids. They fell heavy as could be the moment she sat down, wand still tucked in her arms. She wasn't given much time to dream of anything, even if the return trip had taken a fair bit of time. As far as Tracer cared to tell, it was a few moments between her sitting down to rest up, and Pharah nudging her as she walked down the ship's ramp, helmet in  her hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin seconds Tracer had sprung to her feet, checked that she had both of her pistols, and also started making the departure trip. She picked up the pace a bit to catch up with Winston, who was escorting Widowmaker off the ship and to their holding location. As they walked, Tracer contemplated something witty to say if Amelie tried anything out of line, but wasn't given the option.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm curious, Amelie,\" Winston said, breaking the trio's silence. \"What exactly is it you were after, anyway?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWidowmaker let out a few choice words in French. Tracer didn't need a translator to know that know of them were friendly terms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLena chortled, and shook her head, \"And here I thought French were s'pposed to be the language of love, love?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother string of what she could only presume were vulgarities left Widowmaker's lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose it was too much to hope you might be open about it,\" Winston mused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA light bulb flickered on in Lena's head, and in an instant she had recalled her way back up the ramp. Winston stopped, still holding onto Widowmaker as he did, and turned to peer back into the ship.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lena?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTracer didn't hear him. She was too busy zipping around the ship in search of the item she had acquired from the museum earlier. Or rather, that Widowmaker had acquired from the museum, and that Tracer had acquired from her. All the while she silently snickered to herself, verbally patting herself on the back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Language of love, love. Oh that was a good 'un,\" she mused, finally picking up the wand from her seat. She gave it another look over, and pondered a bit more. \"I'll have to remember that 'un. Oooo. Maybe next time I can add a fake accent'r somethin'. Practice enough, bet I can sound jus' like 'er.\" Another laugh escaped her, \"Bet Emily might like that.\" Pocketing the wand before she could watch it glow, Tracer began the return to Winston, continuing her conversation with herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh look at me, ze evil snipor of Talon,\" she said, doing her best to mimic Widowmaker's voice and tone. She stopped in her tracks, peering around. She could have swore it sounded like Amelie was right there. \"What was...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stopped mid-sentence, bringing a hand to her throat. She certainly hadn't tried to do an impression there, but she had. In fact, she was a dead ringer for Widowmaker, right down to the accent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did...What...\" She looked around, before finally pulling the wand back out of her pocket. \"Did you do this?\" Feeling a bit panicked, she rushed back down the ramp, to Winston.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Winston, somezing has,\" she said, pausing to catch her breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There you are Lena! What's the matter?\" the scientist asked, Widowmaker still held in place with one hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTracer gave him a confused look. \"You can't tell? Don't I zound a bit different to you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWinston canted a brow, shaking his head. \"You sound the same as you always have Lena.\" Tracer peered down at the wand, and then at Widowmaker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wot'r you looking at ya git?\" the purple woman said crossly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Was there something you forgot on the ship?\" Winston asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTracer looked back down at her hands, clutching the wand tightly and tucking it away. \"Ah, no. Zere was nozing. It was nozing, I mean. I left one of my pistols behind, zat is all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWidowmaker turned to sneer, and make a crude remark, but before any words left her mouth, her eyes zeroed in on the wand. \"What in the world'd you d-...\" She was cut off by Winston pushing her forward, having accepted Tracer's excuse. As the pair walked, Amelie turned to glare daggers at Tracer, who replaced the wand in her pocket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stood on the ramp of the ship, considering what to do now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As Tracer's mind raced, her body seemed to operate on autopilot. Her legs moved down hallways she was well acquainted with, but her mind was miles away, trying to parse out just exactly what had happened. In her head she still heard herself as she had always known. With that, as many people had told her at least, overdone accent from London. It was all she had ever known, it was where she had grown up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet when she stopped to think about it, none of it truly came to her. When she tried to remember growing up, she remembered Paris. The beautiful colors of each season, the wonderful architecture and food and people. She didn't join the British air force, she had joined the French air force. She knew that that hadn't been the case before she had stepped back onto the transport, but the moment she had done something with the wand, everything had seemingly changed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally she stopped in the middle of a hallway, and double checked to make sure no one else was around. She had to confirm that she wasn't going made. Perhaps she might open her mouth and that usual cockney tone would come out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Testzing, testzing,\" she said to herself, hand held to her throat. Her stomach dropped as soon as Widowmaker's voice fell from her lips. Not because it sounded wrong, but because it sounded right. She knew it wasn't her voice, yet again, if she thought about it she could have spoke fluent French on the spot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe started down the hall again, not particularly thinking on her destination. It had to have been the wand. It glowed the moment she mentioned talking like Amelie, and then all of the sudden she spoke in Amelie's voice. The two had to have been connected. But that wasn't possible. Even Angela probably couldn't have come up with such a device, at least not one that could do so much in so little time. It was practically...Magic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore she could even realize, she had thrown open a door and stepped inside her little apartment at base, stopping in the entryway to try and steady her thoughts. She had to correct this, surely, but the thought of what the little wand was capable was almost intoxicating. Producing it from her pocket, she continued on into the apartment, setting it on a table near the entryway. Even out of her hand it was still on her mind, though not for much longer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother voice pulled her out of whatever plans she could make for using it. Off from the kitchen of the apartment she heard a short squeal, followed by a red head poking out from around a corner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was wondering when you were getting back, Lena. Just in time, I've got tea about to come off.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTracer stopped in her tracks, and stared for a moment. Emily didn't notice, pulling her head back around the corner. A moment later she emerged with a teapot and a pot holder, and set them both down on the counter. Two cups soon joined them, which were filled with tea, just as Tracer preferred.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething clicked in her brain as she rounded the counter to embrace Emily, whispering into her as if on impulse, \"My love, ze cavalry has returned.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily's face went as red as her hair as she snickered, hiding her bemusement behind her cup. \"How was the mission?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMind racing, Tracer sauntered around the counter, picking up her tea cup. Forget the wand. This <i>voice</i> was intoxicating. Memories flashed of her using its lower, more seductive tones to woo Emily on countless occasions, and she started playing the part on instinct. Locking eyes with Emily, she took a sip of her tea, before adding \"Oh, as per usual. I saved ze day vith a number of heroics, and captured ze villain.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nResting on the counter, Emily looked entranced as Tracer recounted the entire ordeal. Lena had to of course enhance a few sections of the story, and made sure to pepper spots with some wonderful French. When finally she finished, Lena took both of their tea cups to the sink to clink, wonder how she had ever lived without being able to have Emily so taken with her simply speaking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReturning from the kitchen ready for round 2, Lena skidded to a halt the moment she saw Emily having moved beyond the counter. There was a confused look on her face as she looked over the wand, muttering to herself, \"Where the heck'd this thing come from?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLena immediately retreated back to the kitchen, and began trying to plan out an explanation. From out in the living room she could hear Emily moving about, talking to herself, trying to suss out just where exactly the object had come from, a few other idle thoughts getting peppered along with them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally Tracer felt prepared to retrieve the item, and stepped out of the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe...</span></div></div>",

How to play the wand off as some knick-knack they had picked up on the mission. She retreated for a final time, just barely missing the flash of light as the wand triggered based on some random thought from Emily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReadjusting her glasses, Tracer took a deep breath. She was regretting not having taken her parka off at the door, not just because of how clunky and hot it felt, but how she had an inkling that it might have helped with 'negotiations'. As things stood though, she felt confidant enough. With Widowmaker's voice, she felt like she could have talked anything off of Emily, let alone that silly piece of wood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTracer zeroed in on Emily as fast as she could, trying to bring their budding conversation's focus to the wand right off the bat. \"Oh, love. Did you that up by the door?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily turned, wand still firmly in hand, at the sound of Lena calling to her. The smile on her face drooped down into a gobsmacked look of confusion soon after. Her head tilted this way and that, trying to find Tracer, only to settle in on what appeared to be...Mei.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, sorry,\" Emily began, trying to find her feet, \"I didn' hear you come in Mei. Did you knock?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was Lena's turn to look confused. She looked this way and that, trying to find any sign of Mei and her usual orange leggings, but turned up with nothing. Gloved hands knitting together, Tracer gave Emily a concerned look. \"Mei isn't here, love.\" Her eyes turned once again to the wand, trying to process if anything had changed. Far as she could tell, nothing had. But then again, neither had Widowmaker noticed when they had swapped voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTracer shot through her memories again. She had always grown up in France, amidst a family of Chinese immigrants. It had felt a bit odd at times, but she had always considered Paris her home. Lena could still very much remember that the France part was a result of the swap from Widowmaker, but everything else seemed perfectly normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily stood there, eyes shooting between the wand and Tracer, jaw agape. She held the wand up...</span></div></div>",

Tracer had never seen anything like it, to her it looked like a \u2018magic\u2019 wand a witch might use. \u201cWhere\u2019d you get that Emily? Ooh, are you going to cast a spell on me?\u201d she asked, while putting some of her French charm into her voice. Emily\u2019s blush encouraged Tracer to continue, she removed her thick gloves and stepped closer to her girlfriend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh this? I\u2026 found it\u2026 while you were gone today.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTracer giggled at Emily\u2019s flustered response, \u201cI\u2019m just kidding love, let me change into something more comfortable and I\u2019ll help you with dinner\u201d. Lena pulled away and started toward their shared quarters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh uh, no worries I\u2019m almost finished\u2026 just find something good for us to watch\u201d was Emily\u2019s reply, while Tracer playfully swayed her wide hips, giggling to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir bedroom was modestly appointed and quite small, space was a valuable commodity at the base. The bed was squeezed into the far corner, which allowed for just enough room to open the closet door to the side. Tracer\u2019s eyes swept over the array of cold weather gear inside, before breathing a sigh of relief as she removed her heavy parka. She spent a few moments wrangling its bulk onto a hanger, then sat down to remove her thick boots. After finally untying her laces she moved to her dresser, intending to find her preferred pair of pajama pants. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMidway through her search she was startled by a sound behind her. Ah, it was just her orange jumpsuit, it must have slipped from the hanger. With a sigh she returned to the open closet, brushing past her dainty running shoes. Having replaced the garment, she moved back to dig for those pajamas, \u2018the ones with the cute cats Emily loved\u2019 thought Tracer. After fishing them out she made sure to find a comfortable shirt, \u2018something that fits a little loose, just to mess with Emily\u2019. Settling with another cat theme she slipped on the outfit and made for the door. She stopped just before leaving, a thought nagging at the back of her mind. \u201cOh of course\u201d she murmured, returning to her bedside she bent to collect her metallic heels and greaves. She placed them in the closet below her iconic white armor, Emily always appreciated a neat bedroom. Tracer smiled, while adjusting her platinum blonde ponytail as she stepped into the hallway.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As Lena had made her way into their bedroom to relieve herself of 'her' parka, Emily had trailed behind, wand clutched firmly in her hands. Her eyes were as big as plates as she observed Tracer, looking completely like the local climatologist Mei-Ling Zhou. From head to toe, Tracer was Mei, in all but identity. From her glasses to her parka to her thick boots, Tracer was physically Mei. Emily's mind went wild with the possibilities. One idle thought with the wand had transformed Tracer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer second thought had removed any question she had about whether the wand was real or not. The moment she wondered what exactly it was Tracer had brought home, the wand had glistened brightly again, and in a moment she seemed to remember every moment Tracer had had with it. Bringing it off the ship, swapping Widowmaker's voice. And in turn, Tracer was clueless. She didn't know that Emily had done anything, and now she didn't even know that her French accent wasn't natural to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily had watched her remove the parka, before springing through a series of ideas. It was like watching a slideshow transition from that point. Where once Lena had looked like Mei, now she looked like Brigette, and was pulling out Brigette's cat pajamas to change into. Another thought turned her into Angela Ziegler, who she exited the room as, after adjusting her blonde hair like nothing was out of the norm. And yet her voice was still that borrowed French accent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is there anything in particular you wanted to eat tonight, love?\" Tracer asked as she passed by Emily, making for the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever you feel like making,\" Emily said, trying to reel herself back into the conversation for a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat a thought. She was in a relationship with Angela Ziegler in all but name. And personality, she supposed. She tapped her chin, following behind Lena. Watching from afar as she began working in the kitchen, Emily focused on her idea, and watched as the wand lit up again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Angela?\" she called out from their living room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn cue, 'Angela' looked up, \"Yes, love?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily ducked around the corner, amazed once more. \"Nothing! I found what I was looking for.\" With another thought, she undid the change. Lena was once again Lena, even if she had the body of a German bombshell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTapping the wand against her chin, she pondered all the things she could do with it. Walking down and into the bathroom, she peered at herself in the mirror. At the moment, she was as she always had been. Thanks to her memories, she knew that Tracer hadn't had the opportunity to try the wand out on her. Same red hair, same freckles, same as ever. But with a flick of the wand...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had to close her eyes. While she kept them shut, and imagined her idea, she tried to make herself believe that this wasn't real. That it was all a dream, or a fantasy, or a delusion. It took all her might to crack one eye open and confirm that it was real. The truth was right there in the mirror. What reflected back at her was no longer that freckled red-head, but instead a Korean eSports star. She stumbled backwards out of shock, eyes going wide when the reflection did the same. The wand clattered out of her hand and on to the floor as she rushed to the mirror, and began feeling her face, her now long brown hair, the tight body suit that she now wore. All of it was real.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow,\" she said, hand going straight to her throat when she heard D.va's voice emerge, having traded everything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA coy grin overtook her face, and she stepped back from the mirror, trying to mimic the poses she had seen D.va use before taking to the field. They all came naturally, as did the catchphrases that went with them. She didn't even realize that she had been talking to herself for a few minutes, until she took notice that the bathroom door was open. She stumbled away from it, noticing that Lena had been observing for some time, a bemused look on her face that Emily could never have imagined Angela making.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you streaming tonight, love?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if on cue, Emily responded. \"Thinking about it, yeah. Can't keep my fans waiting for too long.\" Just the fact that she knew exactly what all of this meant now astounded her. Without hesitation she felt like she could have named off every piece of her rig, and remember every tournament. Every battle in the meka.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" Lena said, motioning towards the kitchen, \"How about a nice meal beforehand?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily nodded, \"I'll be there in a moment.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTracer seemed to accept this, and made her way back down the hall. Picking up the wand from where it had fallen on the floor, Emily gave herself another glance in the mirror. All of this was so thrilling, almost terrifyingly so. Perhaps it was time to reset everything back to zero. There were so many changes in play at the moment that she feared losing track of them all. And yet, at present she found the thought of streaming to her thousands of adoring fans rather appealing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a moment of contemplation, Emily decided to...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Settling in on the couch in the den, Tracer made sure that she had a good view of Emily, while still being in plain view of the TV. When in doubt, she could just start flipping through channels to look distracted. Once she was certain that Emily was paying her no mind, Tracer turned her attention to the wand, and started racking her brains for ways to test it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStruck with a moment of inspiration, she looked at Emily, face currently obscured as she poked through the fridge, and gave the wand a short wave. Lena had decided to stick to visible changes, she wouldn't exactly be able to hear Emily talking from here. Taking in a breath, she waited for Emily to emerge from the fridge, jaw dropping when she finally did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe person cooking now was not, as far as Lena remembered, Emily. Instead standing there, still wearing Emily's sweater and pajama pants, was one Angela Ziegler. And Emily showed no sign of seeing any difference. She even adjusted her now blonde hair without a second thought, before returning to her cooking. It took Tracer a moment to recover from the shock of it all. Not just that the wand had worked, but what that now meant for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAngela had never really looked her age, and more than a handful of times Tracer had taken the time to appreciate her from afar. And now she was in a relationship with her. Or rather, in a relationship with someone who looked exactly like her. Meanwhile in some other part of the building Angela Ziegler was now walking around looking like Emily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeciding to continue fiddling with the wand, Tracer wracked her brain for another person to choose from, having so many options but unsure of who to pick. Watching Emily standing on her tiptoes to reach something on the upper part of their spice cabinet was all the inspiration she needed. With another flick of the wand, Emily was suddenly a Russian bodybuilder who had no issue reaching anything. Not missing a single beat, Emily continued cooking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile across the room, Tracer's heart was missing all kinds of beats. She was struggling to process everything she was seeing. Trying to take in the fact that Zarya was now standing in her kitchen, but was still Emily. Getting lost in the way her jumper barely seemed to contain her muscular form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn idea suddenly struck Tracer, and once again she waved the wand. After the usual bright light, she leaned off from the side again, jaw dropping once more as she stared into the kitchen. As she had wished, the wand had swapped Emily with Widowmaker of all people. But the truly shocking thing for Tracer was how it had made that fit to reality. Emily certainly had Widowmaker's body, confirmed even more for Tracer with how her pants hugged her waste. But no longer was it the deep blue and purple that Tracer had seen so many times.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily still had Widowmaker's long hair, which instead of being pulled up was allowed to run down the entire length of her back. But rather than being blue, it was what had once been Amelie's natural hair color, black. Her skin was a normal tone as well. To complete the confusion, Emily gave a short warning that the food was almost ready, in Tracer's very own voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would you mind settin' the table luv?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat sentence alone forced Tracer's brain to completely reboot. Not only had the wand given Emily Widowmaker's body, adjusted said body for the fact that she had never been forced to go through the ordeals that Amelie had, and Emily was none the wiser for all of it. It had given her the body as is, which meant that she still had Tracer's previous voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will join you in a moment, love,\" Tracer said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked down at the wand, and up at Emily, deciding to...</span></div></div>",

She had a large mark today, she was going to take out another Omnic politician. <br>\r\nWidow had laid, waiting for the mark to emerge from the spot far longer than she should have, he was supposed to leave the building twenty minutes ago. She scoped the window nearest the door, there she saw a smug woman sat indian-style wave at her. Seeing red she fired at the woman only for said woman to blink out of existance. \"Stupid girl, wasting my time. She better make it up to me.\" Amelie said, repositioning, though she knew that girl would likely be behind her by now, just waiting to say\u2014<br>\r\n\"You missed!\" A voice sang out behind Widow, \"You would think by now you'd be used to my lead.\" Tracer taunted.<br>\r\n\"You've saved the bot?\"<br>\r\n\"Of course I have! It's what Heroes do!\" Tracer responded as she blinked in front of the blue woman. As soon as the blue faded Amelie did two things simultaneously she opened fire spraying bullets into the space Tracer had recently claimed and shot a gas mine to the spot Tracer previously stood. <br>\r\nA coughing was heard behind her, a smile spread on her face, proud of her guile she used her grapple and ran away. She jumped into an alley, she normally would stick the landing but her positioning was off her right foot landed on a small box before her left foot and she'd crumpled in a practiced motion to save her ankle. Amelie removed the box that was stuck to her heal, as she did so a wand fell into her lap.<br>\r\n\"Who would box a scrap of wood?\" the blue woman said as she grabbed it to toss it off her lap, or rather she would have if the wand hadn't assaulted her mind with information. \"The Swap Wand?\" Amelie said in a brief stupor before hearing the clambering of footsteps abover her.<br>\r\nWidow put the wand in her belt and grappled to the roof slingshotting herself into the air and sending a shot where the Tracer briefly stood. Unfortunately she didn't expect Tracer to charge the position she would land, nor for a monkey to bound through the air and grab her arms and hold them to her sides. <br>\r\n\"Unhand me you monkey!\" Widowmaker demanded upon their descent to the roof top.<br>\r\n\"I don't think so, Amelie.\" <br>\r\n\"Don't call me that\u2014\" Widowmaker started before biting her tongue, she needed to think of a way out. Her arms being held to her side left the tip of a certain wand within grasping distance, thoughts began broiling. Could the wand help her escape? Was it worth it to try to use it? Would it be better to be imprisoned in the Overwatch HQ, perhaps she could escape and bring some information for Talon.</span></div></div>",

She had been briefed on the wand's supposed abilities, but certainly didn't buy into any of it. If anything, she had scoffed at the thought that Talon would invest resources in it. But after a short flash of light, she found herself reconsidering that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first thing she noticed was that the gorilla was no longer holding her in place. Instead, his hand was gently resting on her shoulder, as if to comfort her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excellent work as usual, Amelie,\" he said as he moved past her, looking down at someone just beyond her view.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe spent a moment gathering herself, going slackjawed when she noticed that her usual purple body suit was now colored a vibrant orange and white. Along the side of her legs she could see the Overwatch emblem, clear as day. Her rifle too had changed to a similar color scheme. Slinging it on her back, she finally stepped around Winston, only to find Pharah and Tracer, on much less friendly terms than they had been but a minute ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTracer's hands were in cuffs, at the center of which was some sort of energy core. If Amelie was forced to guess, it was what was keeping the woman from zipping or rewinding away at the moment. What caught her eye next was the fact that Tracer too had received a wardrobe change. Her bomber jacket was now a deep black and red, the Talon logo resting on both her shoulder and the left breast of the jacket. She was giving Widowmaker a grim look, but remained silent as Pharah began to lead her back to the ship.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWinston too began to make for the ship, but not before turning to look at Widowmaker. \"Coming, Amelie?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmelie stood there for a moment, considering her options. She could simply swap back now, and take the opportunity to flee. But now would be an amazing opportunity for infiltration. To be able to move about the Overwatch base unabated, with access to all of their documents. The thought was intoxicating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned her head slightly, attention being grabbed away by a nearby window. Looking back at her was a face she hadn't seen in ages. One that wasn't purple, that had a natural hair color. Another, more selfish thought crossed her mind. Perhaps this reality was worth exploring more just for her sake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDid she...</span></div></div>",

She may no longer be literally cold hearted, but her motives remained the same\u2014at least that's what she told herself. She is simply going undercover, a spontaneous undercover operation. She smiled to herself and made her way onto the jet that pulled up near the building to receive the prisoner and Overwatch members.<br>\r\nAmelie had to hide her amazement as she entered the jet for the first time, surprised by its size and by how messy it was, photos thrown across a table, basketballs loosely secured on a rack and a basketball hoop in what she would have called an inconvenient place. It was new to her, but it felt like it safe to her, like a home.<br>\r\n\"Nice ship, love.\" Tracer spoke from her restrained seat. \"I kind of missed it, haven't been on it since, well you know,\" Tracer continued having now gotten Widow's full attention she wanted to know. \"Turned against the whole operation, shot up certain individuals,\" Tracer sent a pointed glare at Amelie \"Oh and earned my title: Widowmaker.\" Amelie was shocked, for several reasons, in this new reality she was not Widowmaker, she was just Amelie, she'd spent so long forgetting Amelie as Widow she felt she would have trouble returning to it, additionally she was hurt by those words, it seemed like the first time she'd felt such emotions. Amelie's teeth ground as she strode to the bound woman, blinded by having found emotion again. Amelie grabbed \"Widowmaker's\" face pointing it so their eyes were locked.<br>\r\n\"I'd love nozing more zan to make you suffer.\" Amelie said with tight lips.<br>\r\n\"Ha, under difference circumstances maybe I'd enjoy that.\" Lena retorted unfazed by the sniper's threat. \"Unfortunately for you though, I'm taken.\"<br>\r\nAmelie was furious before, but now somehow she was even angrier.

Reality had changed and shifted so much, it was impossible to tell. It was certainly a genuine emotion, just not one she could actively identify the source of. Perhaps she would look into it later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the moment she opted to rest back in her seat, and took in the ship. It was odd to think she had free run of the entire thing, if she so wanted. She watched idly as a few of the other Overwatch members milled about, stowing their gear and mingling. Eventually Winston seemed to take notice of her by her lonesome, and approached.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did the rifle do today, Tracer?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmelie blinked, instinctively looking up at Winston, \"Hm?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe scientist pointed at the rifle on her back. \"Your trace rifle. I know we didn't have time to test my adjustments before we were called away today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPulling the rifle from her back, Amelie examined it closer. At first she had only noticed the Overwatch color scheme the weapon had acquired, but with a longer look, she realized that it didn't seem to fire actual bullets now. The longer she thought about it, the more she realized that the rifle was non-lethal. It wasn't meant to harm a soul. And she also remembered Winston adjusting its tracer rounds earlier that day. She shuddered as her mind settled with these new memories, before regaining her composure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It shot true, Winston. Thank you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeming satisfied, Winston returned to the others and their conversations. Across the seat from her, Amelie noticed Lena looking morbidly amused. Her usual wit didn't seem to be as active now. Instead it felt as though the look was supposed to invoke something in Amelie. She felt that anger stir again, but couldn't for the life of her place what the source of it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSometime later the ship touched down at Overwatch HQ. Stepping off of the ramp, Amelie watched as Winston took Lena away, to ready her for a holding cell. The former member of Talon stared at the entrance to her enemy's headquarters.

Without having to ask it's location, Amelie made her way down hallways until she found herself in front of a terminal. The room she was now in was the Overwatch Records Room. She knew it, even if she had never visited it before. Because she had visited it numerous times in this altered reality. The thought made her head hurt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer fingers naturally clicked across keys for her login credentials. There was no second thinking as to what her password would be, everything just sprung to her as though she had known it her entire life, rather than learning it at this very moment. Navigating the records was just as easy, as was pulling the one up for Lena Oxton. She had looked at it countless times in this reality, and the thought of looking at it again filled her with dread.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe text of the file slowly lit up the screen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nName: Lena Oxton<br>\r\nAge: 26<br>\r\nAffiliation: Talon<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the details slowly filled in, she knew exactly what they were going to say. Former fighter pilot who was part of an unfortunate accident that left her unstuck in time. Defected to Talon when they promised her a more permanent solution that Overwatch couldn't provide. After two weeks missing she returned unexpectedly, killed Gerard Lacroix, and vanished again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmelie's stomach dropped. To have experienced at the time was horrible, but now everything about the incident was flooding into her mind all at once. Gerard's body, his funeral. Her demands to take to the field to avenge him. Overwatch had helped her cope. Overwatch had given her a place to belong when everything she had was taken from her. And now her husband's murderer sat some floors above her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shouldn't care. It was all a fiction, as far as everything was concerned. A temporary way of things that would vanish when next she used the wand. And yet...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe swiveled in the chair, hand going for her rifle as the door behind her slid open. The rifle never left its holster, as she relaxed the moment she saw that it was Winston who had entered. The two remained silent as the scientist grew closer, looking over her shoulder at the screen. A knowing look crossed his face, and he looked more solemn than Amelie had ever seen him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I understand it must be hard to be so close to her, Amelie. But taking her in is the right thing to do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe remained stiff, and stared at the floor. He was right. And she believed what he said. The fact that this wasn't permanent reiterated itself to her. Yet it didn't have to be temporary. Yet her duties to Talon...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are right, Winston,\" she said. \"I believe I just need some...Time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe nodded, resting a hand on her shoulder for a moment, before departing.

Amelie was split between two realities, the \"real\" reality where she was damned to a life of a cold widow, and a twisted reality where she could become something more. In the back of her mind she knew the longer she stayed the harder returning to her life would be, but at this moment returning to her life meant willingly entering captivity\u2014which only added to the difficulty of making such a choice.<br>\r\nAmelie found herself before the door of the common area, it felt weird to have made it there so easily, but the door caused a warm feeling in her chest, in spite of never having entered the room she had a strong fondness towards it. She took a deep breath and crossed into the quasi-unknown.<br>\r\n\"Ah, Amelie! Welcome back from another successful mission!\" A bold, warm voice immediately assaulted the woman.<br>\r\n\"Why thank you, Reinhardt. Your greetings are always a treasure.\" Amelie returned with a smile, as if she'd done this many times before. Behind that smile though the woman was barely concealing her horror, how could she be so familiar to this oafish man, and how could she be so nice to him?<br>\r\n\"Winston had mentioned that you may have had a hard time today,\" A modulated voice came from her side, \"One's duty is often hard, but those of strong character fulfill it well. Amelie,\" A robotic hand placed itself on her shoulder, \"You certainly are strong.\" Amelie was looking into the eyes of the cyborg ninja, she for the first time saw the human part of the cyborg. The man's words made her feel much better.<br>\r\n\"Thanks Genji, you've always manage to help me out of a rut.\" Amelie responded with a smile. Looking into the soft but serious eyes she saw a boy who'd suffered greatly, but matured quickly into a strong young man. Amelie felt as if she'd witnessed this growth, and to an extent envied it, he had forgiven the man who had destroyed his body, she couldn't do that for the woman who shot her husband, nor could she forgive those who had turned her into a cold killing machine... that thought trailed off as she realized the weight of that statement and swallowed it down, knowing she'll have to consider it more later.<br>\r\nAnother person had snuck up to Amelie's side, \"Here, your favorite.\" A glass of wine was offered to Amelie.<br>\r\n\"Thanks\u2014My god, I've become a jukebox, nothing more than a bunch of thankses.\" Amelie laughed. \"You smother me with kindness.\"<br>\r\n\"Of course, we're all here for you.\" Angela said guiding the woman to a seat. As they left Amelie turned to where the ninja had stood to find that he was gone, she found him once more at a ping pong table.<br>\r\n\"Come on then you lousey xbox, game on!\" A loud voice yelled at Genji whilst serving the ball. Junkrat and Roadhog were on site, Overwatch had overtime grown fond of the goons and their antics, they'd decided to hire them as demo specialists in an effort to curb their schemes not too long ago.<br>\r\n\"Very well then.\" The \"Xbox\" returned the ball. \"You two shall never beat me.\" He laughed.<br>\r\nI was as if Amelie's heart was melting, she loved everyone here even though she had been trying to kill and or maim many of them just weeks prior, even through this confusion she was, for lack of a better word, happy.<br>\r\n\"Those boys, always having fun.\" A soft voice spoke from the seat next to Amelie.<br>\r\n\"Oui. It's enviable, to have so much energy, I doubt nothing could keep those two down.\"<br>\r\n\"You mean Fawkes and Mako?\"<br>\r\n\"Of course.\"<br>\r\n\"I think if they were to be separated they'd have an incredibly hard time.\"<br>\r\n\"I hope they never have to face such a reality.\" Amelie said, she watched them for a moment then turned back to Angela, \"I wouldn't wish that on any two people.\" She said somberly.<br>\r\n\"You always do this, work yourself into a sad mood.\" You'd really ought to live in the moment.<br>\r\n\"You are right, the moment is the time to live.\" Amelie agreed, she looked back up at the woman across from her. Then she though about how to live in the moment, as if to remind her of it's existence wand warmed in her pocket.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Genji examined the artifact he now held in his hands, having just swiped it during an infiltration mission at a Talon base. He was back at Overwatch's HQ now, curiously studying the thing when Tracer popped her head in the doorway with a smile. \"Genji! Whatchu got there, luv?\" The british woman asked as she darted to his side. Genji chuckled and looked at her. \"Hello, Lena. I was simply... <i>checking out</i> this strange object I uncovered on my last assignment.\" The ninja explained, a nagging urge now in the back of his mind since his friend had shown up, a compulsion of sorta that made him grip the object a bit tighter. Now he couldn't help but run his gaze over Tracer's form, her tight fitting suit on those nicely toned legs, the cute yet cool cut of her hair...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was brought out of thought by the woman continuing. \"Ah! Yeah, 's bit strange in'it? Looks like some kinda magic wand out of a movie! Spooky!\" She remarked with her usual peppy enthusiasm. \"Indeed.\" Genji simply responded, glancing back at Tracer once more. In that moment, the wand in his hand began to react, and very suddenly Genji felt something... shift. A blink, and he looked back to Tracer... only to find himself looking back at him! \"W-what?!\" He exclaimed in shock, with the person identical to him tilting their head in confusion. \"Genji? Ya alright there, luv?\" Genji felt his jaw slack in shock, looking down at himself suddenly. It was then he noticed... he wasn't exactly \"himself\" at the moment, garbed out in Tracer's outfit and more notably, her very <i>body</i>. \"Lena? Why do I look... like you...\" Genji began to ask, but trailed off. It was weird hearing Tracer's voice as he spoke, especially since it lacked her distinct English accent when he wielded it. Almost as if responding to that thought, he felt the artifact react again. The person he presumed to be Tracer (in his own body) again looked very confused. \"What are you saying? You look the same as always!\" This time his own body lacked Tracer's accent, replaced with his own. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was odd, he had exchanged bodies with her, even distinct traits, yet only he noticed. He looked down at the artifact in his hands and suddenly put two and two together. \"Ah... r-righto. I must be... <i>knackered</i>, from that last mission. Sorry.\" Genji responded, now with Tracer's usual tone of speech naturally falling out of his mouth like he'd spoken that way his entire life. Tracer simply shrugged and began to walk away. \"Alright, let me know if you require anything.\" She said over her shoulder before vanishing through the doorway. Now that he was alone, Genji quickly unbuckled the chrono-device and let it fell to the ground, removing Tracer's goggles from her head as well. He stared down at his now smaller, more petite gloved hands with his mouth gawking in awe. \"<b><i>Blimey.</i></b>\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>This was like something out of some kind of... manga, for lack of a better comparison. Genji sat there, now the owner of his friend's physical form, with apparently not a single drawback as far as he could tell. \"Amazing...\" He noted aloud, still staring at his new hands in awe. Honestly, he'd almost forgotten what it was like to have a REAL body again, not stuck as part machine. As much as he had come to accept himself as was, perhaps subconsciously he was jealous of his friend in that moment, and that's why this... wand reacted the way it did, like it had for their speech. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGenji removed as much of Tracer's armor as he could, finally unzipping the bomber jacket and revealing what was underneath... more of the same orange suit, which was apparently made like some kind of leotard. Of course, that meant he was also looking at Tracer's... his, chest. And what a chest it was. Contrary to her lean frame, Lena Oxton had quite the bust. Made sense, given how bulky her jacket always looked from the front, even without her chronal device on. Peeling off the gloves, Genji wasted no time bringing his hands to his newly acquired assets. \"Blimey... again.\" He was still slightly thrown off by this new voice, but even more so at how natural the dialect felt on his tongue. It's like he really <i>was</i> Tracer, in a weird way. His hands slowly caressed the large mounds of flesh, taking fascination in how they felt when they were attached to him for a change.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe threw off the jacket and peeled the top of the suit off, now standing in a bright orange bra that matched the look of her overall aesthetic. \"Bloody hell, I'm proper <i>stacked!</i>\" Genji said with a grin as his hands slipped underneath the cups to grab at his flesh more directly. Now that he thought about it, he was probably the only man who'd <i>ever</i> gotten his hands on Lena in such a way... even if he was using her hands to do so. His fingers pinched a nipple, and he bit his lip as a moan slipped out. \"This is how the other half lives, eh?\" The man-turned-woman said with a cheeky grin as his hands pulled free and he re-adjusted the bra, taking a moment to trace his hands over the cups to feel their fabric. \"Think I could learn t' live with this!\" He finished that thought with a grab of that strange wand again, deducing that it must have some ability to read his desires to a degree, and change people to suit them.</span></div></div>",

She seemed to still address him as Genji, despite all evidence to the contrary, so clearly he couldn't actually get away with claiming himself to actually be her to others... unless of course, he could social status to the point where they'd effectively traded lives entirely? \"Hm, yeah... That sounds good.\" Genji said with a grin, putting what he could of Tracer's stuff back on, before using her powers to zip around and find his original body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt only took a moment, which Genji ended up enjoying immensely. He was fast all right, but this was almost true super speed! It felt amazing! \"Lena!\" He called out to his friend with his old form. \"Hm?\" The woman turned to him at his call. \"Genji, what is it?\" She asked him with a sincere tone, she really couldn't tell a thing. Genji smiled, gripping the wand behind his back and prepare to let it work it's magic. \"I was just thinking, sometimes I really wonder what it would be like, y'know, to really BE Tracer. To live your life.\" At that statement, he felt the wand react again, and knew that by the time she'd respond, things had changed again. \"Well, you have a wonderful life, Lena. I wouldn't trade it if I were you.\" Tracer said in response, only for Genji to grin a wide grin. It actually worked! They'd swapped names, at the very least. He needed to test how much got transferred over. \"S'pose you're right. Got that wonderful bird back home and all.\" He prompted, to which she only nodded. \"Emily is lucky to have you, truly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was amazing, he'd 100% usurped somebody else's life! He just had to go explore more about this, and speaking of \"his\" lovelife... \"Too true, well! That's all really, be seein' you... Genji.\" He said with a salute, dashing out of there.</span></div></div>",

Only that it was 'a secret powerful treasure, said to be able to bend reality'...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sound like bullshit.\" Was all Roadhog said about it in his usual muffled voice, after Junkrat's explanation on what they were after.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no no.

Ye gotta trust me mate, ain't nothin' betta then a treasure that gets em all talkin'.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmph.\" Roadhog looked at all the bombs set up at the wall.

Ehehehe...\" Junkrat readied the detonator, giggling like a child during Christmas... or like himself when he had explosives at hand. \"Fire in the hole!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bombs blew a hole in the wall in a deafening explosion, the shockwave rumbling through the complex. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now that's what I call an explosion! Ehehehe..\" Junkrat laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's go.\" Roadhog said, walking towards the hole, Junkrat hobbling behind him. The alarms meanwhile quickly sounded, putting the two on the timer. Once through the wall, they found themselves surrounded by artifacts and paintings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't see your treasure.\" Roadhog noted, seeing mostly just more of the usual loot than anything 'reality bending'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right, w-well, lets just grab and bag.\" Junkrat said, grabbing and stuffing whatever looked valuable into a bag. Roadhog did the same, just grabbing a looting. Soon enough, the sound of vehicles were approaching, and the duo knew they needed to go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lets go.\" Roadhog said, making his way out the hole they came in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just hold on a little longer, I've spotted something.\" Junkrat saw at the corner of his eye something that stood out to him. It was just a stick - well, a wand rather - but it drew in the rat to take it. He grabbed it, and followed behind Roadhog to make their grand escape...</span></div></div>",

Don't look like its yours.\" She confronted Junkrat and Roadhog.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mind yer own business.\" Roadhog said, quickly firing off his trusty scrap gun at the speedy Brit. Tracer quickly blinked away, and took out her two pulse pistols. The duo made a run for it, both firing off their weapons. Junkrat's grenades bounced around unpredictably, though Tracer skillfully dodged the bouncing explosives that headed her way. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aaargh! She's too quick!\" Junkrat shouted as none of his shots hit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on!\" Tracer blinked around a few times, before firing a volley that disarmed Junkrat of his grenade launcher. \"Take that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJunkrat looked over to where his weapon flew, and saw that Tracer was already around it. <i>If only I could get some of her speed...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of the sudden, the wand started to glow and reacting to Junkrat's current desire. He felt his legs tingle a bit. Wait. Legs? He looked down and realized he suddenly had two legs again. Before he could examine further, he hear and saw Tracer trip and fall, a consequence of now having one of Junkrat's peg legs (and his other leg). <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, what?\" Tracer said on the ground, now quite processing what just happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's move.\" Roadhog said, taking the opportunity to flee. Junkrat quickly grabbed his weapon of the ground, and ran along side his partner, excited about his discovery.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you not see Roadhog? This is what the treasure is!\" Junkrat exclaimed excitedly, showing Roadhog the wand as he ran along side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The stick?\" Roadhog replied, clearly skeptical.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes yes yes! Did ya not see me legs?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What of em?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I got two mate, yer eyes workin' okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You always had two.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahahaha, so that's what the 'reality bend' is all about.

The the way the wand worked meant that she was able to adapt to her new handicap quickly. That was not all however, as backup came in the form of a pink mech, flying in from the sky. Missiles came bursting out of it, raining down towards Junkrat, Roadhog and the hovertruck. Both Junkrat and Roadhog ran, Hog using his breather to tank some of the splash of the missiles. Behind them, the missiles landed on the truck, quickly disabling it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"D.va one, bad guys zero!\" D.va landed behind the two Australians. Tracer meanwhile was now directly ahead of them as well, cutting off any escape for the duo at the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Give it up, yer done!\" Tracer shouted to the two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, we're all mates here. Why so serious?\" Junkrat laughed nervously.

Drop yer weapons.\" Tracer demanded. Both her and Dva closed in on the two. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What plan.\" Roadhog grunted again, the two clearly trapped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd say we've gotten ourselves in quite the pickle.\" Junkrat laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Give it up, its game over for you two!\" Dva said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I agree... it'd need a miracle to for us to escape this one ay mate.\" Junkrat started. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right.\" Tracer said, suspicious of whatever Junkrat was planning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe when pigs fly...\" Junkrat then activated the wand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmph!?\" Roadhog made a surprised Roadhog noise as he suddenly felt his bodymass start shifting. He rapidly started shrinking, quickly losing his weight. That's not the only thing that he lost though, as his weapon seemed to start growing and enveloping him. His form soon became what seemed to be the polar opposite of his original body: a slender, petite female body. Vest and pants grew to hug his new lithe curves as a tight fitting bodysuit. Hair became loose. The tight body suit made him acutely aware that his big how sausage was missing, having been replaced by a tight Korean pussy. Though what was most noticeable was that he was now in the pilot seat of some sort of vehicle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did you do?\" Roadhog said, then completely surprised as his now high pitched, female voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No time to explain, fly! Fly! Flyyyy!\" Junkrat shouted, as he mounted the mech. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoadhog, somehow instinctively knowing how to pilot the mech, immediately took off with the boosters. Dva threw a hook towards her former mech, not noticing she was suddenly an absolute unit of an Australian man. Unfortunately for her, the mech was already out of reach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why did we try to corner someone that could fly?\" Dva asked, voice muffled by the mask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know...\" Tracer replied. She looked at her peg leg, knowing it was swapped but for some reason, could not speak out about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mission failed, we'll get em next time.\" Dva said.</span></div></div>",

All he knew was with its powers, they had easily escaped... and had more than one new toys to play with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hahahaaa... What a score ay mate?\" Junkrat said as he closed the door to the hideout. There was sounds of the mech opening up its cockpit at the same time, with a young Korean exiting out of it. Junkrat laughed. \"Roadhog mate, lookin' good. Ya lost bit weight have ya?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did you do?\" Roadhog said, sounding and looking nowhere near as intimidating as he did before the swap. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I used this lil' stick mate. Got ya that shiny mech there and got us out of there.\" Junkrat replied confidently, waving the wand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what happen to my body? My hook?\" Roadhog looked and felt his new body up. It was certainly a change not having his bigness to carry around and as annoyed he was at Junkrat for swapping him with no notice, it did feel pretty good. Not that he'll say that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Iunno, the body you 'ave has em now.

He nearly let out a moan but held himself back, not expecting them to be that pleasurable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're nice, but rather have my body back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we can't head out now, the fuzz still buzzin' round.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Entering into his pad, Roadhog noticed some immediate changes the room. Clearly it was still a real mess, he ain't tidying up a temporary pad. But the bed rather than a full sized mattress that didn't really fit him before, was a twin that definitely fit his new body. Even with the smaller bag though, he definitely had much more... stuff. Girl clothes stuff, with some moonspeak written on it. Not like Junkrat gave him the knowledge of that language. One thing he didn't have still was a mirror, which he wish he had now. At least he had his phone...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, a pinkskinned phone with a bunny on it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cute.\" Roadhog muttered, turning it onto selfie mode. Seeing his new face for the first time, Roadhog made a few silly faces. \u201cHehehe.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then focused further below. Though he wasn\u2019t a fan of how tight the suit was, he did like how it showcased the rather modest breasts that this body had. Still, wanting to get it off, he clawed around the neck area where eventually he found the opening. Without much grace, he pulled off the top of the bodysuit, dropping Dva\u2019s headset at the same time. Rather surprisingly, at least to Roadhog, it seemed that this girl was only wearing this suit. It was military grade stuff that was so form hugging so maybe it shouldn\u2019t be so surprising.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEither way, in just moments Roadhog got to see Dva\u2019s body in all its glory. It was obviously a stark contrast compared to his old body, and despite it being so skinny, she definitely was athletic enough. Giving his breasts another feel up, just as they were with the suit over them they were perky and tight. The nippples, well, were hard and very sensitive and Roadhog spent a bit of time just playing around with them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course soon enough he could not ignore the wet feeling going down under. There wasn\u2019t much of a bush, though that wasn\u2019t the part he was interested in. He took a hand and brushed over the wet pussy, feeling the wet heat, and the pleasure shocking though his new body. Wanting more of it, he began to rub it with one hand, using the other hand to play with a nipple. Soon enough, wanting even more, he slipped a finger into that tight Korean pussy, even more pleasure flowing through. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith not much time at all, Roadhog brought this body to an orgasm easily, basking in the pleasure of a female climax. He laid on the bed for a bit, taking out his secret pachimari stuffed toy to hug, noting that it easily fit in his hand before this swap. Maybe it was the dexterity and youth of this body, but that certainly felt better than when he had beat his meat recently.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDefinitely some consideration to be had with keeping the body. Maybe the mech. Though all the pink and moonspeak stuff would have to go. Plus, also the fact he didn\u2019t want Junkrat to know that stuff if he were to keep this body.

Sure, it had some minor benefits, but he'd prefer a real body again any day. One that didn't force him to live as a literal shadow half the time. It was a thought that often crossed his mind, and continued to do so as he got off the escape ship with something he had picked up on his last solo run, a strange old wooden stick, one that he almost felt called to him. As he got off, he was greeted by his Talon co-horts, namely Am\u00e9lie and Olivia, codenames Widowmaker and Sombra. They annoyed him, as most tended to. Widowmaker never said much, but Sombra droned on about things, and he didn't care for her attitude either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Watcha got there? Snag something on your little away trip, Reaper?\" Sombra asked him in a mocking tone. \"None of your business.\" He responded, gruff and impatiently. \"Ooooo~ How scary~\" She continued to mock, to Reaper's continued groans. \"I trust zat your mission was a success then, oui?\" Widowmaker asked him, much more curt and to the point. \"Yes, nothing else to report.\" He chose to end the questioning then and there, he had no patience for either of them right now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWidowmaker simply turned to walk away, as cold and calculated as ever. Sombra simply shrugged and threw her arms behind her head to follow the other woman out. Reyes felt a twinge of jealousy as they started to leave, they were both essentially super soldiers, much like he was, but they seemed much better off for it than he was, and that didn't sit right with him. He should have what they had, he'd at least feel somewhat human again otherwise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost as if in response to his desire, the wand in his hand reacted...</span></div></div>",

Then he noticed everything, looking down, he saw that his deepest desire had actually come true! \"I'm... human again.\" He raised a brow and looked at his hands, Widowmaker's hands. He glanced back over to see his own body still walking away. \"Hold on, Amelia!\" He called out, noting the distinct<i> french accent</i> his voice now had. The person with his form turned. \"Yes?\" They asked, seemingly unfazed. Reaper stood there confused for a moment, before a smile of realization crept onto his stolen face. \"...Nothing, carry on.\" He told her, to which she kept walking until she was out of site.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she was gone, a laugh rose in the man's throat. First small, but soon he was full on laughing triumphantly as he looked down at his new body. The body of a true human being again, and the most sultry woman he'd ever seen to boot. A glance down at the wand gave him all the understanding he needed. \"Zis... wand of sorts, it... changed me. Into zis...\" He walked over to the reflective hull of the ship, the click clack of the heeled boots both surreal and exciting all at once. He put down the wand, and ran a hand down his face. \"It'z been... too long.\" The hand kept going, and his other one joined in too, as they made their way to the open cut suit that showed off the massive rack his body was sporting. He grabbed at them with a wicked smile like a man possessed, groping and caressing them as if they were the answer to all his woes. \"Hahaha~ Wonderful...\" Reaper remarked, his hands now tracing his curvy form down to his thighs, and delivering a hard smack to his ass as well. \"Now zat iz what I call... one shot-\" His hands went back up to his torso and pulled apart the front of the suit to reveal Widowmaker's naked breasts, to which he licked his lips. \"-one kill.\"</span></div></div>",

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">The Rules of the Wand:<br>\r\n1. The wand demands it be used, very few people can hold it and not want to use it. Though the wand is not good or evil, it encourages the user's inner desires whether they desire curves, status, skills, or vengeance.<br>\r\n2. The wand will always leave the targets in the positions they were in. IE when swapping bodies, the bodies will move, not the person inhabiting it.<br>\r\n3. The wand can swap anything that can be defined as a trait, whether it be physical or mental. It can swap skin tones, body parts, articles of clothing, friends, and skills. The wand is capable of making multiple swaps at a time.<br>\r\n4. The wand will adjust clothing to fit the body it is swapped to, but only alters clothing when the clothing is the target of a swap.<br>\r\n5. The wand by default leaves only the wielder aware of the swaps, the exception being if the wielder wants the victim to know of it. The wand also knows the wielder's intent, if the swap is done maliciously the wand may make it so the target is aware of the swap, but unable to comprehend why, or talk about it. For example: D.Va calls Mei fat, Mei decides to knock D.Va down a peg and swaps their weight D.Va still knows that she used to be skinny, that she called Mei fat, and later she became heavy herself. She'll see differences in her new life as well, perhaps she has less viewers in her streams, or is harassed in stream by fat haters, or even fat lovers. The wand may also tag onto the swap her metabolism if Mei wasn't going to forgive D.Va, so she'd suffer more. D.Va would not be able to connect the dots between calling Mei fat, and her becoming fat, and why would she? Magic isn't real.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRules for Additions<br>\r\n1. Please use good grammar.<br>\r\n2. Please keep all chapters over a paragraph's length.<br>\r\n3. Go as lewd as you want, but no scat, and no gore.</td>",
