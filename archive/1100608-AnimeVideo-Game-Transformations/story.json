Her fighting Pok\u00e9mon were a tough challenge for any trainer who wished to obtain her badge. She battles many of those trainers on a daily basis, and whether she won or lost, she and her Pok\u00e9mon always enjoyed it, and learned a lot from their battles. However, her next fight was going to be very special, as it wasn't going to end traditionally. Her opponent didn't look that weird : he wore a labcoat and rather nerdy glasses, but Maylene had already fought many other scientists before, so that didn't strike her as odd. The only notable thing about him is that he looked so serious and quiet that he almost seemed to be mute. Before the young Gym Leader could engage a conversation with him, he raised him arm in front of him as of to say \"Stop !\" and grabbed a Pok\u00e9 Ball. Maylene was a bit confused, but she realized there was no point in trying to speak to him, and the battle began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sent out Lucario as her first Pok\u00e9mon, while the challenger sent out a Hypno. Lucario was the first one to attack, but Hypno dodged easily, and countered by putting Lucario to sleep with Hypnosis. Maylene tried her best to wake her Pok\u00e9mon friend up, but she was too focused on doing so to realize that the challenger's next attack was actually aimed at her. When she turned to Hypno, she realized that it was using Hypnosis again, but this time on her. Despite her efforts to resist the attack, Maylene lost consciousness and fell fast asleep. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she woke up, she was a rather dark room, with very little light. She was strapped to what seemed like an operating table, and could not move an inch, much less reach down to her pocket to call one of her Pok\u00e9mon for help. She struggled to try to break free, but to no avail. She took another look around, and noticed two important things : a window from which she could see the silhouettes of three people, and a huge, futuristic-looking ray gun that was aimed right at her. She was really scared, but she gathered the courage to try and yell at the shadowed people, hoping they would answer : <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who are you, and why did you kidnap me ?! What do you want with me ?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe saw the three slihouettes move a bit, as if theye were talking to each other, then heard a man's voice over the loudspeaker :<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We are Team Chaos. We seek to seize control of the world, by capturing legendary Pok\u00e9mon and using their power to make all of our enemies bow down to us. We are aware that many other teams before us have attempted to reach this goal and failed, but we do not rely solely on Pok\u00e9mon. We also make great use of technology and weapons to dispose of humans who should stand in our way. The ray gun that you see before you is one of those weapons. It is a rejuvenating ray, meant to regress our enemies in age to render them harmless. It has not been tested yet, which is why you are here now. You shall be a test subject for this new weapon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaylene started to panic, and struggled even more to try and break free, but her efforts were useless. The ray gun started to glow a bright blue color, before firing a beam of intense light at the young Gym Leader. As soon as the beam of light struck her, her body started to shake violently as if she had been hit by lightning. She felt a rather intense pain throughout her body, and felt her consciousness drifting away as the beam was altering most of her mind. Her body was getting smaller by the second, and her clothes started to look huge on her. Her regression continued until she was...</span></div></div>",

She stood up and stretched, putting her hands up toward the ceiling. She walked over to her makeshift armory and began suiting up, equipping her shield, holstering her guns, placing her class mod on her hip and hanging her relic next to it. She walks out of her apartment and spots Tannis speaking into an ECHO, talking about something relating to the other Vaults. Tennis notices her and smiles that insane grin, then turned away and continued talking into the ECHO.

Maya stepped through the main door of the bar, moving past several people and spotting Axton, who was standing at the bar with the hulking, diminutive form of El Salvador. They were talking about one thing or another, and upon closer inspection, they were talking about raiding a bandit hideout, one in Three Horns and which actually had bandits worth fighting. Not that a Gunzerker couldn't handle them, of course. <br>\r\nMaya stopped next to the bar. Moxxi moved away from the two other Vault Hunters and leaned against the counter in front of Maya.<br>\r\n\"Hey, sugar,\" the busty bartender greeted with a seductive tone in her voice and a matching smile, \"You here about that job?\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" Maya replied, placing her hands on her hips, \"What is the job?\"<br>\r\nMoxxi pushed off the counter and gestured to the door to the side of the bar, and she disappeared through a door herself. Maya lowered her eyebrows, but she did as she was instructed and moved to the door. She moved up the staircase there and then into the door on the landing. <br>\r\nShe entered a room that looked surprisingly luxurious. It has an ECHOVISION installed on one wall and a black couch across from the EV. There was a very large bed with a canopy and plenty of posters, as well as a dartboard with a photo of Handsome Jack and darts put through it. Moxxi was already there, waiting against the bed. <br>\r\n\"Alright, what's the job?\" Maya asked, placing her hands on her hips again and standing parallel to Moxxi, who pressed one hip out and put a hand on that hip, allowing the other arm to hang slack.<br>\r\n\"Well, I have two,\" Moxxi said, \"Do you want to hear about...\"</span></div></div>",

Her eyes become vertical ovals in shape, and as soon as they're finished changing shape, Dawn's body is completely gone, leaving only her head and neck, which has become like a small sphere below her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot a moment later, Dawn is unceremoniously tossed out of the TV, which promptly fizzles a bit before the screen blows out of it, leaving Dawn in her transformed state, hovering a few feet off the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turns to the TV and looks it over, before saying something in Rotom-Poke-speak that literally translates to \"Well, I guess I'm going to be stuck like this.\", though her tone suggests that she's acutally indifferent. \"I wonder what being a pokemon will be like, anyway, or more specifically, this pokemon.

Inside the room, there were five strangely orange-coloured appliances lying on the floor: a microwave oven, a washing machine, a refrigerator, a fan, and a lawn mower.

She came up to the lawn mower and noticed a oddly-shaped hole where a motor should be. Curious about this abnormal spot, she went closer to try to get a better look at this machine, but as she was close to making contact with it, she got absorbed by the appliance, with her body taking on a new shape and aura.

Dawn had even heard rumors of them being able to possess other Pok\u00e9mon, and people! \"Finally, someone enters this dump after seven years!\" Dawn can hear a voice say. She realizes it's coming from Rotom. \"And such a cutie, too!\" Rotom was now much closer to her, making its voice much more audible. \"Don't mind if I do!\"  it said, and without warning, jumped into Dawn's body, leaving its small balloon-like form behind. Dawn's body began to fill with strange sensations, before she became light headed and blacked out. Upon waking up, she could see her own body. Its eyes now resembled those of a Rotom, with a horizontal line going through the middle. Dawn found that she was in that balloon-like form the Rotom once inhabited, and realized the Rotom had stolen her body. \"Ah, so you're awake.\" Rotom said in its borrowed voice, making a slight smirk with its cute new face. Taking its hands off its breasts, it looked over at you, saying: \"I could have just left you here, but I figured I owe you an explanation. I was a lot like you, a trainer. I came into this place and had my body stolen by a Rotom. I should've been able to live a normal teenage boy life, but no, it was taken away from me.\" Dawn shuddered at the thought of a boy her age inhabiting her body. \"And now, after seven years, I see a cute girl wander in her all by herself. I didn't really want to be a girl, but hey, it beats being trapped in here. Besides, I'm now starting to see the benefits of being the fairer sex.\" He says, squeezing his new breasts once again.</span></div></div>",

Normally Bowser would take his bruises with pride and exact a revenge plot after getting home, but what really hit the head on the nail was Peach's increasing defiance. Lately she had been attacking Bowser on sight whenever he appeared to kidnap her. This however caused Bowser to question if his fantasy of inter-species marriage was only a delusion that was causing his kingdom to suffer. Deep down Bowser didn't want to admit his soon to be found hatred of Peach because that would mean begging his ex-wife to help him destroy Mario and co. and also being completely subjugated to his former flame via marriage for in Koopa society the queen always has the last say and Bowser had been trying so hard to rewrite the Koopa kingdom into a patriarch only to fail time and time again through multiple lawsuits from his ex. Bowser had managed to arrive home with no trouble at until he saw her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello Bowser, are you ready to admit that you're a complete idiot for divorcing me and that you need me to fix your mess?\" The tall regal Koopa said in a condescending tone as she stood outside of the front door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why would I give into a psychotic witch like you?\" Bowser asked in a sarcastic tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You still can't deny the fact that you still have feelings for me. Such feelings of affection are weakness. It's only through pure hatred that true power lies.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then that would make you a hypocrite.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will not be talked down to by an inferior Koopa like yourself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Inferior? You know that I'm your equal and you don't like to admit it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If that's how you want to play my tubby ex-hubby than so be it. Speaking of your weight you should stop trying to lose it. Your belly is what makes you so attractive.\" Bowser's ex said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBowser stood shocked at his ex's openness about how she felt about his weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Later Bowser and I hope to hear from you soon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBowser then proceeded into his castle and started watching TV. It was during that time he came up with another plan. He thought what his ex said and considered his size.
