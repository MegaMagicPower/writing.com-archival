            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The sky was dimming as the ever-laughing sun began to set, which allowed for the almost malicious looking moon to take it's place in the apex of the night sky.  A certain ninja-girl was in her comfy home, that she shared with her ever-hyper partner Black Star, and was simply passing the time reading a good book.  Dressed in a simply long-sleeved purple shirt and a pair of gray sweatpants, the girl was extremely content and relaxed compared to what had occur earlier that day.  Yet again, her meister, Black Star had embarassed the tall teen in front of nearly all the Shibusen students.  It all started with a dispute between Soul and Black Star and escalated until the self proclaimed 'God' pulled off Tsubaki's skirt to prove that \"Tsubaki had the hottest bod of them all,\" and left the poor girl standing, confused and embarrassed with her black lacy panties and shapely lower half to be seen by all.  Needless to say, Tsubaki nearly beat her meister to death that day.  Flipping the page, the girl felt her stomach give off a slight growl.  Before even reacting to her own body, the door to her apartment was kicked open and Black Star entered with his shrill voice and 'big' personality.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ya-ho!~  The great me has returned Tsubaki!\" screamed the young teen as he entered his own home, being as loud as possible.  The meister, dressed i his normal apparel seemed to be carrying a rather large package.  It was white in color and was wrapped with a scarlet ribbon and tied at the top with a fancy bow.  Walking towards the shocked girl, she sat up and fought off the urge to greet him warmly but she did eye the box that Black Star had with curiosity.  Looking up to her partner, he had a wide grin on his face and gave off a snicker.  He then placed the box on Tsubaki's lap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here ya go!  I got you something to make up for what happened today at school.  I still don't really get what the whole fuss was about though.\" stated Black Star as he scratched his head in a slight confusion.  \"Come on open it!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, what is it?\" said the girl as she fiddled with the ribbon in an attempt to untie it.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just open it! I got it from a super popular store that just opened up.  And ya know it's good cause Maka recommend it!\"  By his words, Tsubaki only became more curious and after a few moments, she was able to open the gift.  Lifting the cover, she saw that the box was filled with baked treats.  Eclairs, cookies and any kind of patisserie treat imaginable was stuffed into seemingly small box.  Looking at the treats with a slightly confused look, she looked back up to her partner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't eat these Black Star.  I'm on a diet.\"  Not responding to this, the blue-haired youth picked up one of the many eclairs from the box and held it towards Tsubaki's mouth.  Perplexed by this she opened her mouth to say something, which lead to an opening that Black Star too advantage of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bla-\" was all the girl could say until the treat was forcibly shoved into her petite mouth.  Feeling the flavor practically explode in her mouth, she felt her face express pure bliss as she savored the treat in her mouth. Swallowing the calorie-laden treat, she failed to notice that chocolate frosting and filling had adorned her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nonsense Tsubaki!  I bought these for you so you can enjoy them.\" stated Black Star as he picked up another foodstuff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bu-\" the same thing had occurred, only this time, the boy had shoved a jelly doughnut in her mouth.  Feeling the same euphoria coming over her body, she slowly chewed once again.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just enjoy them will ya!  Right, I'm going to go shower and eat dinner.\" said the boy as he exited the living room and went into the nearby hallway.  Tsubaki was left there, with a giant box of her pastries.  Taking a chocolate chip cookie from the pile she felt her stomach growl even louder than earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Well just a few more wouldn't hurt...\"    <br>\r\n  </span></div></div>",

Dressed in their respective everyday outfits, Black Star's heavy footfalls down the hallway were contrasted as always by the meek gait of his ever present weapon partner. The arrogant boy serenaded himself with a song, written by himself and for himself, as they headed to class. Tsubaki didn't particularly mind the eccentricities of her abrasive meister, though he probably could use some vocal lessons. No, he had bought his way off the hook with the box of pastries given to her last night. The out of character gesture of kindness and generosity was enough for her forgiveness. She was so touched in fact, that she didn't think twice about helping herself to the contents of her box of cream filled bribes that Black Star had offered her... multiple times.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right Tsubaki?!\" Black Star interrupted his partner's train of thought as both a sign that he was done with his ballad of egotism and searched for confirmation that he was indeed as awesome as he thought himself to be. \"Yeah!\" Tsubaki said weakly through a mouthful of sugar and dough. Satisfied with the patronizing response, Black Star smiled and continued onward with his usual pace. \"Today's gonna be a great day!\" the aspiring epic said confidently, his hands folded behind his back. \"Oh, and-\" Tsubaki swallowed her mouthful of chewed mush \"-Why's that?\" Black Star grinned exuberantly, \"Because today's the day I finally show how awesome I am to my adoring public!\" he paused, \"...And me, Soul, and Kid are gonna go shoot some hoops after school; Wanna come?\" Tsubaki smiled, genuinely happy to be invited. \"Sure, sounds fun.\" she said sweetly, \"Me being there will make the teams even, so I guess I'm partnered up with you?\" Black Star gaffawed, \"Wouldn't have it any other way!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the second bell, both of them visibly tensed and hurried their paces as the thought of being late to one of Professor Stein's classes crept into their minds. Last time they were late he threatened to make them stay after class for 'independent study'- namely his own study, which usually consisted some form of bodily mutilation. Both of them hurried into the classroom and took their seats in the perimeter seating arrangement near their friends. They each let out a relieved sigh, the Professor hadn't entered the classroom yet. \"Phew.\" they said in a shared sense of easing tensions. \"'Sup guys?\"\" a familiar flat tone greeted them from below. Looking down, Soul 'Eater' Evans and his partner Maka Albarn had already taken their seats, \"You guys are pretty late, I'd expect this from Black Star, but not from you Tsubaki.\" said the white haired scythe boy. \"That's my fault.\" Tsubaki said apologetically, \"I forgot to take a shower last night, and since it was broken when I got up-\" here all eyes turned to Black Star, \"-I had to take a bath this morning.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's in the box, Tsubaki?\" Maka inquired, stretching out a slender arm to gesture towards it, \"It looks too big to be lunch.\" The dark arm weapon pulled it a little closer to her and removed the top of the box, revealing the sea of pastries to her fellow student. \"Black Star felt bad for what happened yesterday, so he apologized with these.\" Maka peered inside, her innocent face turning bewildered. \"<b>Black Star</b> bought you these? Our Black Star?\" The addressed ninja looked over indignantly, \"So what if I did?!\" he said loudly, \"You're just jealous because the great Black Star hasn't given <i>you</i> anything!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sure that's it.\" A voice resounded from above, slightly off to the left and seated exactly in the middle of the classroom. Death the Kid, or simply Kid as his full name was a bit of a mouthful, sat between his twin demon guns Liz and Patty Thompson and looked downward towards the rest of his friends. \"Actually, it's kinda sweet.\" Liz said thoughtfully, \"It's totally not like Black Star to think about other people's feelings, let alone buy them a big box of candy to apologize.\" Her sister, sparking at the word candy, immediately turned to Tsubaki with a hungry look in her sparkling blue eyes. \"Candy? Do you have gummy chocolate death idols in there?!\" she said excitedly. Tsubaki smiled and let out a small chuckle at Patty's bright personality, \"Actually no, its not candy.\" she corrected softly as she reached in and pulled out an eclair as proof, \"It's more like donuts and pastries; stuff like that.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh.\" Patty said, her enthusiasm dying down before realizing that those too were delicious and bad for you. \"Can I have some?!\" she said excitedly, holding out her hand expectantly. Never one to say no, Tsubaki happily handed the younger Thompson twin her eclair and watched as she eagerly devoured it. She belched, afterwords chiming a gracious \"Thanks Tsubaki!\" Liz caught this, those things looked pretty good! \"Hey Tsubaki, mind if I have one too?\" she asked as nicely as possible- which still seemed sort of like demanding. She was handed a random treat from the box and took a bite. The same look of euphoria came to her as it did her sister and Tsubaki, she eagerly ate the rest of her designated treat. Kid stared straight forward as his partners licked their sticky fingers. \"You know that stuff's bad for you.\" he said flatly, \"You should really take better care of your bodies, and-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kid, there's missing stitch on your <i>left</i> sleeve.\" Liz said, not really in the mood for one of her meister's rantings<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i><b>WHERE</b></i>?!\" he shouted, instantly ripping off his upper body wear in search of this deviance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone turned back to Tsubaki and her mystical bag of delicious sweets, having grown quite used to Kid's outbursts when regarding symmetry. \"Anyway Maka, Black Star said he got the idea from you- where is this store anyway?\" the pigtailed student put a finger to her chin as she recalled the exact location of this wonderful pastry shop. \"It should be on the corner of Death Avenue, right next to the coffee shop.\" she said, \"I showed Black Star the way yesterday, but I thought he was just going to blow some money, I didn't know he was shopping for you Tsubaki.\" Soul piped up, catching the fault in her story. \"Wait a sec.\" he teased, \"If you just 'showed him the way', how come you came home with all those pastries yesterday?\" Maka blushed, \"I-uh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahem.\" a stern voice came from far below. The bespectacled professor looking upwards in an unamused fashion, apparently he had entered some time ago and couldn't start class because of the ruckus emanating from the group. \"No talking, please.\" he said, adjusting the large screw running through his skull maliciously, \"Or I'll be forced to hold all of you back after class for detention.\" He turned his back to them, walking over to his patchwork patterned chair and taking a seat. \"And Tsubaki, I would put a lid on that box if I were you.\" he said ominously, \"If one of our test subjects gets loose, they may be attracted to your lunch.\"<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n...<br>\r\nMaka piped up and pointed at they young reaper sobbing openly into his jacket; lamenting that he couldn't locate the fabricated stitch and declaring himself worthless and akin to garbage. \"Can Kid be excused?\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>When class ended, the group walked down the corridors together and out the front door of the school. Fortunately enough, the sun still shone over Death City. But then, rain only came very occasionally in these parts. Tsubaki smiled as she held onto the little box of pastries Black Star had bought her, her eyes scanning over the rest of the group. Kid was observing himself in a mirror - after his earlier paranoia about a loose thread, he'd spent most of the day afterwards making sure just everything about his appearance was neat and symmetrical. Patty was snickering as she watched him, whilst Liz looked off to the side in disinterest. Black Star was striding ahead at the front with a grin across his face, whilst Soul followed just behind him with an amused smirk. Maka just sighed and shook her head at Black Star.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, guys! Ready for a game?\" called a voice from ahead. As the group walked into the courtyard, they spotted a young, black teen, a bald geek and another boy with a visor. Recognizing Kilik, Ox and Harvar, the boys smirked and walked on ahead. Or at least, Black Star and Soul did. Soul had to drag Kid just to take him along.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright! The great Black Star is ready to kick all of your asses!\" he boasted proudly, puffing his chest out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!\" Kid exclaimed, his face twisted in a serious grimace. \"We must have equal teams! There's no point to playing if I can't be on a symmetrical team!\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Relax, Kid. There's about six of us, so we'll play three on three. Oh, wait,\" Soul paused, lazily turning in as cool a fashion as he possibly could. \"Hey, any of you want to play as well?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not interested,\" Liz remarked, inspecting her nails. Patty smiled and stood by her sister, making it clear who she was going to stick with. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's alright, you can play without me,\" Tsubaki spoke up, smiling politely. Absent-mindedly she reached a hand into the box and pulled out another doughnut, proceeding to munch on it as the others turned their attention to Maka.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can play without me,\" Maka spoke up. \"Kid would freak out anyways if it was four on three\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright then, we'll meet up later at the apartment or something,\" Soul remarked, waving lazily as the boys began to turn around and walk ahead. The boys each uttered their goodbyes before proceeding to take a brisker pace forwards. They each began to boast to one another, their bragging slowly fading as they walked away. Now the group of girls stood together, looking to one another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, what do you wanna do?\" Liz remarked, raising a brow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's go everywhere! To all the places!\" Patty cheered a little enthusiastically, grinning from ear to ear. As much as her enthusiasm was appreciated, of course, the rest figured that it would be better to go somewhere more specific.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... We could get some food and then decide where to go. We have plenty of time...\" Maka remarked, rather suspiciously looking across towards the city rather than meeting anyone's eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsubaki by now had finished swallowing down her doughnut, licking a little jelly from the corner of her mouth as she looked down to her box. Although it had started out full, she'd now eaten more than a few of the pastries within. Biting down on her lip, Tsubaki looked back up to the rest of the girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maka, you said you knew a pastry shop nearby, right?\" Tsubaki asked. Maka suddenly seemed to brighten up, though she certainly kept herself well in check as she made sure she wasn't uncharacteristically enthusiastic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I can take us there,\" Maka remarked. Nodding, Liz wordlessly looked to Tsubaki, who picked up on her glance and offered her one of the pastries from the box. Taking a doughnut, Liz took as large a bite and chewed slowly, savouring the taste before swallowing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it's not like Tsubaki's got a bottomless box of these, and they do taste good. The pastry shop is good,\" Liz answered at last, with Patty nodding her head in agreement. Altogether, the group of girls began to stride down the steps from the courtyard down into the city below. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately, the pastry shop was not all that far away. Arriving in just twenty minutes, the group found themselves standing inside a large pastry shop. A long display case had many different pastries and cakes on display. Tsubaki stared in awe at the vast selection, greater than she could have predicted. She almost felt her mouth water a little as she inspected all the different pastries. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe others were certainly no less surprised, save for Maka. But even Maka's eyes seemed to beam a little as she saw the huge selection. But before anyone could notice how childishly she was acting over a bunch of pastries, she quickly assumed a much more calm expression before stepping up to the counter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright... Hm... Could I get...\" Maka paused, thinking about her choice carefully. \"Could I get four croissants please?\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cherry Pie! Cherry Pie!\" Patty chimed in enthusiastically, grinning as she pointed to the aforementioned pie in the display case.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, yeah, could we get some Cherry Pie too-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll have some \u00e9clairs as well. Maybe two?\" Liz added her order. Nodding, Maka looked back to the cashier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, four croissants, Cherry Pie, two \u00e9clairs-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about two of these? It says they're called 'tompouces',\" Tsubaki added her order lastly. Pausing, Maka took a moment to remember it all before continuing to speak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, four croissants, a Cherry Pie, two \u00e9clairs and two tompouces,\" Maka ordered. With a smile, the cashier nodded and began to take several of the pastries out from the display case. As soon as each of the girls got their orders, they walked over to a table with four chairs and sat together, ready to eat their food.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The class time came and went, each student's mind filled with new Shibusen knowledge and the reminder that Dr. Stein held little regard for his student's safety when some of the 'test subjects' decided that being dissected wasn't all that fun.   The group left the lecture-room, slightly fatigued due to fighting off the 'specimens' and trying their hardest to not reduce the area into a smoldering crater due to miss-using their abilities.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well that was a handful.\" sighed the black-haired ninja-girl as she clutched her precious box close to her side.  Doing her best to protect the delicious pastries, she also struggled in containing Black Star, making sure that he didn't destroy everything in the classroom.  Feeling peckish, she quickly opened the lid and pulled out a danish, placing the treat straight into her petite mouth.  Before she closed it, Liz casually grabbed a plain donut, casually munching on it as the group marched on, rather than consuming it at once like her svelte friend.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha, those monsters didn't know what hit'em!  Let's go to Stein's lab so we can fight the rest of them!\" screamed the 'loudest-shinobi-in-existence,\" which promptly allowed him to receive an audible bonk to the head, courtesy of Tsubaki for even suggesting such an incredibly stupid idea.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay well that was stupid,' remarked the cool and collected Soul, who walked besides his meister, \"Look, I think we're all agitated by that whole shit that went down in class, but let's just hurry up and play some basketball.  Exams are coming up and we don't got that much free time left.\" While Soul didn't let the little things get to them (as that would be extremely uncool behavior), he just wanted to have some days where he didn't have to fight for his life.  Plus he really hated exams.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha, Soul if anyone's agitated it's you!  That's kinda uncool of you\" teased Maka as poked her weapon in the arm, getting back at him for his remark earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut-it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsubaki giggled to herself, she always loved to see Maka and Soul tease each other.  In her mind, they would make an incredibly cute couple.  Her musings were interrupted by Patty clutching her free arm playfully.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Tsubaki, can I please have something from the box of delicious stuffs?\" asked Patty, giving Tsubaki a clear view of her 'puppy-eyed' face.  Tsubaki, obliged and opened the top, giving the hyper-girl a view of the vast amounts of foodstuffs.  Giving off her usual laughter, she grabbed a handful and proceeded to stuff them all into her mouth.   Kid watched her carefully, making sure she didn't choke herself, but he noticed something else as well.  All of the girls seemed to be eating nonstop from the box, but it never seemed to get empty and he made a note that the girls didn't seem to be getting full either, despite normal sweets being notorious for killing appetites.  Before he could think of a rational explanation, the group reached the exit.  However, something was amiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Shit!  Why is it raining?\" yelled out Soul. The whole group just stared out at the torrential rain that posed as a minor, but extremely annoying obstacle.  However, Black Star didn't share this opinion.  Running out into the rains, he stopped in the middle of the opening plaza, dramatically pointed a finger towards the rest of his friends and guffawed an obnoxious laugh.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong?  All of you scared of a little rain?!  LET\"S GO!  I'll race all of you guys there!\" screamed boy with an ego to match God himself as he ran off towards the park.  Everyone else simply stared at him.  Maka did the sensible thing and pulled out an umbrella from her bag.  She was always prepared after all.  Though it was a rather small one.  Soul noticed this and grabbed it from her partner and opened it up and pulled her closer to him, trying to move past the whole embarrassing situation cliche that he hated.  Kid, also ready to prevent himself from being drenched, pulled out two umbrellas, after all, the number of umbrellas needed to be an even number and four was simply ridiculous, or so was the reasoning that belong the Kid. Handing one to Tsubaki to share with Liz, while he kept the other for him to use alongside Patty.  As the group readied themselves against the forced of nature, they went out.  Maka, content to be so close to Soul (but she would never outright tell him that) suggested that they go to her and Soul's apartment, as it was the closest to the school.  No on had any objections.  <br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -----------------------------------------------<br>\r\nLater, everyone was dried off, each wearing a new set of dry clothes as Soul and Maka made sure  to have clean clothes available in emergencies.  The group were lounging around in the living room, each warming up from the rain.  Tsubaki placed her box, once again, protected carefully against outside factors, onto the table with the lid off and motioned everyone to help themselves. Maka soon came up, serving coffee to her friends.   Pouring a cup for herself and Soul, she took her place next to the cool boy.  Though he was a bit miffed that he wasn't able to play some basketball, he had to admit that this was nice.  Looking over to Maka, he noticed that he also brought small dessert plates for the treats to be placed on, which Maka promptly filled with food.  Taking a glance at the rest of the group, he saw that the rest of the girls were snacking away on the desserts at a rather rapid pace.  The death god of the group was too preoccupied trying to make sure that his sleeves of the simple t-shirt were the same length.  Giving off a sigh at the lack of interactivity stemming from the group, he looked back to his partner, who subconsciously edged herself closer to Soul.  Unlike the others, she was eating a regular pace.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Soul?\" asked Kid as he stared at both of his sleeves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you have any sewing tools?  I need to fix the hem on the right sleeve but I left my kit at home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know.  Go look through the cabinets in the other room or something.  And make sure you don't go all OCD on us and wreck our stuff.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I promise nothing.\" answered the near-symmetrical lad as he went into the other room.  Soul face-palmed at his reaction, he was ALWAYS like this.  Sinking back into the couch, he felt himself drifting into boredom.  This was looking to be a bust of a night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyone wanna watch a movie or something\" said Soul as he looked out the nearby window.  The sky was gray and dark, with no sign of the sun coming out soon. Thankfully it was Friday and that meant the start of the ever-precious weekend.  Watching the raindrops plopping against the clear window, Soul failed to notice Tsubaki's sash beginning to tighten...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As one can imagine, playing basketball in the rain by yourself would leave you drenched.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlack Star, deciding that the only one skilled enough to face himself <i>was</i> himself, opted for the cold empty concrete that made up their local basketball court instead of the warm toasty apartment where all his friends were; performing as the Home Team, the Visiting Team, the referee, and even the audience. Call it what you would, it was just the principle of the thing. Home Team won by two points. He was actually quite good when it was just him, somehow able to steal the ball away from himself using his awesome speed and shinobi skills. However, that seemed tedious even to the ever-amused Black Star after a while; so he decided to get in some much needed practice on his layups. Soul had really been showing him up lately on the court, and the arrogant little ninja just couldn't stand for that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, after a long night of practice and hard physical exercise, Black Star made the long journey home; back to his apartment where surely his live-in partner Tsubaki had cooked a nice warm meal that would satisfy his Godly appetite. Ah yes, then he could just relax for the rest of the evening with a few hundred pushups and crawl into his comfy futon and slip carelessly into his dreams.What sort of dreams would he have tonight; he could only wonder. Probably something amazing like a solid-gold statue of everyone's number one idol: him. The abrasively egotistical shadow warrior smiled, getting all warm and fuzzy as he pictured all of his friends and classmates bowing down and finally realizing his greatness. Of course, this particular fantasy happened quite often, so his reaction was a little tested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the rain slowly let up, the soaking-wet shinobi's heavy footfalls rattled the staircase; his clodhoppers beating the surface of each individual stair thoroughly as he stomped up each and every one. His apartment was nothing special, but even normal people could get up and down those things without snapping a plank. Black Star was just careless, he always volunteered to fix it anyway, so what if it got broken once or twice? He excitedly opened the door to the Star-Nakatsukasa residence and started his usual ritual of putting several exclamation points after even the simplest of sentences; \"Tsubakiiiiii!!\" he shouted to the out-of-sight dark arm, \"You totally should'a been there, I was totally on fire today.\" the blue-headed simpleton started towards the modest oriental-styled living room in hopes of finding his partner, \"I was playing basketball right? And I was like swooosh, and then I had the nerve to think that I could steal the ball from myself! Ha, but I showed me!\" Still not finding his ponytailed weapon, the Star Clan kid's face scrunched up slightly, \"Hey... are you even here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thought of her not coming home this late was a little troubling; not just because he couldn't cook and would therefore die if she never came home, but this was simply really out of character. She had a self-imposed curfew of about 10'ish for Fridays so that she could come home and have a light supper before going to bed. Black Star thought for sure that she'd be home by now. \"Huh.\" was all the not-so-bright Black Star could muster in silence, \"Wonder if she's still at Soul's?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA light moaning emanating from their shared bedroom startled him, breaking him from his reflection. \"Ohhhh...\" it sounded awfully feminine, distinctly familiar, \"B-Black Star...?\" the voice called out woefully, \"Not so loud, please...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ninja took this as incentive to sneak a quick peek into his bedroom. Not exactly hoping that Tsubaki would be changing or anything, at least not thinking that outright, but really just his simple-minded curiosity that came with his suprisingly complex character. There, curled up tightly in intense pain on her futon was his partner, Tsubaki Nakatsukasa, nursing a stuffed taut tummy under the cover of darkness. Laying on her side facing the door, Tsubaki's face scrunched up in disdain for the light Black Star's entrance entailed; her thin black brow creased her pretty forehead in frustration. \"Ohh...\" she moaned again, \"I think I ate too much...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd, in retrospect, she probably had. That box of sweets had put her up through several eclairs, a couple dozen donuts, thirteen danishes, a frosted onigiri, and some dumplings. Of course she wasn't keeping count, all the sweets just sort of blended together in one headache inducing sugar high. That was probably why Tsubaki, nor Maka, nor Liz or Patti seemed to notice that the Ninja Weapon's box held a ponderous amount of sweets. Far more sweets than a small box should. Of course logic was for the sound, and Tsubaki was about as unsound as she had ever been. All she wanted to do was make the intense pressure on her stomach go away! She thought sleep would help, but so far she'd just been laying there for about an hour doing nothing in the dark...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tsubaki?\" Black Star inquired as he stepped into their bedroom, \"You alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was another moan; \"Noooo...\" she whined, delicate slender fingers tracing her stuffed stomach for fear of upsetting the writhing food baby within even more than she already had, \"I don't... think that I'll... ever be okay... again.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlack Star's face became critical and wise as he ventured closer and stood over Tsubaki, \"There there, let the Great Black Star show you how its done.\" he said softly, \"First, you take a deep breath, swallow, and let it loose; like so.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe apartment was filled with the sound of an ungodly belch. Tsubaki knew he was the champ amongst their small circle of friends; Kid finding it immature and Soul uncool, while Patti finding it quite amusing. She simply groaned, \"Black Star! That's disgusting!\" she grabbed the pillow from under her head and whined. \"Oh... my tummy hurts.\" She uncurled and lay flat on her back; giving Black Star a whole new meaning of the expletive \"damn\". There, sitting atop Tsubaki's normally smooth and rock-hard middle, was a flesh bubble filled with cement! \"Holy shit Tsubaki!\" Black Star exclaimed, \"Did you eat the whole box or somethin'?!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohh!!\" Tsubaki moaned again at Black Star's yelling, \"Black Star! Stop yelling so loud!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a little bit of silence, odd for this household...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry I couldn't get dinner ready...\" she said softly, removing the pillow and craning her neck to get a look at her partner, \"I really just didn't feel like eating after today.\" Black Star smiled gently, again a really rare occurence, \"Its cool, no big deal; I'll just heat up some ramen or something.\" he said rather quietly as he headed out the door, \"Need anything while I'm up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsubaki smiled, \"Nah. Go ahead and enjoy your ramen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe quietly closed the door and tiptoed back into their modest kitchen. Tsubaki couldn't help but think that he was starting to grow up a little, the way he handled her just now. Normally he would have rushed to help in his own idiotic way; just making things worse. It was kinda nice not to worry about him so much...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe let out the tiniest little belch; she had to admit, it felt good to alleviate some pressure. The stuffed Dark Arm giggled slightly and went to bed smiling....<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n...<br>\r\nHer opinions about Black Star would soon return to normal when she awoke to find a scorched-black kitchen and a non-functioning stove.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Back at Soul and Maka's humble apartment, morning soon came and passed, and the afternoon sky was settling in.  The chortling spikey ball of a sun was nearing its apex, emanating heat for all to enjoy.  Everyone, sans Soul and Maka, left once the rain let up, each of them having a great deal of fun like the group usually had in their meet-ups.  Soul awoke with a hearty yawn, which proceeded to the young teen sitting up in his bed and rubbing the tears out of his eyes.  After completely waking up, Soul felt like something was slightly off. Looking at his alarm clock which rested upon his bed nightstand, the blinking red lights read 1:00 PM.  Nearly jumping out of his bed by the digital sign, he began to slightly panic.  Soul was a chronic late sleeper and often slept till ridiculous times and today was proof of that.  It was Maka that would often wake him from his coma-like slumber and the fact that she didn't today worried him a great deal.  Still dressed in his sleep-ware, which consisted of a simple undershirt and his plaid boxers, he rushed out of his room to see if Maka was still alright.  Entering into the living room they shared, everything seemed normal except for the fact that it was slightly messy from the previous evening and that simple observation only served to worry Soul even more, as Maka was a bit of a clean freak and often keep the living space spotless.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'This doesn't look good.' thought the scythe-weapon to himself as he quickly went over to Maka's door and gave a few knocks to the wooden surface.  Past experiences on walking in Maka's room unannounced proved quite disastrous for his health, especially the times he entered whilst the petite girl was caught in her underwear.  That earned him 10 consecutive 'Maka-chops,' a new record for the girl then actually.  Hearing no response to his knocking, Soul cautiously and slowly opened the door, and the site inside both calmed his nerves, but raised a few new questions.  Inside the room was Maka lying on her bed, out of the covers and wearing her usual sleep-ware which consisted of a yellow button-up top and matching yellow pants.  Her hair was even loose and not placed into bun-style as Maka did every night before sleeping. Getting closer to the bed, Soul became relieved once he heard the calm breaths of the girl, a sign that she was simply sleeping soundly.    However, the white-haired boy saw a few things that were simply out of place.  First off, was that Maka seemed to have a thin layer or residue on her cute cheeks, and on closer look, consisted of jelly frosting and chocolate.  Looking further down her petite figure, he also noticed that her middle seemed a tad bit softer than usual.  Trying to see if anything else was amiss, a small blue box caught his eye.  Said object was clutched to Maka\u2019s left arm, which faced away from the door and that simple fact cause Soul to initially overlook it.   Just the sight of that damned packaged caused Soul\u2019s face to grimace.  Ever since Maka first went to that bakery, things had gotten weird among the group of friends.  Suddenly things clicked in Soul\u2019s mind, why the girls were acting so absent-minded, why the treats seemed to never run out, despite many of them being consumed with a rapid pace and Maka\u2019s lethargic attitude this very morning.<br>\r\n\u2018Of course, this all started with that bakery.   It\u2019s already the afternoon, so it should be open so I can go and check out the place.\u2019 rationalized Soul to himself as he quietly made his way to the wooden door.  One single word cause the weapon to freeze in his tracks and feel a cold rush going down his very spine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSoul?  What are you doing in my room?\u201d groggily asked the girl, as she was clearly awoken by her partner.  Feeling about a million excuses flying around in his mind, the normally cool-headed boy was at a loss of words.  All he could do was to turn around and look at Maka as she waited for a reason.  Looking at her expression, it wasn\u2019t one of anger, but simply one of curiosity.  He guessed that her mellow mood was attributed to either her recently awoken state, the treats she had been munching on since the night before, or any mixture of the two.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cS-soul?\u201d asked Maka once again, this time with a yawn and her \u2018noodle-like\u2019 arms rose in the air, unintentionally showing off her pale stomach,  which was padded with a small amount of flesh as Soul clearly noticed a bit earlier.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI-I was just checking up on you and seeing if you were alright, cause I woke up pretty late and you\u2019re the one that wakes me up all the time.  I just got worried.\u201d truthfully answered Soul.  He looked away from the girl, still clearly fearful of retaliation and a slight feeling of embarrassment.  He never did like to show this side of him to the small girl in front of him.  By doing this, Soul completely missed the soft and warm expression that grew on Maka\u2019s face.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, that\u2019s it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cD-Do you mind leaving so I can change.  I\u2019ll make you some breakfast after I get dressed, or lunch if it\u2019s as late as you said.\u201d said Maka with a giggle.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m already leaving, and don\u2019t waste time making me a meal, I got some errands to do.\u201d answered Soul as he already reached the door handle and opened it, his path clear in view.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n\u201cO-Oh.  Well, when are you coming home?  I\u2019ll make your favorite for dinner tonight.\u201d<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll be home in a few hours, and yeah, that sounds great.\u201d simply said the scythe as he closed the door to her room.  Maka watched, but felt cold all of a sudden when she heard that door close.  She didn\u2019t know why, but she had the strangest feeling of disappointment emanating from her midsection, a terrible hollow feeling.  Looking behind her, she found her box of foodstuffs that she had bought the other day.  Taking a donut from the already opened container, she just stared at it.  Examining the rounded treat at all angles, appreciating the texture, and the color of the frosting, it looked enticing for reasons that the blonde could not place.  She took a small bite, but this time was different.  This time there was no explosion of flavor, or a sense of euphoria.  It was empty, just as she felt at the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Soul\u2026\u2019<br>\r\n---<br>\r\nIt only took a few moments for the teen to properly clean himself up and get dressed.  Things were getting strange and he wanted to get to the bottom of this entire mess.  Grabbing his trademark leather black jacket, which matched well to his normal yellow shirt and dull red slacks, he made his way out of his apartment and into the streets of Death City.  As it was still the afternoon, the streets were hustling and bustling with many of the citizens of the domain of Shinigami, each with their destinations and agendas.  Soul paid no mind to them, as he had his own set of problems to deal with.  Walking on the bricked road, he recalled that Maka had claimed that she had bought her treats at a new bakery in the downtown district.  With his destination clear in mind, he simply kept going, down the long and winding road to the specialized district of Death City.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            ],
            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It didn't take long for Soul to reach the downtown district of the infamous Death City. As it was approaching dusk, the hustle and bustle of the citizens were at an all time high. Starting in the dead center of the district, the weapon did his best to recall the times that the bakery was mentioned during earlier conversations among Maka and Tsubaki. His thinking turning up bust, Soul did the next best thing and figured out to simply ask someone about the bakery. He scanned the park-like area he was stationed in, but aside from the passerby's, there was not anyone that looked to know the information that he needed. Closing his eyes, a frown grew on his face and he tried to think of what next to do. The downtown district was particularly large and wandering around aimlessly would lead to nothing getting done. He also couldn't use 'soul detect'; that whole schtick belonged to Maka. Feeling his anger getting the best of him, Soul chose to sit down on a nearby bench and cool his head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man, I shoulda at least brought Black* along with me. With him running around we coulda found the place in five minutes flat.\" he mused as the picture of his hyperactive friend running around like an idiot played in his mind. Of course the ninja would have been running around in the first place because he most likely forgot where the damned bakery was. Okay maybe that wouldn't have been the best of idea, but it was better than the weapon's current situation. 'Hm, maybe Death the Kid could help out. He knows Death City like the palm of his over reactive hand.'  Finding himself about to leave, a man suddenly sat down on a nearby bench. Soul gave a glance at his direction and he looked to be a bit strange. The man wore a plain black suit with matching tie, his head was shaven and he sported a pair of rather large glasses that obscured his eyes. If anything, the old man reminded him of Oxford down to a 't'. Turning away from the strange fellow, Soul heard someone calling out for a young man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me but you seem to be a little lost.\"  Soul looked at the man who seemed to have bit of a calm 'air' to him, someone who could be described as cool and collected. This unnerved Soul a bit. While he knew better than to speak to those that would cause such a reaction within himself, something told Soul that this man might be the answer to his most pressing problem. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah... I'm looking for this bakery my friend told me about. I need to pick up a few things from there but I lost the directions.\" lied Soul. He could talk and listen to this older man, but it didn't mean that he would trust him with his real goal.  The old man seemed to be in thought when he remained quiet for a few moments. His low voice speaking up, Soul listened to what he had to say,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, I've heard many things about that particular eatery as of late. I can assume it is quite popular as well. If you follow that street down two blocks, make a left and head down another block, you'll find it right on the right.\" A bit wary of the instruction, Soul thanked the old man and did as he said. If anything did happen, he was a weapon so he would be able to take care of himself, albeit not as well as if he was with his meister. 'What a weird coot. Though I've met weirder sad as it is to admit.' thought Soul, leaving the park. Ten minutes later, he found that the directions were indeed true and stood at the entrance to the bakery. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Gingerbread House huh? Alright time to get to business.' The silver haired youth entered, signified by the ringing of a bell. Looking around, it seemed to be rather quaint with few customers here and there. It was to be expected as the sun was setting and bakeries usually operated best in the morning. At the counter, there was someone with a rather annoyed expression on their face; their head propped up with a hand, and their eyes nearly shut. Soul could only assume that this was the owner. Getting a closer look, her long black hair was the first to be noticed by him. It was styled in such a way that a frontal fringe covered her forehead and it was straight as straight could be. The second was her rather fair skin, which appeared to be almost doll-like.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'The Hell? Is this girl really the owner?' With a youthful appearance, to claim to be an owner of a store such as this would be to claim something ridiculous.  Nonetheless, he needed some answers. He knocked loudly on the glass counter in an attempt to wake up the sleeping the sleeping woman. It took a few more angry knocks, but sure enough, the other one awoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh, wha-, oh a customer. What do you want?\" she said in an uncouth manner as this woman rose from her slouched position. Her face was rather thin and her blue eyes focused on the youth in front of her. For a few second, Soul found himself speechless at the sight of the owner due to how 'pretty' she was. The feeling quickly subsided as the youth knew that gawking at girls wasn't 'cool.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My friend talked to me about this place a few times now and I thought I'd check it out. I hear you've recently opened up shop here.\"  This woman eyed Soul up and down, it seemed that she found him a bit suspicious.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah that's right. I needed to get out of my old run down town because the people there were downright wet-blankets if you catch my drift. I'm guessing you friend is a girl?\" An innocent question, this was actually structured to steer the conversation in an unrelated direction. As Soul as attentive as he was 'cool' he easily caught on. The weapon decided to play her little 'game.' <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, she won't shut up about this place so I decided to surprise her with a little something. Where did you say you came from again?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't.\"  Soul feigned signs of surprise and quickly thought up a retort.  \"Oh my bad, I guess I misheard you.\"  Once again she found her eyes furrowing due to his words. What was his deal?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Its Salem. Salem, Massachusetts.\"  <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The woman behind counter stare at him for a second, and then it dawned on her. 'So that's the way you want to play it.' She though with a smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what does your girl friend like,\" she said with a faint smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She is not my girlfriend,\" Soul nearly shouted as he lost his calm and aloof. All the other customers looked up from their meals and stared at the rambunctious death scythe. He quickly regain his cool and scoffed. \"She's not my girlfriend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right, sure she is not,\" she said, her voice full of false mirth. \"So what does she like?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chocolate.\" He said lamely. \"So sale/\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe quickly cut from off. \"Chocolate, really that's the best you can come up with.\" She thought for a second before a glimmer shone in her eye. \"I think I know exactly what she 's like. I don't have one on hand but come back in a few days and I will it here for you. Be back in three days.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ya, sure. Thanks.\" He stopped for a moment as he turn to leave. \"I never caught your name?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Matilda. Yours?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Soul.\" He replied aloofly as he left the bakery.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~~~~~~~~<br>\r\n\"Maka, I'm home.\" Soul shouted as he shut the door behind him. The scent of grilled steak and curry wafted into his nose as he opened door. Soul smiled lightly to himself. \"Maka, you here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm in here, Soul.\" A feminine voice called from her bedroom. He walked into the homely room to find her lounging on her bed, reading a book. \"How'd the errands go. Oh, dinners on the table.\" She said looking up her book as she reached the box of goodie next to her and pulled out a chocolate, chocolate chip muffin. Soul grimaced as she took a bite of the rich dessert. Her stomach was taut and bloat and she had chocolate and glaze smeared across her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what did you do all day?\" He asked leaned against the door frame coolly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing really. Cleaned, cooked dinner and grabbed a book.\" She said happy at the fact that soul was taking a interest in her day. Maka put the book down next to her and sat up. It was a little harder than normal, which she frowned at. Her shirt rode up half way up her stuffed belly, revealing a large crescent of pale flesh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, maka.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ya, soul?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was about to mentioned his visit to the bakery, as she reached into the box and pulled out another donut. He then did something very unlike himself, he hesitated. If his suspicions were right then she freak out. He didn't want to send her into a panic and he knew he couldn't handle a super stress maka. So he voice the next best redirect. \"Sorry, I flaked on you today. We'll hang out tomorrow, promise.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka smiled as the empty feeling in her stomach was filled with butterflies. \"Id like that,\" At that moment, soul's stomach growled loudly. \"Now, go eat. Im kind of sleepy anyways.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, good night, maka.\" He said as he shut the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good night, soul.\" She whispered as she grabbed a cookie out of the box and picked her book and went back out reading.</span></div></div>",

She had become somewhat desensitized to her own belching in the last several days since BlackStar had helped her with her stomachache, but having him egg her on like that was just a bit too much for the poor girl. A smaller, quieter burp slipped out as she reached over to her box of pastries and pulled out a cookie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um... BlackStar... do you think I'fe pudd on shum weight...?\" She asked her meister through a mouth full of chocolate chips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? Don't worry 'bout it! You're still looking good!\" The energetic ninja grinned from ear to ear and gave her a thumbs up<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That... didn't answer my question...\" Tsubaki whispered as she looked down at herself. Her vision was obscured by her well-endowed chest, now even bigger and straining her shirt, her cleavage covered in crumbs and donut glaze. Past that, she could see her round belly, taut from fullness, pushing her shirt up past her navel, and resting in her lap. A lap that consisted of thicker thighs than it had before, that now rubbed together most of the time and were connected to wide hips that were snug in the sweatpants she was wearing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had been only a week or so since Tsubaki had received the pastries that had caused her to swell like this, and yet the Dark Blade hadn't quite made the connection between her sweet addiction and her current weight problem. She knew she'd been eating more than normal, but didn't realize just how much she had consumed. She probably wasn't more that a dozen or so pounds away from 200.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe I need to *urp* go on a diet...\" She grimaced. Just a week ago, the weapon would have been jumping onto a diet at the slightest sign of pudge on her trim figure, but now the idea was just so... unappealing. Not just because she'd have to give up the donuts and treats that she had become so fond of, but something else. She felt... cozy like this. Her big butt sitting wide on the couch, her soft belly and big boobs, even the slight weight added to her arms and face just felt nice. \"Or maybe I should just let it be and get fat...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsubaki leaned back into her chair and dozed off with smile on her face as she thought that.</span></div></div>",

Home of the Meisters and their weapons, of the great Shinigama-sama.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd to one trotting cat as she roved the streets in the middle of the day, oblivious to the laughing sun above her. What was perculiar was that this cat had a witches hat and donning a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I wonder what I should do today Nyah,' thought the cat to herself. This morning was a bit of the norm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe, Blair the Magical Cat Girl, woke up, teased one of her benefactors Soul Eater Evans, and Maka Albarn, her other benefactor, slammed a book on his head and probably giving the white haired teen a concussion. She had some tuna from the fridge and started off on her day as the duo of Meister and Weapon set off from Shibusen<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(AN: I am not using DWMA.

She cantered down the street and turned a few corners and she saw it. It was a bakery, and the scent was coming from inside the bakery, reading \"Suntime Pastries\". Blair smiled and trotted into the store.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe store was a bit populated, some customers inspecting some of the muffins and confectionaries, a young child begging their parent for a sugary treat and Blair hopped up onto the counter, ignoring the looks of people giving her and she hopped down behind the counter and trotted up the person at the cash register.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nyah.\" She mewed, getting the person's attention.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Startled, the red haired young man looked down towards the floor of the bakery in fear of a possible mouse. He never did like those nasty rodents. Much to his surprise it was a small black cat. Quickly ringing up the next customer, he bent down so his eyes could be level with the disguised cat. The young man smiled at Blair, gently stroking her furry back. He did find it odd that the cat was wearing an over sized hat Blair meowed cutely, doing her best to look cute in order to score some free food. Her human form wouldn't really work in a setting outside of a bar or host club, so she did what a smaller cute cat could do. Beg for food!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here there, do you want some milk?\" he said in a gentle voice in an attempt to not scare off the black cat. An animal running around could be bad for business after all. Letting a female employee handle the cash register, he gently picked up picked up Blair and brought her to the stock room. Opening up the fridge, he grabbed an open bottle of milk and poured some out into a saucer for the cute kitty.  Placing it on the floor, he happily watched Blair lap up the creamy substance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha, you're so cute kitty.\" gushed the man. This one was a sucker for anything cute, animals included.  Quickly, she finished the milk and gave a louder meow than before. While milk was delicious in its own right, she wanted pumpkin, the sweet smell still residing in her mind.  The red haired youth looked at her, trying to figure out what else this cat wanted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe you want some food?\"  After much confusion and some improvising from Blair, the young man finally understood that Blair wanted to eat some of the bakery's famous pumpkin pies. While he didn't know if it was alright to serve pie to a cat of all things, this little one seemed different to him. He was back handling the counter, allowing for his employees to restock the the front. He had been running this bakery for a few months now after one of his close relatives had gotten too ill to manage it. Making the move over to Death City was one of the more interesting things to happen in his life. He wasn't anyone special really, he couldn't handle weapons or knowledgeable in the study of souls. He simply loved to bake and make his customers happy. The young man smiled at Blair, sitting on top of the counter eating her pumpkin pie from a plate. The customers didn't seemed to mind and even petted the cat every now and then. A few hours later and the black cat had more than satisfied her craving for pumpkin. Giving off another cute meow, she jumped of the counter and said goodbye in a cat-like manner. The owner waved back, sad to see such a darling kitty leave. He was actually hoping to keep it but he figured it most likely had an owner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, excuse me Mr. Corey, do you mind if I go on my break now, I'm meeting with a friend here...\" said a girl in a shy tone. This young man had a habit of hiring girls that he found adorable, mostly for the atmosphere but also for admiration. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, but make sure to take a cake for you and your friend to share.\" he said, always making sure to see that his employees were happy working at the bakery.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no, I can't eat more cake. I'm on a diet you see, and my friend is someone close. I don't want to look like a slob in front of him.\" Bah, the girl was acting with such little self esteem that he had to do something. Placing a hand on her shoulder, he gave her a warm smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, if he likes you, he'll like you no matter what. Trust me I've been there.\" Smiling, her spirits were lifting and she grabbed a cake from the display and left the counter area. This owner smirked to himself, that particular employee often had troubles like that and he was always happy to help out in whatever way he could. His self-praise was cut short by a shout from the baking room.  A young man appeared from the doorway, a noticeable frown plastered on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yo boss, we got a problem with one of our ovens, hurry up and check it out.\"  Looks like his work was just starting.<br>\r\n---<br>\r\nBlair returned to the apartment that Maka and Blair shared. Still in cat form, she wanted to sleep of the tasty meal she had indulged in. Opening the door, she found Maka reading a book on the green couch, with an angry expression of sorts. Jumping on to the couch, she settled herself nicely and looked towards Maka.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's eating you sweetie?\" Maka angrily huffed and turned to the other direction, her eyes not leaving book she had been so enthralled as of late.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Its Soul isn't it? Man you two are playing your stupid game aren't you?\" Sighing with irritation the pigtailed girl threw a soft pillow at Blair, which blocked her vision. Shaking the pillow off, Blair went on her back preparing to take her nap. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know if you keep pushing like this, eventually he's going to get tired.\" said Blair, using the experience from her many years of life to aid Maka. She had seen romantic interactions like Maka's and Soul's many times in the past. Some of them end well while others not so much. Blair was one of those types who believed that everyone should be loved. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Be quiet.\" Choosing to follow Blair's lead, Maka dropped the book on the coffee table and found herself in a comfortable position. She was going to take a nap as well.  Feeling herself drifting off, an odd thought was placed into her mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Do I smell pumpkin?'</span></div></div>",

And something wisped past her nose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Huh, that smell is familiar\u2026\u2019 thought the cat to herself as she trotted into the kitchen, her nose high in the air.

Blair couldn\u2019t contain her meow of happiness and hopped up onto the table. The pig-tailed girl noticed the black cat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBlair. You\u2019re awake.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSomeone\u2019s observant.\u201d She plopped down in front of Maka, tail swishing as her eyes were on the piece of pumpkin cake, which the slice was already half-eaten. Maka noticed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou hungry?\u201d She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat nap worked up a small appetite. Sleeping burns calories you know, and I totally recognize THAT scent from anywhere!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou do?\u201d Blair nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYep. I was there today, well yesterday if it\u2019s past midnight. The owner of the place,\u201d Blair plopped down and laid on her side. \u201cWasn\u2019t exactly Adonis looking, but man not only is he a cutie patooty, he can bake!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka\u2019s eyes were raised up a bit. \u201cWow, I didn\u2019t know you stopped by my part time job Blair.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMeow?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh that\u2019s right I didn\u2019t tell you and Soul. With that no good dad of mine,\u201d Maka rolled her eyes. \u201cGoing to Vegas more recently with Stein and Marie I fear for the expenses so I got myself a job. Thankfully Lord Death seems to understand and has given me leave from Shibusen duties so that I can focus on getting enough income that whatever Spirit blows off we would have a safety net.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI see\u2026\u201d pondered Blair. \u201cWell you should be a bit more easier on your dad.\u201d She rolled onto her back. \u201cHe does love you very much you know.\u201d Maka simply gave a \u2018hmmph\u2019 and went back to eating the cake piece, only much faster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf he loved me he wouldn\u2019t dated twenty different women in under a month. Or split up from mom. Or be a total jerk towards Soul.\u201d Blair could only smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOne day you\u2019ll learn to forgive him. Trust me, holding grudges gives you wrinkles.\u201d Maka narrowed her eyes a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you saying I have wrinkles?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m just playin\u2019 with ya.\u201d Chuckled the cat. \u201cYou\u2019re as cute as ever Maka, and being mad at your dad will only make life bad for ya both. Give the guy a chance.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka sighed and returned back to eating the cake piece.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan I have some?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGet food of your own you nymphocat.\u201d Blair rolled her eyes and hopped off the table and towards the window sill. She opened the window.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFine. Leave the window cracked okay? I\u2019ll be home by dawn.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWill do. Be careful.\u201d And Blair hopped onto the fire escape, then the lower building\u2019s rooftop, then onto a trash-can, then onto the ground. And she trotted along the streets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe if I can find that cute baker\u2019s place I could get some food from him!\u201d</span></div></div>",

The walk itself was nice, the breeze was gentle and the air was cold. Blair found this to be one of better perks of being a sentient cat, being able to enjoy the simple things in life. And snacks were quite simple themselves as well.  With her nimble black cat form, it didn't take long for Blair to reach the store. However, as it was night time already, the bakery was understandably closed. Usually Blair would have been able to catch the owner cleaning up and get him to let her have some leftovers from the work day. This time, it looked like the owner headed home early. Sitting, the cat placed a paw to her chin and thought of what to do next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think he would mind if I sneaked in and did a little taste testing of my own.\" said the black cat to herself as she jumped towards the roof and used her magic to open up the window. Gracefully hoping in, she landed on the floor, and took a look of her surroundings. The chairs had been flipped on top of the various tables and the display case had been emptied out for the night. In a flash, the black cat changed into a young woman, with a black dress, shoulder length purple hair, yellow eyes and a matching black witch hat. In her human form, Blair made sure to show herself as a curvy young woman, mostly as it could help her get whatever she wanted from other humans. As there was nothing on the bakery floor, the cat had the idea of checking the kitchen to see if there was any pastries saved for the next day. Walking into the next room, Blair walked towards the fridge and a pleasant sight awaited her. Plenty of different pastries sat on the shelves of the fridge, such as cheesecakes, pumpkin pies, eclairs, essentially anything sweet and baked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh, don't mind if I help myself.\" said the witch cat in a sing song voice.\"<br>\r\n---<br>\r\nBack at their apartment, Maka was still eating her slice of pumpkin pie, savoring the sweet and spicy taste. Soon after, Soul entered, just returning from doing errands. Maka ignored her weapon, still peeved from their earlier spat. Walking over to her, he saw that she was enjoying the pastry. Of course, he couldn't help but crack a few jokes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, you do know that sweets go to your fat ankles right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmph, all the better to kick your scrawny ass with.\"</span></div></div>",

Like a laser guided missle, she was coming...coming to destroy him and feed his soul to her weapon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYes...he was all to familiar with that weapon of hers...a scythe as it was and just as deadly as the one Lord Death himself wielded.

This vagabond was no human, more like a monster of sorts, similar to the man with the magic eye...but lacking the rather handy power of immortality and the physical prowess of a werebeast. \"Shit.\" The one armed man cursed under his breath, jetting into an ally way only to see that it was a grave error to have chosen that path for what stood before him was a dead end...in both senses as it would be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sandfly...\" A feminine voice rang out behind him, the cornered man turning around to see no one else but Maka standing at the only avaliable exit her large scythe shining ominously in the moonlight. \"Nowhere to run, or hide.

Unfortunately for Sandfly...she was very effective at her job as a meister and was to demonstrate why or rather had already demonstrated given how he was missing an arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was nowhere to go, nowhere to give him salvation from the judgement her scythe would exact upon him. He was, as the youngersters would say 'boned'. Maka Albarn, as she was known to many on the streets of Death City, was a serious threat to both witches and monsters such as himself.

Which left them with a quandry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka woke up next to Soul in bed, and had been thinking about what to do with the human souls. She still had nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul woke up not long after and yawned. It was a fairly short discussion before Soul had an idea. \"Hey Maka. Women give birth to souls all the time, so why don't you just take them?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka looked at Soul a little shocked, she never really thought about that before. It was completely true, and she was a woman. Sure she'd try it. \"Ok Soul. Lets try it then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul went for the bag, it was decent sized and not heavy at all. Seemed like there were alot in there, he hoped Maka could do this for them. Soul took it back to Maka who had changed and was wearing only one of Soul's old button up shirts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok Soul, put them in and be gentle.\" Maka was still a little unsure, but it felt right to her, so she laid down and got ready for Soul to start.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul was presented with an astounding view of Maka with her legs spread and shaved, fully. But now was not the time for that, while Maka had more confidence now he saw no reason to give her a reason to call him a pervert, even though she liked it like that sometimes. Soul took out the first human soul and pressed it up against her. Maka's birth canal slowly stretching to accomodate the soul being introduced to her lower body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor Maka it was an experience she would never forget, the soul moved inside her in wonderful ways, and her partner was putting more in her and Maka was really starting to enjoy it.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Tch, don't get full of yourself...\" Sandfly muttered before he threw his defiant gaze at Maka, \"I was just leading you into a trap, and you fell for it!\" And just like that, he threw himself at his own death knell. They were always like this, thinking their final charge would be bold and brazen enough to push their efforts to result in a victory. It usually ended very badly and Maka was going to make sure it was the same with Sandfly. The blonde meister standing her ground and focusing her wavelength to resonate with that of her partner's. It had taken Maka a bit of time to master this technique, but now...she was ready to wield it well and slay this foe in one mighty slash. \"Soul Resonance!\" Maka declared loudly alongside Soul, the once ordinary scythe weapon transforming it's blade and stretching it into the shape of an immense cresent moon of pure, energized wavelength. With her weapon primed and ready, Maka met Sandfly's brazen charge with her own, her gloved hands gripping Soul tightly as she reeled the scythe back and swung it forward with all the might her arms could summon forth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a clean cut. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSandfly literally being cleaved in half from the waist and his still moving legs tumbling down to the ground below as his upper half continued forward past Maka's crouched form his eyes wide with horror at the realization that he had been cut in right in half by the meister he was doomed to face defeat against...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr so he wanted her to believe...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Sandfly's upper half flew past Maka's head, something strong grappled her around the neck, evoking a pained gasp from her lips as she felt Sandfly's body latch onto hers and his head looking her straight in the eye with an absolute crazed look radiating from the sunken in pupils of his damning eyes. \"You think you've won, you think all is well. You can kiss my insectoid ass, I'll see you in hell!\" Sandfly hissed maliciously in an almost bestial tone. Although she had cut him clean in half, Sandfly had somehow managed to hold on to just the right amount of life to pull one more trick...Maka's eyes swelled as Sandfly made a bee line for her clothing, the dying monster pulling up her yellow sweater vest to reveal her smooth tummy, flawless and some might even say perfect. With his gaze fixated on her belly, Sandfly opened his bloodied maw, the jaws in his mouth cracking out place with a sickening sound allowing his gullet to stretch to inhuman lengths. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot a second after his mouth stretched open, Sandfly's tongue slithered out and immedieatly shot toward the exposed area of Maka's stomach. In a split second, the slimy appendage jammed itself into the exposed lower abdomen of his victim. The minute the writhing muscle made contact with her flesh, Maka's nerves screamed to her in anguish as they they registered something piercing her skin like a syringe and invading her insides. Although she knew not of what Sandfly was trying to do, it didn't take rocket science for Maka to know that this was bad for her no matter what he was doing. \"Ngh, get off me!\" Maka protested, beating Sandfly across the back of his head with the blunt end of her scythe, Sandfly responding only by securing his grip onto her so he wouldn't fall of of her. Soul immedieatly showed concern for his partner's well being and set to help her out by giving her a common suggestion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oi, Maka!\" Soul spoke up, \"Shake him off!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh...I'm trying!\" Maka complained once more, her palm lodged onto Sandfly's face as she pushed it up only to see his tounge still embded ithin her. Thinking quickly, Maka shoved Sandfly's head back and placed Soul in front of his face. With something between her and Sandfly, Maka gave one big push and began the process of removing him from her body. As the meister pushed Sandfly off her, she could feel something slithering underneath her flesh, poking around insider her body for whatever it was it searched for within her. It was this disgusting sensation of being invaded that proved to be the driving force for the meister to tear Sandfly from her stomach. \"Haaaah!\" Maka screamed out, summoining up a burst of strength and managing to give Sandfly a hard enough shove to dislodge him from her body and sent his upper half tumbling to the concrete below, his elongated tounge popping out from her stomach to reveal a wriggling tendril about the size of a pin writhing about from the split tip of Sandfly's tounge. The slimy, worm-like append age writhed about in midair before it gave up it's ability to move and plopped hopelessly on the ground along side it's master.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSandfly merely gave up his struggle the very second he hit the pavement, his body having produced a sickening splat sound on the asphalt as blood pooled from the severed area of his body before a red soul rose from the mutilated remains. With the job done, Maka held out her scythe who's blade took on the form of a young white haired man with sharp teeth and a generally lazy look on his face. Soul grabbed onto the red soul and dangled it over his mouth before sucking it down his mouth and fully consuming it. With Sandfly gone, Soul then turned to Maka who looked spooked from the last ditch assualt of her opponent. \"You okay, Maka?\" He asked to her, the meister looking to Soul for a moment thinking of the proper answer that needed to be said here... </span></div></div>",

Yeah, there was the fact that she was sorta violated by some insect man's tongue but, all in all, Maka didn't feel any negative effects from the last ditch assault of Sandfly and a quick rub against her flat tummy didn't reveal anything wrong either; no puncture wounds, blood or annoyingly itchy bug bite. It looked like Sandfly's last attack was nothing short of a complete dud, something Maka found somewhat amusing given how ominous he was acting during the entire ordeal. \"Yeah, I'm alright, Soul.\" Maka replied to her partner, driving her point home with a faint smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, if you say so,\" Soul shrugged, apart of him not exactly buying Maka's response as true. \"Just thought I'd ask seein' as to how you had that guy's tongue stuck in you for a while.\" Soul paused for a moment, his words managing to paint a rather disturbing image within his mind involving Maka and Sandfly's tongue which was...rather elongated and flexible. The thick, slimy appendage was slithering across Maka's nude form and was doing an excellent job of pleasuring Maka between her spread legs as she moaned in a rising ecstasy. Needless to say, Soul wasn't exactly sure if he liked this mental image or if he should get something checked out up stairs. Whichever it might have been, it certainly was something he himself questioned the integrity of...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka, of course, was still very close to Soul and thus could see the expression plastered on her partner's face. She knew what this face meant...it was one Soul took on when thinking of something less than moral. \"...Soul,\" Maka spoke up, her voice awakening Soul from the question of if he wanted to keep dreaming about the previous image his mind was preoccupied with earlier. \"You're not thinking of anything dirty are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way...cool guys don't think of dirty images about tentacle like tongues.\" Soul replied, his words being clear evidence that he was attempting to avoid a situation that would, inevitably, lead to a devastating head injury brought on by Maka's trademark '<i>Maka Chop</i>'. With his mind attempting to flush the dirty image down the mental toilet, Soul turned to the messy remains of Sandfly, his upper body now nothing more than a dried puddle of, what Soul thought was, blood. Of all the evil humans he's sliced through he never once saw one die in the fashion Sandfly did. Was it of any signifigance? It didn't seem like it...at least not to Maka who was motioning Soul to follow her out of the dreary ally way they stood within.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe everything was fine, after all, Maka didn't seem to show any immedieate effects both in a physical and mental standpoint. However, only time will be the judge on if the meister...was actually fine, or not...</span></div></div>",

The nighttime air was warm and pleasant, the streets were quiet with no people around, and the moon stood high in the sky smiling it's creepy smile. Then the peace was disturbed when a young girl named Sarah came running down the streets. Sarah was 15 years old and stood about 5\"4, she had short brown hair and blue eyes. She was wearing a white sleeveless shirt, red short skirt, and sandals. She kept looking behind her to see if she had lost the one chasing her. When she was sure she did she ran into an alley and hid behind a dumpster to catch her breath. Sarah thought about how she got into this situation only minutes ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was walking home at night when she heard a scream, curious Sarah headed towards the source. When Sarah got there she almost scream herself, but she managed to put her hands over her mouth just in time. What she saw, was a skinny pink haired boy around her age wearing a black dress standing over a woman's corpse. She started to back away slowly, but she tripped and fell. She quickly looked up to see if he noticed, he did. In fact he was now standing right over her. He stared at her with a blank face, making impossible to tell what he was thinking. \"Hi.\" he said with no emotion whatsoever. And the second he said that Sarah sprang to her feet and ran off. He stared in the direction she went and said seemingly to no one. \"Medusa-sama can I go eat her, I haven't eaten anyone all day?\" A voice rang through his head saying \"Yes Crona enjoy your meal and we will be done for tonight.\" He smiled wide in an insane manner. \"Thank you Medusa-sama.\" and soon gave chase.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Sarah caught her breath she checked to see if she had lost him. Seeing nobody, Sarah decided to head out. No more than two steps from her hiding place she bumped into someone. And sure enough that someone happened to be Crona. Before she could run Crona grabbed her and pulled her close. Then he licked her across the face, but what really disturbed her was the fact that his tongue was 6 inches long. (Yes I'm making Crona's 6 inches long, hope you don't mind.) \"Mmm you taste good.\" Crona said in a very creepy tone. Sarah was terrified, wondering what this psychopath was going to do to her. \"Well, time to Eat\" Crona smiled evilly. Sarah had no time to react before Crona shoved her head into his mouth. He licked her face all over before he took a big swallow. Sarah screamed in his throat making him chuckle. Another swallow and Sarah's shoulders into Crona's mouth. Not liking the taste of her clothes he tried to hurry it up so he would be nice and full. Next he swallowed her breasts and quickly moved on to her stomach. Then Crona lifted Sarah off the ground over his head, letting gravity lend a hand. Meanwhile Sarah had just entered Crona's stomach and scream as loud as she could, but only Crona could hear her muffled cries and he couldn't care less. So he swallowed again taking in her thighs once again getting to taste her delicious flesh. He licked and tasted her legs until all that was left of Sarah was her feet. Crona took off her sandals and tossed them into a nearby garbage can like it was nothing. Slowly taking in her feet Crona savored her flavor and swallowed. Crona's stomach swelled as the last of Sarah was deposited into it. Crona was in bliss his dress stretched outward threatening to rip but luckily it didn't. It was then Ragnarok decided to pop out. \"Enjoy your meal?\" He asked, Crona sighed happily. \"Yes\" Hes said still in bliss, quikly snapped out of it when Ragnarok whacked him over the head. \"WELL THEN LETS GO STUPID!\" Crona rubbed hi head \"Okay lets go.\" With that Crona walked off rubbing his still moving gut. \"Tonight was a good night.\"</span></div></div>",

This made verything easy for Medusa, who began to swallow. She didn't even try to taste her meal. Swallow after swallow Eruka started to disseappar.

So please stay to this way of expansion. Thank you.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a bright saturday around 2 p.m., when Maka walked home. She came from the bookstore, in which she bought a new schoolbook and one of the first copies of her favorite on going novel. Suddenly her stomach growled loudly for food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn it. I shouldn't have left so early without breakfast. I feel like I could eat a cow.\" she said to herself while rubbing her stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a half hour she arrived at home, but she couldn't smell anything cooked. Which was strange, because Soul should cook today after their last dispute over it, who cooks when. As Maka walked into the kitchen, she saw, that it was completly clear and nothing looked like, if somebody made lunch in here. She went into the living room to put down her bag with her books, but as she walked in, Maka saw Blair laying on the couch. Blair only wore a bikini, which showed much skin. Blair smiled, when she saw Maka.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi Maka! How are ya?\", Blair greeted Maka.<br>\r\n\"Hi Blair. I feel good, but also hungry. By the way where is Soul? He was supposed to make lunch today.\", Maka answered.<br>\r\n\"Oh, He is lying in the bed. I think, my outfit was too much for him.\" purred Blair as answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon Maka heard this, she became angry at the cat for Blairs actions. But her dark thoughts were interupted by her growling stomach. Maka looked at her stomach and back at Blair aigan. But somehow Blair suddenly looked very delicious with those plump thights, round ass and big breasts. Maka tried to fight the idea about eating one of her friends even thou she hated Blair. However this inner battle was won by her growing hunger for food. She got an idea, how to eat Blair without noticing it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Blair. Shall I give you a neck massage?\", Maka asked with a faked smile.<br>\r\n\"Sure, you can. How nice of you.\", Blair happyli replied without knowing her destiny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka walked to the end of the couch, where Blairs upper body was. Blair changed her position now lying with her back up against  the sofa arm. Maka kneeled behind Blair and start rubbing Blair. While Maka was massaging Blair, Maka opened her mouth as wide as possible. For her confusment her jaw had stretch enough, that Blairs head would fit in. But Maka didn't let herself interupted by this and used the moment of suspense. She quickly wraped her mouth around Blairs head. Blair shortly started to struggle against being eaten by her friend. Maka grabed the arms of her victim and pined them down, so that Blair couldn't use them. After that Maka started to swallow Blair up, which went easier than expected by her. After four swallows Maka reached Blairs boobs. With the fifth swallow Blair chest was in her mouth, while the head of Blair created a big bulge in Makas throat. To Makas surprise her tong was long enough to taste those meatbums. The taste was unbelievable good, so Maka licked for a minute to enjoy the great taste of her meal. But she shortly returned to swallowing, because Maka wanted to know of the butt of a cat tastes. After four more swallows Blairs butt was in her mouth, which had the same great taste like the tits. For three minutes she just licked Blairs butt for the great flavour. However Maka knew she had to finish her prey of before Soul wakes up or somebody comes in. So she tilted her head back and let the legs slide in. With one more swallow Blair finally was completly in Makas belly and took a curled up position up. Maka burped loud and long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me.\"Maka said.<br>\r\n\"Why did you ate me, Maka?\" Blair asked in a sad voice.<br>\r\n\"Well lunch, I was hungry and you got between my meal.\" was the reply of Maka.<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry for kno... Did you just called me lunch?\" Blair asked in panic.<br>\r\nMaka patted her belly, which looked like she was pregnant with twins in the eight month and said: \" Well food goes into the belly and it is lunchtime, so you are my meal. Understood?\"<br>\r\n\"But I though, we were friends?\", Blair asked, but quickly added: \"Why is my skin tingle?\"<br>\r\n\"Yes, we were friends,\" Maka answered with special focus on \"were\", \"but now your just food in my belly, which started to digest its content. It was nice knowing you. Goodbye Blair.\"<br>\r\n\"Maka please, don't do this to me. I do anything for you. ANYTHING!\" Blair begged, but it falled on deaf ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTired from her heavy meal, Maka rose up and went into her room and laid down on her bed. She listened to the churns of her stomach and soon slept away, while Blair cried silently in her grave, which was Makas belly.<br>\r\nAfter three hours Maka was woken up by the call of nature, but she still felt heavier, however not as much with Blair alive in her belly. She would investigate it after the rest of Blair was out of her system. So she rose up and went to the bathroom. After 15 minutes she was finished and looked at th content of the toilet. The only things being not digested were the bikini and some hair. \"Sorry Blair, but this will be your grave.\", Maka silent said. She flushed and looked at herself to see, why she was so heavy. Makas eyes met two large bumps on her chest. Then Maka looked at her behind and was greeted with a juicy ass and wider hips, however they didn't grow as much her chest. \"Thanks Blair for those great treats. They will be put to gut use.\" She then looked for measure tape to see, how big she got. After measuring  she knew now, that her chest were small E-Cups.<br>\r\n\"Quite nice, but a bit more wouldnt be bad?\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A young brown-haired woman dressed in a white sleeveless shirt, red knee length skirt, and sandals ran down an alleyway. She quickly hid behind a dumpster to catch her breath. The she slowly poked her head out to see if her pursuer was still chasing her. Sure enough there he/she was, a skinny, pink-haired boy/girl. Sword in hand he/she looked around for her. 'Good Crona you've got her running straight towards me, she looks so delicious.' Medusa's voice echoed through Crona's head\"Your welcome Medusa-sama.\" Crona said aloud Crona quickly spotted the woman. When she found out she had been spotted, the woman ran further into the alley. 'Excellent Crona keep herding her towards me and be ready to block her escape.' Crona was about to do when Medusa \"spoke\" to him/her again. 'And if you do a good job, maybe we'll get you a treat to.' Crona looked shock for a moment, then gave a slight smile. Medusa never let him/her eat someone with her, she was being really generous tonight. \"Thank you Medusa-sama.\" Crona said, before chasing after the woman and soon to be meal for his/her mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMedusa stood at the dead end of the alley waiting for her meal to come. Since she was a snake witch she could swallow a full grown human whole. She loved this ability so much she made people her regular diet. Unfortunately for her, humans turned out to be very fattening. Her current appearance result of that. She had a huge belly with multiple love handles that stuck nearly two feet out and went down to mid thigh. Her arms and leg where a foot thick each, her breasts were an E-cup in size. Her attire was clothing almost the same as when she was thin ,but now it was made out of a more stretchable material to contain all her fat. Yet even with stretchable material she for some reason made it a two piece so it showed her huge belly. She did not know why she made it that way but she just did so that was that. She also had a bit of a double chin underneath her plump face, which now had an evil grin on it. \"Right abooouuut, NOW!\" Sure enough the woman ran around the corner and straight into Medusa's enormous gut, causing her to fall flat on her ass and it to wobble around for a few seconds. \"I'm sorry, but could you help me?! Some maniac is chasing m-\" When the woman saw Medusa all color left her. Seeing Medusa's large and imposing figure terrified the woman. To make things worse Crona then came around the corner blocking the only exit. Both Medusa and the woman looked at him/her. \"Good job Crona, you did very well. Now then...\" Medusa bent down and pinned the woman's shoulders to her sides and lifted her up to her feet. \"Time to eat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMedusa unhinged her jaw and slowly brought it over the woman's head. When the whole head was in her mouth Medusa licked and tasted the woman all over. Once she was done she swallowed. It was then she realized something. Quickly Medusa released the woman's arms then grabbed both her wrists with her right hand. With her free hand Medusa ripped off the woman's shirt and then her bra, revealing her C-cup size breasts. Then Medusa pinned the woman's arms to her sides once more. Slipping the woman's shoulders into her mouth Medusa swallowed again, bringing the woman's breasts into her mouth. She played with them with her tongue for a bit causing moans to come from inside her. When her stomach growled for it's food, Medusa swallowed again. The woman was now halfway inside Medusa and thinking about her current situation. First Some psycho killed both her friends, then chased her down this alley, and now she was being stripped and eaten by some fat witch. Medusa tasted her meal again, but she was mostly just hungry so she pulled the woman's skirt and panties all the way off taking her sandals in the process. Medusa grabbed her butt shoved it into her mouth, then she grabbed her legs and swallowed them down until only her feet were left. Slowly Medusa pushed them in and gave a final swallow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMedusa's stomach grew twice its size and went down a little over her knees. Medusa gave a pleasant sigh as she enjoyed the feeling of her meal squirm around inside her. She looked at Crona and saw that Ragnarok had come out when she was eating. \"Crona would you kindly dispose of those tasteless  garments.\" Medusa said before she began rubbing her prey filled belly. \"Yes Medusa-sama.\" Crona picked up the discarded clothing then thew them into a nearby garbage can. Crona turned and saw Medusa still tending to her belly \"Man, she must love really eating people if she does this all the time.\" Ragnarok said to Crona. \"Ragnarok don't say it like that you'll get us in trouble\" Crona said looking to see if Medusa heard them, she didn't. Ragnarok growled then thwacked Crona on the head \"Shut up bitch! You're not the boss of me!\" He roared before morphing back into Crona's body. Crona gripped his/her skull painfully and looked up, that unfortunately caught Medusa's attention. Medusa flicked her hood up and turned. \"Come Crona we're leaving.\" Medusa said as she stared to walk away. \"But what about my treat?!\" Crona blurted out then covered his/her mouth. Medusa turned around sharply glared at Crona. She looked as if she were inflict some sort of punishment, but right then her meal struggled harder and started to scream as the digestive process began. This sent Medusa back into her blissful almost orgasmic state. She looked down at her belly and stroked it tenderly again. ''Sure, why not? Come Crona, lets get you someone to eat.\" Medusa purred as she turned again, this time she held her belly up with her flabby arms so as to feel it wobble around more closely. Crona stood there still stiff from fear then it melted and he/she smiled. \"Yes Medusa-sama.\" He/she said before following Medusa anxious for his/her treat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Okay, before we go any further we need to give Crona a gender. So which is it boy or girl?)</span></div></div>",

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\"><b>General Overview</b><br>\r\n-Generally speaking, Soul Eater is a series that focuses on meister and his or her partner, known as a Weapon, as they work under Shinigami-sama (or Lord Death) to hunt the souls of evil folk to prevent the creation of another Kishin (the first being something that definately doesn't need to be created a second time), souls hunted by the meister are then eaten by their weapon. Once a weapon has consumed 99 souls and the soul of a witch, then that weapon becomes a Deathscythe. The series has 3 main characters but, many more have surfaced over the course of the series.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Characters</b><br>\r\n<a class=\"blue2roll\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://souleater.wikia.com/wiki/Characters\" target=\"_blank\">http://souleater.wikia.com/wiki/Characters</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeep in mind that there's really no need to use all the characters present on that page, but you're welcome to introduce them as you see fit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>What to expect/look for</b><br>\r\n-As with many of my interactives; be aware of the content rating, put forth and honest effort in the chapters you post, and try to keep any canon characters used in your stories...well, in-character when at all possible. I'll be dividing this up in the same fashion as my other 3 interactives so everyone can have their shot at creating a story with their favorite fetish as the focus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Like many of it's kind, this interactive will only be focusing on bloating up the female characters of Soul Eater. It's only a minor detail, but I ask that you keep this in mind if you ever think about adding on to this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, unique to only this interactive is the potential for \"Soul Vore\" which is essentially consuming the soul of a person. Soul Vore is quite common in Soul Eater (if it's name wasn't proof enough), so having I thought it was only natural to include it within this interactive as a pursuable route for folks to weave a story behind. This being said, it would be rather interesting to see weight gain applied in combination to soul vore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStandard rules apply...<br>\r\n- Only female characters are to expand. Although this doesn't exclude male characters from appearing at all in the interactive.<br>\r\n- Please put forth effort in your chapters.<br>\r\n- Nothing completely outlandish in regards of expansion.<br>\r\n- Let's try the overly gross situations such as toilet stuff and the like. Burps are fine, but nothing past that please.<br>\r\n- This is an 18+ interactive so sexual situations are allowed, just...try not to go overboard with them. Use in moderation, basically and try not to have the story revolve too much around it.</td>",
