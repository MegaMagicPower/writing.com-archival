Liana, suck my dick.\" The doctor lowers his pants, exposing his cock. Liana kneels between his legs and takes it, working Dr. Evans to an orgasm. \"Now swallow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiana steps back, \"Why did I do that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Part of the medicine I gave you made you extremely susceptible to suggestion, now my cum will react with the medicine to make you permanently obedient to my commands. Now get undressed.\" Liana did as she was told and bared her gorgeous body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Evans then opened a drawer, \"Take these clothes, and put them on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiana walks over and begins, she starts with her lacy black panties and bra, then she pulls on her garter belt and attaches it to her stockings. She then pull on her short white petticoats, and finally her dress. It is a short black dress with white lace fringes and a deep scoop neckline. Once she is done getting done, she asks, \"Why are you making me do this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For a variety of reasons, first and foremost, because you thought me to be weak and I had to prove otherwise. But I also enjoy it. Now here are your accessories.\" He opens a drawer containing 3\" black latching stiletto heels, a black silk choker with a white lace flower, a black headband with a lace ridge, and a feather duster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiana just stands still, \"Alright, I'll do it the hard way, put them on.\" Liana then complies. \"If you do what I want, I won't have to take your control of your body. Now let's go see your bruisers.\"</span></div></div>",

The light shines of there muscled bodies, another reminder of how important this is to the good Drs plan. Both of the heavies strip her her and waste little time entering her on both sides as she moans heavily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow the good Dr plan would come into the fray. The big man who was getting sucked off was already taken care of as the chemical reaction that was given off whilst he cummed in Lianas mouth would spread to the man she is blowing and he even seemed lost already he was taken care of and would likely do whatever the Dr would say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other guy though was the problem the formula wouldnt affect this one, so he has to find another way to take this huge guy down... Luckily he already has something in mind and picks up a needle with a blue substance in it and casually walked up to the mountain of a man and thankfully he had stripped naked, the mountain had just cummed in Lianas ass and was closing his eyes on a cum down, Dr Andrews quickly took his chance and Jabbed him in the ass with it and pushed as quickly as he could... \"arhhhh you fucking little asswipe..  wait what did you do?.\"  With that the mountain of a man shrank down to 2 inches. The man looks up unfortunately to see the Dr staring down at him his habd reaching out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr Andrews looks at the Guy getting blown and he has no reaction to his friend disappearing. At this point Dr Andrews knows he has won and picks up the tiny goon. \"your boss is my bitch and im gonna take all his... or should i say her money, your friend is my slave as he holds the tiny man up and he begs his friend to help him and the horror as he realises the Dr speaks truth as his friends reaction is blank. He is just enjoying his blowjob and cannot react to anything else unless Dr Andrews compless him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You my little friend belong to me now and he rubs the tiny man against Lianas Ass and is rubbed against his own cum getting in the little mans eyes, hair and mouth. The man couldnt believe it he was covered head to toe in his own seed as the doctor laughted manically. \" Now now little man for that asswipe comment turn about is fair play\" he strips out of his clothes and brings him around to his ass and pushes him right up there and feels the tension and pleasure as the guy sqirms in his ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Dr smiles and enters Liana from behind and fucks her hard and long easily slipping in with the goon whom is currently stuck up his ass cum is already making it more pleasurable and easier to entre Liana and he cums hard inside of her. In the cum down he has the body guard serve as his right hand and the other one remains where he is as a pleasurable reminder to the good Dr that he can achieve anything and Liana transfers the mobs ritches to Dr Andrews and he lives a life of luxary with money, power and if anyone ever got in his way... he could always use more... urm staff to help him out.<br>\r\n   </span></div></div>",

Utilizing his own unique style of reality-altering magic and science, the physician has found a way to turn any of his free patients into wealthy clients. Through a simple syringe, he can get a secretary. With a puny pill, he can get a Playboy Bunny. A brief use of oxygen could get him an heiress. It doesn't matter of the patient's age or gender, he could have them become whatever he wants, although he does prefer female clients...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat shall follow is a barrage of TG sequences of all kinds.
