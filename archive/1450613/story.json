Although Kirby only had the very basic needs, food and sleep, he soon yearned to journey off to new worlds.  So, he set off on his adventure, but he had some failed attempts doing so.  His Warp Star crashed the other day and Kirby tried to use primitive ways to get off the ground.  He tried a catapult, a slingshot, being thrown by a huge monster; he tried a lot of things.  He even tried to jump aboard a NASA rocket, but it crashed and Kirby was sent flying.  Kirby had almost given up, when he found a little gem on the ground.  He picked it up and he joyfully put it on himself.  The gem then glowed a blue color and Kirby was instantly transported else where.  Meta Knight showed up soon after and wondered where Kirby got off to...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCloud was sitting under a tree, thinking to himself.  He had some problems lately that concerned him a lot, so he secluded himself from his friends.  As Cloud got up to leave, a blue spark came out of nowhere and a pink ball appeared.  Cloud, thinking that it was a monster, prepared to attack it.  Kirby, being as light as he was, bounced high and Cloud missed.  Kirby soon saw Cloud and he said, \"Hi!\"<br>\r\nCloud hesitated after it said that, and he lowered his Buster Sword.  He asked, \"What are you?\"<br>\r\nKirby looked confused and walked closer to Cloud.  Cloud raised his sword and Kirby stopped.  Poor Kirby hadn't known that this world the only normal creatures are humans; anything else was a monster.  Soon a girl with black girl came and she was looking for Cloud.<br>\r\n\"Hey Cloud!  Where are you?\"  she called out and she found Cloud with Kirby.  She asked, \"Who's that?\"<br>\r\nCloud answered, \"That's a monster.  It appeared out of nowhere.\"<br>\r\nTifa said, \"No it's not.  That's the cutest thing I've seen!\"  She ran towards Kirby and hugged him tightly.  \"What's your name, you cute little thing?\"<br>\r\nKirby could only answer, \"Kirby!\" as he could only speak a few things.<br>\r\nCloud struck the ground with his sword and he walked away.  Tifa tried to stop him, but she knew him more than anyone else.  She looked at Kirby and asked him, \"What do you want to do Kirby?\"</span></div></div>",

Kirby inhales all of his food and wants more as Tifa and Barret look at Kirby as though he ate a human whole.  They give some more and he wants some more.  Barret complains and says, \"He's like a stinkin' blackhole!  Can't take this foo'!\"  as Mr. T bursts in and beats the crud out of him (the two look alike).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTifa says, \"Sorry Kirby, but if we give you any more, we'd be run out of a job!\"  Kirby looks down in disappoinment and he gets up and waves for Tifa.  \"You want to go out?  Ok.\"  said Tifa, as they leave the two muscle heads fight it out.  Tifa and Kirby run into Aeris, the flower girl, saying that Cloud is fighting some monsters.  They run after Cloud and they find them fighting huge monsters, like a giant house and some imp things.  Cloud looked like he was badly hurt, so the two girls took care of Cloud as Kirby attack the monsters.  He inhaled them all and Kirby obtained Lightning ablities.  The others look at Kirby in shock.  Kirby looks at them with a smile on his face, happy about his victory.  He went towards them and jumped into Tifa's arms.  She looked at him, not knowing what to say, and the group walked back to Barret's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe group finds (a rather badly injured) Barret and they decide to leave Midgar, the place they were in, to find Shinra, an evil organization harming the world.  Kirby agrees to come along in their journey, so they headed off towards the company.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlong the way, the meet some new people, such as Yuffie the ninja, Red XIII, Cait Sith, a robotic cat, Cid, a airplane rider, and Vincent.  With their new member Kirby, the team was unstoppable, for the most part.  That is, until one fateful day...</span></div></div>",

He enjoyed his time in Bravo, for the little time he joined the team.  He experimented with the guns, but that ended badly, as he shot everything he could see except his target.  He inhaled Rebecca Chambers and ate her, only to have her come back and he obtained the skills of healing and shooting extremely accurate shots.  He was happy for those days, as for Rebecca, not so much as she was the victim everytime he needed the powers.  One day...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWesker told the Bravo team that there's been an escaped fugitive named Billy Coen and he was to be executed for murdering 23 people.  Everyone headed out to the helicopter and they caught up to the train that was carrying Billy.  Rebecca and Kirby headed out towards the train, as the rest of the team headed out towards the forest.  Kirby and Becca entered the train to find Billy as they noticed that no one on the train seems to be moving... or breathing.  They kept on walking as Becca examined one person.  She asked them if they could help them, when she saw that they were dead.  The two moved on when they heard someone getting up.  They looked back, expecting Billy, only to found out that it was the dead person they found before.  He was not dead after all.  No, he was more or less back from the dead and he chased towards Becca, only to get shot by her and pushed away.  Soon the dead were coming back to life and they were hungry.<br>\r\n\"Kirby!  What do we do?!\"  screamed out Rebecca.  Kirby looked around to figure out what their options were.  They could jump out the train, kill them all, or run towards the door and continue from there.

As they head up, they run into what looks like parasites or leeches.  There are hundreds of them, and Kirby tries to eat them, but this is the one food that he can't stomach down, and he spits them out.  Rebecca tries to give Kirby some cover, but the leeches start to form together into a human leech and it lunges out towards them.  Rebecca defends herself as a stray bullet comes from behind them and makes the leechman splatter onto her and Kirby.  Kirby jumps up and down joyfully that someone saved them, as Rebecca tries to recover.<br>\r\nRebecca asked the man, \"You're... Billy Coen, Ex-Marines officer, aren't you?\"<br>\r\nHe responds, \"Well, you're right.  What of it?\"  \"You're under arrest for murdering 23 people.\"  Responded Rebecca, but what Billy said next stunned her a little, \"Princess, in the situation we're in, that doesn't matter.  Besides, I didn't kill them anyways.\"<br>\r\nRebecca looked at Kirby and said, \"Then who did then?\"  Billy pointed back towards the undead coming towards them, as he shot them down.  \"And they're not alone.  Our only choice to survive is to team up.  So what's it going to be?\"<br>\r\nRebecca was hesitant at first, but she looked at Kirby, who nodded at her, and they decided to team up, for now.<br>\r\nThe three decided that the only way to get past all these... zombies was to get off the train.  Before they could do that, the train was set into motion and the trained speeded off.  They painced and they had to figure out how to stop the train to get off.  Along the way, the continued to fight off zombies, zombie dogs, leeches, and Rebecca's team mate Edward, now part of the undead.  She had to stop him, and she took him out.  They continued until they got to a certain part of the train.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey got close to the control room until a large crash was heard ontop the train.  The three proceded with caution until a large scorpion came crashing through and attacked them.  Kirby jumped in to distract it long enough for the others to attack it.  It threw Kirby off and it went off to attack the other two.  Kirby didn't have a lot of time to think.  What does he do?  </span></div></div>",

While Kirby enjoyed his meal, Rebecca and Billy recovered from the encounter.  Once Kirby was done, they continued into the control room of the train.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they entered the room, they saw that the train was going to run into a mansion.  Billy tried to stop the train, but there were two control panels; one in the room, and one on the other side of the train.  A timer appears saying that they only have a few minutes to stop the train before it hits the mansion.  Billy goes off to the panel on the other side of the train while Kirby and Rebecca stay at the control room and wait til Billy gets over there.  Billy finally got there and he contacted Becca on their communicators.  Becca gave Billy instructions on the buttons to stop the train.  At first it failed, but Kirby was giving the instuctions upside down.  Becca gave them again, and the train stopped in a few minutes.  Billy ran back to the control room and was relieved to find the train stopping, but they looked at the window of the train to see that the train was still going to crash, just not at full collision.  They embraced for the impact and the train crashed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three came to after a little bit.  The train crashed, but it didn't explode, yet.  They got off and headed found themselves in some sewers.  There were also zombies here.  Kirby started to shoot them and chase them off, while the other two tried to make of what was happening.  Becca pointed to a corridor leading out of the sewers and Kirby came running past them, pointing at the zombies chasing after him.  They ran after him, shooting the zombies close by.  They find some stairs in the sewers and they climbed out to find themselves in a mansion.  Kirby was looking around, amazed at the mansion, as Billy and Rebecca took some time to rest a little.  Kirby stumbled upon an unusual door that was different from the others, save the two double doors, and he opened it.  Kirby saw what was it there and closed right away.  <br>\r\nBecca asked him, \"What did you find?\"<br>\r\nKirby said what he could, \"You... don't... want... to... know...\"<br>\r\nBilly got up and opened the door.  What came out were two leechmans.  Billy jumped back to get away from them and Becca fell off her chair.  Kirby didn't know what to do.

Kirby found a chainsaw near the top of the steps he went up.  His eyes glowed evily and he put the chainsaw away.  Once he finished exploring the rooms, he went back to Billy and Rebecca and told them what he found.  They got up and they decided to go into the Projection Room.  After some romaging, Billy found a clip and put it into the projector and played the clip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We have... created something.  Something brilliant.  After many years of research we've created the ultimate weapon.  This weapon, however, didn't follow directions and it had to be shutdown.  I'm the only researcher left at this mansion.  The rest of us were killed to our other failed experiments.  I know I can't survive long if I don't get out of here.  If you find this message, go out into the forest and find a log cabin.  I've made sure that only humans that are still living can get in.  If there's any chance of living, go find me and I'll help you out as much as I possibly can.  We can end this.  Umbrella will pay for what they've done.  Researcher Brandon Birkin signing out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe projector ended showing slides.  Billy looked at Rebecca and Kirby.

But for I know Umbrella has been doing some shitty things around here, and we'll figure out what happened here.\"  Kirby looked at Rebecca concerned.  The projector then showed more of the clip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If anyone ever meets our creation, they should know that they have no chance of survival if they aren't armed with heavy weapons.  Also, besides the zombies, cerberus, leeches, and crows, there are many other creations that Umbrella ordered.

Billy said, \"What the hell is that thing?\"  Birkin looked at his gun.  \"This this is called the T-Virus Assassination Processing gun, or the T.A.P. gun.  It kills T-Virus cells rapidly and makes the creature much weaker to weapon fire.\"  Billy said, \"Cool.  Let's go.  I have a feeling that something is going to happen soon.\"  The four left the cabin and went back to the mansion, while fighting off the undead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon entering the mansion they found a bunch of zombies roaming around the main lobby.  Birkin was pressing a button on the T.A.P. gun and said, \"Give me a second to charge this thing up.\"  Billy, Becca, and Kirby were firing at the zombies when a burst of multiple lightning bolts fired out and zapped all the zombies and they all burst into flames and blew up.  The three looked at Birkin with shock just from the power of the T.A.P. gun.  Birkin said, \"Well, I did have some time to create this thing, you know.\"  The four continued through the mansion, killing more zombies and other mutant creatures went they found a way out of the mansion and into a observatory.  Upon looking more into the observatory, they found a secret entrance into a small house.  As they walked closer to the building they saw that it was a church.  They tried to find a way in and they found an entrance through the top.  Kirby flew up to the top and Billy threw a rope up to him so the others can climb up.  A hole was big enough for the four to drop through and they fell in.  Inside the church was all messed up.  Kirby, Birkin, and Becca were trying to find a way out of the church when Billy looked up and saw something hanging on the celling.  \"Uh, guys, we have a little problem.\"  They looked up and they saw a giant bat.  It flew down and rammed Birkin into the wall.  He went unconsious and dropped the T.A.P. gun.  Kirby went through his case and looked at this new weapons.  Kirby didn't have much time to decide which gun he should use.</span></div></div>",

Kirby, his hand (paw, whatever you want to call it) on the trigger, shot one of the Shiva Bomb shells and it flew right to the bat.  The bomb went off and it destroyed the bat in one blue blast.

He did, however, get one round in and it turned out that the shot had four rockets in it.  So the bat was blasted and turned into a bloody mass that fell to the ground and revealed a secret entrance below the church.  Birkin came to and got his T.A.P. gun and asked, \"Where's Kirby?\"  Billy pointed to the Kirby-shaped whole in the wall.  Kirby came back in distorted.  \"Kirby!  Oh, you poor thing.  Are you all right?\" asked Becca.  He came to and nodded.  The four then looked down at the hole which was their only way out.  They climbed down and found more of the mansion that was underground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter more puzzles that made no sense whatsoever, the four made it to a library.  There were many books in there that gave more details about Biological Organic Weapons, or B.O.W.s that Birkin talked about.  \"These weapons were made by Umbrella.  They like to keep quiet with their operations.  Umbrella's main goal is to gain power; any power they can get.  The B.O.W.s are the main way to achieve this.  I only discovered this when these... monsters started to attack.  Most of the scientists were told nothing more than what we needed to do.\"  Billy found a book that was labeled \"Marcus's Journal\".  He asked, \"Who's Marcus?  He's the only who has a journal here.\"  Birkin looked complexed.  \"He's... the researcher that worked on the Progenitor Virus, the one that dealt with the leeches.  I can't remember but I think that he got transfered to another laboratory because Umbrella ordered the project to be moved.  I don't remember much after that.\"  Becca looked more into the journal after taking it from Billy, who was still reading it.  Becca said, \"It says here that he wasn't going to be moved.  The project was, but he never moved.  It also says that the people at Umbrella are 'planning something that will end my career as I know it'.  You sure?\"  \"I'm more than certain I hadn't any part of the Progenitor Virus.  All I did was the T-Virus.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Birkin said that, something came bursting through the ceiling.  A giant centipede fell down and it grabbed Birkin.  Birkin yelled, \"Get this thing off of me!\"  He dropped his T.A.P. gun and Kirby grabbed it.  Kirby aimed and shot the centipede once and it came crumbling down.  Billy and Becca helped Birkin up and Kirby gave Birkin back his gun.  \"Why thank you Kirby.  I don't think that I would've done much good with that thing now would I?\"  The four were about to leave when the centipede thrashed about and whacked Billy and Birkin flying to the wall.  It grabbed Becca and started to move for the ceiling.  The thing was about to eat Becca as Kirby ran on top the creature and grabbed the knight sword out of his case.  Kirby yelled, to his best ability, \"Where... you... get... this... from... Birkin?\"   \"I got from one of those empty armors in the mansion.  I didn't think that they were going to use them anymore.\"  Kirby had to think about this.  Should he save Becca first or kill the centipede first?</span></div></div>",

No offense.\"  She shook off the goo off her and hugged Kirby.  \"Thank you so much Kirby!\"  Kirby blushed and he did his victory dance.  Birkin and Billy came to and looked at the dead centipede.  Billy said, \"God damn, these things just keep getting weirdier and weirdier, huh?\"  The centipede broke a wall to what looked like a train station.  The four went in and found a train that worked.  Birkin said in astonishment, \"There's a train station?!\"  The other three didn't look reassured when he said that.  Billy asked, \"You didn't know?\"  \"I've never been here before.  I knew about the church but never this.  What other experiments have they worked on here?\"  They stood there thinking about this.  Kirby heard something out of nowhere but it went away quickly.  He looked around for it while the others looked for a way to turn on the train.  Billy found the controls when a mutant monkey came out of nowhere and grabbed Billy.  \"Billy!!\" yelled Becca as Billy and the monkey fell into the water that was next to the train.  \"Birkin!  What should we do?!\"  \"I say that we found a safe way to find Billy.  There's no way we can survive by jumping in ourselves.\"  Becca wasn't convinced.  \"Kirby, what should we do?\"  Kirby looked at the two and thought about this situation.</span></div></div>",

After they found a door and entered it, they saw Billy trying to swim the strong current.  \"Billy!\" yelled Becca.  She tried to find a way to help him but there wasn't any way from where she was.  Becca also noticed something following him.  The three raced through the next few rooms when they ran into another monster.  Birkin shouted, \"Get down!\" and the other two ducked.  Birkin shot the mutant frog-human thing and it stumbled and fell off the railing.  Becca asked, \"What was that thing?\"  \"That was one of the weapons that I was talking about.  Those things are called Hunters.  They pocess a lot more intelligence than other B.O.W.'s.  Just make sure they don't get to your head.\"  Kirby looked at himself, thinking, \"But I'm all face.

Annoying little creatures.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually the three made it to a room full of water.  Becca saw Billy barely holding onto the ledge and she pulled him out.  \"Billy!  Oh my god, are you OK?\"  Billy coughed a bit, \"*cough* Yeah, just peachy.  Ugh, I got the monkey to drown but something else was trying to get me as well.  It looked like a giant frog.  I tried to fire at it and it got scared and ran away.\"  Birkin was looking complexed.  \"I don't remember ever working on frogs at all.  There was that one project about hunters that involved frogs, but that was at Raccoon City.\"  Billy said, \"Well Doc, we got frogs here.  And I think they aren't the only things we got to worry about.\"  Billy was telling Becca about his story, involving several killings in Africa and being blamed for killing 23 innocent people, which he didn't in the first place, while Kirby looked around to find two doors.

Kirby and Rebecca go up one and Birkin and Billy go up the other one.  As they climbed the stairs, they eventually find a big warehouse like room.  At the end of it, a large door opened.  Rebecca and Kirby took spots at each side of the door and readied there guns.  Enrico came out.  \"Enrico!  You're alive!\"  Enrico looked tired but relieved.  \"Ah, Rebecca and Kirby.  Good to see you alive.  Any luck with finding Billy?\"  Rebecca responded, \"No sir.  I would have to assume that these monsters got to him first.\"  \"Hrm... thats what I thought.  I don't want to leave you two behind, but I have to find the rest of the team.  My bet is that they headed off towards a different mansion several hundred yards from here.\"  Rebecca was surprised.  \"There's two mansions?\"  \"It would seem so.  Sorry Becca and Kirb, but I gotta get going.  I want to make sure those boys are still alive.  Stay safe.\"  Enrico gave them a pat on the back and headed off.  Kirby asked, \"Why did... you lie about... Billy?\"  Rebecca hesitated.  \"As much as I hate to admit it, I don't think that Enrico would believe Billy's story.  Not without solid proof.\"  Kirby frowned, but understood.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two continued through the door and looked around.  The room was erriely empty.  Rebecca didn't hear a thing, but Kirby had a strong sense that something was near by.  Kirby spun around quickly, but nothing was there.  \"What is it?  Something there?\"  Kirby looked about.  \"Not sure.  Thought I heard... something.\"  But Kirby did indeed hear something.  Next thing Kirby knew was that there was a hand on his back.  He grabs the hand and readies his gun but lowers it as he sees Billy and Birkin.  Rebecca, \"Whew.  We thought we heard something.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA fifth body enters the room.  The others look around and they find a monster.  Rebecca starts to back off.  \"What is that?!\"  Billy stammers, \"Is-is he even human anymore?\"  Birkin says, \"That's one of the ultimate weapons Umbrella made!  It's a Tyrant!\"  \"There's more than one?!\"  Birkin replies, \"In a matter of speaking, yes.  This one is a prototype.  There's more Tyrants wherever Umbrella has a lab to make it in.\"  Kirby shouted, \"FIRE IN THE HOLE!!!\"  and fired off a round from the Rocket Magnum.  The four rockets made contact and Kirby grinned.  The smoke clears but the Tyrant was still in one piece, just hunched over in pain.  Kirby grabs the chainsaw and charges the Tyrant, but he gets swiped away.  Rebecca and Billy fire away as Birkin charges up the T.A.P. gun.  Kirby revvs the chainsaw up again and waits for Birkin to fire his gun.  Once the tyrant was stunned, Kirby charges again and slashes off the Tyrant's arms off.  The Tyrant looks at its limbs on the ground.  It then runs at Rebecca and Billy and tries to kick them.  Kirby then spins his chainsaw like a legendary sword and jumps into the air.  The Tyrant looks up to Kirby and Kirby impales the Tyrant through the exposed heart.  It stumbles for a little bit, then it falls over dead.  Kirby takes out the chainsaw and swings it trihupmhantly and sheaths it back into his case.  Rebecca and Billy sigh in relief.  Billy says, \"Kirby, you're one loose cannon, but you're a damn good warrior.\"  Kirby smiles.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe four continue throughout the factory until they run into a strange man in a white robe.  Rebecca states, \"That's the guy from the train.  The guy with the leeches.\"  Billy shoutes, \"Yo!  Skirt boy!  Whats your deal?\"  Kirby and Rebecca shakes their head.  Birkin stammers.  \"You-you're Marcus!\"  The other three look at him in shock.  Marcus smiles.  \"Yes.  My name is James Marcus.  You must be related to William Birkin, right?  Brothers was it?\"  \"Cousins to be precise.  Why?\"  Marcus quickly frowns.  \"You're fucking cousin assassinated me!  Along with Albert Wesker, your leader, you stupid little girl.\"  Kirby and Rebecca look at each other.  \"Wesker was involved?\"  \"Yes!  I do believe that everyone here has been fooled.  Including me.\"  Billy wasn't convinced.  \"If you were assassinated, how are you alive?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarcus then smiled again.  \"My creations.  The leeches you all have seen no doubt.  As I worked on the virus, Umbrella wanted to kill me off, literally, and take the virus for themselves.  So 'good ol' Wesker and William come and kill me as I was working.  But a miracle happened.  The leeches crawled into me and brought me back to life.  And so, with my new life, I decided to exact revenge on the two by spreading the virus throughout the mountains.  Both my virus... and the T-Virus.\"  Birkin looked stunned.  \"There's two viruses out there?!\"  Marcus grinned some more.  \"Yes.  And now, you will all die.  If I let you leave, the world will know of me and what I have done.  I will not let my creations be destroyed!\"  Marcus starts to morph into a giant leech man.  He then lunges at Billy and Kirby and sends them flying to the wall.  Rebecca shoots Marcus while Birkin charges up his gun and stuns Marcus.  Kirby started to search through his case and found a Laser Gun and an Acid Cherry Bomb.  He looks at Billy and Billy grins.  Kirby then decides who should do what.</span></div></div>",

While Kirby was setting up the Acid Cherry Bomb, Billy began shooting the monster, distracting it for a few seconds.  Kirby was all ready and he threw the bomb, and Billy saw his opportunity.  The bomb and the shot had hit perfectly, causing a huge explosion of acid spray all over Marcus.  He screamed in pain as the acid dissolved its body.  Birkin was all set with a second shot for his T.A.P. Gun.  With the acid exposing the raw flesh of Marcus, the T.A.P. Gun will utterly destroy the monster.  The professor fired the shot and hit Marcus.  The monster squirmed in pain and hissed and screamed.  Marcus made one last attempt to grab Kirby to crush him to death, but Rebecca shot him in the head.  \"Take that, you ugly beast!\" she shouted.  Its body slumped.  Kirby exclaimed, \"Victory!\" and did his victory dance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe four left the body of Marcus and tried to find a way out of the factory.  Overhead sirens went off and a automated voice said, \"The self-destruct system has been activated.  All personnel please evacuate the facility.\"  Billy shouted, \"What the hell man?!  Who puts in a self-destruct button in a factory?!\"  The four found a slanted lift going up, hopefully getting them out of doomed factory.  As they ascended, something was pursuing them.  The monster grew in size and roared in rage.  \"Marcus mutated!!  Quick, shoot it!\" Birkin yelled.  The others began shooting it while Kirby looked for a grenade to easily blow away the monster.  He found a \"Gooey Bomb\" and looked at the professor.  He asked, \"What will this... do, Professor?\"  \"That grenade is a Gooey Bomb... Kirby, that's perfect!  That'll make the beast stuck in its place, thus the self-destruct will kill it!\"  The professor threw the bomb and the bomb exploded with a small boom.  Marcus was stunned for a moment, only then to continue its seek-and-kill lust.  But it got caught on something.  A bunch of purple goo hung from everywhere and made its attempt to pursue them in vain.  It thrashed around as the four went up.  Billy proudly said, \"Nice job doc.  I guess you Umbrella workers aren't so bad after all.\"  \"Nah, we do have souls.  Some just don't use them.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lift stopped and the four got out.  The door leading outside was closed and it had to be opened by opening four safety locks.  Each person took a safety lock and started opening it.  Kirby was about to open his when he heard something charging up the lift.  He had a look and the monster lunged up.  \"Ahhhh!  It got itself free!\"  Kirby started shooting it when the monster noticed Kirby.  Taking a step back, Kirby retreated.  As the monster lunged, Rebecca got her lock open, letting sunlight flood into the area.  Marcus hit the floor hard and started thrashing around in pain.  Birkin shouted, \"It's weakness is the light!  Everyone, open the locks quickly!\"  The monster got back up shaking and rushed towards Rebecca.  Kirby intercepted the charge and sent the beast flying towards several crates.  Both started shooting the monster while Billy and Birkin released their locks.  The only one left was Kirby's which he didn't get the chance to.  Billy and Birkin gave them cover while Kirby and Becca ran off to release the last lock.  The monster, desperate to make sure the light stayed out, gave a mad chase after the two.  Kirby turned around and shot the monster with the Rocket Magnum, making it flop onto its back.  Rebecca got to the lock and released it, letting all the shutters open and the door open.  Marcus's body was sizzling from the light and it screamed some more.  Billy, tired of it, said, \"Get lost bitch.\" and shot one magnum bullet at its head, finally defeating it.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe four sprinted out of the factory and got some distance from it so that they were safe.  The countdown for the self-destruction got to 0:00 and the place exploded.  Rocks and debris shot off everywhere.  Kirby was eating popcorn and enjoying the show.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOff in the distance, the four found another mansion where the rest of BRAVO team had headed off to.  Kirby shouted, \"Oh hell, ANOTHER freaking mansion?!  Come on, what's next?  Sharks?\"  The others looked at him and he himself was shocked.  \"Oh yeah!  I can speak regular English!  Sweet!\" And he started to dance.  Billy felt that something was tugging at his cuffs.  Becca was releasing the cuffs off, and she said, \"Well, you're free Billy.  It's time for you to head off.  I don't think that the rest of my team will be happy to see you with me at the end of this hell.  Birkin, our records say that you're dead.  I recommend that both of you 'disappear' for a while.  I'm pretty sure that the government won't be happy to find out what you did when this is over.\"  They looked down for a little bit, and nodded.  Billy sighed, \"... Well girl, it's been a blast.  You puffball are one hell of a guy.  Hope to see you later.  Maybe I'll buy you a beer and we can have a laugh about this later in life.  See ya.  Rebecca...\"  \"Yeah Billy?\"  \"Be safe.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBirkin and Billy walked off into the forest, disappearing from records.  It has been confirmed by Rebecca Chambers that Billy Coen and Brandon Birkin were not found and announced dead.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebecca and Kirby watched as they disappeared until they couldn't see them again.  Kirby felt a drop of water fell on him.  Looking up, he saw it came from Rebecca.  Concerned, he asked, \"Rebecca, are you... ok?\"  Rebecca was in a distance in her mind when she heard Kirby.  \"Oh- what?  I'm fine.  Really.  Come one.  Let's get to safety.  I bet there are still some monsters out there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCongratulations!!  You have made it to the end of Kirby's Resident Evil Zero story!  However, this saga isn't over yet!!

Once the mansion blew up, they used a back up story that made it look like it was an accident and the incident was really covered \"well\" to the public of Raccoon City.  That is, until one day in Raccoon City...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Kirby went into Raccoon City after his mansion mission, he tried to find Chris, Jill, Barry, Brad, Rebecca, and/or Wesker.  Even Wesker!  But none of them were there.  He heard rumors that Chris, Jill, Brad, and Barry were somewhere in the city, so he went off on a long journey around the city to find them.  Kirby, being the single-minded puffball he is, only went through all the diners, which weren't any use to him in the least.  Kirby wasn't going to give up yet though.  His last place he ventured to was a diner around the outskirts of the city.  He opened the door and went in.  He ordered a decent meal and waited at a booth.  Kirby noticed that a truck driver kicked some random dude out of a truck and sped off.  The guy that was kicked out was crawling around, trying to find something.  Kirby looked away and wanted his food.  Soon his food came and a girl in black and pink walked in.  Kirby also noticed that everyone that was in the diner was still...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire casually walked in the diner and tried to look for someone; anyone.  \"The city's been empty for some reason,\" Claire told herself.  She shrugged off the idea and continued to look through the diner.  She saw a pink puffball eating a twelve course meal, which she found very odd.  Claire remembered Chris talking about someone pink from S.T.A.R.S. so she thought that the pink marshmellow was him and continued on.  She then saw someone at a booth at last.  She slowly crept up to the person and asked for some help.  The person didn't stir.  She tapped the man but he fell out of his booth.  Claire jumped up as the man's head fell off.  She looked at the pink puffball and he looked back confused.  It inhaled the rest of the food and headed over to Claire.  Kirby looked down at the dead man and he said, \"Damn, not again.\"  Claire couldn't speak, as someone's head came off of his head and a giant marshmellow is talking to her.  Soon the other customers of the diner came to life and moaned towards the two.  Kirby grabbed Claire and said, \"Come on!  We have no time to startle!\"  Claire was really confused.  She asked, \"What's going on?!  And how can you talk?!\"  Kirby responded, \"I don't know and you can Chris about the second question (mansion incident).  We need to get out of here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKirby and Claire got to the back door and opened it, only to find a R.P.D. officer stop them and having a gun raised towards them.  Claire shouted, \"Don't shoot!\"  Kirby didn't have many options.  What will he do?</span></div></div>",

That, however, didn't stop what happened next in Raccoon City.  The viral outbreak that actually happened in the mountains have somehow escaped through to the city by rats and now the dead have risen again.  The police could not subdue the zombies and countless victims were claimed.  Very few survivors made it through the outbreak, including Jill Valentine.  Kirby, accompaning Jill from the mansion incident, helps Jill to escape the monsters that await them in the city.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two escape into a small shelter that is safe for the moment.  They recover from the last battle and try to plan what they're going to do next.  They head out the back to get to a safer place when they hear gun shots from afar.  They head off to the shots as they fight back the zombies and undead dogs and crows.  The shot keeps going from one direction to another, making the trip a long one.  Kirby watches from the back while Jill pushes forward.  They reach a bar and they take a break and go inside.  As they go in, they hear a scream.  They rush in and find out that the person is already dead and is being eaten by two zombies.  Kirby pulls out a grenade and throws it at them, causing them to be blown up into several pieces.  The two take a break and grab a drink.  Ironically, they enjoy themselves, having a good time from their drinks.  Soon they snap out of it and become sober.  They realize that there's more gun shots being fired elsewhere and they head off into that direction again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir trip leads them back to the bar again.  This time they hear the gun shots and screams inside and they rush in again.  They don't see anyone until one zombie sneaks up on Jill and tries to bite her.  Kirby tried to stop it, but a zombie tripped him and he tried to get it off of him.  Jill was almost bitten when a bullet came from behind her and shot the zombie in the head, killing it and Jill killed the zombie attacking Kirby.  She looked behind and she saw Brad Vickers, her pilot from S.T.A.R.S.  He warned them that there's a monster trying to kill them all and he ran off without saying anything else.  They saw that he was heading towards the R.P.D. station and they wanted to make sure that he didn't get hurt... or killed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey eventually get there and they notice that it's a little too quiet.  There aren't any zombies around and that there was someone, or something, stalking them.  They shoke the feeling off and they headed to the front doors of the station.  They saw Brad coming up and started to walk towards him until something dropped out of nowhere.  It was a huge, deformed human that didn't look human at all and grabbed Brad by the neck.  He tried to call out for help, but he was muffled by the hand.  Jill and Kirby were too shocked to move from their spot.  Brad tried to get away, but the thing shot a tentacle through his head, killing him right away.  He tossed Brad's body away and looked at the other two, saying only, \"STAARSS...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two didn't know what to do.  Kirby was the first to snap out of the shock and decided what to do next...</span></div></div>",

Kirby, being the curious one he was, ran after the raven and entered the shadows.  His friend Meta Knight soon followed him, thinking that this won't end well.

Kirby still didn't know what it was, but Meta Knight sure knew what it was.  He was tempted to put it on his sword, but he wanted to make sure that the rumors weren't true.  He attached it to a twig he had found and the twig started to twist into grotesque shapes and forms.  Then the twig grew a big eye in the middle.  Meta Knight broke the twig and took the metal again.<br>\r\n\"So the rumors are true then,\" said Meta Knight to himself.  He put it into a special box and turned to the creature running towards them.  He jumped into the air with his giant sword with the eye and slashed down towards them.  They avoided the slash and stood their ground for a second.  Meta Knight threw a sword, but not his main sword, at Kirby and he ate it to become Sword Kirby.  The two attacked their attacker and he reflected them back with his sword.<br>\r\nMeta Knight yelled out to Kirby, \"Watch out for his sword!  It can easily slice you into two if you're not careful.\"  He then looked at the strange being and asked, \"And who are you?\"<br>\r\nThe being answered, \"I'm Nightmare, and you're finished!\"<br>\r\nMeta Knight and Kirby looked at each other, shocked to find out that Nightmare was there as well.  They had thought that they destroyed him before, but apparently he was back.  In reality, it wasn't the same Nightmare, but that's what they thought.  Kirby had called in a Warp Star and it crashed down onto Nightmare.  It seemed that he was knocked out for now.<br>\r\nMeta Knight looked to Kirby and said, \"We need to get the Star Rod quickly to end this.\"  Kirby nodded and they ran off, but not before the girl from before stopped them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSophita had stopped them to ask them a question.<br>\r\n\"Who are you two?\"  she asked.  Meta Knight replied, \"I'm Meta Knight, and he's Kirby over there.\"  Kirby waved hi cheerfully.  Sophita told them, \"That was Nightmare you were fighting.  He's the escence of Soul Edge.\"<br>\r\n\"The escence of... Soul Edge?  Not pure evil caused by nightmares?\"  Meta Knight asked.  She responded, \"No, but he could cause them.  He was formed by a man called Siegfried.  He's a noble swordsman that tried to stop Soul Edge, but he couldn't successfully and he was over powered by it and that created Nightmare.  The two are now seperated, from the looks of it.\"<br>\r\nMeta Knight asked, \"Can he be stopped, along with Soul Edge?\"<br>\r\nShe hesitated for a bit, then answered, \"Yes... but only by SoulCalibur, the opposite of Soul Edge.  Soul Edge is the evil blade and SoulCalibur is the blade of good.\"<br>\r\n\"So we got to stop the two before it can be used to destroy everything, right?\"<br>\r\nSophita answered, \"Yes.  Only the purest can purge Soul Edge though.\"<br>\r\nThey both looked at Kirby, looking very innocent among them.  So they decided to join together to stop the terror of Soul Edge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlong the way, they encounter some followers of Soul Edge, but they were easily beaten by the three.  They also collected pieces of Soul Edge to stop others from using it for their own purposes.  They hadn't faced anyone that they couldn't handle until they met a really strange girl with a giant ring blade.  They were traveling on a raft when they encountered her.  She surprised them and Meta Knight accidently fell into the water.  Sophita tried to strike her, but the girl pushed into the water, hanging onto the side of the raft.  The girl was about to get her off when Kirby pulled her back and triple kicked her down.  She got back up and introduced herself.<br>\r\n\"I go by the name of Tira, and I can't wait for you to die!\"  Kirby backed off a few steps, a little creeped out by this, and she lunged at him.  Kirby didn't have a lot of time to react.  He could either attack Tira, or dodge her to save Sophita or Meta Knight.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Kirby was bored one day, so he wanted to do something that was out of the ordinary.  He first joined the army, but he was kicked out for eating all the food rations one day in battle.  He then joined the Navy, but he couldn't drive a plane to save his life, as he accidently flew into a mountain.  Lastly, he tried the Marines, but Kirby sunk the ship when he found it's \"plug\".  Kirby tried them all, but he couldn't find anything that could handle his abilites.  One day though, he found a time machine and he entered it and he was sent back into the past.  As Kirby walked out the machine, he noticed that nothing really changed.  He looked at a calendar and it read 1968.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA BLU scout ran by a RED heavy and soldier as they tried to stop him and they both miss him.  The scout jumps ontop the mid bridge in 2Fort and he accidently falls off.  As he collects his barings, a time machine comes out of nowhere and flatens him.  The heavy and soldier from above examine the machine and try to make of this thing.  The door on the machine opens and the heavy starts his minigun.  A pink puffball comes out and the heavy starts to fire on it.  The bullets don't do anything, so the heavy stops shooting.<br>\r\nHeavy looks at the soldier and says, \"Pink little thing on our side?\"<br>\r\nSolider replies, \"Solider, I think so.  Welcome to the war, recruit.\"  Kirby just stares at them, wondering what to make of this.  A sniper picks off the soldier and the heavy and Kirby hide in their base.  A RED medic calls everyone together and they meet up in the intelligence room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe medic tells everyone that they need to get the BLU team's intelligence in order to take them down.  Kirby realizes that this is like the Army, so he agrees to go along with it.  Everyone else cheered and headed off.  But as everyone left, a lone Pyro stayed behind.  He went behind a Demoman and it turned out to be a BLU spy in disguise and backstabbed him.  Kirby inhaled the spy and Kirby turned into a BLU spy.  The medic saw this and made Kirby their official spy.  This tricked everyone else on the BLU team, as they couldn't figure out that the BLU spy was on the other side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKirby reached the other base and wondered which side to go in.  The soldier and medic on his team went into the right, while a BLU pyro and scout entered the left.</span></div></div>",

His disguised stayed, instead of revealing that he was a RED teammate, and the two thought that an enemy spy was in the building.  Kirby saved the soldier and medic and they continued on, until they got mowed down by the BLU team's sentry.  Kirby tried to get past it and he did, with the sentry being tricked that he was on their side.  Kirby looked in his arsenal and he found a sapper to get rid of the sentry.  He placed it onto the sentry and it blew it up.  A BLU engineer came by to figure out what happened and all he saw was Kirby disguised as a BLU spy.  The engineer gave him a whack and Kirby took some damage, and that made the engineer alert the others that there's a spy in their base.  Everyone came into the BLU base and surrounded Kirby.  He smiled and turned invisible to escape and everyone began to fire like crazy.  Kirby walked away and he found the intelligence.  He tried to pick it up, but a RED scout came blazing through and took it.  Kirby followed him and the scout was ambushed by the BLU team.  Everyone on the BLU team guarded it, but they still didn't realize that he wasn't on their side.  Kirby causally walked up to it and backstabbed the few closest to the intelligence and took off running with it.  His disguise then came off, as everyone knew what team he was and gave chase.  He swallowed a upcoming BLU scout and he gained the speed of the scout and ran off.  The BLU team could not keep up, so Kirby got to their intelligence and they finally got the BLU's intelligence.  The RED team was very impressed with Kirby's efforts, but they said that they need to get the intelligence 2 more times to make sure that it is the real deal.  Kirby agreed and he speed off with the scout's speed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe BLU team saw that a puff ball was on the RED team and they wanted to make sure that if he came around again, they would know what to do.  They devised a little plan.  A pyro would stand at each door way with a dispenser, making a wall of fire so that no one on the RED team could get in.  Then, when someone that was on fire came through, the BLU team would attack them.  So the engineers started to build dispensers and pyros stood at each one.  Kirby, in advance, saw this plan, so he decided to eat a pyro, gain their fire abilites, and wait for some prey to come by.  He saw an engineer and a medic came by and he wondered which one to burn.</span></div></div>",

The pyros thought that he was from the other team and they all ambushed him.  Kirby, on the otherhand, walked right through the whole mess with two RED scouts.  They ran to the intelligence and took it while the BLU team wondered what on earth happened.  Kirby, still disguised as a pyro, burned everyone who wasn't a pyro and a demoman on his team placed sticky bombs under the other pyros and blew them up.  The two scouts ran past the dead BLU team with the intelligence out the base.  The one scout fell into the water and he went back to their base the long way and the other scout got sniped by a BLU sniper.  Kirby, still disguised as a pyro, went after the intelligence.  The sniper thought it was one of BLU pyros, so he ignored him until he picked it up.  The sniper tried to get him, but he was too slow and Kirby got away again.  Kirby went to their intelligence room and gave the medic the BLU team's intelligence for the second time.  The RED team was very impressed again, and they told Kirby to play a defense.  So Kirby stayed at the RED base til further notice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe BLU team was mad now.  They've been infiltrated twice by a pink puffball.  They kept the dispensers their, but now the had heavies protecting the doorways.  They then sent out a scout rush, a total of 6, to get the RED teams intelligence.  Kirby followed right behind the scouts when they entered the base.  The first two were mowed down by a sentry, so there were only 4 now.  Kirby yelled, \"Sentry up there!\" in a muffled voice and the scouts looked behind them.  They saw a BLU pyro and they were ready to shooting when Kirby used his flamethrower to prove he wasn't a spy.  They returned to the engineer's sentry and pondered what to do with it.  Kirby, knowing that scouts aren't the smartest class when left standing still, burned them from behind and shot them with his shotgun.  He got rid of them and he looked back to the BLU base.  He saw not 6 but 10 scouts rushing in this time with a soldier and a medic.  Kirby saw that they were actually in two teams; all 10 scouts in one and the soldier and medic in the other.  Kirby could either go after the scouts or the medic and soldier. </span></div></div>",

He begins to look through child's books, but he grew tired of such childish literature.  The librarian, a rather shady man, offers him a story about Greek mythology and gives Kirby a book called God of War.  It told a tale of ancient Rome fighting the Spartans and how the God of War would \"help\" whichever army that gave their alligence.  Kirby was interested, as it mentioned one warrior named Kratos.  The man Kratos could go up against a god and kill him/her, as the story said.  Kirby was really interested and he wanted to go back into time to battle in Rome.  The librarian then showed Kirby into a time machine in the back of the library.  Meta Knight was following Kirby, seeing that Kirby doesn't go to the library often.  He didn't want Kirby to go alone into a full blown war invovling gods, so Meta Knight insisted that the two go together.  The librarian didn't object, so Kirby and Meta Knight got into the machine and he set the coordinates to ancient Rome and the two off to battle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKratos was on a boat where he was trying to get to Rome.  He had orders from Athenia to go there.  The seas were rough and storms were bound.  He then found him surrounded by legions of the undead.  Kratos just sneered at them and proceded to cut them into ribbions.  His ship was going down in the process, so he jumped onto another boat near him.  As he jumped, a bright light came out of nowhere and a strange machine appeared.  Kratos ripped the door open and Kirby and Meta Knight jumped out.  The two looked at Kratos and he looked back at them, not sure what to make of them.  Kratos starts to make a move, but he swipes his swords attached to his arms around and slices some more undead.  Meta Knight soon started to attack as well.  Kirby didn't know what to do, so he swallowed a sword and he became Sword Kirby and he attacked the undead as well.  As the numbers started to dwindle, as human warriors on the ship were pointing at the water.  The waves were becoming more violent and a huge sea serpent came and ate some of the warriors.  Kirby saw the thing and pondered what to do from there.</span></div></div>",

The story is going to be a lot violent, with blood, explosions, and questionable themes as well, but don't overkill it.  Any video game series can be implicated into the story, as long as each series is longer than 10-12 pages.  Kirby can't die, nor can the main character of the game series(for the main story line.  If it is a side branch that doesn't go anywhere else, they may die but the story ends there).  Kirby can eat anyone he chooses, but they must come back alive (unless it's a minion).  That's all the rules as of now.  If you feel like adding any chapters into this story, email me with the chapter you want to add, what it's about, and a rough draft of it.  I will email you if it needs some editing.  If I like it the way it is, I will use the chapter and put it in, with a few minor alterations if needed(I'll email you any thing that I might change).  Thanks and enjoy the story!</td>",
