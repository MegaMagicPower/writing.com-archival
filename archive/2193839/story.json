I dunno, I'm sorta talking to a mute audience here, but I guess it couldn't hurt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy name is Gwen Poole. (Because not every Gwen you meet is a <i>Stacy)</i> A few months ago, I was just like you. A regular person, just tryin' to get through life and maybe read a few (hundred) comics along the way. But then one morning... I don't even remember exactly what happened, but I just found myself... here. In the Marvel Universe. So obviously, I did the only reasonable thing you can do in a situation like this-<br>\r\nPut on a Pink and White costume and shoot bad guys for money, obviously! So that's pretty much been my life as of late, mercenary work in this totally crazy world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut there's something weird going on with this most recent mission. Here's the basic rundown: Alchemax (formerly known as Oscorp) is producing a wicked dangerous super soldier serum. The effects are supposed to be practically unpredictable, and you know how these evil corporations are... we can't just <i>let</i> them have something like this sitting in their vault.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOkay, so here's where this gets weird: That basic rundown I just gave you is basically all there is to this mission. I was given very few details on the mission parameters, we don't have a motive as to why someone is paying money to have this destroyed, and I barely saw any traps getting into the place. You know what this all stinks of? Bad writing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo I figure, whatever. This must be a filler arc and they probably got a less talented writer to handle it while the main guy is probably working on some other series for a few issues. But then I think about it further, and I realize something else- this is the <i>shameless</i> kind of bad writing. Ordinarily bad comic writers have character inaccuracies of just forget plot points. This is more along the lines of \"I could flesh this out more, but I really don't care.\" That's not nearly as common. Usually they at least pretend to care.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut I'm getting ahead of myself. I get past the... maybe like... one or two traps they actually set this place up with, crawl through an air duct, and drop into the lab where they've got the serum. I get my pistols out ready to shoot any of the bad guys guarding it and... nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlright, whoever's writing this sure didn't want to make this difficult for me. I walk over to the side of the room, and there's the vial of serum with the formula sitting on a journal right there. Next to it is a computer explaining what it's supposed to do: Enhance the user's musculature and frame. At this point- it hits me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shamelessly basic backstory, the overwhelmingly poor security, and the obvious setup... this is the start of an <i>internet FMG story.</i> How do I know this... you ask? Well you see, a few months ago, I was just like you. Sitting at their computer reading degenerate stories. Because surprise, I was a teenage girl with a sex drive and I had to satisfy it somehow. And, well, I had a few... interests... that I'm not typically comfortable with sharing. So, if you're reading this: That means you specifically chose me to be the subject of your fictionalized sexual gratification. I am equal parts flattered and disgusted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, it probably won't matter. Obviously this is all non-canon, so I'm not even sure I'll remember any of this. I guarantee nobody else will. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyway... I guess it's time we actually got to what you came here for... huh?</span></div></div>",

It still technically accomplishes my goal. It disposes of the serum, they never said <i>how</i> I need to dispose of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, no less than thirty seconds later, and I'm already feeling like I made a huge mistake. My stomach churns and then tenses up like a rock, and I start frantically gasping for air. I fall over on the floor, huddled up in the fetal position, my body is on fire, and I'm bordering on feeling like I'm about to die. Fun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, after a little bit of that, I start feeling better... a lot better. My stomach calms down, and an energy flows from my core out through my limbs. Before I know it, I can feel parts of my body... growing. I first noticed my thighs thickening up, whilst gaining some real rigid muscle definition to boot. My calves also scaled up, becoming the more defined teardrop shape I always hear about. My stomach hardened into a set of abs, with a matching set of obliques on each side. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPretty soon into the growth, I can feel my entire frame expanding outward. My shoulders broaden, and I even feel like I'm getting taller. It hurts like all get out, so much so that I have to stifle a scream as it feels like my skeleton is changing itself from inside of me. But despite all that... it's a good pain. Like my brain is saying just how much it <i>wants</i> this to be happening. I can feel my entire body be filled with this new power that I could never even imagine before. I look down at my arm, and notice that it's gone from the cute 10\" bicep to a solid 14\" around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually I'm able to stand again, and from the looks of it, I've gained eight inches on my old measly 5'4\" height, putting me at 6' even. Looking down, every part of me looks like it gained +5 stats in an RPG. Every muscle in my body is toned from top to bottom, and noticeably larger than what it was before. And with that, I feel <i>amazing!</i> I feel better than myself! Like I could kick the ass of anyone who walks through the door!<br>\r\nMy suit, on the other hand, has seen better days. It stretched out more than I thought it would, especially considering I got eight inches taller, but there are some seams that just couldn't take it. Most noticeably, the seams on my shoulders just burst open, exposing part of my arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore I can even think about what to do next, I hear alarms go off. I guess this place does have <i>some</i> security, because now they know where I am, and they've gotta be gunning for me. So... what now?</span></div></div>",

I guess the world is telling me to put my money where my mouth is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut you know what- this is a perfect opportunity. We're not gonna cheat this. No guns, swords and hand-to-hand only. Let's see just how well this serum worked. As I'm pulling my swords out, 6 security guys barge into the room. They're all armed with assault rifles, and they're armored up like a wrecking crew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy shit...\" one of them says, \"Did she use the formula on <i>herself?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nI start running towards the group on the north end of the room. \"Hey, chill guys, I'm just your QA! I'm just here to make sure your illegal performance enhancers are up to our standards!\" I don't think they were too amused by my quip. They just started shooting at me instead of laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the guys are firing, my mind starts doing some magic for me. Suddenly, I'm able to look at where their line of fire is and actually <i>react.</i> It feels like that serum didn't just up my strength factor, it boosted my reflexes!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI manage to reach the 3 guys on the north end (because I'm just that awesome), and immediately start taking 'em out. One sword swipe for the first guy, two for the second guy, punch the third guy in the face. The third guy was knocked out cold immediately, and the first two were easily taken out with my sword. I was able to cut through their Kevlar vests like a hot knife through butter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, I still got problems. The goons on the south end of the room are still trying to kill me. So, I start sprinting over there, staggering my approach so I'm not an easy target, and as I come across a table in the middle of the room, I get an idea. I let myself drop for a moment and try to kick the table at the last 3 guys. The intention was to distract them for a moment and give me some cover, but I completely surprise myself, and wind up kicking the table <i>across the room</i> into two of the guys, knocking them clean on their feet. Then that leaves the last guy, who is currently staring right at me, probably wetting his pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well?\" I crack my knuckles and strike a menacing pose, \"You gonna come at me or what?\" He decided to choose \"or what\" because he just ran out of there. Ordinarily I'm the one who has to run out of a room so I don't get killed. It's really nice to be on the other end of that for once.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlright... so, what's next?</span></div></div>",

My body starts to feel warm again, and I'm getting that familiar feeling of energy flowing through my body. <b>I'm having another growth spurt.</b> I think getting into combat must have made the serum start working again... is this going to happen every time? I kinda hope so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn no time at all, I can feel my frame expanding again, allowing for more room for muscle, and making me even taller in the process. My biceps bulge out even more to a substantial 17\".  My calves grow enough to break the straps on my shin guards, leaving them to fall off at my feet. My pectorals start pushing out, making my bust just a little more pronounced along with it. My whole body is becoming more of a stoic mass of power, and I'm loving every minute of it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmmmm...\" A moan escapes my breath. During the whole transformation, my face was absolutely beaming, and my fist was completely clenched. I have to hold myself back from squealing with joy with just how much this excites me. The process of having the next several hours in a non-canon story to let myself go loose, get strong, with no consequences... is a pretty exciting proposition.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy growth finally subsided leaving my at an even 7' tall.<br>\r\n\"Aww...\" I say to myself, \"I was hoping I'd get even bigger...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut hey, that can still easily happen, if the original theory holds true. This should be a very interesting experience.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I head back over to Ronnie's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Oh, btw- Ronnie's basically like this tailor chick. She made my costume, and in order to pay her back for it, I did a couple mercenary contracts for her, and now I just keep doing contracts for her so I can get paid. Apparently she hires out several merc types like myself. I think she uses that to fianance her tailoring business, like she doesn't make enough money off of that alone.

She's a little weird, but she's cool.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo I walk into the front door of Ronnie's shop, which I have to duck my head into now because I'm so tall.

I got rid of the serum. It all went into me, but Alchemax doesn't have it anymore.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ronnie is not worried about that you reprobate!\" She fumes, <i>\"You tore the suit!</i> You cannot just put it under these conditions, Ronnie's work must be treated with respect!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI'm left standing there with a completely dumbfounded expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe continues, \"You will have to come in for another fitting soon, Ronnie will let that be covered by your completion of this past contract.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then I guess I better start the next contract right away then, huh?\" I step over to the computer terminal.

This whole thing was for a test- the contract, the vial out in the open, the lack of any security, they were getting me in place for whatever it is they're trying to test on me. I already let phase 1 happen, now they've got blast doors sealing both ends, and I see these 4 tesla rods protruding from the ceiling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn electric hum starts filling the room. 'Bout 3 seconds later, whammo. I'm being hit with some kind of energy from those tesla rods.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately, I feel my body being filled with a staunch, painful, pleasure. I let out a loud groan as my body starts expanding even further. My bicep had quickly boomed out from 14\" to 17\", and before I even knew it, I was already standing at 7' tall. My 6-pack abs morphed into the completely unrealistic but oh-so-cool 8-pack. My breasts even pumped themselves out to an F-cup, tearing a split down the middle of my suit's torso. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI feel completely empowered. Every ounce of muscle in my body is increasing in power exponentially, with of course more ounces being added every second. \"Oh fuck yes... keep making me <i>stronger!\"</i> To put into perspective just how much more powerful I feel, one moment I feel like I can bench an entire locomotive. Not even ten seconds later, that feels like a joke to me. Whatever this test is, it's making me stronger than any human being ever reasonably should be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy biceps have ballooned from 17\" to 24\", and my height reaches 9'. \"Mmmmm, yes! MORE!\" I pull off my mask because I can feel my face heating up and turning red from all the excitement.<br>\r\nAs my frame continues to expand outward, my costume is tearing apart at the seams. My shoes, shin guards, and socks have all torn off, leaving me barefoot, and my suit was barely holding itself together. I begin taking a few steps towards one side of the room. Each step I take rattles the floor, and leaves cracks where my foot landed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually I hit 10' with 26\" biceps, and solid 10-pack abs. My hair is brushing up against top of the room, and I let my hands slide across the drywall ceiling tiles. At this point, my growth spurt finally stops. I have strength beyond words, I'm nearly twice the height of the average person, and I'm left with my costume in tatters. But it's not nearly enough. Not now. Now that I know what they can do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on you pussies!\" I shout, \"Come on and make me bigger!\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

So I grab the vial, pocket it, and hold onto the formula.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually I manage to break out of Alchemax, using roughly the same path I used to get in. As I set back out onto the streets of New York, I realize that having this illegal Super Soldier formula opens up some options for me. First, I could try and get a professional to analyze it for me... Goodness knows there's enough random scientists hanging around the city. Alternatively, I could just jump the gun and find a test dummy to use it on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI could also try and turn in the contract so I can get paid. Ronnie doesn't need to know I didn't destroy the formula. She just knows Alchemax doesn't have it anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut lastly is the oh-so intriguing idea. My brain's been nagging me to just shut up and try the serum myself since I found it. And it would be nice to get some kind of super strength for a while, it's been pretty lame trying to deal with Superhero work when you don't have any kind of super powers. (And minimal combat experience, for that matter) But still that brings us back to where we started now, doesn't it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHmm... what do?</span></div></div>",

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">Good morning/afternoon/evening everyone. This is my first time posting an interactive story here, and I'm pretty new to writing these sorts of adult fetish stories, so bear with me if I'm not the best.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlright lads, let's cut to the chase- This is interactive is about the Marvel Comics character Gwenpool, and focuses on <i>Giantess growth, muscle growth, and action.</i> It's set in New York, while Gwenpool is still working as a contract-by-contract Mercanary. The basic setup is she's been hired to dispose of a dangerous experimental Super Soldier formula cooked up by Alchemax.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are open to write ANYONE from the Marvel Universe into the story that you want. But the story <b>must stay focused on Gwenpool.</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf you don't know who Gwenpool is, I strongly recommend you quickly brush up on your knowledge here: <a class=\"blue2roll\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Gwendolyn_Poole_\" target=\"_blank\">https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Gwendolyn_Poole_</a>(Earth-TRN565) I'm not expecting you to get the personality exactly correct, just don't say she's Gwen Stacy and we're cool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEDIT: Here's some <b>character bios</b> for a few side characters.<br>\r\n(I've set the story up so that you can choose whether or not you want to exclude either one entirely)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRonnie: She's a talented tailor in the Marvel Universe that is known for making costumes for Superheroes and Super Villains alike. She also apparently hires out mercenaries on the side. This is the woman that Gwenpool does all her merc contracts for. She also has a third-person speech thing going on.<br>\r\nAppearance wise, she's relatively tall, thin, has long black hair, and she wears glasses. She's roughly in her early 40s.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCecil: He's Gwenpool's hacker friend. They met when Gwenpool busted his uncle's bank heist. Cecil was begrudgingly helping them steal the money, and was just glad to be removed from the situation. Now they share an apartment, and Cecil helps her out with her missions in exchange for half of the cash. He doesn't seem to have much romantic interest in Gwenpool (in fact he kind of just sees her as a bit of a psycho) and has a dry sense of humor. <br>\r\nAppearance wise, he's a fairly average 18-year-old guy with shaggy black hair. He always wears a jacket over a green skull shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHere are <b><span class=\"cred\">THE RULES:</span></b><br>\r\n(If you break 'em, I'll delete your chapter, simple as that.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1: You CAN have some breast/butt expansion, just don't overdo it. Like I said, that's not the focus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2: You CAN kill anyone you feel like, excluding Gwenpool. You wanna have Captain America thrown into a volcano? Go right ahead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3: The following is NOT ALLOWED:<br>\r\na) No weight gain/body inflation<br>\r\nb) No toilet stuff, that includes farting/piss. (Ye nasties)<br>\r\nc) No sex, some masturbation is okay if you're not <i>too</i> graphic.<br>\r\nd) No TG/Futa stuff<br>\r\ne) No highly detailed gore. You can have brutal action, but don't make me uncomfortable by vividly descriving each character's puss wounds. Yuch.<br>\r\nf) No male growth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n4: No one-sentence/non eventful chapters. If you're under 150 characters, you're doing something wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n5: No instantaneous growth. I don't want anything with \"and then she was 1000 feet tall\". That's lame. Don't be lame. You need to at least attempt to describe the growth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n6: Don't end the story without messaging me first. I <i>probably</i> will tell you that you can't, but if the story string has been going on for a while, and you're pretty sure there's not anywhere else you can reasonably take the story, then I might give you the go ahead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHere are <b><span class=\"cblue\">THE GUIDELINES:</span></b><br>\r\n(It's not a big deal if you break these, depending on the situation I might edit your chapter some)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1: Don't overuse your made-up background characters. If you want a supporting cast, you already have literal hundreds of characters you can already choose from.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2: You can totally have other characters besides Gwenpool grow some. And while I don't encourage it, I'll let you make another character grow more than her. (As long as you don't shift the perspective away from Gwenpool we're all good.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3: You should really have a competent level of writing skill. You don't have to be amazing (god knows I'm not), but if you're frequently making obvious grammatical mistakes, spelling errors, and pouring out broken sentences, I'm gonna have to go in and fix that. (Also for this particular guideline, if the chapter you post is unsalvageably bad, I'll probably have no choice but to delete it. Just be aware.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n4: I recommend you have a basic level of knowledge on the characters you chose to write about. As in, you should probably have a baseline understanding of any powers they have or their basic personality traits. Beyond that it doesn't matter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n5: Try to keep the pacing relatively consistent. If the chapter path so far has been slow growth, don't massively speed it up out of nowhere. If it's been pretty fast thus far, don't have it come to a screeching halt. (Although the latter is easier to get away with) Same goes for whether it's focused more on giantess or muscle growth, don't randomly switch focus with no warning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOkay, I think that is everything that I wanted to bring up. I hope I don't come off as too strict, if you feel like you'd want to add a chapter, please do so, and enjoy.</td>",
