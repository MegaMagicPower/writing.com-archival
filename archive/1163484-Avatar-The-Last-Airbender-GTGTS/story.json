Don't be so silly, it takes more than that to offend me.\"<br>\r\nZuko looked relieved but not reassured he remained silent,staring off into the night sky,he had done this many times before to help him think ,\"I know what it feels like,\" he said as he gently placed his hand on her shoulder,\"I know what it feels like to be so completely alone.\"<br>\r\nShe looked away,\"I've never felt alone,\" she said,\"and now I have a home, and this is the best place that I've ever lived in.\"<br>\r\nRaven laughed suddenly,causing Zuko to give her a side ways look,\"I'm sorry my prince,\"She said,\"I was however remembering the look on our not so beloved commanders face when you beat him in the Agni Kai.\"<br>\r\nHe couldn't resist a smile the child's smile was contagious,\"That was indeed a memorable moment,\" He replied,as a shiver ran up his back,\"for a few seconds i thought i was going to be the one to lose.\" <br>\r\nThe girl smiled as she replied \"I knew you would come out the victor.\" <br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

After a few pushes a small fountain of water came out of the person\u2019s mouths followed by a few coughs<br>\r\nNaruto breathed a sigh of relief and sat back down on the ground<br>\r\n\u201cWhat a day\u201d he moaned as he though about what had happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatruto\u2019s Camp<br>\r\nToph woke up in the early morning when the dew was still fresh on the ground and the sun was just beginning to rise bathing the sky in a deep orange glow<br>\r\nShe sat up in yawned contently<br>\r\nToph could hear some of the early waking animals just beginning their days and scampering around in the woods nearby and she could feel the cold dew on the grass beneath her and some on her clothes<br>\r\nShe let out a deep breath and just enjoyed the peacefulness of the early morning around her as she sat up off the ground<br>\r\nThen she realized something was off<br>\r\n\u201cWhere\u2019s that Naruto guy?\u201d she asked curiously<br>\r\nToph could not hear his snoring and she could not feel any vibrations nearby that showed he was there<br>\r\nOf course her earth powers and senses were still not at full power thanks to the holes that were still in her legs<br>\r\nShe could feel things around her but it was a lot weaker and she couldn\u2019t feel too far<br>\r\nToph again tried to get up onto her feet<br>\r\nLike last time her legs gave way after about three seconds on her wobbly feet<br>\r\nShe came crashing down on her butt with a painful thud<br>\r\n\u201cOwww\u201d moaned Toph rubbing her sore bottom a bit<br>\r\n\u201cWhere the heck is that kid?\u201d asked Toph annoyed doing her best to listen for any sound that meant he was nearby<br>\r\nShe focused as hard as she could to listen to what was around her<br>\r\nToph heard a faint sound nearby through some trees that sounded like running, jumping, grunting<br>\r\nIt sounded like a fight!<br>\r\nToph turned in the direction the sound was coming from quickly<br>\r\n\u201cIs the Fire Nation back?\u201d she asked slightly worried<br>\r\nFor a second she thought that Naruto had run off to tell about her to the Fire Nation troops that might be in the area<br>\r\nBut then she realized that wouldn\u2019t make sense<br>\r\nShe heard fighting but if he had just told about her there shouldn\u2019t be any fighting<br>\r\nToph quickly realized that Naruto couldn\u2019t have told on her<br>\r\nThen she thought that Naruto could be under attack or something<br>\r\nShe tried to get up and head to the noise but she couldn\u2019t walk<br>\r\nToph then began to crawl over to where the noise was at a slow pace<br>\r\nRiver <br>\r\nAfter a few minutes of painful crawling Toph came onto the river where Naruto had found her half-dead the day before<br>\r\nShe staggered past some trees and stopped behind a bush<br>\r\n\u201cHere\u2019s where the sounds came from\u201d said Toph<br>\r\nShe was confused by the fact that she didn\u2019t feel anything nearby besides that river she really hated<br>\r\n\u201cWhere is he?\u201d asked Toph confused<br>\r\nThen she heard the sound of someone walking or\u2026splashing?<br>\r\nToph didn\u2019t feel anything but she was sure she heard splashing<br>\r\n\u201cAll right! At this rate I\u2019ll be better at chakra control than Sakura!\u201d came a voice Toph recognized as Naruto\u2019s<br>\r\nNaruto was busy training by walking on water<br>\r\nToph couldn\u2019t feel him since he wasn\u2019t on land<br>\r\n\u201cNaruto?\u201d asked Toph coming out from behind the bush she was hiding behind<br>\r\n\u201cWhhhhhaaaa!\u201d<br>\r\n(Splash!)<br>\r\nNaruto was caught off guard by Toph coming out of nowhere and lost focus and fell into the water he was walking on<br>\r\nHe got back to the surface of the water and looked over at where Toph was<br>\r\n\u201cGeez don\u2019t do that\u201d said Naruto annoyed<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the heck are you doing? Swimming?\u201d asked Toph going over to the bank of the river and sitting down<br>\r\n\u201cNo I\u2019m training\u201d said Naruto<br>\r\n\u201cThis early?\u201d asked Toph surprised<br>\r\n\u201cOf course I need to train hard!\u201d said Naruto seriously<br>\r\n\u201cWhat for?\u201d asked Toph curiously<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve got to get stronger!\u201d said Naruto determinedly<br>\r\n\u201cWhy?\u201d asked Toph curiously<br>\r\n\u201cTo become the Hokage!\u201d said Naruto fiercely<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s so important about doing that?\u201d asked Toph<br>\r\n\u201cWhat! You\u2019ve got to be kidding me! It\u2019s a huge deal to be Hokage!\u201d shouted Naruto<br>\r\nToph had no idea what the Hokage was but based on how Naruto was acting she guessed it was really important to him<br>\r\nShe figured that it was probably some sort of position like general or king<br>\r\n\u201cOk if you say so\u201d said Toph mostly disinterested<br>\r\n\u201cSo you get up this early to train always?\u201d asked Toph<br>\r\n\u201cYeah\u201d said Naruto as he finally got out of the water<br>\r\nHe shook off a bit of the water after he got onto the bank next to Toph<br>\r\n\u201cHey careful!\u201d said Toph annoyed as she got some water on her from Naruto<br>\r\n\u201cSorry\u201d said Naruto<br>\r\nHe then sat down next to Toph on the sandy river\u2019s bank<br>\r\n\u201cIs this where you found me yesterday?\u201d asked Toph as she put her feet in the water a bit to relax<br>\r\n\u201cYup you weren\u2019t breathing or anything. I almost had to use mouth to mouth\u201d said Naruto<br>\r\nToph understandably nearly turned red at the comment<br>\r\n\u201cIt was kind of funny actually. For a second I thought you looked like a girl!\u201d said Naruto to make light of the situation<br>\r\n\u201cHa ha yeah\u201d said Toph weakly<br>\r\n\u2018He still hasn\u2019t figured out I\u2019m a girl!\u2019 thought Toph amazed<br>\r\n\u201cSo what are you training for?\u201d asked Toph curiously<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s for the Chunin exams\u201d said Naruto<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s a Chunin exam?\u201d asked Toph<br>\r\n\u201cWhat? You don\u2019t know what the Chunin exams are!\u201d asked Naruto shocked<br>\r\n\u201cShould I?\u201d asked Toph<br>\r\n\u2018How can she not know what a Chunin exam is?\u2019 though Naruto<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s the test you have to take to be a Chunin\u201d explained Naruto<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s a Chunin?\u201d asked Toph<br>\r\n\u201cWait! You don\u2019t know what a Chunin is?\u201d asked Naruto surprised<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, what is a Chunin?\u201d asked Toph<br>\r\n\u201cYou aren\u2019t a ninja are you?\u201d asked Naruto<br>\r\n\u201cWait you\u2019re ninja?\u201d asked Toph<br>\r\n\u201cYeah I said I was from Hidden Leaf Village, everyone knows they have the biggest and most powerful ninja army\u201d said Naruto<br>\r\nNaruto was confused now<br>\r\nThis Toph guy had no idea about common knowledge like ninja ranks or the hidden villages<br>\r\nHe could not understand how Toph didn\u2019t know this stuff that almost everyone knew<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve never heard of it\u201d said Toph honestly<br>\r\n\u201cI said it was the Land of Fire\u201d said Naruto<br>\r\n\u201cYou mean the Fire Nation?\u201d asked Toph again<br>\r\n\u201cWhy do you keep calling it that?\u201d asked Naruto<br>\r\n\u201cYou honestly mean to tell me you don\u2019t know about the Fire Benders, Hundred year war, and Fire Lord?\u201d asked Toph<br>\r\n\u201cWhoa! What are you talking about?\u201d asked Naruto surprised<br>\r\nThe two of them were now very confused<br>\r\n\u201cI just don\u2019t get it, you talk about stuff I don\u2019t know like everyone knows about it and I talk about this that everyone knows and you don\u2019t have a clue\u201d said Toph<br>\r\n\u201cYeah it\u2019s totally weird!\u201d said Naruto<br>\r\n\u201cJust who are you?\u201d asked Toph<br>\r\nThe both of them realized they had never bothered to find out more about each other last night<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m a ninja from Hidden Leaf Village\u201d said Naruto<br>\r\n\u201cTell me more about it\u201d said Toph<br>\r\n\u201cHow about you tell me more about you?\u201d asked Naruto<br>\r\n\u201cWell first off I\u2019m a Earthbender\u201d said Toph<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026what\u2019s that?\u201d asked Naruto with a confused look<br>\r\nLater <br>\r\n(Don\u2019t think I\u2019m lazy I just don\u2019t have time to talk about the entire series every time they have to explain stuff to someone)<br>\r\nThe two talked for a while into the morning by the river<br>\r\nToph explained about bending to Naruto who thought the idea of using elemental attacks without using handsigns was awesome<br>\r\nHe was also surprised when Toph told him that she/he was a powerful earthbender (She left out why her earthbending was so powerful)<br>\r\nShe also told him about the hundred year war with the Fire Nation and how she though he might\u2019ve been from the Fire Nation because he said he was from the Land of Fire<br>\r\nNaruto understood why Toph was reluctant to tell him about himself why he though that he might\u2019ve been from this evil Fire Nation place<br>\r\nToph also talked about how she had been so powerful that the Avatar had asked her\u2026wait begged him to train him in Earthbending<br>\r\nNaruto looked at Toph with amazement<br>\r\nHe was shocked to see that this guy only around his age was so powerful in this Earthbending that he had been begged by this all-powerful Avatar guy to be his sensei<br>\r\nNaruto imagined this Avatar person to be some huge tough looking guy with amazing attacks capable of leveling entire villages in one blow<br>\r\nHe was also enraged when he heard about all the stuff the Fire Nation had done; about all the people driven from their homes, people put into slave labor, and even genocide<br>\r\nNaruto could\u2019ve sworn he felt his chakra become more powerful and wild as he heard about this Fire Nation<br>\r\nIt was almost like his demon chakra was being released with every word<br>\r\nNaruto was pretty sure his demon was getting riled up about something but he figured it was just because he was mad<br>\r\nWhen Toph was done she asked Naruto about his world<br>\r\nNaruto began explaining about how he was from a village of ninjas<br>\r\nHe told Toph about how he could use jutsu to do a lot of different things<br>\r\nToph found the fact that he had to do handsigns to attack annoying but she knew these \u201cjutsu\u201d provided a lot of possibilities that any bending couldn\u2019t match<br>\r\nNaruto told her about how he and his team were going out into the woods to train for<br>\r\nthe Chunin exam in peace when he was attacked<br>\r\n\u201cHey I think I know what is going on!\u201d said Toph<br>\r\n\u201cReally what?\u201d asked Naruto intrigued<br>\r\n\u201cWell based on what you said I think that you\u2019re from another world\u201d said Toph<br>\r\n\u201cReally!\u201d asked Naruto<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I\u2019ve heard Aang talk about the spirit world. What if there is more than those two worlds? I think you are from another world\u201d said Toph<br>\r\n\u201cReally? That would explain a lot\u201d said Naruto thinking about it<br>\r\n\u201cBut what happened to my team then?\u201d asked Naruto<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe they ended up here also, either that or they ended up in other worlds\u201d said Toph<br>\r\n\u201cOh No! Then how will I find them?\u201d asked Naruto in a panic<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe Aang can help\u201d suggested Toph<br>\r\n\u201cYou think so?\u201d asked Naruto<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, he\u2019s into all sorts of weird stuff so he might know what to do\u201d said Toph<br>\r\n\u201cAll right! Where can I find this guy?\u201d asked Naruto excitedly<br>\r\n\u201cI got separated from them on a cliff up river, I need to find them\u201d said Toph<br>\r\n\u201cSo how can we find them?\u201d asked Naruto<br>\r\n\u201cAll we have to do is follow the river until we find the cliff I fell from\u201d said Toph<br>\r\n\u201cHow\u2019ll we know it\u2019s the right place?\u201d asked Naruto<br>\r\n\u201cLook for signs of a battle\u201d said Toph<br>\r\n\u201cOh\u201d said Naruto<br>\r\n\u201cSo how\u2019ll we get there? I still can barely walk\u201d asked Toph<br>\r\n\u201cI guess I can carry you on my back\u201d said Naruto unsure<br>\r\n\u201cWhat!\u201d asked Toph surprised with a blush<br>\r\n\u201cWell it\u2019s either that or you crawl\u201d said Naruto<br>\r\n\u201cFine\u201d said Toph still slightly red in a slightly stubborn tone<br>\r\nNaruto knelt down next to Toph and turned around<br>\r\nToph hesitantly wrapped her arms around Naruto\u2019s neck and held on tight<br>\r\nShe couldn\u2019t help but blush<br>\r\nToph might\u2019ve been the world\u2019s biggest tomboy but even she couldn\u2019t help but be affected by something like this<br>\r\nNaruto stood up slowly and tired to get his balance with the weight of Toph and his backpack on his back<br>\r\n\u201cWow you\u2019re heavier than you look\u201d said Naruto with a strained voice as he struggled a bit<br>\r\n\u201cAre you calling me fat?\u201d yelled Toph angrily<br>\r\n\u201cWell you ain\u2019t a feather!\u201d said Naruto back<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe you\u2019re just weak!\u201d yelled Toph<br>\r\n\u201cGeez I though only girls got this upset about weight\u2026well Choji too\u201d said Naruto<br>\r\n\u201cJust get walking!\u201d yelled Toph<br>\r\n\u201cFine! Which way do I go?\u201d asked Naruto<br>\r\n\u201cFollow the river upstream, you\u2019ll have to find a way up onto the cliffs\u201d said Toph<br>\r\n\u201cGreat I have to climb up some cliffs while carrying this guy\u201d said Naruto annoyed under his breath<br>\r\n\u201cQuit complaining!\u201d yelled Toph<br>\r\n\u201cWow good hearing\u201d said Naruto impressed<br>\r\nNaruto then began walking with Toph on his back upriver<br>\r\nThe Cliff <br>\r\nAfter a while Naruto finally managed to find the cliff<br>\r\nIt was around lunchtime when Naruto finally walked near the ledge of the cliff Toph had fallen off the day before<br>\r\nHe was pretty sure this was the place<br>\r\nThe ground was cracked from Toph\u2019s earthbending, trees had been uprooted violently nearby, there was various projectiles embedded in the ground, and several areas had been burned<br>\r\nNaruto could tell there was a battle here from the condition of the area<br>\r\n\u201cHey is this the place?\u201d asked Naruto to Toph who was getting bored riding on Naruto\u2019s back<br>\r\n\u201cPut me down\u201d said Toph<br>\r\n\u201cOk\u201d said Naruto unsure why Toph had to be put down in order to tell him if this was the spot<br>\r\nNaruto put Toph on the ground gently<br>\r\nToph could tell from the ground that it was the spot<br>\r\n\u201cYeah this is it\u201d said Toph<br>\r\n\u201cWow looks like a serious fight broke out here\u201d said Naruto at all the damage<br>\r\nNaruto looked around the area while Toph sat nearby<br>\r\nHe saw all the damage and thought that whoever fought he was strong<br>\r\nNaruto could even see where Toph\u2019s blood had been spilled next to the cliff and the hole Azula had blasted in the bushes<br>\r\nHe also bent down to inspect the needles and other projectiles embedded in the ground<br>\r\nUpon inspection he could defiantly see that they looked a lot like the ones pulled from Toph\u2019s legs<br>\r\nHe even picked up all the projectiles he could carry<br>\r\nAll he had was the shuriken and kunai he had brought with him and even one or two demon wind shuriken in his backpack<br>\r\nHe had no idea when he could get more ninja weapons if he ran out<br>\r\nThey looked to be of good quality and he figured that if he could spare wasting his own weapons he should<br>\r\nThe projectiles looked different from his regular ones and all had red on them but he figured a shuriken was effective no matter how it looked<br>\r\nNaruto then looked closer at the trees<br>\r\nHe was wondering what could be powerful enough to rip those trees out like that<br>\r\n\u201cHey what happened to those trees?\u201d asked Naruto pointing over to them<br>\r\n\u201cTake me to them\u201d said Toph<br>\r\nNaruto helped Toph walk/limp over to the trees<br>\r\nShe could feel that they had been yanked out of the ground<br>\r\nToph guessed that only Aang\u2019s airbending was powerful enough to take out the trees that easily<br>\r\n\u201cThis is Aang\u2019s work\u201d said Toph<br>\r\n\u201cYou mean that Avatar guy did this?\u201d asked Naruto in shock<br>\r\n\u201cYup, he used his airbending to rip these trees out\u201d said Toph<br>\r\n\u201cWow!\u201d said Naruto impressed<br>\r\n\u201cWhere are they?\u201d asked Naruto looking around for any signs of Toph\u2019s friends<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know\u201d said Toph<br>\r\n\u201cCould they have been captured by those people who attacked you?\u201d asked Naruto<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know, I don\u2019t think twinkle toes would go down that easily\u201d said Toph knowing Aang wouldn\u2019t be brought down easily<br>\r\nNaruto looked around for any signs of what happened to them<br>\r\nHe spotted some footprints leading away from the site<br>\r\n\u201cHey here are some footprints!\u201d said Naruto to Toph<br>\r\nNaruto helped Toph limp over to the prints<br>\r\nThe two bent over the footprints and looked at them<br>\r\nToph could feel the footprints in the ground and recognized them<br>\r\nShe could feel that they were her friends based on how deep they were<br>\r\n\u201cThey were running\u201d said Toph upon inspecting them<br>\r\n\u201cHow can you tell?\u201d asked Naruto<br>\r\n\u201cThey\u2019re far apart and deep. If they were walking they would be light and close together\u201d explained Toph<br>\r\n\u201cOh\u201d said Naruto<br>\r\n\u201cDid they get captured then?\u201d asked Naruto<br>\r\n\u201cNo\u201d said Toph<br>\r\n\u201cHow can you tell that?\u201d asked Naruto<br>\r\n\u201cSee these other prints?\u201d asked Toph pointing to another set of three prints nearby that headed in the same direction<br>\r\n\u201cYeah who are they\u2019s\u2019?\u201d asked Naruto noticing Toph didn\u2019t even look at the prints as she pointed at them<br>\r\n\u201cThose belong to the people who attacked us\u201d said Toph<br>\r\n\u201cHow can you tell that?\u201d asked Naruto<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019d recognize those prints anywhere\u201d said Toph<br>\r\n\u201cOk I guess\u201d said Naruto still a bit confused<br>\r\n\u201cThey\u2019re also running prints, that means they were chasing my friends\u201d said Toph<br>\r\n\u201cSo your friends escaped?\u201d asked Naruto<br>\r\n\u201cProbably, if they had been captured the Fire Nation\u2019s troops they would still be around here. We haven\u2019t seen a hint of the Fire Nation all day so that means the Fire Nation must be chasing after them\u201d said Toph<br>\r\n\u201cSo they escaped?\u201d asked Naruto<br>\r\n\u201cProbably\u201d said Toph<br>\r\nNaruto put Toph on the ground to rest as they talked<br>\r\n\u201cSo what do we do?\u201d asked Naruto<br>\r\n\u201cWe were heading to Ba Sing Se to talk to the Earth King, I\u2019m guessing they would still be heading there\u201d said Toph<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s Ba Sing Se?\u201d asked Naruto<br>\r\n\u201cThe Earth Kingdom capital, it\u2019s a huge city surrounded by massive walls, it\u2019s one of the only safe havens from the Fire Nation\u201d said Toph<br>\r\n\u201cAlmost too much of a safe haven\u2026\u201d added Toph under her breath<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d asked Naruto not hearing that last part<br>\r\n\u201cAh nothing\u201d said Toph<br>\r\n\u201cSo we should head to the city?\u201d asked Naruto<br>\r\n\u201cYeah if Aang is still heading to the city we might be able to catch up to him if we head there too\u201d said Toph<br>\r\n\u201cOk sounds like a good plan!\u201d said Naruto enthusiastically<br>\r\n\u201cYeah but we\u2019re going to have to hurry, if the Fire Nation is on there tail still Aang and the others will be moving fast\u201d said Toph<br>\r\n\u201cOk let\u2019s go then!\u201d said Naruto beginning to walk away<br>\r\n\u201cHello? Forgetting something!\u201d yelled Toph after him<br>\r\n\u201cHe He oops!\u201d said Naruto nervously<br>\r\nNaruto came back and picked Toph back up<br>\r\n\u201cSo which way do we go?\u201d asked Naruto as he helped Toph to her feet and supported her<br>\r\n\u201cThe way the footprints are heading duh!\u201d said Toph on Naruto\u2019s back<br>\r\n\u201cOh yeah\u201d said Naruto embarrassed<br>\r\n\u201cYou had better speed up if we\u2019re going to stand any chance of meeting up with Aang\u201d said Toph seriously<br>\r\n\u201cOk! I\u2019ll show you speed!\u201d yelled Naruto hyperly<br>\r\nHe then did a ninja jump high into the air<br>\r\nToph screamed in surprise when she felt they weren\u2019t on the ground<br>\r\nNaruto landed on a tree branch in the forest with a scared looking Toph on his back<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the heck was that? Airbending?\u201d screamed Toph in an angry and scared tone<br>\r\nNaruto looked down until he spotted footprints on the ground heading in the right direction<br>\r\n\u201cHold on!\u201d he shouted to Toph<br>\r\n\u201cHey wait!\u2026\u201d began Toph frightened<br>\r\nBefore she could finish Naruto began leaping on tree branches following the footprints at high speed<br>\r\nToph screamed as they flew through the air<br>\r\nShe could only see when they touched a tree branch and the vibrations went through the tree<br>\r\nIt was like only being able to see at certain intervals<br>\r\nThis was all she needed though to tell that they were going the right way<br>\r\nThat Night <br>\r\nAfter a full day of following the footprints at full speed with Toph on his back Naruto was beat<br>\r\nHe landed in a small clearing in the woods around sundown with a nervous, scared, and shaking Toph on his back<br>\r\nThankfully she had stopped screaming after about five minutes<br>\r\nNaruto couldn\u2019t help but notice Toph screamed like a girl but didn\u2019t mention it<br>\r\nAll that high speed jumping and being unable to see had taken affect on her and she kissed the ground happily when Naruto finally let her off<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t think I can do anymore jumping today\u201d said Naruto panting<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s alright\u201d said Toph just happy to be back on the ground<br>\r\n\u201cWe can rest here tonight, we covered a lot of ground today so I think it we\u2019ll be able to catch up with your friends soon\u201d said Naruto<br>\r\n\u201cSounds good to me\u201d said Toph<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll make camp while you rest\u201d said Naruto to Toph<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t need to rest\u201d said Toph<br>\r\nShe then tried getting up onto her feet<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d asked Naruto<br>\r\n\u201cSeeing if I can walk yet, the sooner my legs heal the sooner I can Earth Bend\u201d explained Toph<br>\r\nToph slowly got onto her feet<br>\r\nHer legs were shaky still but after a few moments she was able to stand<br>\r\nNaruto left her to do her rehabilitation while he went and set up camp and collected firewood for dinner that was, you guessed it Ramen!<br>\r\nAt the Camp Fire <br>\r\nNaruto and Toph sat down next to the fire when it was dark out<br>\r\nThey were waiting for Naruto\u2019s ramen to cook<br>\r\nToph had been working to stand for the last hour<br>\r\nAfter a while her legs got a bit steadier and she was able to stand on her own for a short while<br>\r\nShe tried walking too but was only able to get a few awkward steps a short distance before she fell<br>\r\nToph had also tried to do a little Earthbending<br>\r\nShe got into the steadiest stance she could and raised her hands forcefully<br>\r\nSure enough two small pillars of rock came out of the ground in front of her<br>\r\nShe was on nowhere near the scale of power she used to be but it was better than nothing<br>\r\nToph was willing to bet she might be able to make an earth tent that night for bed<br>\r\nNaruto told her that her legs couldn\u2019t have healed much over only one day and that it would be a while before she would be back to normal<br>\r\nShe was sick of waiting and relying on another but she had no choice<br>\r\nRight now the two of them were talking next to the fireside<br>\r\nCurrently they were on a subject that Naruto was a qualified expert in\u2026Ramen<br>\r\n\u201cAre you sure this stuff will be good?\u201d asked Toph suspiciously<br>\r\nShe had never heard of this ramen stuff and was unsure she would like it<br>\r\n\u201cOh course it\u2019s good!\u201d yelled Naruto<br>\r\n\u201cI never heard of this premade food stuff\u201d said Toph<br>\r\nNormally all the food in her world was fresh and made by cooks since they had no way to preserve stuff or package it<br>\r\n\u201cTrust me you\u2019ll like it!\u201d said Naruto happily<br>\r\nToph had skipped out on the ramen Naruto made the night before and she was starving so she knew she had no choice<br>\r\nNaruto could tell she/he was hungry too since Toph\u2019s stomach grumbling sounded like a 4.0 earthquake<br>\r\n\u201cSo what other stuff is there in your world?\u201d asked Toph<br>\r\n\u201cWell let\u2019s see, we have TV\u201d said Naruto<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d asked Toph<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s like a picture but it can move and you can hear what the people are saying\u201d said Naruto just unsure how to describe TV to someone who had never heard of it<br>\r\nBased on what Toph had told him Naruto guessed this world had little primitive science and no electronics at all<br>\r\n\u201cHow the heck does that work?\u201d asked Toph wonder just how it was possible to get a picture to move<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s too complicated to explain\u201d said Naruto<br>\r\n\u201cOh, you also said you have ninjas in your world right?\u201d asked Toph<br>\r\n\u201cYeah I\u2019m one of them, and when I finish the Chunin exams I\u2019ll be a real ninja!\u201d said Naruto excitedly and forcefully<br>\r\n\u201cYou said you were training for those things before you got warped here\u201d said Toph<br>\r\n\u201cYeah I just got done training with my temporary sensei and me and my team were going into the woods to work on coming up with some fighting moves\u201d said Naruto<br>\r\n\u201cBy sensei, do you mean sifu?\u201d asked Toph<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d asked Naruto unfamiliar with the word<br>\r\n\u201cIt means teacher\u201d said Toph<br>\r\n\u201cOh, yeah\u201d said Naruto<br>\r\n\u201cWho was your sifu?\u201d asked Toph<br>\r\n\u201cWell my normal teacher is a really weird guy that lead my team called Kakashi Hatake\u201d said Naruto<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s he like?\u201d asked Toph curiously<br>\r\n\u201cHe\u2019s really weird and mysterious, you wouldn\u2019t guess it at first but he\u2019s really powerful!\u201d said Naruto<br>\r\n\u201cWhat could he do?\u201d asked Toph wondering just what kind of powers he had<br>\r\nFrom all that Toph had heard of ninja she was beginning to believe they might be a lot stronger than your average bender<br>\r\n\u201cHe could do all sorts of stuff, he\u2019s really good at Taijutsu\u201d said Naruto<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s hand to hand right?\u201d asked Toph<br>\r\n\u201cYup, he can move so fast you can\u2019t see him!\u201d said Naruto<br>\r\n\u2018A bit of irony there\u2019 thought Toph<br>\r\n\u201cHe also has a ton of jutsu also\u201d continued Naruto<br>\r\n\u201cReally?\u201d asked Toph<br>\r\n\u201cYup! He is said to know over a thousand jutsu!\u201d said Naruto<br>\r\n\u201cA thousand different ways of attacking, now that sounds dangerous\u201d said Toph<br>\r\n\u201cYeah but he couldn\u2019t train me since he was busy training Sasuke\u201d said Naruto bitterly<br>\r\nToph was beginning to think Naruto didn\u2019t like this Sasuke guy based on how he talked about him<br>\r\n\u201cAnyway Kakashi got this closet pervert named Ebisu train me\u201d said Naruto bitterly again<br>\r\n\u201cCloset what?\u201d asked Toph<br>\r\n\u201cPervert! That guy couldn\u2019t keep his eyes off the girls, that guy was so pathetic I beat him in our first battle with one attack!\u201d said Naruto fiercely<br>\r\nToph though the guy had to be pathetic in order to lose to his student in their first battle with one attack<br>\r\nA little voice in her head told her that she had also done the same thing with Aang but she ignored that<br>\r\n\u201cThankfully I got a really good guy to teach me after he kicked the crud out of Ebisu\u201d said Naruto<br>\r\n\u201cWho was that?\u201d asked Toph<br>\r\n\u201cThis old guy called Jiraya\u201d said Naruto<br>\r\n\u201cWhat was he like?\u201d asked Toph<br>\r\n\u201cHe was a bigger pervert than Ebisu! I met him when he was spying on naked girls at the hot springs! He even writes a book that is nothing but naked women! It was actually Kakashi\u2019s favorite book\u201d said Naruto<br>\r\n\u201cAre all your teachers perverts?\u201d asked Toph<br>\r\n\u201cPretty much\u201d said Naruto<br>\r\nToph let out a half interested \u201chmph\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWas he strong?\u201d asked Toph<br>\r\n\u201cYeah! He might\u2019ve acted like an idiot and weird but this guy was the real deal! He was even stronger than Kakashi!\u201d said Naruto<br>\r\n\u201cSo you trained with him for the last month to get stronger?\u201d asked Toph<br>\r\n\u201cYup he showed me some really cool new tricks and attacks!\u201d said Naruto happily<br>\r\nToph scoffed when she heard this<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d asked Naruto<br>\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s just say I would hardly mind a teacher who was a pervert if he actually taught me new stuff\u201d said Toph<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d asked Naruto confused<br>\r\n\u201cMy parents got me a privet tutor in Earthbending, he was this really elite tutor who was just a moron\u201d said Toph bitterly<br>\r\n\u201cSounds like Ebisu almost\u201d commented Naruto noticing the similarities<br>\r\n\u201cYeah well my parents told him to take it easy on me since they didn\u2019t want me getting hurt and they thought I was totally helpless on my own\u201d said Toph<br>\r\n\u201cSo what happened?\u201d asked Naruto intrigued<br>\r\n\u201cHe kept me at basic drills forever and never let me do anything advanced because my parents wouldn\u2019t like it\u201d said Toph bitterly as she stared at where she thought the fire was<br>\r\nShe could still remember doing the same drills over and over again<br>\r\nAll baby steps that any new earthbender could do in their sleep<br>\r\nThe same things, move a pepple there, raise a small rock pillar here<br>\r\nEven in her severely weakened state she could do those with ease<br>\r\nIt drover her crazy!<br>\r\nShe hated being limited to rules and boundaries and here she was with a natural gift for earthbending doing basic drills!<br>\r\n\u201cWhat did you do?\u201d asked Naruto<br>\r\n\u201cI just got so sick of it that I just taught myself how to earthbend\u201d said Toph<br>\r\n\u201cReally? How\u2019d you do that?\u201d asked Naruto impressed<br>\r\n\u201cWell I found out a little from overhearing things from other earthbenders but other than that it was trial and error\u201d said Toph<br>\r\n\u201cWow that\u2019s so cool! I\u2019ve never heard of anyone becoming a master at anything just by teaching themselves!\u201d said Naruto impressed<br>\r\n\u201cWell I would\u2019ve gone crazy on just basic lines alone\u201d said Toph<br>\r\n\u201cSo how\u2019d your parents react? I bet they were impressed\u201d said Naruto<br>\r\n\u201cI didn\u2019t tell them\u201d said Toph<br>\r\n\u201cWhy?\u201d asked Naruto confused<br>\r\nIf he had singled handedly become a master ninja all by himself he would brag it to everyone<br>\r\n\u201cThey were waaaaay to over protective of me, they freaked if I so much as had a cut on my hand. If I told them they would never let me earthbend again. So I played along with the \u201cPoor little helpless Toph\u201d act until Aang and the others showed up looking for a earth bending teacher\u201d said Toph<br>\r\n\u201cSo you just acted weak to you teacher when you were becoming stronger?\u201d asked Naruto<br>\r\n\u201cYup, he and my father found out in a bad way. I got captured along with Aang by some elite earthbending fighters. My dad and teacher were watching in the stands as I trashed nearly a dozen elite earthbenders single handedly. I was hoping my dad would finally like how strong I had become\u201d said Toph<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m guessing he wasn\u2019t\u201d said Naruto<br>\r\n\u201cHe freaked and said I had too much freedom, I was to be placed under 24 hour watch and never allowed to leave the estate\u201d said Toph<br>\r\n\u201cHow\u2019d you end up with Aang?\u201d asked Naruto<br>\r\n\u201cI ran away\u201d said Toph with a happy smirk<br>\r\n\u201cSounds like you\u2019re better off on your own anyway\u201d said Naruto<br>\r\nThat was one of the best things Toph had heard in her life<br>\r\n\u201cSo do you think you\u2019ll ever go back?\u201d asked Naruto<br>\r\n\u201cPlease if I went back there odds are my dad would place me in a cage hanging off the ground for the rest of my natural life\u201d said Toph knowing the odds of that were good<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re a lot like me\u201d said Naruto<br>\r\n\u201cHow\u2019s that?\u201d asked Toph<br>\r\n\u201cWell everyone back home always underestimated me and treated me like dirt\u201d said Naruto<br>\r\n\u201cBeing treated like dirt doesn\u2019t sound that bad to me, at least I would get some peace and freedom\u201d said Toph<br>\r\n\u201cYeah well at least you got attention and people cared about you, you try having your entire village hate your guts\u201d said Naruto bitterly<br>\r\n\u201cYou entire village hated you? Why?\u201d asked Toph<br>\r\nNaruto looked down at where the seal had been for the fox<br>\r\n\u201cI can\u2019t say\u201d said Naruto quietly<br>\r\n\u201cBut anyway the point is that all our lives people had underestimated us and didn\u2019t take us seriously!\u201d yelled Naruto<br>\r\n\u201cI hear you on that\u201d said Toph<br>\r\n\u201cYeah and we have to show everyone that we deserve respect too and that we are stronger than they think!\u201d yelled Naruto fiercely<br>\r\n\u201cHow?\u201d asked Toph<br>\r\n\u201cWell I\u2019m going to become Hokage and you can get respect by helping defeat this Fire Lord guy\u201d said Naruto<br>\r\n\u201cHey! How about we help each other? Let\u2019s work together to finally get some respect!\u201d said Naruto fiercely<br>\r\nToph looked over and Naruto and smiled<br>\r\n\u201cYou got a deal\u201d she said happily<br>\r\n\u201cAlright and the first thing I want to do is challenge you to a fight as soon as your healed\u201d said Naruto<br>\r\n\u201cWhy?\u201d asked Toph<br>\r\n\u201cBecause if I can beat you I can become stronger! Plus I want to see how a earthbending master fights!\u201d said Naruto loudly<br>\r\nToph got a mischievous smile on her face<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re on\u201d she said happily<br>\r\n\u201cAll right!\u201d said Naruto fiercely<br>\r\n\u201cHey is that ramen stuff done yet?\u201d asked Toph<br>\r\nNaruto checked it<br>\r\n\u201cYup here you go\u201d said Naruto handing Toph the bowl<br>\r\nAs she ate she though that she was really starting to like this Naruto guy<br>\r\nIt had been a week or two after Toph and Naruto had stared traveling together and things were going very well<br>\r\nThey had made good time and were closing in on Aang quickly even though they could only guess where he was<br>\r\nThey had recently slowed down a bit since Toph had stared walking on her own and they traveled like that sometimes since Toph wasn\u2019t the biggest fan of the ninja jump<br>\r\nToph was healing at a very quick rate and was getting back to her old self quickly by practicing her earthbending to strengthen her body<br>\r\nShe had healed a lot quicker after Naruto had applied some of Hinata\u2019s medicine he had left over to Toph\u2019s wounds<br>\r\nHe was actually surprised when her wounds didn\u2019t just melt off like his did but then he remembered that it was Fox that healed him so rapidly and not her medicine<br>\r\nBut still they helped her heal and kept her wounds from getting infected which was good<br>\r\nThe medicine had stung a lot when first put on but Toph was strong and didn\u2019t show how much it hurt<br>\r\nToph had asked where he got the ointment and Naruto told her that a friend had given it to him right before she nearly got killed in a fight<br>\r\nShe told him she/he was glad to have it since it worked really well<br>\r\nNaruto was happy of that and wondered how Hinata and the others were doing back home<br>\r\nHe often wondered what had happened to his team and how things were going back at the village<br>\r\nNaruto then had a horrible realization that filled him with dread<br>\r\nThe Final Chunin Exam would be starting and he would miss it!<br>\r\nIf he couldn\u2019t find a way home soon he would miss out on the exams and officially Neji would win!<br>\r\nHe couldn\u2019t allow that to happen after what he did to Hinata and he thought about the subject every time he gave Toph\u2019s legs a new set of bandages and medicine<br>\r\nUnfortunately there wasn\u2019t anything he could do to get home quicker except catch up to this Aang guy quickly and pray he knew what was going on<br>\r\nBut that was a problem since he couldn\u2019t go too fast with Toph since she still couldn\u2019t get used to ninja jumping and she couldn\u2019t run too fast on her wounded legs<br>\r\nNaruto could only hope and pray things turned out well for him but didn\u2019t count on it with his long bad luck streak<br>\r\nEither way he found traveling with Toph to be fun<br>\r\nToph always respected him for some reason, he didn\u2019t know he was one of the very few people Toph respected, and Toph didn\u2019t treat him with hating like he had been all his life or classified him as the village idiot which most did in Hidden Leaf Village<br>\r\nHe was actually beginning to wish that he and Toph could be on a team together and he/she could replace Sasuke but he knew that wasn\u2019t likely<br>\r\nBut the one thing he really wanted was to finally have his battle with Toph\u2026<br>\r\nCamp, Early One Morning <br>\r\nToph got out of her earth tent with a yawn as she walked out into the bright morning sun that bathed the entire area in warmth<br>\r\nShe was happy she could walk fine on her own now and didn\u2019t have to ride Naruto anymore<br>\r\nToph\u2019s legs were still covered in bandages but they were steady and Toph got used to it even if they did make bending them or itching harder<br>\r\nShe had even heard Naruto talk about this guy called Rock Lee that used to train so hard his arms always had bandages on them so she thought she was lucky<br>\r\nToph walked near the pile of ashes that had been the fire the pervious night looking for Naruto since he usual slept near the fireside<br>\r\nShe couldn\u2019t feel him in his sleeping bag or anywhere nearby<br>\r\n\u201cWhere did he go off again to?\u201d she asked annoyed<br>\r\nHer question was suddenly answered when she felt a kunai knife come flying past her head from behind so close it cut a few hairs<br>\r\nToph jumped in shock at the attack before turning around to see where it had come from<br>\r\nShe didn\u2019t feel anyone on the ground anywhere around and looked around confused<br>\r\n\u201cOk who\u2019s there!?\u201d she demanded fiercely in a fighting stance<br>\r\n\u201cGlad to see you\u2019re up finally!\u201d joked Naruto from some unknown location<br>\r\n\u201cNaruto!? Where the heck are you!?\u201d yelled Toph unable to sense him<br>\r\n\u201cUp here! Believe it!\u201d shouted Naruto happily<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d asked Toph confused<br>\r\nShe looked towards where she heard the voice come from<br>\r\nIf she could see she would have seen Naruto hanging upside down from a tree branch that was positioned high over her earth tent with a smug look on his face<br>\r\n\u201cPretty cool huh?\u201d asked Naruto in a bragging tone thinking Toph would be amazed he could hang upside down from a tree branch using only chakra<br>\r\nToph had no idea what he was doing and just gave a half interested \u201cWhatever\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cGhaaaaa! What!?\u201d asked Naruto in shock and frustration seeing Toph wasn\u2019t impressed a bit and almost acted like he couldn\u2019t see him<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s going on? Why did you attack me?\u201d asked Toph mildly annoyed<br>\r\n\u201cOh that\u2019s easy! To make sure you\u2019re fully awake!\u201d said Naruto happily<br>\r\n\u201cFor what?\u201d asked Toph<br>\r\n\u201cOur battle!\u201d yelled Naruto excitedly<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d asked Toph confused<br>\r\n\u201cYou promised me we could battle as soon as you got strong enough to fight again! From what I\u2019ve seen you\u2019re ready\u201d said Naruto excitedly<br>\r\nToph got an excited and confident smirk on her face as she closed her eyes<br>\r\nWhen she opened them she looked at where Naruto\u2019s voice was coming from and pointed at him<br>\r\n\u201cOk whenever you want to fight I\u2019m ready!\u201d yelled Toph confidently at Naruto<br>\r\n\u201cNow that\u2019s what I wanted to hear!\u201d said Naruto happily with a smirk on his face<br>\r\n\u201cSo when do we fight?\u201d asked Toph<br>\r\n\u201cRIGHT NOW!!!\u201d shouted Naruto as he jumped of the tree onto the ground in front of Toph\u2019s earth tent<br>\r\nWhen Toph felt him land she got into fighting position but didn\u2019t attack<br>\r\nNaruto stood up and got into a fight stance also<br>\r\n\u201cWow you don\u2019t bother with formalities do you?\u201d asked Toph playfully holding her stance<br>\r\n\u201cNinja can attack from anywhere and anytime so we are taught to be ready to battle anytime and not to create and opening by delaying battles\u201d said Naruto<br>\r\n\u201cWhatever let\u2019s fight!\u201d said Toph<br>\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s try not to kill each other, ok?\u201d asked Naruto<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re the only one who should be worrying about that!\u201d shouted Toph tauntingly with a smile<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t underestimate me yet!\u201d shouted Naruto to the amusement of both fighters<br>\r\n\u201cShow me what you can do first, then I won\u2019t underestimate you\u201d joked Toph<br>\r\n\u201cEnough talking let\u2019s fight!\u201d shouted Naruto<br>\r\n\u201cFine by me\u201d said Toph<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m going to kick your butt, BELIVE IT!!!\u201d shouted Naruto pointing his fist at Toph<br>\r\n\u201cBring it on Ninja Boy!\u201d shouted Toph pointing at Naruto while looking away for a second (Naruto has a Toph nickname now!)<br>\r\nNaruto VS. Toph <br>\r\nFight!<br>\r\nToph starting things off by sending a small wall of solid rock right at Naruto with a stomp<br>\r\nNaruto quickly dove out of the way of the wall just as it was about to hit him<br>\r\nThe rock wall crashed into Toph\u2019s earth tent with a bang and both were horribly smashed upon impact<br>\r\nWhen they collided small pieces of rock were sent flying everywhere as Naruto hit the ground and ran around to Toph\u2019s side<br>\r\nHe hoped to hit Toph from the sides or back or in Toph\u2019s \u201cblind\u201d spots (Pun intended)<br>\r\nNaruto rushed up to Toph as fast as he could and was about ready to strike<br>\r\nIt looked like a clean hit since Toph wasn\u2019t even looking at him and made no move to doge at all<br>\r\n\u2018This is too easy\u2019 thought both Toph and Naruto as Naruto charged<br>\r\nBefore Naruto could react Toph raised a rock wall in defense that Naruto slammed into like bird into a sliding glass window<br>\r\n\u201cOwwww\u201d moaned Naruto as he staggered back reeling in pain from the clever move<br>\r\nWhile he was busy moaning in pain Toph quickly attacked him while he was distracted with one of her favorite moves she loved to practice on Sokka<br>\r\nToph blasted Naruto into the air with a pillar of rock beneath his feet<br>\r\nNaruto was sent flying through the air while screaming at the top of his lungs<br>\r\nWhen Naruto hit the ground with a dull painful thud Toph hit him with another pillar attack<br>\r\nShe continued this pattern and juggled Naruto for a good five hits before letting him hit the ground normally<br>\r\n\u201cOww\u201d moaned Naruto in pain on the ground<br>\r\n\u201cBeing hit by rocks hurt more than I thought\u201d moaned Naruto on the ground while Toph looked on smugly<br>\r\n\u201cIs this fight over already? That was too easy!\u201d said Toph happily<br>\r\n\u201cGrrr! Not a chance!!!\u201d yelled Naruto frustrated jumping to his feet and shrugging off the pain<br>\r\nHe then began another charge right at Toph while screaming a battle cry<br>\r\nToph reacted by creating and then kicking several rocks at Naruto as he charged her<br>\r\nNaruto dodged out of the way of the rocks that Toph sent at him as he ran and continued charging her at full speed<br>\r\n\u2018Wow he\u2019s pretty fast\u2019 thought Toph impressed as Naruto ran at her<br>\r\nNaruto\u2019s ninja reflexes allowed him to dodge the rocks without too much trouble and his speed allowed him to get close before Toph realized it<br>\r\nWhen he was close he gave Toph a powerful flying kick to the face before she could realize it<br>\r\nToph got sent flying back from the hard blow and skidded along the ground in a cloud of dust for a few feet before coming to a stop<br>\r\nShe didn\u2019t hesitate to counter attack and while on her back she managed to slam her fist into the ground and send a small earth shockwave at Naruto<br>\r\nNaruto jumped out of the way of the attack while Toph got back on her feet slowly<br>\r\n\u2018He\u2019s not bad, he\u2019s almost as fast as Aang maybe even faster. I can\u2019t let him get close again\u2019 thought Toph realizing Naruto\u2019s ninja speed could be a problem<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not a weak as you thought huh?\u201d asked Naruto confidently<br>\r\n\u201cThat still doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re going to win\u201d pointed out Toph<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019ll see about that!\u201d said Naruto charging her/him again so he could use more Taijutsu since he didn\u2019t want to use any ninjutsu just yet and Shuriken would kill Toph if they hit<br>\r\nToph got into a defensive stance as Naruto ran at her again<br>\r\nShe sent a few earth shockwaves at Naruto as he charged at her but he simply dodged this by jumping high into the air where Toph lost sight of him<br>\r\nWhile Naruto flew through the air he threw a smoke bomb at Toph\u2019s feet hoping to blind Toph so he could attack by surprise<br>\r\nHe didn\u2019t realize all Toph felt was an odd sensation on her skin like she was going through fog and smelled a weird odor<br>\r\nAs soon as Naruto landed next to Toph in the cloud he ran at her even though he was barely able to see her<br>\r\nToph felt Naruto land and got ready for him<br>\r\nShe merely suck her fist out to where Naruto was coming from and felt Naruto slam face-first into her fist<br>\r\nWhen the smoke cleared Toph was standing over Naruto who was moaning in pain and holding his nose<br>\r\n\u201cWill you just give up? You can\u2019t beat me\u201d said Toph to him<br>\r\nNaruto leapt to his feet in a frenzy and looked at Toph<br>\r\n\u201cOk that\u2019s it! No more playing around!\u201d yelled Naruto fiercely while pointing at Toph<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m fine with that\u201d said Toph smugly as she got ready to finish the fight by capturing Naruto between two rock walls<br>\r\nNaruto jumped out of the way of the walls before they could close in on him but then Toph began assaulting him rapidly with earthbending forcing Naruto to dodge all over the place to avoid the many rock pillars that came up from the ground around him<br>\r\nHe was slowly forced back away from Toph so he couldn\u2019t use any close attacks<br>\r\n\u2018This isn\u2019t good! I can\u2019t get close enough to attack him when he can use the ground to attack me! I have to find a way to get close to him without touching the ground\u2019 thought Naruto as he dodged all over the place<br>\r\nHe considered using shuriken since those didn\u2019t touch the ground and they were fast but those would also kill Toph or injure him<br>\r\n\u2018Wait a second\u2026shuriken! I know how to get close to him!\u2019 thought Naruto happily with a smirk<br>\r\nUnfortunately his moment of distraction at the thought was enough for Toph to catch him off guard and create two rock walls on both sides of him<br>\r\nToph then slammed them together in a massive collision of rubble<br>\r\n\u201cUh oh! I think I went a bit too far!\u201d said Toph worried she had killed Naruto<br>\r\nJust then Naruto came flying out of the dust unharmed<br>\r\nWhen Toph felt him land on the ground she realized he jumped out of the way before the attack hit so he was fine<br>\r\nBut she noticed something<br>\r\nHer vibration sense didn\u2019t let her make out colors or faces but shapes were no problem and she could see what looked like the blade of a sword in Naruto\u2019s hand<br>\r\nNaruto looked at Toph with a mischievous grin as the dust cleared behind him<br>\r\n\u201cOk, this battle ends now!\u201d said Naruto fiercely<br>\r\nHe then raised the blade that was in his hand up to his face much to the confusion of Toph<br>\r\nShe was wondering just what the heck that blade was and what Naruto was doing<br>\r\nSuddenly the blade unfolded into four separate blades with a ring in the center forming a huge shuriken<br>\r\n\u201cDemon Wind Shuriken: Windmill of Shadows!\u201d said Naruto holding up the massive shuriken<br>\r\n\u2018Whoa! That thing is huge! He can\u2019t honestly be thinking of using that?! He\u2019ll kill me!\u2019 thought Toph in shock<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you doing!? I thought you said no killing each other!?\u201d yelled Toph at Naruto<br>\r\nNaruto just smirked before jumping into the air and throwing the shuriken<br>\r\n\u201cTake this!\u201d he yelled as he threw the massive weapon<br>\r\nToph had no way of knowing where the shuriken was coming from so she couldn\u2019t block it or dodge it as it came right at her<br>\r\nThe giant shuriken flew at Toph as she just stood there looking worried<br>\r\nBefore Toph could react she heard the whirring of the shuriken as it flew past her head<br>\r\nShe let out a small gasp as she suddenly heard a poofing sound behind her<br>\r\nWhat she felt next was a huge surprise to her<br>\r\nShe felt someone land on the ground behind her but the only thing was that it was another Naruto!<br>\r\nNaruto had created a clone during the small cloud of dust earlier and had turned it into a shuriken<br>\r\nHe threw the shuriken at Toph and had it go behind him so that the clone turned back right behind him and was ready to strike<br>\r\nAnd Naruto knew just the attack\u2026<br>\r\nThe clone was right behind Toph and kneeling on the ground (You know what\u2019s coming)<br>\r\nNaruto gave a small laugh as he made the handsign<br>\r\n\u2018Now I\u2019ll get to know how Kakashi felt!\u2019 thought Naruto with a slightly evil smile on his face<br>\r\nToph was being cocky with him like he had been with Kakashi during the bell test so Naruto came up with the idea to \u201cdistract\u201d Toph the same way Kakashi had did to him<br>\r\n\u201cSecret Finger Technique: A Thousand Years of Death!\u201d yelled Naruto<br>\r\n\u2018What?!!!\u2019 thought Toph in a panic not liking the sound of that<br>\r\nThere was no possible way an attack called the Thousand Years of Death could be good and Toph quickly tried to put up some sort of defense<br>\r\nBut it was too late and Toph had no time to react<br>\r\nNaruto took his fingers and\u2026I\u2019d rather not have to describe it but I think you know what happened if you know Naruto<br>\r\nToph first got a look of disgust and embarrassment on her face before a second later the pain hit her like a freight train<br>\r\nShe went flying across the campsite after being launched with almost insane force grabbing her butt in pain and screaming loudly (Poor Toph but you have to admit that might mellow her out a bit)<br>\r\nToph landed face first across the campsite still grabbing her butt in pain with a look of both embarrassment and pain on her usually confident face<br>\r\n\u2018What hit me?!\u2019 thought Toph disoriented by the attack understandably<br>\r\nNaruto used the attack so he could distract Toph and deliver a finishing blow, which he was now going to do<br>\r\nHe ran at the downed Toph and got ready to finish the fight with one final blow before he had time to get up although it didn\u2019t look like he was just going to jump to his feet after that attack<br>\r\nNaruto ran at Toph as he laid on the ground in pain and was very vulnerable to attack. He jumped up into the air and did a flying kick right at Toph but was blocked by a wall of rock coming from the ground in front of her<br>\r\nNaruto quickly kicked off the wall before he could slam into it and landed a few feet from Toph<br>\r\n\u2018Wait! What the heck?! I thought he wouldn\u2019t be able to do earthbending just laying on the ground in pain like that!\u2019 thought Naruto confused thinking there was no way Toph could use earthbending without moving<br>\r\nToph was just as confused since she wasn\u2019t the one who had made that wall and did her best to feel who had done it<br>\r\nShe didn\u2019t have to wait long since the culprit soon came into their arena as Toph slowly got back to her feet on her bandaged legs<br>\r\n\u201cNot you\u201d moaned Toph as soon as she felt who it was<br>\r\nIt was a man in extremely dark green robes with white sleeves and little areas of yellow on the sides<br>\r\nHe looked to be of decent age with back hair tired into a bun on top of his head with some sort of little crown<br>\r\n\u201cYes me\u201d said the stranger in an sophisticated tone<br>\r\nToph looked at him with loathing while he looked at her with a stern look<br>\r\nNaruto looked at both of them as they continued their quiet stare down with confusion<br>\r\nHe quickly looked back and forth at the two with silent confusion before turning to Toph<br>\r\n\u201cHey Toph you know this guy?\u201d asked Naruto confused<br>\r\n\u201cYes he\u2019s the privet earthbending tutor my parents got me so that I wouldn\u2019t get past basics\u201d said Toph bitterly<br>\r\n\u201cYou mean the guy that\u2019s like Ebisu?\u201d asked Naruto<br>\r\n\u201cWho the heck is Ebisu?\u201d asked the Man confused<br>\r\n\u201cYes\u201d answered Toph<br>\r\n\u201cMy name is master Yu, I\u2019m Toph\u2019s earthbending teacher\u201d said the man<br>\r\n\u201cFormer teacher\u201d pointed out Toph bitterly<br>\r\nNaruto suppressed a few laughs at his name but couldn\u2019t hold it out for long before busting out<br>\r\n\u201cMaster You?!!! Ha Ha Ha! What a stupid name!\u201d said Naruto in fit of laughter<br>\r\n\u2018I\u2019ve always wanted to do that\u2019 thought Toph<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the heck did you interfere for?!\u201d demanded Toph angrily at her former teacher<br>\r\n\u201cI spotted this boy trying to attack you so I protected you, you should be thanking me\u201d said Master Yu in a sophisticated tone<br>\r\n\u201cChill out dude we were only having a sparing match, I wasn\u2019t going to hurt Toph badly\u201d said Naruto calmly<br>\r\n\u201cSparring?! You could be seriously hurt doing such things!\u201d said Yu in a disappointed tone<br>\r\n\u201cAw calm down man! It\u2019s not that big a deal, I only wanted to help Toph recover from his wounds by helping him get back to his normal strength\u201d said Naruto calmly<br>\r\n\u201cWounds?\u201d asked Yu worriedly<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, Toph got some seriously bad leg wounds after a battle. I actually pulled Toph half dead from a river a week or two ago after he fell off a huge cliff into a river\u201d said Naruto acting like a hero<br>\r\n\u2018I don\u2019t think he\u2019s going to like hearing that\u2019 thought Toph with dread expecting his reaction<br>\r\n\u201cWHAT!!?\u201d shouted Mater Yu in a furious tone<br>\r\n\u201cYup! I saved Toph\u2019s life!\u201d said Naruto happily<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the heck are you doing here?\u201d asked Toph suspiciously to change subject<br>\r\n\u201cYour father has sent me to retrieve you from being kidnapped by the Avatar\u201d said Yu<br>\r\n\u201cWhat!!? I thought you said you ran away!?\u201d asked Naruto shocked to Toph<br>\r\n\u201cI did, wait\u2026 my father thinks what!?\u201d asked Toph finally realizing what her former teacher had said<br>\r\n\u201cYou were kidnapped by the Avatar so you would be forced to teach him earthbending, I was sent to retrieve you. It appears as though I was a bit too late and you escaped on your own though\u201d said Yu<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s the dumbest thing I\u2019ve ever heard! I was not kidnapped!\u201d yelled Toph loudly<br>\r\n\u201cI suspected as much, I figured you ran away since you thought you could handle yourself in the real world. But based on what this boy with yellow hair had told me you barely survived up to this point. I\u2019m taking you home now were you\u2019ll be safe from the outside world\u201d said Yu<br>\r\n\u201cI have a name you know! It\u2019s Naruto Uzumaki!\u201d shouted Naruto at Yu<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not going back!\u201d yelled Toph angrily getting into a fighting stance<br>\r\n\u201cPlease don\u2019t be stubborn Toph, the real world is a dangerous place for a blind girl\u201d said Yu<br>\r\n\u201cWHATTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!?????????????????????\u201d yelled Naruto in shock at the top of his voice<br>\r\n\u2018Great! I have someone who treats me normally and doesn\u2019t pamper me and this idiot ruins it!!!!\u2019 thought Toph with a deep loathing of her former teacher<br>\r\n\u201cYou mean Toph is a girl and blind?!\u201d asked Naruto in shock<br>\r\n\u201cYes, didn\u2019t you know that?\u201d asked Yu calmly<br>\r\n\u201cImpossible! Toph it isn\u2019t true is it?\u201d asked Naruto to Toph<br>\r\nHe thought back on how Toph had acted and it was hardly ladylike<br>\r\nToph turned around and looked at Naruto giving him a good look at her eyes<br>\r\nNaruto could see how Toph\u2019s sea foam eyes were cloudy and never seemed to move<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s true my eyes are clouded by blindness\u201d said Toph sadly<br>\r\n\u201cAnd\u2026are you really a girl?\u201d asked Naruto weakly<br>\r\n\u201cYes, I\u2019m a girl\u201d said Toph sadly<br>\r\nNaruto then got a horrible thought in his head<br>\r\n\u2018I used a Thousand years of Death on Toph and if Toph is a girl then\u2026that means I stuck my fingers up a girl\u2019s... AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!\u2019 thought Naruto in horror<br>\r\nNaruto screamed loudly while shaking his hands in disgust<br>\r\n\u201cI can\u2019t believe I did a thousand years of death on a girl!!\u201d he yelled in shock and pain with a look of horror on his face<br>\r\n\u201cA thousand years of death?\u201d asked Yu confused<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s nothing\u201d said Toph embarrassed<br>\r\n\u201cAnyway I have been ordered to bring you back and I intend to even if you don\u2019t want to\u201d said Yu<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019d like to see you try\u201d said Toph seriously getting into a fighting stance<br>\r\n\u201cPlease don\u2019t be so stubborn, you\u2019re hurt and I don\u2019t want to harm you in a fight\u201d said Yu<br>\r\nToph growled bitterly at the last comment<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry about me! I can handle myself even if I am injured!\u201d yelled Toph furiously at him<br>\r\n\u201cI suspected this which is why we came prepared\u201d said Yu calmly<br>\r\n\u201cWe?\u201d asked Toph confused<br>\r\nJust then a small pouch came flying out of nowhere at Toph\u2019s feet where it exploded into a cloud of purple dust around her<br>\r\nToph coughed as she inhaled the purple dust even if she couldn\u2019t see it<br>\r\n\u201cWhoa! What was that!?\u201d asked Naruto looking around<br>\r\nHe spotted where the smoke bomb had come from and saw it had been throw by a muscular man with a dark green vest on and long dark hair standing on a nearby tree branch<br>\r\n\u201cNice shot Xin Fu\u201d said Master Yu to the man as he leapt down onto the ground<br>\r\n\u201cYou!!!\u201d shouted Toph angrily at the man in between coughs<br>\r\n\u201cTime for my revenge girl\u201d said Xin Fu evilly as he walked over to Yu<br>\r\n\u201cOk now who the heck is this guy?\u201d asked Naruto confused pointing at him<br>\r\n\u201cI beat him and his earthbending team when I saved Aang from being sold to the Fire Nation\u201d said Toph still coughing a bit<br>\r\n\u201cYes, and after your father hired both him and me to retrieve you\u201d said Yu<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the heck is this stuff?!\u201d demanded Toph still coughing on the dust<br>\r\nShe couldn\u2019t feel her body and for some reason she couldn\u2019t move<br>\r\n\u201cUgh! I can\u2019t move!!! What\u2019s going on!?\u201d yelled Toph in frustration and fear<br>\r\nToph fell onto her knees and couldn\u2019t get back up or even move a single muscle<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s a special herb dust that we prepared in case you or your friends fought back, it first paralyzes the body from the neck down so we could safely restrain you\u201d said Yu<br>\r\n\u201cGrrrr!\u201d growled Toph as she did everything she could to move but to no avail with her body totally paralyzed<br>\r\n\u201cThen it should put you into a very deep sleep for a while so we can safely get you back to your home and father\u201d said Yu<br>\r\n\u201cAnd our payment\u201d added Xin Fu<br>\r\nHe was right and Toph could already feel herself becoming weaker by the second like she really needed a nap<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2026won\u2019t\u2026take me\u2026back\u201d said Toph weakly slowly fading out<br>\r\nXin Fu just walked over to her and picked her up and carried her back to Yu on his back<br>\r\n\u201cThat was easier than I though, now let\u2019s go back and get our money\u201d said Xin Fu eagerly<br>\r\n\u201cAgreed\u201d said Yu<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026hate\u2026you!\u201d said Toph weakly as she was treated as dead weight by these two<br>\r\n\u201cNow Toph you should learn to appreciate just all your father is doing to protect you and make sure you\u2019re safe. You ran away and nearly died and were severely injured. It\u2019s obvious you cannot handle yourself\u201d said Yu in a stern tone to her<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll\u2026destroy\u2026you\u201d was all Toph could say back as she slowly became weaker<br>\r\n\u201cJust go to bed brat so we don\u2019t have to listen to you\u201d said Xin Fu in annoyance<br>\r\nThe two then turned around and began to head off leaving Naruto behind<br>\r\n\u201cHey wait!\u201d called out Naruto to them<br>\r\nThey both turned back to see Naruto who had watched the entire scene unfold<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d asked Yu looking at Naruto<br>\r\n\u201cWait a second! You\u2019re just going to walk away with Toph like that?!\u201d asked Naruto to them loudly<br>\r\n\u201cYes, I do believe that Toph\u2019s father owes you a great dept for saving his daughter\u2019s life. I think that he may reward you a bit for what you did\u201d said Yu expecting Naruto was asking about a reward for saving Toph<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t care! I still don\u2019t get what\u2019s going on! You say Toph is blind but I\u2019ve seen him, um her walking around fine all on her own for the past week!\u201d yelled Naruto to them<br>\r\n\u201cToph has the ability to use sound and vibrations to see what her eyes cannot, it\u2019s that power that makes her earthbending so powerful. I\u2019m sad to say she\u2019s been cursed with blindness since birth\u201d said Yu<br>\r\n\u201cSince birth?\u201d asked Naruto<br>\r\n\u2018So that\u2019s why Toph never told me she was blind or a girl, she must have been treated like a weak china doll all her life. I guess she thought if I knew I\u2019d treat her like she was weak also\u2019 realized Naruto thinking back to their talks of how they were underestimated and how Toph was treated as weak<br>\r\nHe also remembered how he loved being around Toph since she didn\u2019t know him or judge him as the village idiot or the carrier of the Nine Tailed Fox lik</span></div></div>",

was sitting around Aang and the other\u2019s campsite eating lunch and chatting with Katara<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of them had become very good friends in the time they had been traveling and were often seen talking, joking, or beating the crap out of Sokka for some dumb or sexist thing he had said<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka had quickly learned just how dangerous Sakura could be especially with that Genjutsu illusion stuff<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore than once after he had said something that those two didn\u2019t like he found himself in some sort of nightmare illusion that ranged from being covered in spiders to every animal he had ever eaten rising from the grave to kill him (That\u2019s a lot I\u2019m guessing)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd even more unfortunately the only way he had found of dispelling it was by whacking himself on the head with a club till he passed out<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAang enjoyed having her around since she was very helpful and always did her part so she didn\u2019t feel like dead weight<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey had quickly figured out Sakura had some kind of issue with that but didn\u2019t ask her about it<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone had pretty much gotten used to having her around and were loving her ninja skills<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore than once they had completely avoided the Fire Nation troops hunting them thanks to her ninja skills and training<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura picked up on enemy patrols coming their way and helped them sneak past the soldiers that occupied the forests looking for them<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzula had taken the liberty to make sure the Fire Nation had a strong presence in the area so that Aang couldn\u2019t escape but with Sakura\u2019s help they hadn\u2019t had to fight once since she joined<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer illusions made getting past Fire Nation troops so much easier that it was unbelievable<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura had once used an illusion so strong they walked right through a Fire Nation encampment that was packed with soldiers in broad daylight and not a single solider noticed them<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka had even made funny faces in the commander\u2019s face but he didn\u2019t even notice<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura also appeared to be interested in bending and Katara had tried to show her some waterbending but they got nothing for some reason<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatara said that perhaps she just couldn\u2019t bend like some people (Sokka)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura had volunteered to teach Katara and Aang some jutsu but they were too busy with bending to try (Thank god for that!)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was totally unaware of what would happen if Aang or Katara had tried it so she still had no idea the truth about benders and chakra<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn all things were going good but that wouldn\u2019t last for long\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo Katara do you have any idea what this Ba Sing Se place is like?\u201d asked Sakura as they all sat around eating fish for lunch (Minus Aang who was a vegetarian)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot really, Toph knew about that and said she had been there before, all I know is that it\u2019s a big walled city that is probably the last safe haven from the Fire Nation\u201d said Katara<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the mention of the \u201cT\u201d word Aang got a sad look on his face again that the others were used to seeing every time Toph was brought up<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAang still blamed himself for her death even though the others kept telling him that it wasn\u2019t his fault<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome nights Aang would have nightmares of Toph\u2019s fall being played over and over again as well as Toph yelling at him for causing her to die<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt reflected in the real word as well<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor some reason no matter how hard he tried he couldn\u2019t do even simple earthbending techniques that he had used before<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone was worried that this could cause some problems in his training and kept trying to cheer him up<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSounds nice I hope we get there soon\u201d commented Sakura wondering if the city was anything like Hidden Leaf Village<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe should be there in a few days\u201d said Sokka pulling out a map he had stolen from the library<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe are in this huge patch of woods near the city\u201d said Sokka pointing to a large green area of the map that was close to the city<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat about this thing here?\u201d asked Sakura pointing to a large blue area that separated the woods from the city<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s a huge lake that boarders the city that acts as a natural defense from invasion, it\u2019s so big that it takes a few days to get across it\u201d said Sokka<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow are we getting across that?\u201d asked Sakura<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know\u201d said Sokka embarrassedly<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019ll figure out a way when we get there right now we just need to get out of these woods safely\u201d said Aang seriously<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe wanted to get to Ba Sing Se and be safe from any more surprise attacks or Firebenders<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAang was determined to not let anyone else die and was going to make sure they all got out of this safely for Toph\u2019s sake<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young Avatar clenched his fists together as he thought about Azula for a brief second<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAang are you ok?\u201d asked Katara worriedly seeing him acting weird again<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m fine\u201d said Aang trying to sound normal even though Katara could see through his false tone in a second<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk I\u2019m just worried about you\u201d said Katara in a caring voice<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t be just worry about yourself, as long as you an the others are safe I\u2019ll be happy\u201d said Aang in an unusual tone to Katara<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk I guess\u201d said Katara unsure if that was a good sign or not<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Katara! Can you go get us some more water from that stream we passed earlier? We need some more for our canteens\u201d asked Sokka loudly from the other side of camp breaking the tense mood<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy do I have to?\u201d asked Katara<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBecause you\u2019re a waterbender and it\u2019s a women\u2019s job to get stuff for the men\u201d said Sokka smugly<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA second later her realized he shouldn\u2019t have said that<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next thing he knew there was a giant 50 foot angry looking Katara in front of him roaring like Godzilla before trying to crush him<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe screamed as he ran for his life from it trying to crush him under its foot<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the others saw was Sokka running around screaming while looking over his shoulder at some unknown attacker<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIT\u2019S GOING TO KILL ME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\u201d he screamed in terror as he ran<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat did you used this time?\u201d asked Katara happily to Sakura had her hands in a Genjutsu handsign<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAttack of the 50 ft Katara\u201d replied Sakura simply as she watched Sokka run around crazily<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI need to learn how to do that\u201d said Katara with a smirk as Sokka ran around<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell that should last about ten minutes I\u2019m going to get the water since I need to wash my hair anyway\u201d said Sakura grabbing their canteens and walking off<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey fill this up for me will you?\u201d asked Katara as she threw Sakura her water pouch that she needed refilled since Momo had accidentally drank from it<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo problem\u201d said Sakura as she caught the pouch and headed off into the woods to find a stream they passed earlier that morning as they walked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n15 Minutes Later, Campsite <br>\r\nThey were all lounging around the campsite waiting for Sakura to get back with the water<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatara was busy playing with Momo, Aang tried to get his earthbending to work again but still didn\u2019t get anything, and Sokka was busy recovering from his latest nightmare<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe laid on the ground panting hard after all that running and screaming he did before when suddenly another giant Katara loomed over him<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka screamed for a second before he realized that it was just the real Katara standing over him with Momo on her shoulder<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter can\u2019t a man handle some illusions?\u201d she asked tauntingly with a grin<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t afraid of the crushing part. It was your face that scared me\u201d replied Sokka<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy you little!\u2026\u201d roared Katara angrily before she was cut off<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOut of nowhere a red throwing knife came flying past her face missing it by not even half an inch<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt came so close to hitting her it actually made a little cut on the tip of her nose that began to bleed slightly<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe knife landed in a tree nearby with a thud and Aang looked at it for a second<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe knew who used knives like this in a second since the one who used them had hunted him<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Aang could shout a warning more knives came flying into their campsite right at Katara and Sokka<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatara reached for her water but found nothing and then realized it was being filled by Sakura<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had no way of blocking the knives and was about to be hit when Aang leapt in front on her and used a wind gust to knock them away<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDarn I missed\u201d said a dull voice<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMust be your injury\u201d reassured another cheery voice from the woods<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot them again\u201d said Sokka with dread<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as he said it Azula, Ty Lee, and Mai came walking out of the woods from where the knives had come from<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou!\u201d shouted Aang fiercely at Azula with hatred in his eyes<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot still mad about your little friend are you?\u201d asked Azula tauntingly to Aang<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAang growled at her like an animal ready to pounce and kill it\u2019s prey in one attack and you could almost see the aura of hate around him<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome back to fight us?\u201d asked Sokka seriously getting off the ground with his boomerang ready<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot today, you\u2019re in luck Avatar we\u2019re not in the mood to play with you today so we\u2019ll just do this the easy way\u201d said Azula<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d asked Katara worriedly not liking how that sounded<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzula smirked before she snapped her fingers which was the signal to move in<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore they knew it there were Fire Nation troops moving in from the woods all over the place<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn seconds Aang, Katara, and Sokka found themselves surrounded by an army of soldiers and Firebenders as far as they could see<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh oh! This isn\u2019t good!\u201d said Sokka looking around seeing nothing but red and black armor with small spots of silver for swords and spears<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally? I couldn\u2019t figure that out\u201d said Katara sarcastically<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey sarcasm is my bit!\u201d yelled Sokka angrily<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGuys we don\u2019t have time for this!\u201d yelled Aang pointing his staff defensively at a wall of Fire Nation soldiers<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs all this was happening Sakura finally returned to camp with the water<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was walking in the woods close to the camp when she heard a commotion up ahead at the camp<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d she asked worriedly hearing the sounds of a lot of people as well as weapons and armor clanking<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura decided to head back to camp stealthily in case something bad was going on<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe jumped into the trees and began silently making her way back to the camp to see what was going on and if the others were ok<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she got there she saw the image of Aang, Katara, and Sokka surrounded by tons of soldiers and two evil looking girls (Ty Lee does not look evil)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura squatted on a branch and peeked her face out of the thick green leaves just enough to fully see what was going on in the camp<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGive it up Avatar you can\u2019t possiblely be able to escape alive with your friends now\u201d said Azula in a taunting tone<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAang what do we do?\u201d asked Katara worriedly as they looked at all the soldiers<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was really bad<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey would have a hard time beating all the soldiers even with Toph and now she was gone, Katara had no water, and Sakura was not there<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe entire situation looked hopeless to them probably because it was<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on Avatar, give up now and I won\u2019t kill what\u2019s left of your companions\u201d said Azula knowing just what buttons to hit to unnerve Aang<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAang thought about it seriously as he looked through the seemingly endless ranks of the Fire Nation army<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf they fought back odds are they would die or at least one of them would be killed and Aang was not about to lose another friend<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeing a captive of the Fire Nation wasn\u2019t good but it was still better than death<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAang threw his staff to the ground with a defeated look on his face<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAang? What are you doing?\u201d asked Katara in shock to what she was seeing<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018What? He\u2019s giving up so easily?\u2019 thought Sakura surprised<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGuys back down\u201d ordered Aang seriously<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSmart idea Avatar\u201d said Azula with a grin<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019re just giving up?!\u201d asked Sokka shocked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf we fight back odds are that at least on of us will die, I don\u2019t care if it\u2019s me but I will not let you two die\u201d said Aang almost emotionless despite the fact his heart was filled with very painful emotions<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatara and Sokka looked at each other with concerned looks as they tried to decide what to do<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey knew Aang was right but it was just not right to give up so easily after all they\u2019ve done<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAang stepped forward to address Azula<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll give up and allowed myself to be captured so long as you do not harm my friends at all\u201d said Aang seriously to Azula<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can agree to that\u201d said Azula in an official tone<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow that was easier than expected we should have killed one of his friends ages ago\u201d said Mai amazed by how easy that was<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou made the right choice Avatar I\u2019m sure your comrade would have done the same thing\u201d said Azula<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the troops came forward and put cuffs on them they all thought the same thing<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToph would never have done that<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura watched as her new friends were captured and cuffed as prisoners and knew she had to do something<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe knew that right now the area was too hot to try anything so she needed to get away for a while, come up with a plan, and come back to set them free when it was not so dangerous<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura withdrew from the tree and slowly crept away from the camp and all the Fire Nation soldiers before they could discover her<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had the advantage of no one knowing she was there which would be invaluable during the escape plan so she didn\u2019t want to blow it<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNear Naruto\u2019s Campsite <br>\r\nAfter she cleared out of the area Sakura found a nice tree to relax in and plan what she was going to do about this mess<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe knew this was going to be a difficult if not impossible solo mission dealing with an army of enemies if she messed up<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura had never been the strongest of her group and had never handled this dangerous a situation before on her own<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had defended Naruto and Sasuke from the sound ninja in the Forest of Death but she almost gotten herself killed and she only survived thanks to the help of Guy\u2019s and Ino\u2019s teams showing up<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time there was no chance that allies would show up to help her out, she was truly all on her own on this one<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMan I wish I had Sasuke here or Kakashi, I\u2019d even be happy if Naruto was here\u201d said Sakura in a depressed tone<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018That\u2019s a new one, me being happy to see Naruto\u2019 thought Sakura<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe let out a weak laugh at the comment<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura was praying that anyone would show up to help her<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe imagined Lee, Sasuke, Ino, Kakashi, and Naruto come flying out from behind some bushes and saying they were there to help her (Lee of course doing his signature pose and Kakashi reading his dam book)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut she knew that wasn\u2019t going to happen no matter how hard she wished<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNope this is the eighth time you\u2019ve messed up that justu\u201d came a familiar voice faintly to Sakura<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh? What\u2019s that? Did someone just say jutsu?\u201d asked Sakura surprised looking around<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first she thought it was only her imagination since she was the only one who knew about jutsu in this world or so she thought<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey I\u2019m still new at this!\u201d came a girl\u2019s voice angrily through the woods proving Sakura wrong<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSomeone\u2019s there\u201d said Sakura unsure of what was going on<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe jumped down from the tree she was on onto the ground and began walking towards where the voices had come from<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk! Ok! Sorry! You don\u2019t have to be so moody\u201d said the first voice defensively<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait that voice! It couldn\u2019t be\u2026\u201d began Sakura she then began to move faster towards the voices<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe would know that annoying voice anywhere since she had often heard that tone before when she was angry<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe you should focus more on doing the handsigns right and not on doing them quickly\u201d came an older unknown voice<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHandsigns! They\u2019re talking about jutsu!\u201d said Sakura happily thinking that could only mean one thing<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright\u201d came the girl voice again<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura began to run towards the voices<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey what is it?\u201d asked the familiar voice confused<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI hear someone\u201d said the girl voice<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura stopped when she heard this<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhoever it was already knew she was there so she approached slowly with caution<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe could tell that she was close and the owners of the voices were just on the other side of some trees that were in her way<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhere?\u201d asked the familiar voice seriously<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura knew who that voice belonged to<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere\u201d said the girl voice<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura could just feel that they knew she was there and just decided to walk out<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto, Toph, and Jiraya\u2019s Campsite<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe walked around the tree and emerged in a small campsite like there own<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn front of her Sakura was shocked to see none other than Naruto standing with a girl around her age in white with hair tied in a bun as well as a weird looking old man she had never seen before with an odd headband that said \u201coil\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Naruto and Sakura stared at each other in shock<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo way\u201d said Naruto weakly<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNaruto?\u201d asked Sakura in disbelief<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSakura?\u201d asked Naruto in equal shock<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNaruto!\u201d yelled Sakura happily glad to finally see one of her teammates again<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSakura!\u201d yelled Naruto happy to finally see Sakura safe<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Naruto you know this girl?\u201d asked Toph wondering what was going on<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe\u2019s one of my teammates! She\u2019s the girl I told you about!\u201d said Naruto happily as he ran over to Sakura with a huge smile<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSakura I\u2019m glad to see you safe!\u201d said Naruto happily as he gave Sakura big hug<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m glad to see you Naruto but unless you want to die you\u2019ll let go right now!\u201d said Sakura in her demoness voice<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was happy to see Naruto but not that happy<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto quickly let go of her in fear<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Naruto let go Sakura began looking around the campsite rapidly looking for Sasuke or Kakashi hoping they would be with Naruto<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe already had dreams of Sasuke grabbing her in a warm embrace and saying how much he missed her and confessing his love to her<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Naruto are Kakashi and Sasuke around here?!\u201d asked Sakura excitedly looking around as fast as she could<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNope, I haven\u2019t seen a trace of them since I got here. I was hoping you had seen them\u201d said Naruto<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUgh! Great that means I\u2019m stuck with Naruto\u201d said Sakura sulking with disappointment<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018It\u2019s not fair!\u2019 yelled inner Sakura angrily<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey are we invisible or something?\u201d asked Toph loudly annoyed at not being noticed by whoever this girl was<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Sakura and Naruto watched as Toph and Jiraya walked over to them<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo she\u2019s one of your teammates huh?\u201d asked Toph to Naruto as she examined Sakura through vibrations<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYup, her name is Sakura Haruno\u201d said Naruto happily<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh yes I remember her, she decked you when you tried to hug her during your training\u201d said Jiraya remembering seeing Sakura before<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe remembered her because she had reminded him of another ill-tempered woman he knew that was just as violent<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura looked at these two in confusion for a second<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl looked like she might have been from this world based on the fact her clothes looked weird and appeared to be handmade<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile the old man looked like a ninja with a giant scroll on his back, a headband, and sandals<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe could tell this strange old guy was from their world and he was a ninja<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho are these two?\u201d asked Sakura wondering who on earth they could be and how come they were with Naruto of all people<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh let me introduce you!\u201d said Naruto happily walking over to Toph first<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is\u2026\u201dbegan Naruto before Toph cut him off<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can introduce myself ninja boy!\u201d said Toph forcefully<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Ninja boy?\u2019 thought Sakura confused<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy name is Toph Bi Fong\u201d said Toph proudly<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis hit Sakura immediately<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had heard a lot about Toph from the others over the past few weeks as they traveled but this couldn\u2019t possible be the same one<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe others had all told her about how they had witnessed Toph fall to her death over the side of a huge cliff weeks ago the same day she met them<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait a second! Toph Bi Fong? You mean the Toph the Blind Bandit?!\u201d asked Sakura in shock<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah\u2026how do you know my nickname?\u201d asked Toph suspiciously<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah how do you know Toph Sakura?\u201d asked Naruto confused<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou can\u2019t be the same Toph! Aang, Katara, and Sokka told me you were dead and that you died weeks ago the same day we arrived\u201d said Sakura not understanding how this was possible<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know Twinkle Toes, Sugar Queen, and the idiot Sokka?\u201d asked Toph surprised<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho?\u201d asked Sakura confused at Toph\u2019s nicknames<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAang, Katara, and that idiot Sokka\u201d repeated Toph<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes I met them the day I got here, the day they told me you died\u201d said Sakura<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo Aang and the others think I\u2019m dead?\u201d asked Toph<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes they told me you fell off a huge kill into the canyon below. How did you survive and how do you know Naruto?\u201d asked Sakura confused<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell that\u2019s easy, there was a river at the bottom of the canyon that broke her fall. She blacked out in it and floated down river. A little while after I got here I found her in a stream that the river flowed into and pulled her out half-dead. She was barely alive and I took care of her until she was better. We\u2019ve been traveling together since\u201d explained Naruto to Sakura<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo Naruto saved you and took care of you?\u201d asked Sakura to Toph<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, now explain to me how you know twinkle toes and the others\u201d said Toph<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAfter I got here I wandered the woods for a little while until Katara ran into me while running from some Fire Nation troops. They thought I was helping her and attacked both of us so I as forced to fight them with Katara. After I met Aang and the others they told me that Toph had just died and they were on their way to Ba Sing Se to get a new earthbending teacher and get Appa back. I decided to go with them to Ba Sing Se and hopefully run into someone from my team on the way\u201d explained Sakura<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHold on! Twinkle Toes is getting a new teacher!!?\u201d roared Toph angrily upon hearing this<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell he thought you were dead\u201d pointed out Naruto but that did little to calm Toph<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m going work him until he hurts in places he doesn\u2019t know about! I\u2019ll throw everything I got at him! How dare he get a new teacher!!!\u201d yelled Toph in a tone that could scare the Fox<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Boy that Avatar guy is in for hell when Toph catches up to him\u2019 thought Naruto<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSeems like there has been a very big coincidence here with Naruto meeting with Toph and Sakura meeting with the Avatar\u201d said Jiraya<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura then turned her attention to him when he said this and realized she still didn\u2019t know this guys story<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey who is this guy Naruto?\u201d asked Sakura<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh that\u2019s just my pervy sage, he was training me for the final exams in our world. He accidentally got transported here about two weeks ago\u201d explained Naruto<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey! Don\u2019t call me the pervy sage! I\u2019m am Jiraya the Toad Sage!\u201d said Jiraya proudly<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura gasped when she heard this name since she had read it many times before in books on great ninja<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDid you just say Jiraya the Toad Sage!?\u201d asked Sakura in shock<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes I did\u201d said Jiraya<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh my God! Naruto this is who has been training you?!\u201d asked Sakura urgently shaking Naruto violently<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes. Why? He\u2019s just a perverted old man\u201d said Naruto wondering why Sakura was making a big deal of it<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNARUTO! This guy is one of the Sanin! The three ninja of legend!\u201d said Sakura loudly to the clueless Naruto<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto looked at Jiraya for a second before bursting out laughing<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHa Ha! This old toad a Sanin!? Ha Ha! He\u2019s just a dirty old man! Ha Ha Ha Ha!!!!\u201d said Naruto rolling on the floor laughing<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t get any respect\u201d said Jiraya in a sulking tone as Naruto continued to laugh at him<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNARUTO!!! SHOW SOME RESPECT!!!\u201d yelled Sakura stomping on Naruto\u2019s face<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOw that hurt\u201d moaned Naruto in pain with a shoeprint on his face<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s she talking about? What are Sanin?\u201d asked Toph confused<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe Sanin are supposed to be three unbeatable, insanely powerful, legendary ninja. They are considered the strongest in the entire world back home. I\u2019ve read that all of them were very wise and skilled fighters with amazing abilities\u201d explained Sakura seriously almost quoting most books on them<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJiraya wise? HA HA HA HA!!!!!\u201d said Toph busting out laughing on the ground like Naruto had<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s a good one! Jiraya wise! I\u2019ve seen Naruto trick him so many times over the past two weeks it\u2019s not funny!\u201d said Toph still laughing on the ground a bit<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan\u2019t I get a pupil that doesn\u2019t think I\u2019m a complete idiot?\u201d asked Jiraya sulking as Toph laughed at him<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry for how they\u2019re acting mister Sage sir! They just don\u2019t realize how important you are\u201d said Sakura in a very respectful tone to Jiraya (Foolish Sakura giving respect to Jiraya, she probably won\u2019t think he\u2019s so great when she finds out he writes Icha Icha Paradise)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s no problem, the fact is that I never told them who I am\u201d said Jiraya<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait! So you mean you actually ARE one of the Sanin?\u201d asked Naruto surprised as Toph stopped laughing and sat up<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes I am one of the Sanin\u201d said Jiraya<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo one of the super powerful Sanin is a dirty old man who does nothing but drink and go after women?\u201d asked Naruto with a \u201cyou have got to be kidding me\u201d tone<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNARUTO! Will you shut up already!? How could you accuse a Sanin of something like that!?\u201d yelled Sakura as she beat him over the head<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura was foolish enough to believe that one of the Sanin couldn\u2019t possibly be a pervert or an idiot and that Jiraya was some wise and powerful guy who always knew what he was doing and was very serious<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoy was she wrong!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWill you quit hitting me?\u201d asked Naruto in pain with a lump on his head<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo you\u2019re actually one of those really powerful Sanin guys?\u201d asked Toph realizing he was serious now<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes\u201d said Jiraya seriously<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell if I can be a master earthbender and Aang could be the Avatar I guess it\u2019s possible\u201d said Toph<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks for the confidence\u201d said Jiraya sarcastically<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNaruto how did you get a Sanin to train you!?\u201d asked Sakura urgently to Naruto<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell he accidentally flattened my first trainer so I demanded he train me instead\u201d said Naruto<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is incredible! How could Naruto get a Sanin to train him?\u201d asked Sakura to herself<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018The Sexy Jutsu\u2019 thought Naruto<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhile this little reunion and revelations thing is fine I would like to know where Aang and the other two are\u201d interrupted Toph wanting to get back to Aang to give him a good beating\u2026um, \u201ctraining\u201d session<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat could be a problem\u201d said Sakura seriously<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy?\u201d asked Toph<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThey\u2019ve been captured by the Fire Nation\u201d said Sakura grimly<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWHAT!? How did that happen!?\u201d asked Toph angrily<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAang just sort of gave up and surrendered when he and the others got surrounded when I went to get water\u201d explained Sakura<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHE DID WHAT?!!!! TWINKLE TOES JUST GAVE UP!!!?\u201d roared Toph furiously<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEarthbending was all about standing your ground and not giving up and that little miserable wimp just rolled over and gave up!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToph was going to beat him to the edge of death when she got her hands on him<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe better pray the Fire Nation kills him because if I get my hands on him he\u2019ll be put through worse stuff than death!\u201d yelled Toph<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell last I saw they placed him, Katara, and Sokka in cuffs and were setting up camp\u201d said Sakura<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe have to go and get them\u201d said Toph seriously<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe couldn\u2019t beat Aang if the Fire Nation had him<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey hold on! They got an army and there are only four of us! We have to think this through before we try anything!\u201d said Sakura seriously<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s a good idea\u201d said Jiraya<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk what do we do?\u201d asked Toph<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe need to come up with a plan\u201d said Naruto<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes but first we should do a little recon of the camp and gather Intel so we can come up with a good plan\u201d said Jiraya<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright\u201d said Naruto, Sakura, and Toph<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan you lead us to the camp?\u201d asked Jiraya to Sakura<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure\u201d said Sakura<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright then let\u2019s pack up and move out we got a mission ahead of us\u201d said Jiraya<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFinally some action!\u201d said Naruto happily looking forward to some excitement<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToph, Jiraya, and Naruto gathered their things from the camp and set off with Sakura to find the Fire Nation camp<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFire Nation Camp<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile back at Aang\u2019s camp the Fire Nation troops and Azula had set up camp in a very short amount of time<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApparently being so important in the Fire Nation meant that you had a lot of people in mortal fear of you doing all your work very quickly\u2026or else<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzula\u2019s troops had brought in her tank/train/mobile home thing that carried all her stuff and unpacked it in amazing time<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore they knew it the Fire Nation troops had a very decent camp set up where Aang, Katara, Sokka, and Sakura\u2019s had been earlier<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was very simple with just a few small red tents set up in rows for the troops, a few bathroom tents, and of course a royal tent for Azula, Mai, and Ty Lee<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile they had also set up a cage in one corner of the camp for Aang, Katara, and Sokka<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMomo was in a smaller cage nearby screeching crazily<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAang had his staff taken away and his bending shut down by Ty Lee<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot that it mattered much since Azula knew he would never risk his friends getting hurt now with a escape plan<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatara was unbound since she couldn\u2019t bend without water, which they denied her (even going as far as to put the bathroom tent on the other side of the camp even though Katara wouldn\u2019t try that no matter how bad it got)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka was also unbound since all his weapons had been taken away and he was just a moron so they did not consider him a threat<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven though Aang and Katara where in a bad mood and they were all seemingly doomed that hardly stopped Sokka from flirting with Ty Lee through the bars of the cage<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey chatted on as Katara looked on annoyed<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo you worked for a circus before you got here?\u201d asked Sokka obviously interested in Ty Lee<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, it was my true calling\u201d said Ty Lee with a stupid look on her face as she talked with Sokka<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy are you here with the demon princess then?\u201d asked Sokka<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell Azula called a little louder and she was a childhood friend of mine so I said yes when she asked me to join her hunt\u201d answered Ty Lee<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow can anyone be a friend to that wicked witch of the east?\u201d asked Sokka looking at Azula who was busy yelling at some slightly imperfect soldiers to speed up with their work like she was a monster<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe went to the same school together and grew up together\u201d explained Ty Lee<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou went to school?\u201d asked Sokka (I think it\u2019s pretty obvious that he never went to one)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, it was a school for elite girls within the Fire Nation\u201d said Ty Lee<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMeet any boys there you liked?\u201d asked Sokka trying to sound cool and smooth<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm, Sokka she just said it was an all girls school\u201d interrupted Katara<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHa! Ha! Right I knew that!\u201d said Sokka embarrassedly<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTy Lee let out a few giggles at this<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re pretty funny\u2026and cute, maybe I can ask Azula if I can keep you prisoner in my room\u201d said Ty Lee teasingly with a smile<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka immediately blushed before trying to act all cool and impress her<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell a lot of girls think I\u2019m a great, wise, warrior with an amazing amount of charm and good looks\u201d said Sokka trying to act as cool as possible<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah right\u201d said Katara sarcastically in the corner<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you mind? I\u2019m trying to impress a girl here!\u201d whispered Sokka annoyed to his sister<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEver kiss anyone before?\u201d asked Ty Lee teasingly<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?!\u201d asked Sokka shocked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWana try it now?\u201d teased Ty Lee putting her face close to the bars<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka got a huge smile before he too went to put his face to the bars<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were mere inches away and dreaming about what would happened when suddenly someone pulled Ty Lee away from the bars<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Azula said no talking or flirting with the prisoners\u201d said Mai as she pulled Ty Lee away from the cage<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAww you\u2019re no fun!\u201d whined Ty Lee as she looked back at Sokka with disappointment<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy does it seem that every time something good happens for me it goes horribly wrong ten seconds later?\u201d sulked Sokka<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cQuit complaining we need to find a way out of this mess, not waste our time flirting with the enemy\u201d said Katara annoyed<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe\u2019s not an enemy!\u201d said Sokka defensively<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo she\u2019s just someone who hangs around with the evilest person in the Fire Nation\u201d said Katara sarcastically<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut she\u2019s really nice\u201d argued Sokka<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhen she\u2019s not fighting us\u201d argued Katara<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s just change the subject\u201d said Sokka wanting to change topic<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow are we going get out of this? We need a plan\u201d said Sokka seriously<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you think we should do?\u201d Katara asked Aang who had been sulking in the corner the whole time his thoughts riddled with guilt and uncertainty<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had given up but it had been to save his friends so that made it okay, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAang wasn\u2019t sure anymore of just what he should do<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo far his actions had lead to Appa being kidnapped, Toph being killed, and all of them being captured<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seemed anything he did or decided would lead to something else bad happening and he wasn\u2019t about to chance that<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know\u201d said Aang weakly<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell that helps a lot\u201d said Sokka sarcastically<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you think we should do first?\u201d asked Katara to Sokka<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe first thing we need is a plan to escape, then we need to focus on a way to get away from this camp safely\u201d said Sokka planning<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat should we do?\u201d asked Katara<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI overhead some of the troops talking, Azula is letting them all go to a nearby town for supplies in a little while that\u2019s a perfect chance to get away\u201d said Sokka<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWon\u2019t she keep some around as guards?\u201d asked Katara<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, she thinks we\u2019re helpless and that no body is going to come save us with Toph dead and Sakura\u2026wait were is Sakura?\u201d asked Sokka finally realizing she was gone<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe went to the stream to get water but never came back\u201d said Katara<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe could be our only hope to get out! When Azula\u2019s troops leaves she can probably use some ninjay trick or jutsu to get us out! Then all we have to do is sneak by Azula and the others to escape!\u201d said Sokka excitedly<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen would be the perfect time to escape<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlso as a bonus they had heard that Azula, Mai, and Ty Lee were injured in a battle recently and that\u2019s why she didn\u2019t want to fight<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTy Lee had suffered some minor breaks and had gotten massive headaches from a head injury<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had even complained of a few pains while she and Sokka were talking and he had even asked her if she was alright when she winced a little in pain<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMai apparently had a deep gash in her rib cage that was bandaged but still bled from time to time<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzula had suffered a few burns, several minor injuries, and had one bang cut off by some stranger with one eye or a red eye or something<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of them were hardly in full fighting condition and might be easy to beat if they could find a way to escape and fight them<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow do we tell her the plan and we still don\u2019t know where she is\u201d pointed out Katara<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI hadn\u2019t thought that far\u201d admitted Sokka<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s hopeless isn\u2019t it?\u201d asked Aang solemnly<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry I\u2019m sure it\u2019ll be fine\u201d said Katara trying to cheer him up<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside the Camp<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile Jiraya, Sakura, Naruto, and Toph arrived outside the camp and hid in the forest to spy on the Fire Nation<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow you weren\u2019t kidding about the army part\u201d said Naruto to Sakura as he looked at all the soldiers walking around the camp<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can handle that many troops! Twinkle toes shouldn\u2019t have given up and just fought them\u201d said Toph angrily<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think he was too scared of losing anymore friends\u201d said Sakura<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d asked Toph<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAang\u2019s been feeling pretty guilty about you dieing, he thinks it\u2019s all his fault\u201d explained Sakura<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo he lost his nerve because he thought he\u2019s responsible for me dieing?\u201d asked Toph<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes\u201d said Sakura<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell that still doesn\u2019t make giving up so easily right\u201d said Toph bitterly<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere are a lot of them Toph, it may have been a good idea to give up\u201d said Naruto<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWHACK! <br>\r\nToph decked Naruto right in the face plowing him into the ground<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat was that?\u201d asked Toph innocently<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNothing\u201d said Naruto weakly in pain on the ground<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s stop arguing and come up with a plan to save Aang and the others\u201d said Jiraya seriously looking over the place with his telescope<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat does Aang look like anyway?\u201d asked Naruto<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura grabbed Jiraya\u2019s telescope and looked around the camp until she spotted Aang, Katara, and Sokka in a cage in the corner<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere he is\u201d said Sakura<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet me see\u201d said Naruto as he took the telescope and looked at the cage too<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s him? He doesn\u2019t look big or powerful, and what\u2019s with the ponytail?\u201d asked Naruto looking at Sokka expecting the Avatar to be a big and muscular guy<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo that\u2019s Sokka, Aang\u2019s the other one\u201d said Sakura<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou mean the Avatar is a girl?!\u201d asked Naruto surprised as he looked at Katara<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure is\u201d said Toph with a smirk<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo he\u2019s the bald one with the arrows\u201d said Sakura<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto then finally looked at Aang through the telescope<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait you mean that little shrimp is the Avatar!? He looks about as threatening as a bunny!\u201d said Naruto looking at Aang amazed he was the super-powerful Avatar<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe\u2019s about as brave as one too\u201d added Toph<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet me see\u201d said Jiraya taking back his telescope and looking at Aang<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow he hardly looks like the type to win a war\u201d said Jiraya looking at the tiny little kid that was the Avatar<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo what\u2019s he like?\u201d asked Naruto<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell he\u2019s been really sad lately about losing Toph so I only saw him sulking and frustrated\u201d said Sakura<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe looks to be doing plenty of sulking now\u201d said Jiraya looking at Aang in the corner of the cage<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey something is going on\u201d said Sakura pointing at the camp where all the soldiers where gathering around Azula<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey who\u2019s the evil looking girl down there?\u201d asked Jiraya looking at the magnified face of Azula through the telescope and shuttering<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEvil looking? That\u2019s probably Azula the fire princess\u201d said Toph<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo that\u2019s Azula? Wow she\u2019s uglier than Katara described her\u201d said Sakura having heard many stories about Azula from Katara and Sokka<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho are the other two girls with her?\u201d asked Jiraya looking at Mai and Ty Lee<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe one in pink is Ty Lee a hand to hand specialist, the other in red is Mai a projectile specialist\u201d explained Toph<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow I never thought I would meet a bad guy that wore pink\u201d said Naruto looking at Ty Lee<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019d be careful, Katara told me about her. She can hit pressure points to shut off bending and paralyze the body. I make a note to avoid her since the last thing I like to be is helpless\u201d said Toph remembering how much she despised that feeling<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSounds almost like the gentle fist style of Neji\u201d commented Sakura knowing Neji could do the same thing<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHa a fight with her would be perfect training for the final chuin exams for me! Let me fight her\u201d said Naruto happily<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo a direct attack with all these troops would be too dangerous and even if we could plow through them there\u2019s the chance that Azula could kill the others if we get too close\u201d said Jiraya<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do we do?\u201d asked Naruto wondering what the plan was<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe first need to get those troops out of the equation\u201d said Jiraya<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat might not be a problem\u201d said Toph happily with a smirk<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d asked Naruto wondering what Toph could be talking about<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can hear what Azula is telling her soldiers from here, she\u2019s telling them that they\u2019ll be heroes back in the Fire Nation for capturing the Avatar. She\u2019s telling them to go to the nearby town and send the word to the Fire Nation as well as get supplies and to be back in five minutes\u201d said Toph able to make out Azula\u2019s orders even from their position<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe\u2019s sending all of them? Won\u2019t she keep so for protection and guard duty?\u201d asked Sakura surprised that it could be that easy<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThey\u2019re staying behind to guard them personally since they don\u2019t think that\u2019ll be a problem. They think Aang, Katara, Sokka, and Momo are powerless, they think I\u2019m dead, and they don\u2019t have a clue about you guys\u201d said Toph with a smile<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo they don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything capable of stopping them! They won\u2019t know we\u2019re coming at all!\u201d said Sakura happily<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019ll be able to catch them totally off guard!\u201d said Naruto happily knowing this is just what they needed<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut five minutes isn\u2019t a lot of time\u201d pointed out Toph<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo problem just leave it to me, I\u2019ll follow them and stall them at the town\u201d offered Jiraya<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAn entire army?\u201d asked Sakura amazed he was offering to face an entire army single-handedly<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course! I\u2019m a Sanin right? I can handle it\u201d said Jiraya proudly already forming a brilliant plan<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course you can! How could I forget you were a Sanin? I\u2019m sorry for doubting you\u201d said Sakura respectfully<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo problem just don\u2019t do it again\u201d said Jiraya<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI won\u2019t\u201d said Sakura<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou think we should tell her that he\u2019s not really that great?\u201d asked Toph quietly to Naruto watching Sakura making a fool out of herself by respecting Jiraya<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo let\u2019s wait for him to reveal how big a moron he really is\u201d said Naruto<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell I\u2019m off, while I\u2019ll stall the army you guys have to take out Azula and those other two and free your friends\u201d said Jiraya as he walked away following the leaving Fire Nation army to town<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Fire Nation troops marched single-file in formation down a dirt path to the local village while Jiraya\u2019s stalked them hidden in the trees<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey also brought along the main part of the tank to hold the supplies and left Azula\u2019s compartment back at the camp since it would just slow them down<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow do you think he\u2019ll stall them?\u201d asked Toph doubtful he could handle it<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe\u2019ll find some way, he is a powerful and wise Sanin\u201d pointed out Sakura to the annoyance of Naruto and Toph<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Jiraya and the army where gone all that was left were Naruto, Toph, and Sakura hiding, Azula, Mai, and Ty Lee doing guard duty, and Aang, Katara, Sokka, and Momo hanging in their cages<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverything was in an eerie calm and quiet so Naruto, Toph, and Sakura quieted down to whispers to avoid being heard by Azula<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey didn\u2019t want to blow the element of surprise they had<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tree of them snuck down to some bushes closer to the camp and hid behind them so they could get a closer look at what they were up against<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll three evil Fire Nation girls were doing various things to help pass time while guarding<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzula was practicing her fire bending movements and would sometimes send up a ball of blue flame as she practiced<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMai just looked bored and hung around under a tree playing with her knives and complained about how boring this was<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTy Lee did some cartwheels for fun but this was just a ruse so she could go back and forth in front of the cage to see Sokka since Azula would be mad if she knew she was trying to get close to a prisoner she liked<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka looked on and complimented her sometimes as she did her gymnastics moves in front of the cage<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite the seemingly relaxed mood of the scene things were tense for Naruto, Sakura, and Toph<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo what do we do guys?\u201d asked Naruto to the girls<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe you can use some genjutsu on them Sakura\u201d suggested Naruto<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know, they might be able to see through it if they\u2019re smart enough and Katara told me Azula isn\u2019t easily fooled by tricks\u201d said Sakura unsure<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s just fight them! It\u2019s 3 vs.3\u201d said Toph forcefully<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was more than eager to get revenge for what they had done to her<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure if we are a match for them Toph, they look pretty strong and they might try to harm Aang and the others if we get too close. We need a plan to attack and beat them quickly before they can try anything\u201d said Sakura seriously thinking it over<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow could they take down an entire Nation\u2019s strongest and most deadly team quickly by themselves<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet me crush them!\u201d came an evil and angry voice<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure that\u2019ll be so easy Toph\u201d said Naruto<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat? I didn\u2019t say anything?\u201d asked Toph confused<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat was me child\u201d came the familiar voice of the Fox in Naruto\u2019s head<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018What are you here for?\u2019 asked Naruto annoyed<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI came to ask about the seal since you haven\u2019t seen me about it yet\u201d said the Fox<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Now\u2019s not a good time, I\u2019ve got to beat these three evil fire girls and save the Avatar\u2019 said Naruto<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo that little airbender is the Avatar huh? He looks just like him\u201d said the Fox<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Who?\u2019 asked Naruto<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026Um no one, but anyway let me help you destroy them with my power!\u201d said the Fox<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Hey! I just want to beat them and free Aang, not kill them using Fox power!\u2019 said Naruto<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI do, I have some issues with the Fire Nation\u201d said the Fox<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Just leave this to me please. We need to come up with a plan, I want to help Toph get revenge on these three\u2026wait that\u2019s it! I just got a brilliant plan!\u2019 said Naruto<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat is it?\u201d asked the Fox<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018I suggest you stick around for the show since this is going to be really cool\u2019 said Naruto<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you planning?\u201d asked the Fox<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Well if everything works right Azula is in for a really big scare and a severe beating\u2019 said Naruto<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cScaring isn\u2019t as good as killing but it can be more fun when drawn out I suppose\u201d said the Fox<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto turned to Sakura and Toph who where both planning out what to do<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey guys I go a really good plan\u201d whispered Naruto excitedly<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally what is it?\u201d asked Sakura surprised since Naruto was hardly smart enough to be much of a plan guy<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThey still think you\u2019re dead right Toph?\u201d asked Naruto<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah why?\u201d answered Toph confused<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto began whispering his plan into the two girls\u2019 ears<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could see the smile break out on their faces as Naruto outlined his plan to them<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is going to be good!\u201d said Toph excitedly when Naruto told her his plan<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s brilliant Naruto!\u201d said Sakura really surprised by how clever the plan was<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah but I\u2019m going to nee both of you to do it\u201d said Naruto seriously<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can handle it\u201d said Sakura confidently<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo problem\u201d said Toph<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright now let\u2019s get into our positions and get ready to attack\u201d said Naruto<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToph and Sakura nodded before going where they needed to<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura disappeared into some trees while Toph sank under the ground to get ready for a great performance<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto stood where he was to get ready for his part and to enjoy the show<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was going to be awesome<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside the Fire Nation Camp<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhere are they?! They were suppose to be back after only five minutes!\u201d yelled Azula angrily as she waited for her useless troops to return<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey had been gone for seven minutes and Azula was hardly the one to forgive people under her command for failing to comply with and order even if it was next to impossible to do<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou did only give them five minutes to go to town, get supplies, and come back. That\u2019s kinda unrealistic\u201d pointed out Ty Lee<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI gave them a simple order and they disobeyed it! When they get back they are in deep trouble!\u201d yelled Azula angrily ignoring Ty Lee\u2019s reason while Mai just looked on indifferent<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow she looks mad\u201d commented Katara from the cage looking on as Azula raved and rampaged<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWomen are so temperamental\u201d said Sokka watching too<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat was that?!\u201d asked Katara offended<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNothing!\u201d said Sokka nervously<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAang didn\u2019t bother to look and continued sulking in the corner thinking about Toph and Appa and how he failed them<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Aang you should come watch this it\u2019s pretty funny\u201d said Sokka to Aang pointing at Azula<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo thanks\u201d he said weakly turning down the offer<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzula continued on her little rampage while raving on about what she was going to do to her troops who where now 8 minutes late<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven her descriptions seemed to cause pain as she described torture so horrible that if I typed it here my computer would crash<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI wonder why they\u2019re late?\u201d asked Katara<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho cares we still need a way to get out and escape and this would be the perfect time\u201d said Sokka<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOur only hope is Sakura but we don\u2019t know where she is\u201d pointed out Sakura<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe she\u2019s around here\u201d speculated Sokka \u201cShe could be using her ninja powers to be hiding in plain sight. Quick look for any moving rocks or people hiding bushes!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d asked Katara annoyed at her brother\u2019s stupid ideas<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe must have some illusion or something up to keep us from seeing her, we need to contact her somehow\u201d said Sokka looking around suspiciously<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOr she could just not be here\u201d pointed out Katara<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe probably abandoned us because she didn\u2019t want to get killed or captured like us\u201d said Aang in a depressed tone<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t say that Aang\u201d said Katara compassionately coming over to Aang and sitting by him<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s true! I\u2019ve just lead us into disasters again and again and lost two friends because of it! I won\u2019t lose anymore\u201d said Aang sadly<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAang it wasn\u2019t your fault. We got some good info from the library that could win the war and we can get Appa back when we get to Ba Sing Se\u201d said Katara<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut Toph is dead because of me and we can\u2019t get her back. I should have just took that fire blast and let her live\u201d said Aang sadly seeing that moment again when Toph fell<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t mean for it to happen and it was all Azula\u2019s fault not yours. The world still needs you to live and end this war so that the Fire Nation can\u2019t hurt anyone else. But we can\u2019t do that from this cage so we have to escape\u201d said Katara<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess\u2026\u201d said Aang in a distant tone<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh Aang\u2026\u201d began Katara but she was cut off by the ground suddenly shaking violently beneath them<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey all started panicking as the ground shook from side to side rapidly all over the camp with enough force to bring down several tents<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMomo\u2019s small cage jumped up and down upon the shacking earth him screeching inside<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside Ty Lee lost balance and fell to the ground while Mai and Azula struggled for balance<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAn earthquake!\u201d shouted Sokka as he held onto the bars of the cage to stay up<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEveryone hold onto something!\u201d shouted Katara urgently as she hold onto the bars with Aang<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMai and Azula held onto the support poles for a tent while Ty Lee struggled to get back to her feet and stand<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as suddenly as shaking started it suddenly stopped and everything calmed down in the camp<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs it over?\u201d asked Ty Lee<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think so\u201d said Sokka<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat was a short earthquake\u201d said Katara surprised<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t think that was an earthquake\u201d said Azula suspiciously looking around<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d asked Ty Lee<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly a pillar of rock came blasting out of the ground at Azula\u2019s feet and nearly hit her right in the face<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe barely was able lean backwards to avoid the direct hit to the face and she actually got a scrape on her chin from it<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzula, Mai, and Ty Lee got into positions and got into fighting stances while looking around seriously<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA earthbender! We\u2019re under attack!\u201d said Azula seriously<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhere are they?\u201d asked Ty Lee trying to spot any green robes that were a sure sign of Earthbenders<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter she said this a figure slowly rose out of the ground in front of them<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was small with it\u2019s backed arched, it\u2019s arms hanging limply at it\u2019s sides and it\u2019s head drooping down so the face couldn\u2019t be seen<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere you are!\u201d shouted Azula fiercely to this unknown person<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt just stood there not saying a word and not moving<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzula noticed something about this person<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey looked very familiar with their hair in a bun, bare feet, and two weird puffball things on the side of their head<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzula gasped in fear when she realized who it was<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cImpossible!\u201d she yelled at it actually looking scared and backing away slowly<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho is it?\u201d asked Ty Lee confused and shocked to see Azula scared<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo way!\u201d said Sokka also realizing who it was<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was deceased Toph standing before them<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only thing was that she looked like a zombie with dark green skin, tattered and dirty clothes, an evil look on her face, bad scratches and cuts all over her body, and several bloody holes in both her legs<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt can\u2019t be!\u201d yelled Mai actually scared backing away<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s Toph\u201d said Katara stunned looking at this undead Toph<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAzuuuulllaaaa!\u201d moaned the Toph zombie<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s not possible! I killed you!\u201d yelled Azula in fear<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve come back from the grave for revenge\u201d moaned the zombie slowly<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh hey it\u2019s that girl you killed Azula! Except you know, all zombiefied\u201d said Ty Lee in a upbeat clueless tone finally recognizing Toph<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cToph?\u201d asked Aang in shock from the cage<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll deal with you later twinkle toes!\u201d yelled the zombie<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis just can\u2019t be happening! People can\u2019t rise from the dead! This can\u2019t be real!\u201d yelled Azula fearfully backing away from the zombie<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTrust me this is real\u201d said the Toph zombie<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis has to be some kind of nightmare or something!\u201d said Ty Lee fearfully<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the girls were terrified (The unemotional Mai was even shocked a little) since they knew they could handle anything living but they didn\u2019t know if they could handle the living dead or spirits<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour nightmare is only beginning\u201d said the zombie with a smirk<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt least fifty other Toph zombies suddenly rose out of the ground all around them surrounding the three girls<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey randomly moaned and groaned as they crept out of the ground all facing Azula, Mai, and Ty Lee<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPrepare to face my wrath\u201d they all said at the same time<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow Toph is much scarier dead than alive\u201d said Sokka<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow can there be more than one of her?\u201d asked Katara<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cZombie powers duh!\u201d said Sokka<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere\u2019s no such thing!\u201d said Katara<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes there is, all spirits and mystical stuff have weird freaky powers! Just like Aang\u201d said Sokka<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow do you know?\u201d asked Katara doubtfully<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve heard a lot of ghost stories\u201d said Sokka<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re an idiot\u201d said Katara plainly<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile Azula, Mai, and Ty Lee where trying to figure out what to do with an army of undead Tophs surrounding them<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAhh they\u2019re going to steal our souls!\u201d yelled Ty Lee scared<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, zombies eat brains not steal souls\u201d said Mai<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis has got to be a trick or illusion or something\u201d said Azula fiercely thinking that was the only explanation<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sent a fire blast at a zombie to see what would happen to it<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fire blast hit a zombie but when the flames cleared the zombie was totally unscratched and just gave her a smirk<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can\u2019t hit it!\u201d yelled Azula<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll try\u201d said Mai grabbing some knives from under her robes and throwing them at the same zombie<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey just passed right through like the zombie like it was a ghost and landed in the grass behind it<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo good! We can\u2019t touch them!\u201d said Mai frustrated<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk it\u2019s my turn now!\u201d yelled three zombies as they got into earthbending stances<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey all slammed their feet into the ground and sent three pillars of rock right at Azula, Mai, and Ty Lee<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll three girls were hit right in the face by the pillars and sent flying backwards onto the ground<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHit you that time\u201d said all the zombie Tophs<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey skidded along the ground kicking up a dust trail for a few feet before stopping and sliding to a halt<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOw\u201d moaned Ty Lee<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer hit to the head during the fight with Sasuke had given her massive headaches recently at even little things so she was in serious pain after a direct blow to the face again<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s not fair, we can\u2019t hit them but they can hit us\u201d said Mai painfully as she and Azula slowly got back to their feet<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTy Lee was down for the count though after that direct hit and she stayed on the ground clutching her pounding head<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you ok?!\u201d asked Sokka concerned as he saw Ty Lee on the ground<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe\u2019s a bad guy remember?\u201d pointed out Katara again<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey undead Tophs!

Her entire body was aching, she felt like she had just had a boulder dropped on her, and she felt weak but she was still alive.She was surprised that she was still alive<br>\r\n\u2018I\u2019m alive? How?\u2019 she wondered surprised that she wasn\u2019t dead at the bottom of the river. She couldn\u2019t see where she was but she was able to feel a few things. The first thing she noticed was that she was laying on the grassy ground but the odd thing was that she had a blanket over her.Her earth senses told her that she was in a small open clearing away from the river she was drowning in earlier. She could feel a backpack on the ground nearby and she could hear a fire crackling nearby. Based on the fact that there was a fire going Toph guessed that it was night or early evening. It was actually late sunset when the sky was just turning dark. Toph could also feel that her legs were bandaged and the needles had been removed. She realized that someone must have saved her and taken care of her.\u2018But who?\u2019 she wondered<br>\r\nSuddenly she felt someone walk over to the fire that was going and sit down. Naruto had just returned with some fire wood to his campsite.It had been a little over an hour since he had saved the drowning stranger from the river. He had brought him (Naruto taught the person looked like a boy but he wasn\u2019t about to invade privacy and make sure) to this small clearing and made sure he was ok<br>\r\nNaruto was shocked when he noticed that the person had throwing needles stuck in their legs<br>\r\nHe had removed them and did his best with the first aid kit that was in his backpack<br>\r\nThankfully most ninja had some form of basic first aid training so he had did a pretty good job<br>\r\nThe wounds weren\u2019t serious or life threatening and would heal quickly.Naruto had been hit with a lot more needles than that during one of his battles and survived.The person still hadn\u2019t woken up so Naruto decided to set up camp and make the person was as comfortable as he could. Naruto was currently making a fire so he could cook some of the Ramen he had brought with him. As he put the wood on the fire and tended to it he wondered who this person was<br>\r\nHe figured that they had to be a fighter and have gotten into a fight based on the throwing needles in their legs. Naruto wondered his he was dealing with another ninja. The odd thing was he found no headband<br>\r\nBut some ninja didn\u2019t wear them so he couldn\u2019t it out<br>\r\nThen of course was the question of who they had been fighting. Based on the fact that throwing needles were used he could probably assume another ninja was involved. Perhaps it might\u2019ve been the same ones who took his team<br>\r\nHe was worried about all this<br>\r\nHe didn\u2019t know exactly where he was, his team was missing, and he now was with a strange person that was possibly a ninja maybe even a hostile one. Naruto hoped he wasn\u2019t getting involved in something bad<br>\r\nBut he knew that odds are that he was<br>\r\nAnother thing had been troubling him as well<br>\r\nThe strange blue spirit-looking guy had mentioned something about the fox. Naruto couldn\u2019t help but look at were the fox seal was when he thought about it<br>\r\n\u2018Could the fox have something to do with this?\u2019 wondered Naruto.He thought that wasn\u2019t possible since no one besides the adults in the Hidden Leaf Village knew he had the fox in him. But he knew if this did had something to do with the fox it was going to be bad. He was snapped out of his thoughts by the sound of a groan nearby \u201cUghhh\u201d moaned Toph \u201cHuh?\u201d asked Naruto as he looked over to where Toph was resting<br>\r\nHe saw Toph sit up with a little difficulty<br>\r\nToph\u2019s strength had still not returned and her entire body ached so getting up was hard<br>\r\n\u201cOh you\u2019re up\u201d said Naruto to Toph<br>\r\nToph turned and looked over at where the voice had come from. For the first time Naruto saw Toph\u2019s pale eyes,They reminded him of Hinata\u2019s almost\u2026<br>\r\nThey were pale like Hinata\u2019s but they had a green tint to them. Naruto wondered if he was dealing with a Hyuga clan member.He made a note to ask about the eyes later \u201cWhere am I?\u201d asked Toph<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re at my camp\u201d explained Naruto. Naruto got up and took a step forward.The vibration was enough for Toph to get a pretty good picture of what Naruto looked like. She was surprised when she found out that the person that saved her was only a boy about her age. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d asked Toph with a slight hint of pain to her voice. \u201cI found you face down in the river floating by, I jumped in and saved you\u201d said Naruto<br>\r\n\u2018So much for the others saving me\u2019 thought Toph disappointedly<br>\r\nShe wondered what happened to the others, Toph wasn\u2019t one to get emotional but she was hoping her friends got away safely.She knew she had to go back and see what had happened to them.Toph threw the blanket off and tried to get up \u201cWhoa! What are you doing?\u201d asked Naruto shocked \u201cThanks for the help but I have to get going\u201d said Toph stubbornly as she tried to stand on her legs. She barely got onto her feet when an intense pain struck her legs and she fell to the ground \u201cHey! Hold on!\u201d said Naruto as he walked over to help her. \u201cI don\u2019t need your help!\u201d shouted Toph as waved him off.She then tried to get up again. This time she got to her feet and barely stood up. The pain was intense and her legs were shaking madly but she was standing.<br>\r\nNaruto was shocked by this<br>\r\n\u2018Whoa! After all that and whoever this person is standing!\u2019 thought Naruto.He could also see that Toph was going to fall any second \u201cHey careful! You shouldn\u2019t be up right now! You were half dead when I pulled you from the river! You should rest now!\u201d said Naruto concerned\u201cI don\u2019t need your help, I have to go now\u201d said Toph fiercely. She then turned around and took several painful, slow steps away from Naruto<br>\r\nAfter about four steps her legs gave out and she fell face first into the ground<br>\r\n\u201cUm\u2026\u201d began Naruto<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t\u2026say\u2026 anything\u201d said Toph bitterly her voice muffled by the ground.Naruto walked over and pulled her up. He then helped support Toph by letting her hang onto his shoulder. \u201cI was telling you, you\u2019re way too badly hurt to be walking around now!\u201d said Naruto<br>\r\n\u201cAh shut up!\u201d said Toph bitterly<br>\r\nNaruto helped her limp over to the fireside and then put her down gently.He sat down next to her.<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t think you\u2019re going to be able to walk on your own for a while\u201d said Naruto<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t have a while\u201d said Toph bitterly<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the rush?\u201d asked Naruto curiously<br>\r\n\u201cNone of your business!\u201d shouted Toph<br>\r\n\u201cOk! Yeesh! Someone\u2019s in a bad mood!\u201d said Naruto defensively<br>\r\nThere was an awkward silence for a minute and a half before Naruto spoke up<br>\r\n\u201cSo who are you anyway?\u201d asked Naruto<br>\r\n\u201cIf you have to know my name is Toph Bi Fong\u201d said Toph.<br>\r\n\u201cReally? I thought you might have been of the Hyuga clan\u201d said Naruto<br>\r\n\u201cThe what clan?\u201d asked Toph confused<br>\r\n\u201cThe Hyuga clan, I have a friend called Hinata Hyuga and she has eyes a lot like yours\u201d said Naruto<br>\r\n\u201cReally?\u201d asked Toph curiously<br>\r\n\"So he knows another blind girl?\u2019 thought Toph<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, they\u2019re all pale and stuff except that hers are pure white while yours have green in them\u201d said Naruto.\u201cSo you know a blind girl?\u201d asked Toph<br>\r\n\u201cBlind? What do you mean? Hinata has good vision\u201d said Naruto confused \u2018Wait! He doesn\u2019t realize I\u2019m blind!\u2019 thought Toph shock.She guessed that either he was being nice or that she didn\u2019t look blind thanks to her earth senses. Toph decided to see how long it would take this kid to figure it out for fun.<br>\r\nAfter Naruto stopped talking there was another silence for a brief period<br>\r\n\u201cSo aren\u2019t you going to ask my name?\u201d asked Naruto to Toph<br>\r\n\u201cI could care less\u201d said Toph<br>\r\nNaruto got one of those shocked/annoyed looks on his faces<br>\r\n\u2018Why does no one care who I am!\u2019 thought Naruto bitterly<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m going to tell you anyway!\u201d shouted Naruto fiercely<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m Naruto Uzumaki! The next Hokage of Hidden Leaf Village!\u201d yelled Naruto while standing up and doing a heroic gesture<br>\r\nToph looked on with an annoyed look.<br>\r\n\u2018He\u2019s out of his mind!\u2019 thought Toph at the display<br>\r\n\u201cSo you\u2019re from a place called Hidden Leaf Village?\u201d asked Toph wondering where in the Earth Kingdom that was.\u201cYeah\u201d said Naruto<br>\r\n\u201cWhere\u2019s that?\u201d asked Toph<br>\r\n\u201cThe Land of Fire of course\u201d said Naruto<br>\r\n\u201cWait! You\u2019re from the Fire Nation!\u201d asked Toph shocked. Toph immediately got ready for anything<br>\r\nShe prepared to defend herself as best she could, This could be a Fire Nation spy sent to capture her for Azula \u201cFire Nation? What the heck are you talking about? I said the Land of Fire. What the heck is the Fire Nation?\u201d asked Naruto confused and totally oblivious to the fact that Toph was now very tense<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re kidding right? You honestly don\u2019t know what the Fire Nation is?\u201d asked Toph surprised<br>\r\n\u201cNo, is it a new village or something?\u201d asked Naruto curiously. Toph wondered if what this kid said was true. Was he honestly not from the Fire Nation?<br>\r\nAnd if so how could he have not known about the Fire Nation that had been conquering the world in the last 100 years?Based on his tone it didn\u2019t sound like he was lying but how could he have not know what the Fire Nation is.\u2018Has this kid been living under a rock all his life or something?\u2019 wondered Toph.Plus she still didn\u2019t know where this Land of Fire was either<br>\r\nSomething about this kid was off.Before they could discuss things further Naruto changed the subject<br>\r\n\u201cSo where are you from?\u201d asked Naruto curiously<br>\r\nToph thought that if this kid was of the Fire Nation is would be better to not mention exactly who she was and where she came from<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s none of your business\u201d said Toph<br>\r\n\u201cUm ok\u201d said Naruto<br>\r\nWhoever this person was they really didn\u2019t want to talk about their past<br>\r\nNaruto found it odd how Toph had reacted to him when he said when he was from the Land of Fire.\u2018Could he be from a rival village?\u2019 wondered Naruto<br>\r\n\u201cSo what are you going to do now?\u201d asked Naruto<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve got to go find my friends\u201d said Toph<br>\r\n\u201cReally? Did you get separated during your battle?\u201d asked Naruto.\u201cHow do you know I was in a fight?\u201d asked Toph suspiciously. \u201cYou had throwing needles in your legs so I figured you got into a fight\u201d answered Naruto.\u2018Oh yeah\u2026\u2019 thought Toph realizing that was a dead giveaway \u201cMy and my friends got ambushed and fought, I fell off a cliff after getting hit and wound up in the river below\u201d explained Toph<br>\r\n\u201cWow\u201d said Naruto<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m looking for my friends too\u201d said Naruto<br>\r\n\u201cReally?\u201d asked Toph<br>\r\n\u201cYup, we got ambushed and knocked out. When I woke up I was here and the rest of my team was gone\u201d explained Naruto<br>\r\n\u201cHey I got an idea! We can look together!\u201d said Naruto<br>\r\n\u201cNo thanks, I can find them on my own\u201d refused Toph stubbornly<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t think you can\u201d said Naruto<br>\r\n\u201cWhy\u2019s that!\u201d yelled Toph angrily expecting the usual reason: She was a blind girl<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s because your legs are still hurt and you can barely walk\u201d said Naruto,Toph realized this was true,She could barely walk.There was no way she could cover enough ground fast enough to find her friends in her condition.Plus she could barely earthbend if she wasn\u2019t able to stand.She\u2019d be a sitting duck.If she got attacked she was finished.As much as she hated getting help she had to admit to herself she needed it badly.\u201cHumph! Fine!\u201d said Toph in defeat.\u201cAlright dude we can look together!\u201d said Naruto happily.\u201cWait a second! What did you call me?\u201d asked Toph in shock after Naruto\u2019s comment. \u201cUm dude? Is that a problem?\u201d asked Naruto confused<br>\r\n\u2018Wait a second\u2026he thinks I\u2019m a boy!\u2019 thought Toph shocked.Toph knew she wasn\u2019t ladylike like her parents wanted her to be but she never imagined that she would be confused for a boy!<br>\r\nSo he thought she was a boy!<br>\r\n\u2018This kid is denser that Sokka!\u2019 thought Toph in surprise. She was about to correct him when she got an idea. Most people underestimated her and treated her differently because she was a blind girl<br>\r\nBut since Naruto didn\u2019t know that Toph thought she would finally have someone who treated her like an ordinary kid and not a helpless blind girl<br>\r\nToph decided to go along with him for now<br>\r\n\u201cJust call me by my name\u201d said Toph with a smile<br>\r\n\u201cOk Toph\u201d said Naruto<br>\r\n\u201cWhen can we get going?\u201d asked Toph<br>\r\n\u201cWell it\u2019s pretty late now, we should have a good nights rest and head out in the morning\u201d said Naruto<br>\r\nDuring the time they had been talking it had become dark out and Toph could hear the crickets chirping in the woods. \u201cOk\u201d said Toph thinking that might be a good idea, Aang and the others would probably do the same.\u201cI only brought one blanket though\u201d said Naruto<br>\r\n\u201cNo problem I don\u2019t need one\u201d said Toph just laying back on the ground near the fire<br>\r\n\u201cYou sure?\u201d asked Naruto<br>\r\n\u201cYup\u201d said Toph<br>\r\n\u201cOk\u201d said Naruto. Naruto then went over to the blanket and got underneath it. It wasn\u2019t five seconds later Toph could hear him snoring nearby. Toph lay on the ground near the fire and went to sleep \u2018This might actually not be that bad\u2019 thought Toph before finally going to sleep<br>\r\nEnd Flashback<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToph realized that was true \"OK AZULA, YOUR LUCKEY I LIKE HIM, AS MY MEW SLAVE IF YOU DISOBEAY ME, YOU DIE.<br>\r\nNOW I WANT YOU TO...\" <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Azula thought he looked fimilar. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he woke up, Naruto was in his no-tailed form, and Azula was looking at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YOU!\" Naruto shouted <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFLASHBACK: <br>\r\n<br>\r\n It was about 5 hours before Sakura showed up at Naruto\u2019s camp that she was sitting around Aang and the other\u2019s campsite eating lunch and chatting with Katara<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of them had become very good friends in the time they had been traveling and were often seen talking, joking, or beating the crap out of Sokka for some dumb or sexist thing he had said<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka had quickly learned just how dangerous Sakura could be especially with that Genjutsu illusion stuff<br>\r\nMore than once after he had said something that those two didn\u2019t like he found himself in some sort of nightmare illusion that ranged from being covered in spiders to every animal he had ever eaten rising from the grave to kill him (That\u2019s a lot I\u2019m guessing)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd even more unfortunately the only way he had found of dispelling it was by whacking himself on the head with a club till he passed out<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAang enjoyed having her around since she was very helpful and always did her part so she didn\u2019t feel like dead weight<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey had quickly figured out Sakura had some kind of issue with that but didn\u2019t ask her about it<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone had pretty much gotten used to having her around and were loving her ninja skills<br>\r\nMore than once they had completely avoided the Fire Nation troops hunting them thanks to her ninja skills and training<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura picked up on enemy patrols coming their way and helped them sneak past the soldiers that occupied the forests looking for them<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzula had taken the liberty to make sure the Fire Nation had a strong presence in the area so that Aang couldn\u2019t escape but with Sakura\u2019s help they hadn\u2019t had to fight once since she joined<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer illusions made getting past Fire Nation troops so much easier that it was unbelievable<br>\r\nSakura had once used an illusion so strong they walked right through a Fire Nation encampment that was packed with soldiers in broad daylight and not a single solider noticed them<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka had even made funny faces in the commander\u2019s face but he didn\u2019t even notice<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura also appeared to be interested in bending and Katara had tried to show her some waterbending but they got nothing for some reason<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatara said that perhaps she just couldn\u2019t bend like some people (Sokka)<br>\r\nSakura had volunteered to teach Katara and Aang some jutsu but they were too busy with bending to try <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was totally unaware of what would happen if Aang or Katara had tried it so she still had no idea the truth about benders and chakra<br>\r\nIn all things were going good but that wouldn\u2019t last for long\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo Katara do you have any idea what this Ba Sing Se place is like?\u201d asked Sakura as they all sat around eating fish for lunch <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot really, Toph knew about that and said she had been there before, all I know is that it\u2019s a big walled city that is probably the last safe haven from the Fire Nation\u201d said Katara<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the mention of the \u201cT\u201d word Aang got a sad look on his face again that the others were used to seeing every time Toph was brought up<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAang still blamed himself for her death even though the others kept telling him that it wasn\u2019t his fault<br>\r\nSome nights Aang would have nightmares of Toph\u2019s fall being played over and over again as well as Toph yelling at him for causing her to die<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt reflected in the real word as well<br>\r\nFor some reason no matter how hard he tried he couldn\u2019t do even simple earthbending techniques that he had used before<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone was worried that this could cause some problems in his training and kept trying to cheer him up<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSounds nice I hope we get there soon\u201d commented Sakura wondering if the city was anything like Hidden Leaf Village<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe should be there in a few days\u201d said Sokka pulling out a map he had stolen from the library<br>\r\n\u201cWe are in this huge patch of woods near the city\u201d said Sokka pointing to a large green area of the map that was close to the city<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat about this thing here?\u201d asked Sakura pointing to a large blue area that separated the woods from the city<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s a huge lake that boarders the city that acts as a natural defense from invasion, it\u2019s so big that it takes a few days to get across it\u201d said Sokka<br>\r\n\u201cHow are we getting across that?\u201d asked Sakura<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know\u201d said Sokka embarrassedly<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019ll figure out a way when we get there right now we just need to get out of these woods safely\u201d said Aang seriously<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe wanted to get to Ba Sing Se and be safe from any more surprise attacks or Firebenders<br>\r\nAang was determined to not let anyone else die and was going to make sure they all got out of this safely for Toph\u2019s sake<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young Avatar clenched his fists together as he thought about Azula for a brief second<br>\r\n\u201cAang are you ok?\u201d asked Katara worriedly seeing him acting weird again<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m fine\u201d said Aang trying to sound normal even though Katara could see through his false tone in a second<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk I\u2019m just worried about you\u201d said Katara in a caring voice<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t be just worry about yourself, as long as you an the others are safe I\u2019ll be happy\u201d said Aang in an unusual tone to Katara<br>\r\n\u201cOk I guess\u201d said Katara unsure if that was a good sign or not<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Katara! Can you go get us some more water from that stream we passed earlier? We need some more for our canteens\u201d asked Sokka loudly from the other side of camp breaking the tense mood<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy do I have to?\u201d asked Katara<br>\r\n\u201cBecause you\u2019re a waterbender and it\u2019s a women\u2019s job to get stuff for the men\u201d said Sokka smugly<br>\r\nA second later her realized he shouldn\u2019t have said that<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next thing he knew there was a giant 50 foot angry looking Katara in front of him roaring like Godzilla before trying to crush him<br>\r\nHe screamed as he ran for his life from it trying to crush him under its foot<br>\r\nAll the others saw was Sokka running around screaming while looking over his shoulder at some unknown attacker<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIT\u2019S GOING TO KILL ME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\u201d he screamed in terror as he ran<br>\r\n\u201cWhat did you used this time?\u201d asked Katara happily to Sakura had her hands in a Genjutsu handsign<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAttack of the 50 ft Katara\u201d replied Sakura simply as she watched Sokka run around crazily<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI need to learn how to do that\u201d said Katara with a smirk as Sokka ran around<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell that should last about ten minutes I\u2019m going to get the water since I need to wash my hair anyway\u201d said Sakura grabbing their canteens and walking off<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey fill this up for me will you?\u201d asked Katara as she threw Sakura her water pouch that she needed refilled since Momo had accidentally drank from it<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo problem\u201d said Sakura as she caught the pouch and headed off into the woods to find a stream they <br>\r\npassed earlier that morning as they walked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n15 Minutes Later, Campsite <br>\r\nThey were all lounging around the campsite waiting for Sakura to get back with the water<br>\r\nKatara was busy playing with Momo, Aang tried to get his earthbending to work again but still didn\u2019t get anything, and Sokka was busy recovering from his latest nightmare<br>\r\nHe laid on the ground panting hard after all that running and screaming he did before when suddenly another giant Katara loomed over him<br>\r\nSokka screamed for a second before he realized that it was just the real Katara standing over him with Momo on her shoulder<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter can\u2019t a man handle some illusions?\u201d she asked tauntingly with a grin<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t afraid of the crushing part. It was your face that scared me\u201d replied Sokka<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy you little!\u2026\u201d roared Katara angrily before she was cut off<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOut of nowhere a red throwing knife came flying past her face missing it by not even half an inch<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt came so close to hitting her it actually made a little cut on the tip of her nose that began to bleed slightly<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe knife landed in a tree nearby with a thud and Aang looked at it for a second<br>\r\nHe knew who used knives like this in a second since the one who used them had hunted him<br>\r\nBefore Aang could shout a warning more knives came flying into their campsite right at Katara and Sokka<br>\r\nKatara reached for her water but found nothing and then realized it was being filled by Sakura<br>\r\nShe had no way of blocking the knives and was about to be hit when Aang leapt in front on her and used a <br>\r\nwind gust to knock them away<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDarn I missed\u201d said a dull voice<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMust be your injury\u201d reassured another cheery voice from the woods<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot them again\u201d said Sokka with dread<br>\r\nAs soon as he said it Azula, Ty Lee, and Mai came walking out of the woods from where the knives had come from<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou!\u201d shouted Aang fiercely at Azula with hatred in his eyes<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot still mad about your little friend are you?\u201d asked Azula tauntingly to Aang<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAang growled at her like an animal ready to pounce and kill it\u2019s prey in one attack and you could almost see the aura of hate around him<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome back to fight us?\u201d asked Sokka seriously getting off the ground with his boomerang ready<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot today, you\u2019re in luck Avatar we\u2019re not in the mood to play with you today so we\u2019ll just do this the easy way\u201d said Azula<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d asked Katara worriedly not liking how that sounded<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzula smirked before she snapped her fingers which was the signal to move in<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore they knew it there were Fire Nation troops moving in from the woods all over the place<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn seconds Aang, Katara, and Sokka found themselves <br>\r\nsurrounded by an army of soldiers and Firebenders as far as they could see<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh oh! This isn\u2019t good!\u201d said Sokka looking around seeing nothing but red and black armor with small <br>\r\nspots of silver for swords and spears<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally? I couldn\u2019t figure that out\u201d said Katara sarcastically<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey sarcasm is my bit!\u201d yelled Sokka angrily<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGuys we don\u2019t have time for this!\u201d yelled Aang pointing his staff defensively at a wall of Fire Nation soldiers<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs all this was happening Sakura finally returned to camp with the water<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was walking in the woods close to the camp when she heard a commotion up ahead at the camp<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d she asked worriedly hearing the sounds of a lot of people as well as weapons and armor clanking<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura decided to head back to camp stealthily in case something bad was going on<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe jumped into the trees and began silently making her way back to the camp to see what was going on and if the others were ok<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she got there she saw the image of Aang, Katara, and Sokka surrounded by tons of soldiers and two evil looking girls (Ty Lee does not look evil)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura squatted on a branch and peeked her face out of the thick green leaves just enough to fully see what was going on in the camp<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGive it up Avatar you can\u2019t possiblely be able to escape alive with your friends now\u201d said Azula in a taunting tone<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAang what do we do?\u201d asked Katara worriedly as they looked at all the soldiers<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was really bad<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey would have a hard time beating all the soldiers even with Toph and now she was gone, Katara had no water, and Sakura was not there<br>\r\nThe entire situation looked hopeless to them probably because it was<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on Avatar, give up now and I won\u2019t kill what\u2019s left of your companions\u201d said Azula knowing just what buttons to hit to unnerve Aang<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAang thought about it seriously as he looked through the seemingly endless ranks of the Fire Nation army<br>\r\nIf they fought back odds are they would die or at least one of them would be killed and Aang was not about to lose another friend<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeing a captive of the Fire Nation wasn\u2019t good but it was still better than death<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAang threw his staff to the ground with a defeated look on his face<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAang? What are you doing?\u201d asked Katara in shock to what she was seeing<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018What? He\u2019s giving up so easily?\u2019 thought Sakura surprised<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGuys back down\u201d ordered Aang seriously<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSmart idea Avatar\u201d said Azula with a grin<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019re just giving up?!\u201d asked Sokka shocked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf we fight back odds are that at least on of us <br>\r\nwill die, I don\u2019t care if it\u2019s me but I will not let you two die\u201d said Aang almost emotionless despite the fact his heart was filled with very painful emotions<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatara and Sokka looked at each other with concerned looks as they tried to decide what to do<br>\r\nThey knew Aang was right but it was just not right to give up so easily after all they\u2019ve done<br>\r\nAang stepped forward to address Azula<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll give up and allowed myself to be captured so long as you do not harm my friends at all\u201d said Aang seriously to Azula<br>\r\n\u201cI can agree to that\u201d said Azula in an official tone<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow that was easier than expected we should have killed one of his friends ages ago\u201d said Mai amazed by how easy that was<br>\r\n\u201cYou made the right choice Avatar I\u2019m sure your comrade would have done the same thing\u201d said Azula<br>\r\nAs the troops came forward and put cuffs on them they all thought the same thing<br>\r\nToph would never have done that<br>\r\nSakura watched as her new friends were captured and cuffed as prisoners and knew she had to do something<br>\r\nShe knew that right now the area was too hot to try anything so she needed to get away for a while, come up with a plan, and come back to set them free when it was not so dangerous<br>\r\nSakura withdrew from the tree and slowly crept away from the camp and all the Fire Nation soldiers before they could discover her<br>\r\nShe had the advantage of no one knowing she was there which would be invaluable during the escape plan so she didn\u2019t want to blow it<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNear Naruto\u2019s Campsite <br>\r\nAfter she cleared out of the area Sakura found a nice tree to relax in and plan what she was going to do about this mess<br>\r\nShe knew this was going to be a difficult if not impossible solo mission dealing with an army of enemies if she messed up<br>\r\nSakura had never been the strongest of her group and had never handled this dangerous a situation before on her own<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had defended Naruto and Sasuke from the sound ninja in the Forest of Death but she almost gotten herself killed and she only survived thanks to the help of Guy\u2019s and Ino\u2019s teams showing up<br>\r\nThis time there was no chance that allies would show up to help her out, she was truly all on her own on this one<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMan I wish I had Sasuke here or Kakashi, I\u2019d even be happy if Naruto was here\u201d said Sakura in a depressed tone<br>\r\n\u2018That\u2019s a new one, me being happy to see Naruto\u2019 thought Sakura<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe let out a weak laugh at the comment<br>\r\nSakura was praying that anyone would show up to help her<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe imagined Lee, Sasuke, Ino, Kakashi, and Naruto come flying out from behind some bushes and saying they were there to help her (Lee of course doing his signature pose and Kakashi reading his dam book)<br>\r\nBut she knew that wasn\u2019t going to happen no matter how hard she wished<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNope this is the eighth time you\u2019ve messed up that justu\u201d came a familiar voice faintly to Sakura<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh? What\u2019s that? Did someone just say jutsu?\u201d asked Sakura surprised looking around<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first she thought it was only her imagination since she was the only one who knew about jutsu in <br>\r\nthis world or so she thought<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey I\u2019m still new at this!\u201d came a girl\u2019s voice angrily through the woods proving Sakura wrong<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSomeone\u2019s there\u201d said Sakura unsure of what was going on<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe jumped down from the tree she was on onto the ground and began walking towards where the voices had come from<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk! Ok! Sorry! You don\u2019t have to be so moody\u201d said the first voice defensively<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait that voice! It couldn\u2019t be\u2026\u201d began Sakura she then began to move faster towards the voices<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe would know that annoying voice anywhere since she had often heard that tone before when she was angry<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe you should focus more on doing the handsigns right and not on doing them quickly\u201d came an older unknown voice<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHandsigns! They\u2019re talking about jutsu!\u201d said Sakura happily thinking that could only mean one thing<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright\u201d came the girl voice again<br>\r\nSakura began to run towards the voices<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey what is it?\u201d asked the familiar voice confused<br>\r\n\u201cI hear someone\u201d said the girl voice<br>\r\nSakura stopped when she heard this<br>\r\nWhoever it was already knew she was there so she approached slowly with caution<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe could tell that she was close and the owners of the voices were just on the other side of some trees that were in her way<br>\r\n\u201cWhere?\u201d asked the familiar voice seriously<br>\r\nSakura knew who that voice belonged to<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere\u201d said the girl voice<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura could just feel that they knew she was there and just decided to walk out<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe walked around the tree and emerged in a small campsite like there own<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn front of her Sakura was shocked to see none other than Naruto standing with a girl around her age in white with hair tied in a bun as well as a weird looking old man she had never seen before with an odd headband that said \u201coil\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Naruto and Sakura stared at each other in shock<br>\r\n\u201cNo way\u201d said Naruto weakly<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNaruto?\u201d asked Sakura in disbelief<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSakura?\u201d asked Naruto in equal shock<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNaruto!\u201d yelled Sakura happily glad to finally see <br>\r\none of her teammates again<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSakura!\u201d yelled Naruto happy to finally see Sakura safe<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Naruto you know this girl?\u201d asked Toph wondering what was going on<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe\u2019s one of my teammates! She\u2019s the girl I told you about!\u201d said Naruto happily as he ran over to Sakura with a huge smile<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSakura I\u2019m glad to see you safe!\u201d said Naruto happily as he gave Sakura big hug<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m glad to see you Naruto but unless you want to die you\u2019ll let go right now!\u201d said Sakura in her demoness voice<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was happy to see Naruto but not that happy<br>\r\nNaruto quickly let go of her in fear<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Naruto let go Sakura began looking around the campsite rapidly looking for Sasuke or Kakashi hoping they would be with Naruto<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe already had dreams of Sasuke grabbing her in a warm embrace and saying how much he missed her and confessing his love to her<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Naruto are Kakashi and Sasuke around here?!\u201d asked Sakura excitedly looking around as fast as she could<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNope, I haven\u2019t seen a trace of them since I got here. I was hoping you had seen them\u201d said Naruto<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUgh! Great that means I\u2019m stuck with Naruto\u201d said Sakura sulking with disappointment<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018It\u2019s not fair!\u2019 yelled inner Sakura angrily<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey are we invisible or something?\u201d asked Toph loudly annoyed at not being noticed by whoever this girl was<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Sakura and Naruto watched as Toph and Jiraya walked over to them<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo she\u2019s one of your teammates huh?\u201d asked Toph to Naruto as she examined Sakura through vibrations<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYup, her name is Sakura Haruno\u201d said Naruto happily<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh yes I remember her, she decked you when you tried to hug her during your training\u201d said Jiraya remembering seeing Sakura before<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe remembered her because she had reminded him of another ill-tempered woman he knew that was just as violent<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura looked at these two in confusion for a second<br>\r\nThe girl looked like she might have been from this world based on the fact her clothes looked weird and appeared to be handmade<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile the old man looked like a ninja with a giant scroll on his back, a headband, and sandals<br>\r\nShe could tell this strange old guy was from their world and he was a ninja<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho are these two?\u201d asked Sakura wondering who on earth they could be and how come they were with Naruto of all people<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh let me introduce you!\u201d said Naruto happily walking over to Toph first<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is\u2026\u201dbegan Naruto before Toph cut him off<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can introduce myself ninja boy!\u201d said Toph forcefully<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Ninja boy?\u2019 thought Sakura confused, unawere that Naruto now had been given a Toph nick-name<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy name is Toph Bi Fong\u201d said Toph proudly<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis hit Sakura immediately<br>\r\nShe had heard a lot about Toph from the others over the past few weeks as they traveled but this couldn\u2019t possible be the same one<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe others had all told her about how they had witnessed Toph fall to her death over the side of a huge cliff weeks ago the same day she met them<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait a second! Toph Bi Fong? You mean the Toph the Blind Bandit?!\u201d asked Sakura in shock<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah\u2026how do you know my nickname?\u201d asked Toph suspiciously<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah how do you know Toph Sakura?\u201d asked Naruto confused<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou can\u2019t be the same Toph! Aang, Katara, and Sokka told me you were dead and that you died weeks ago the <br>\r\nsame day we arrived\u201d said Sakura not understanding how this was possible<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know Twinkle Toes, Sugar Queen, and the idiot Sokka?\u201d asked Toph surprised<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho?\u201d asked Sakura confused at Toph\u2019s nicknames<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAang, Katara, and that idiot Sokka\u201d repeated Toph<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes I met them the day I got here, the day they told me you died\u201d said Sakura<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo Aang and the others think I\u2019m dead?\u201d asked Toph<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes they told me you fell off a huge kill into the canyon below. How did you survive and how do you know <br>\r\nNaruto?\u201d asked Sakura confused<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell that\u2019s easy, there was a river at the bottom of the canyon that broke her fall. She blacked out in it and floated down river. A little while after I got here I found her in a stream that the river flowed into and pulled her out half-dead. She was barely alive and I took care of her until she was better. We\u2019ve been traveling together since\u201d explained Naruto to Sakura<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo Naruto saved you and took care of you?\u201d asked Sakura to Toph<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, now explain to me how you know twinkle toes and the others\u201d said Toph<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAfter I got here I wandered the woods for a little while until Katara ran into me while running from some Fire Nation troops. They thought I was helping her and attacked both of us so I as forced to fight them with Katara. After I met Aang and the others they told me that Toph had just died and they were on their way to Ba Sing Se to get a new earthbending teacher and get Appa back. I decided to go with them to Ba Sing Se and hopefully run into someone from my team on the way\u201d explained Sakura<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHold on! Twinkle Toes is getting a new teacher!!?\u201d roared Toph angrily upon hearing this<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell he thought you were dead\u201d pointed out Naruto but that did little to calm Toph<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m going work him until he hurts in places he doesn\u2019t know about! I\u2019ll throw everything I got at him! How dare he get a new teacher!!!\u201d yelled Toph in a tone that could scare the Fox<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Boy that Avatar guy is in for hell when Toph catches up to him\u2019 thought Naruto<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSeems like there has been a very big coincidence here with Naruto meeting with Toph and Sakura meeting with the Avatar\u201d said Jiraya<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura then turned her attention to him when he said this and realized she still didn\u2019t know this guys story<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey who is this guy Naruto?\u201d asked Sakura<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh that\u2019s just my pervy sage, he was training me for the final exams in our world. He accidentally got transported here about two weeks ago\u201d explained Naruto<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey! Don\u2019t call me the pervy sage! I\u2019m am Jiraya the Toad Sage!\u201d said Jiraya proudly<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura gasped when she heard this name since she had <br>\r\n<br>\r\nread it many times before in books on great ninja<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDid you just say Jiraya the Toad Sage!?\u201d asked Sakura in shock<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes I did\u201d said Jiraya<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh my God! Naruto this is who has been training you?!\u201d asked Sakura urgently shaking Naruto violently<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes. Why? He\u2019s just a perverted old man\u201d said Naruto wondering why Sakura was making a big deal of it<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNARUTO! This guy is one of the Sanin! The three ninja of legend!\u201d said Sakura loudly to the clueless Naruto<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto looked at Jiraya for a second before bursting out laughing<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHa Ha! This old toad a Sanin!? Ha Ha! He\u2019s just a dirty old man! Ha Ha Ha Ha!!!!\u201d said Naruto rolling on the floor laughing<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t get any respect\u201d said Jiraya in a sulking tone as Naruto continued to laugh at him<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNARUTO!!! SHOW SOME RESPECT!!!\u201d yelled Sakura stomping on Naruto\u2019s face<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOw that hurt\u201d moaned Naruto in pain with a shoeprint on his face<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s she talking about? What are Sanin?\u201d asked Toph confused<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe Sanin are supposed to be three unbeatable, insanely powerful, legendary ninja. They are considered the strongest in the entire world back home. I\u2019ve read that all of them were very wise and skilled fighters with amazing abilities\u201d explained Sakura seriously almost quoting most books on them<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJiraya wise? HA HA HA HA!!!!!\u201d said Toph busting out laughing on the ground like Naruto had<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s a good one! Jiraya wise! I\u2019ve seen Naruto trick him so many times over the past two weeks it\u2019s not funny!\u201d said Toph still laughing on the ground a bit<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan\u2019t I get a pupil that doesn\u2019t think I\u2019m a complete idiot?\u201d asked Jiraya sulking as Toph laughed at him<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry for how they\u2019re acting mister Sage sir! They just don\u2019t realize how important you are\u201d said Sakura in a very respectful tone to Jiraya (Foolish Sakura giving respect to Jiraya, she probably won\u2019t think he\u2019s so great when she finds out he writes Icha Icha Paradise)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s no problem, the fact is that I never told them who I am\u201d said Jiraya<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait! So you mean you actually ARE one of the Sanin?\u201d asked Naruto surprised as Toph stopped laughing and sat up<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes I am one of the Sanin\u201d said Jiraya<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo one of the super powerful Sanin is a dirty old man who does nothing but drink and go after women?\u201d asked Naruto with a \u201cyou have got to be kidding me\u201d tone<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNARUTO! Will you shut up already!? How could you accuse a Sanin of something like that!?\u201d yelled Sakura as she beat him over the head<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura was foolish enough to believe that one of the Sanin couldn\u2019t possibly be a pervert or an idiot and that Jiraya was some wise and powerful guy who always knew what he was doing and was very serious<br>\r\nBoy was she wrong!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWill you quit hitting me?\u201d asked Naruto in pain with a lump on his head<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo you\u2019re actually one of those really powerful Sanin guys?\u201d asked Toph realizing he was serious now<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes\u201d said Jiraya seriously<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell if I can be a master earthbender and Aang could be the Avatar I guess it\u2019s possible\u201d said Toph<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks for the confidence\u201d said Jiraya sarcastically<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNaruto how did you get a Sanin to train you!?\u201d asked Sakura urgently to Naruto<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell he accidentally flattened my first trainer so I demanded he train me instead\u201d said Naruto<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is incredible! How could Naruto get a Sanin to train him?\u201d asked Sakura to herself<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018The Sexy Jutsu\u2019 thought Naruto<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhile this little reunion and revelations thing is fine I would like to know where Aang and the other two are\u201d interrupted Toph wanting to get back to Aang to give him a good beating\u2026um, \u201ctraining\u201d session<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat could be a problem\u201d said Sakura seriously<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy?\u201d asked Toph<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThey\u2019ve been captured by the Fire Nation\u201d said Sakura grimly<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWHAT!? How did that happen!?\u201d asked Toph angrily<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAang just sort of gave up and surrendered when he and the others got surrounded when I went to get water\u201d explained Sakura<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHE DID WHAT?!!!! TWINKLE TOES JUST GAVE UP!!!?\u201d roared Toph furiously<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEarthbending was all about standing your ground and not giving up and that little miserable wimp just rolled over and gave up!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToph was going to beat him to the edge of death when she got her hands on him<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe better pray the Fire Nation kills him because if I get my hands on him he\u2019ll be put through worse stuff than death!\u201d yelled Toph<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell last I saw they placed him, Katara, and Sokka in cuffs and were setting up camp\u201d said Sakura<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe have to go and get them\u201d said Toph seriously<br>\r\nShe couldn\u2019t beat Aang if the Fire Nation had him<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey hold on! They got an army and there are only four of us! We have to think this through before we try anything!\u201d said Sakura seriously<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s a good idea\u201d said Jiraya<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk what do we do?\u201d asked Toph<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe need to come up with a plan\u201d said Naruto<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes but first we should do a little recon of the <br>\r\ncamp and gather Intel so we can come up with a good plan\u201d said Jiraya<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright\u201d said Naruto, Sakura, and Toph<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan you lead us to the camp?\u201d asked Jiraya to Sakura<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure\u201d said Sakura<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright then let\u2019s pack up and move out we got a mission ahead of us\u201d said Jiraya<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFinally some action!\u201d said Naruto happily looking forward to some excitement<br>\r\nToph, Jiraya, and Naruto gathered their things from the camp and set off with Sakura to find the Fire Nation camp<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFire Nation Camp<br>\r\nMeanwhile back at Aang\u2019s camp the Fire Nation troops and Azula had set up camp in a very short amount of time<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApparently being so important in the Fire Nation meant that you had a lot of people in mortal fear of you doing all your work very quickly\u2026or else<br>\r\nAzula\u2019s troops had brought in her tank/train/mobile home thing that carried all her stuff and unpacked it in amazing time<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore they knew it the Fire Nation troops had a very decent camp set up where Aang, Katara, Sokka, and Sakura\u2019s had been earlier<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was very simple with just a few small red tents set up in rows for the troops, a few bathroom tents, and of course a royal tent for Azula, Mai, and Ty Lee<br>\r\nMeanwhile they had also set up a cage in one corner of the camp for Aang, Katara, and Sokka<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMomo was in a smaller cage nearby screeching crazily<br>\r\nAang had his staff taken away and his bending shut down by Ty Lee<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot that it mattered much since Azula knew he would never risk his friends getting hurt now with a escape <br>\r\nplan<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatara was unbound since she couldn\u2019t bend without water, which they denied her (even going as far as to put the bathroom tent on the other side of the camp even though Katara wouldn\u2019t try that no matter how bad it got)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka was also unbound since all his weapons had been taken away and he was just a moron so they did not consider him a threat<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven though Aang and Katara where in a bad mood and they were all seemingly doomed that hardly stopped Sokka from flirting with Ty Lee through the bars of the cage<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey chatted on as Katara looked on annoyed<br>\r\n\u201cSo you worked for a circus before you got here?\u201d asked Sokka obviously interested in Ty Lee<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, it was my true calling\u201d said Ty Lee with a stupid look on her face as she talked with Sokka<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy are you here with the demon princess then?\u201d asked Sokka<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell Azula called a little louder and she was a childhood friend of mine so I said yes when she asked me to join her hunt\u201d answered Ty Lee<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow can anyone be a friend to that wicked witch of the east?\u201d asked Sokka looking at Azula who was busy yelling at some slightly imperfect soldiers to speed up with their work like she was a monster<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe went to the same school together and grew up together\u201d explained Ty Lee<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou went to school?\u201d asked Sokka (I think it\u2019s pretty obvious that he never went to one)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, it was a school for elite girls within the Fire Nation\u201d said Ty Lee<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMeet any boys there you liked?\u201d asked Sokka trying to sound cool and smooth<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm, Sokka she just said it was an all girls school\u201d interrupted Katara<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHa! Ha! Right I knew that!\u201d said Sokka embarrassedly<br>\r\nTy Lee let out a few giggles at this<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re pretty funny\u2026and cute, maybe I can ask Azula if I can keep you prisoner in my room\u201d said Ty Lee teasingly with a smile<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka immediately blushed before trying to act all cool and impress her<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell a lot of girls think I\u2019m a great, wise, warrior with an amazing amount of charm and good looks\u201d said Sokka trying to act as cool as possible<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah right\u201d said Katara sarcastically in the corner<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you mind? I\u2019m trying to impress a girl here!\u201d whispered Sokka annoyed to his sister<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEver kiss anyone before?\u201d asked Ty Lee teasingly<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?!\u201d asked Sokka shocked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWana try it now?\u201d teased Ty Lee putting her face close to the bars<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka got a huge smile before he too went to put his face to the bars<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were mere inches away and dreaming about what would happened when suddenly someone pulled Ty Lee away from the bars<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Azula said no talking or flirting with the prisoners\u201d said Mai as she pulled Ty Lee away from the cage<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAww you\u2019re no fun!\u201d whined Ty Lee as she looked back at Sokka with disappointment<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy does it seem that every time something good happens for me it goes horribly wrong ten seconds later?\u201d sulked Sokka<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cQuit complaining we need to find a way out of this mess, not waste our time flirting with the enemy\u201d said Katara annoyed<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe\u2019s not an enemy!\u201d said Sokka defensively<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo she\u2019s just someone who hangs around with the evilest person in the Fire Nation\u201d said Katara sarcastically<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut she\u2019s really nice\u201d argued Sokka<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhen she\u2019s not fighting us\u201d argued Katara<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s just change the subject\u201d said Sokka wanting to change topic<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow are we going get out of this? We need a plan\u201d said Sokka seriously<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you think we should do?\u201d Katara asked Aang who had been sulking in the corner the whole time his thoughts riddled with guilt and uncertainty<br>\r\nHe had given up but it had been to save his friends so that made it okay, right?<br>\r\nAang wasn\u2019t sure anymore of just what he should do<br>\r\nSo far his actions had lead to Appa being kidnapped, Toph being killed, and all of them being captured<br>\r\nIt seemed anything he did or decided would lead to something else bad happening and he wasn\u2019t about to chance that<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know\u201d said Aang weakly<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell that helps a lot\u201d said Sokka sarcastically<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you think we should do first?\u201d asked Katara to Sokka<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe first thing we need is a plan to escape, then we need to focus on a way to get away from this camp safely\u201d said Sokka planning<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat should we do?\u201d asked Katara<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI overhead some of the troops talking, Azula is letting them all go to a nearby town for supplies in a little while that\u2019s a perfect chance to get away\u201d said Sokka<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWon\u2019t she keep some around as guards?\u201d asked Katara<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, she thinks we\u2019re helpless and that no body is going to come save us with Toph dead and Sakura\u2026wait were is Sakura?\u201d asked Sokka finally realizing she was gone<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe went to the stream to get water but never came back\u201d said Katara<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe could be our only hope to get out! When Azula\u2019s troops leaves she can probably use some ninjay trick or jutsu to get us out! Then all we have to do is sneak by Azula and the others to escape!\u201d said Sokka excitedly<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen would be the perfect time to escape<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlso as a bonus they had heard that Azula, Mai, and Ty Lee were injured in a battle recently and that\u2019s why she didn\u2019t want to fight<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTy Lee had suffered some minor breaks and had gotten massive headaches from a head injury<br>\r\nShe had even complained of a few pains while she and Sokka were talking and he had even asked her if she was alright when she winced a little in pain<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMai apparently had a deep gash in her rib cage that was bandaged but still bled from time to time<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzula had suffered a few burns, several minor injuries, and had one bang cut off by some stranger with one eye or a red eye or something<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of them were hardly in full fighting condition and might be easy to beat if they could find a way to escape and fight them<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow do we tell her the plan and we still don\u2019t know where she is\u201d pointed out Katara<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI hadn\u2019t thought that far\u201d admitted Sokka<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s hopeless isn\u2019t it?\u201d asked Aang solemnly<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry I\u2019m sure it\u2019ll be fine\u201d said Katara <br>\r\ntrying to cheer him up<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile Jiraya, Sakura, Naruto, and Toph arrived outside the camp and hid in the forest to spy on the Fire Nation<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow you weren\u2019t kidding about the army part\u201d said Naruto to Sakura as he looked at all the soldiers walking around the camp<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can handle that many troops! Twinkle toes shouldn\u2019t have given up and just fought them\u201d said Toph angrily<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think he was too scared of losing anymore friends\u201d said Sakura<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d asked Toph<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAang\u2019s been feeling pretty guilty about you dieing, he thinks it\u2019s all his fault\u201d explained Sakura<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo he lost his nerve because he thought he\u2019s responsible for me dieing?\u201d asked Toph<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes\u201d said Sakura<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell that still doesn\u2019t make giving up so easily right\u201d said Naruto,thinking of what Haku told him in the forest back in the land of waves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere are a lot of them , it may have been a good idea to give up, and You happen to be an idot for thinking othwise Naruto.\u201d Sakura said <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWHACK! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nToph decked the girl who insulted her \"friend\" right in the face plowing her into the ground<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat was that?\u201d asked Toph innocently<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNothing\u201d said Sakura weakly in pain on the ground<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s stop arguing and come up with a plan to save Aang and the others\u201d said Jiraya seriously looking over the place with his telescope<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat does Aang look like anyway?\u201d asked Naruto<br>\r\nSakura grabbed Jiraya\u2019s telescope and looked around the camp until she spotted Aang, Katara, and Sokka in a cage in the corner<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere he is\u201d said Sakura<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet me see\u201d said Naruto as he took the telescope and looked at the cage too<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s him? He doesn\u2019t look big or powerful, and what\u2019s with the ponytail?\u201d asked Naruto looking at Sokka expecting the Avatar to be a big and muscular guy<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo that\u2019s Sokka, Aang\u2019s the other one\u201d said Sakura<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou mean the Avatar is a girl?!\u201d asked Naruto surprised as he looked at Katara<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure is\u201d said Toph with a smirk<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo he\u2019s the bald one with the arrows\u201d said Sakura<br>\r\nNaruto then finally looked at Aang through the telescope<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait you mean that little shrimp is the Avatar!? He looks about as threatening as a bunny!\u201d said Naruto looking at Aang amazed he was the super-powerful Avatar<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe\u2019s about as brave as one too\u201d added Toph<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet me see\u201d said Jiraya taking back his telescope and looking at Aang<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow he hardly looks like the type to win a war\u201d said Jiraya looking at the tiny little kid that was the Avatar<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo what\u2019s he like?\u201d asked Naruto<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell he\u2019s been really sad lately about losing Toph so I only saw him sulking and frustrated\u201d said Sakura<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe looks to be doing plenty of sulking now\u201d said Jiraya looking at Aang in the corner of the cage<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey something is going on\u201d said Sakura pointing at the camp where all the soldiers where gathering around Azula<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey who\u2019s the evil looking girl down there?\u201d asked Jiraya looking at the magnified face of Azula through the telescope and shuttering<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEvil looking? That\u2019s probably Azula the fire princess\u201d said Toph<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo that\u2019s Azula? Wow she\u2019s uglier than Katara described her\u201d said Sakura having heard many stories <br>\r\nabout Azula from Katara and Sokka<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho are the other two girls with her?\u201d asked Jiraya looking at Mai and Ty Lee<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe one in pink is Ty Lee a hand to hand specialist, the other in red is Mai a projectile specialist\u201d explained Toph<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow I never thought I would meet a bad guy that wore pink\u201d said Naruto looking at Ty Lee<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019d be careful, Katara told me about her. She can hit pressure points to shut off bending and paralyze the body. I make a note to avoid her since the last thing I like to be is helpless\u201d said Toph remembering how much she despised that feeling<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSounds almost like the gentle fist style of Neji\u201d commented Sakura knowing Neji could do the same thing<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHa a fight with her would be perfect training for the final chuin exams for me! Let me fight her\u201d said Naruto happily<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo a direct attack with all these troops would be too dangerous and even if we could plow through them there\u2019s the chance that Azula could kill the others if we get too close\u201d said Jiraya<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do we do?\u201d asked Naruto wondering what the plan was<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe first need to get those troops out of the equation\u201d said Jiraya<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat might not be a problem\u201d said Toph happily with a smirk<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d asked Naruto wondering what Toph could be talking about<br>\r\n\u201cI can hear what Azula is telling her soldiers from here, she\u2019s telling them that they\u2019ll be heroes back in the Fire Nation for capturing the Avatar. She\u2019s telling them to go to the nearby town and send the word to the Fire Nation as well as get supplies and to be back in five minutes\u201d said Toph able to make out Azula\u2019s orders even from their position<br>\r\n\u201cShe\u2019s sending all of them? Won\u2019t she keep so for protection and guard duty?\u201d asked Sakura surprised that it could be that easy<br>\r\n\u201cThey\u2019re staying behind to guard them personally since they don\u2019t think that\u2019ll be a problem. They think Aang, Katara, Sokka, and Momo are powerless, they think I\u2019m dead, and they don\u2019t have a clue about you guys\u201d said Toph with a smile<br>\r\n\u201cSo they don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything capable of stopping them! They won\u2019t know we\u2019re coming at all!\u201d said Sakura happily<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019ll be able to catch them totally off guard!\u201d said Naruto happily knowing this is just what they needed<br>\r\n\u201cBut five minutes isn\u2019t a lot of time\u201d pointed out Toph<br>\r\n\u201cNo problem just leave it to me, I\u2019ll follow them and stall them at the town\u201d offered Jiraya<br>\r\n\u201cAn entire army?\u201d asked Sakura amazed he was offering to face an entire army single-handedly<br>\r\n\u201cOf course! I\u2019m a Sanin right? I can handle it\u201d said Jiraya proudly already forming a brilliant plan<br>\r\n\u201cOf course you can! How could I forget you were a Sanin? I\u2019m sorry for doubting you\u201d said Sakura respectfully<br>\r\n\u201cNo problem just don\u2019t do it again\u201d said Jiraya<br>\r\n\u201cI won\u2019t\u201d said Sakura<br>\r\n\u201cYou think we should tell her that he\u2019s not really that great?\u201d asked Toph quietly to Naruto watching Sakura making a fool out of herself by respecting Jiraya<br>\r\n\u201cNo let\u2019s wait for him to reveal how big a moron he really is\u201d said Naruto<br>\r\n\u201cWell I\u2019m off, while I\u2019ll stall the army you guys have to take out Azula and those other two and free your friends\u201d said Jiraya as he walked away following the leaving Fire Nation army to town<br>\r\nThe Fire Nation troops marched single-file in formation down a dirt path to the local village while Jiraya\u2019s stalked them hidden in the trees<br>\r\nThey also brought along the main part of the tank to hold the supplies and left Azula\u2019s compartment back at the camp since it would just slow them down<br>\r\n\u201cHow do you think he\u2019ll stall them?\u201d asked Toph doubtful he could handle it<br>\r\n\u201cHe\u2019ll find some way, he is a powerful and wise Sanin\u201d pointed out Sakura to the annoyance of Naruto and Toph<br>\r\nWhen Jiraya and the army where gone all that was left were Naruto, Toph, and Sakura hiding, Azula, Mai, and Ty Lee doing guard duty, and Aang, Katara, Sokka, and Momo hanging in their cages<br>\r\nEverything was in an eerie calm and quiet so Naruto, Toph, and Sakura quieted down to whispers to avoid being heard by Azula<br>\r\nThey didn\u2019t want to blow the element of surprise they had<br>\r\nThe tree of them snuck down to some bushes closer to the camp and hid behind them so they could get a closer look at what they were up against<br>\r\nAll three evil Fire Nation girls were doing various things to help pass time while guarding<br>\r\nAzula was practicing her fire bending movements and would sometimes send up a ball of blue flame as she practiced<br>\r\nMai just looked bored and hung around under a tree playing with her knives and complained about how boring this was<br>\r\nTy Lee did some cartwheels for fun but this was just a ruse so she could go back and forth in front of the cage to see Sokka since Azula would be mad if she knew she was trying to get close to a prisoner she liked<br>\r\nSokka looked on and complimented her sometimes as she did her gymnastics moves in front of the cage<br>\r\nDespite the seemingly relaxed mood of the scene things were tense for Naruto, Sakura, and Toph<br>\r\n\u201cSo what do we do guys?\u201d asked Naruto to the girls<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe you can use some genjutsu on them Sakura\u201d suggested Naruto<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know, they might be able to see through it if they\u2019re smart enough and Katara told me Azula isn\u2019t easily fooled by tricks\u201d said Sakura unsure<br>\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s just fight them! It\u2019s 3 vs.3\u201d said Toph forcefully<br>\r\nShe was more than eager to get revenge for what they had done to her<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure if we are a match for them Toph, they look pretty strong and they might try to harm Aang and the others if we get too close. We need a plan to attack and beat them quickly before they can try anything\u201d said Sakura seriously thinking it over<br>\r\nHow could they take down an entire Nation\u2019s strongest and most deadly team quickly by themselves<br>\r\n\u201cLet me crush them!\u201d came an evil and angry voice<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure that\u2019ll be so easy Toph\u201d said Naruto<br>\r\n\u201cWhat? I didn\u2019t say anything?\u201d asked Toph confused<br>\r\n\u201cThat was me child\u201d came the familiar voice of the Fox in Naruto\u2019s head<br>\r\n\u2018What are you here for?\u2019 asked Naruto annoyed<br>\r\n\u201cI came to ask about the seal since you haven\u2019t seen me about it yet\u201d said the Fox<br>\r\n\u2018Now\u2019s not a good time, I\u2019ve got to beat these three evil fire girls and save the Avatar\u2019 said Naruto<br>\r\n\u201cSo that little airbender is the Avatar huh? He looks just like him\u201d said the Fox<br>\r\n\u2018Who?\u2019 asked Naruto<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026Um no one, but anyway let me help you destroy them with my power!\u201d said the Fox<br>\r\n\u2018Hey! I just want to beat them and free Aang, not kill them using Fox power!\u2019 said Naruto<br>\r\n\u201cI do, I have some issues with the Fire Nation\u201d said the Fox<br>\r\n\u2018Just leave this to me please. We need to come up with a plan, I want to help Toph get revenge on these three\u2026wait that\u2019s it! I just got a brilliant plan!\u2019 said Naruto<br>\r\n\u201cWhat is it?\u201d asked the Fox<br>\r\n\u2018I suggest you stick around for the show since this is going to be really cool\u2019 said Naruto<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you planning?\u201d asked the Fox<br>\r\n\u2018Well if everything works right Azula is in for a really big scare and a severe beating\u2019 said Naruto<br>\r\n\u201cScaring isn\u2019t as good as killing but it can be more fun when drawn out I suppose\u201d said the Fox<br>\r\nNaruto turned to Sakura and Toph who where both planning out what to do<br>\r\n\u201cHey guys I go a really good plan\u201d whispered Naruto excitedly<br>\r\n\u201cReally what is it?\u201d asked Sakura surprised since Naruto was hardly smart enough to be much of a plan guy<br>\r\n\u201cThey still think you\u2019re dead right Toph?\u201d asked Naruto<br>\r\n\u201cYeah why?\u201d answered Toph confused<br>\r\nNaruto began whispering his plan into the two girls\u2019 ears<br>\r\nYou could see the smile break out on their faces as Naruto outlined his plan to them<br>\r\n\u201cThis is going to be good!\u201d said Toph excitedly when Naruto told her his plan<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s brilliant Naruto!\u201d said Sakura really surprised by how clever the plan was<br>\r\n\u201cYeah but I\u2019m going to nee both of you to do it\u201d said Naruto seriously<br>\r\n\u201cI can handle it\u201d said Sakura confidently<br>\r\n\u201cNo problem\u201d said Toph<br>\r\n\u201cAlright now let\u2019s get into our positions and get ready to attack\u201d said Naruto<br>\r\nToph and Sakura nodded before going where they needed to<br>\r\nSakura disappeared into some trees while Toph sank under the ground to get ready for a great performance<br>\r\nNaruto stood where he was to get ready for his part and to enjoy the show<br>\r\nThis was going to be awesome<br>\r\nInside the Fire Nation Camp<br>\r\n\u201cWhere are they?! They were suppose to be back after only five minutes!\u201d yelled Azula angrily as she waited for her useless troops to return<br>\r\nThey had been gone for seven minutes and Azula was hardly the one to forgive people under her command for failing to comply with and order even if it was next to impossible to do<br>\r\n\u201cYou did only give them five minutes to go to town, get supplies, and come back. That\u2019s kinda unrealistic\u201d pointed out Ty Lee<br>\r\n\u201cI gave them a simple order and they disobeyed it! When they get back they are in deep trouble!\u201d yelled Azula angrily ignoring Ty Lee\u2019s reason while Mai just looked on indifferent<br>\r\n\u201cWow she looks mad\u201d commented Katara from the cage looking on as Azula raved and rampaged<br>\r\n\u201cWomen are so temperamental\u201d said Sokka watching too<br>\r\n\u201cWhat was that?!\u201d asked Katara offended<br>\r\n\u201cNothing!\u201d said Sokka nervously<br>\r\nAang didn\u2019t bother to look and continued sulking in the corner thinking about Toph and Appa and how he failed them<br>\r\n\u201cHey Aang you should come watch this it\u2019s pretty funny\u201d said Sokka to Aang pointing at Azula<br>\r\n\u201cNo thanks\u201d he said weakly turning down the offer<br>\r\nAzula continued on her little rampage while raving on about what she was going to do to her troops who where now 8 minutes late<br>\r\nEven her descriptions seemed to cause pain as she described torture so horrible that if I typed it here my computer would crash<br>\r\n\u201cI wonder why they\u2019re late?\u201d asked Katara<br>\r\n\u201cWho cares we still need a way to get out and escape and this would be the perfect time\u201d said Sokka<br>\r\n\u201cOur only hope is Sakura but we don\u2019t know where she is\u201d pointed out Sakura<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe she\u2019s around here\u201d speculated Sokka \u201cShe could be using her ninja powers to be hiding in plain sight. Quick look for any moving rocks or people hiding bushes!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d asked Katara annoyed at her brother\u2019s stupid ideas<br>\r\n\u201cShe must have some illusion or something up to keep us from seeing her, we need to contact her somehow\u201d said Sokka looking around suspiciously<br>\r\n\u201cOr she could just not be here\u201d pointed out Katara<br>\r\n\u201cShe probably abandoned us because she didn\u2019t want to get killed or captured like us\u201d said Aang in a depressed tone<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t say that Aang\u201d said Katara compassionately coming over to Aang and sitting by him<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s true! I\u2019ve just lead us into disasters again and again and lost two friends because of it! I won\u2019t lose anymore\u201d said Aang sadly<br>\r\n\u201cAang it wasn\u2019t your fault. We got some good info from the library that could win the war and we can get Appa back when we get to Ba Sing Se\u201d said Katara<br>\r\n\u201cBut Toph is dead because of me and we can\u2019t get her back.

Just like Aang\u201d said Sokka<br>\r\n\u201cHow do you know?\u201d asked Katara doubtfully<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve heard a lot of ghost stories\u201d said Sokka<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re an idiot\u201d said Katara plainly<br>\r\nMeanwhile Azula, Mai, and Ty Lee where trying to figure out what to do with an army of undead Tophs surrounding them<br>\r\n\u201cAhh they\u2019re going to steal our souls!\u201d yelled Ty Lee scared<br>\r\n\u201cNo, zombies eat brains not steal souls\u201d said Mai<br>\r\n\u201cThis has got to be a trick or illusion or something\u201d said Azula fiercely thinking that was the only explanation<br>\r\nShe sent a fire blast at a zombie to see what would happen to it<br>\r\nThe fire blast hit a zombie but when the flames cleared the zombie was totally unscratched and just gave her a smirk<br>\r\n\u201cI can\u2019t hit it!\u201d yelled Azula<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll try\u201d said Mai grabbing some knives from under her robes and throwing them at the same zombie<br>\r\nThey just passed right through like the zombie like it was a ghost and landed in the grass behind it<br>\r\n\u201cNo good! We can\u2019t touch them!\u201d said Mai frustrated<br>\r\n\u201cOk it\u2019s my turn now!\u201d yelled three zombies as they got into earthbending stances<br>\r\nThey all slammed their feet into the ground and sent three pillars of rock right at Azula, Mai, and Ty Lee<br>\r\nAll three girls were hit right in the face by the pillars and sent flying backwards onto the ground<br>\r\n\u201cHit you that time\u201d said all the zombie Tophs<br>\r\nThey skidded along the ground kicking up a dust trail for a few feet before stopping and sliding to a halt<br>\r\n\u201cOw\u201d moaned Ty Lee<br>\r\nHer hit to the head during the fight with Sasuke had given her massive headaches recently at even little things so she was in serious pain after a direct blow to the face again<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s not fair, we can\u2019t hit them but they can hit us\u201d said Mai painfully as she and Azula slowly got back to their feet<br>\r\nTy Lee was down for the count though after that direct hit and she stayed on the ground clutching her pounding head<br>\r\n\u201cAre you ok?!\u201d asked Sokka concerned as he saw Ty Lee on the ground<br>\r\n\u201cShe\u2019s a bad guy remember?\u201d pointed out Katara again<br>\r\n\u201cHey undead Tophs! Go easy will you!?\u201d yelled Sokka<br>\r\n\u201cShut up!\u201d yelled the zombies at Sokka before turning back to Azula and Mai<br>\r\n\u201cTy Lee get up\u201d ordered Azula<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t think she\u2019s ok after that last one Azula\u201d said Mai<br>\r\n\u201cArgh! Them we\u2019ll have to do this ourselves!\u201d growled Azula angrily<br>\r\n\u201cWow you\u2019re compassionate\u201d said the Tophs sarcastically<br>\r\n\u201cShut up! I don\u2019t care if you are undead or if there are an army of you!

Unfortunatley she lost consciousness before she got to the door and was out cold for quite a while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>4 hrs later</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Azula woke up she found she was unclothed and there was an expance of red surroundingher not that she was surprised, the entire Fire Nation was colored that way. What did freak the slightly psycho princess was the demonic laughter, which as she turned saw something even she couldn't comprehend. Sitting cross-legged a sizeable distance from her was a masked creature of human form even larger than the statue on the 'Great Gates of Azulon' with a crack in it in the form of a smirk along with a large chunk missing revealing his left eye. Azula considered running but decided against it, as it was something she'd vowed never to do. As the being stood up she could she a relative fist sized hole through his chest that an airship could pass through and each hand was clawed to even from he perspective a razor point. Azula felt the ground move below her as she rose up to eye level with him and he just stood there silently.<br>\r\nEventually the silence started to annoy Azula so she decided to start this talk<br>\r\nAzula: So who are you and where am I?<br>\r\n?: I am the demon known as <b>Armetyle</b> and Sakura has let me out to give this to you. I hope this doesn't go tit's up like with Kazarina.<br>\r\nAzula: So this is.....<br>\r\nArmetyle: Sakura has decided to give you a chance at a happy ending, so she's come up with this so we can see if your love cares enough for you.<br>\r\nAzula: And this will work on the basis of what? dropping me in a basket into their care?<br>\r\nAremtyle: No, we already shrunk you, now we let you find them or vise-versa and we try the whole 'care for the helpless' to see if they really love you. Then you just nedd to make them admit it <u>and</u> kiss you, or <i>have sex </i>either works.<br>\r\nAzula: Can I speak to Sakura, this S*** makes no sence<br>\r\nArmetyle: I saw that coming but we'll worry about it later. Right now I'ld like to know who we're leaving you with.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho's Azula in love with?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Her eyes was adjusting themselves while she rubbed her head softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow. I feel like I just got ran over by Appa. What in the world happened?\u201d Katara thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Katara\u2019s vision became clear, she sees that she\u2019s no longer with the rest of the group. Instead, she\u2019s in a strange looking room. But, she was shocked to see that everything is completely huge to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the?! Why is everything\u2019s gigantic?!\u201d Katara thought before she looked down at herself to see that she\u2019s wrong. \u201cOh no! Everything\u2019s not big! I\u2019m small! How can that be possible?!\u201d Katara thought in her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat\u2019s when she felt the earth beneath her was shaking and she looked around to find out why. The booming noise continues to get louder until she sees something, or someone, entering the room. However, this person was the very least one she wants to see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was none other than the Fire Nation princess, Azula, herself. Katara knows that she can be intimidating. But, seeing her so big just made that worse. Azula sees her and she reaches in to grab her before bringing her to her face that\u2019s humongous to the water-bender. This doesn\u2019t hold well floor her as Azula looks at her with that evil smirk on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, look who decided to wake up. Enjoying your new size, I suppose?\u201d Azula teased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat have you done to me, Azula?! How did you shrink me like this?!\u201d Katara demanded as she struggled in Azula\u2019s grip to break free.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh! That? I so happen to find a scull that can help benders shrink other people using spirit energy. It was difficult. But, I happened to learn the ways of using it. I was going to use it on your Avatar of a boyfriend. But, I think you are more suitable for me.\u201d Azula said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSuitable for what?! Serve you?! As if!\u201d Katara yelled at Azulaz<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t think you\u2019re in any position to protest, waterbender. You\u2019re mine to have now.\u201d Azula said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere\u2019s no way Katara is just going to be some plaything to this psychopath. So, she tried to waterbend her way out. But, she soon sees that she can\u2019t. It\u2019s like it\u2019s been completely cut off from her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh yes. Did I forget to mention that I shut down your wateebending when I shrink you? Oh well. There\u2019ll be no escape using water now.\u201d Azula said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhen Aang and the others get here, you\u2019ll be-!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry? I don\u2019t think so.

Katara bounces off the fabric and went face first into Azula\u2019s vagina. The sight she sees is much too insane as she sees the princess\u2019s vagina right in front of her. The area then darkened as Azula closes her panties with a snap to keep Katara inside. After doing so, she felt Katara starting to squirm against her crotch and it felt really good to her. Azula moaned quite a lot as Katara finds herself getting her head out of Azula\u2019s pants. Azula noticed it and she pushes Katara back inside her panties, playfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSilly little peasant. You\u2019re not allowed out of my panties until I say you can. If I wanted to, that is.\u201d Azula said while enjoying the pleasure of Katara\u2019s struggles in her red underwear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatara continues to struggle as she mustered up the strength to get back out. But, before she can, she soon noticed that Azula is about to cum. She couldn\u2019t react to it as the juices exploded out of the princess\u2019s crotch and Katara and Azula\u2019s panties would both soon be wet. Azula took a moment to gather herself before she puts her hand on her crotch from the outside of her pants and begins rubbing herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell well. It appears that I may have found a new home for you.\u201d Azula said before patting on her crotch that made Katara hit against it. \u201cWould you want that, peasant? Do you want to spend the rest of your pathetic little life inside your princess\u2019s underwear and become my little sex toy? It sounds really good to me. I mean, it\u2019s not like you\u2019ll have anything better to do than pleasure me.\u201d Azula said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while, Azula</span></div></div>",

Maybe you're getting smaller while I'm getting bigger.\" then Aang hugs her, laughing, saying \"I'm not getting smaller.

Taller than Katara! She kicked the tent wall down and stood up, stretching. Katara was bringing Toph some water, as Katara got to Toph, she gasped, asking \"Toph? Are you okay?

I just have the biggest.\" then without warning, Toph shoots up three feet while Aang is standing there, within a second, she had grown from 6'9, to 9'9. Because of her blanket, Aang didn't notice. But he says \"At least I've got a really big earthbending teacher.\" with a laugh, she says \"No. I'm not big. I'm huge. And growing, pipsqueak.\" with a smirk. She shoots up again.
