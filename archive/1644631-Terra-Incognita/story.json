Your vision is too blurry to discern anything at first, but it is slowly clearing.  You have a metallic taste in your mouth and you smell something burning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs your vision clears, you see sunlight overhead.  That can\u2019t be right, but why not?  You struggle in vain to remember who you are, where you are, and what just happened.  As the colors and shapes form around you and sharpen, you realize you liked it better when you couldn\u2019t see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou\u2019re lying on a twisted chunk of metal; the hull around you has been ripped away, exposing you to the balmy open air.  Smoldering sections of the ship you must have been on are scattered as far as you can see.  There are bodies strewn about, some bloody, some burned, and none are moving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sun is odd.  A bit too large and orange to be Sol or Wasp12, but how do you know that when you can\u2019t recall any details about those places?  The foliage is thick and dark blue.  You\u2019re sure you have never been here and something about being \u2018outside\u2019 continues to nag at your senses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou try to move.  Your arms seem to function, though shakily.  But when you try to move your legs, you discover a nasty gash under the torn, blood-soaked left pant leg of your dirty orange jumpsuit.  On closer inspection, you see a metal shard jutting out next to a fragment of your broken shin bone.  This is very bad.  The bleeding is slow, but the skin around the injury is very swollen and turning green and white.  You imagine the alien microbes that have already entered your system and are busy causing a nasty infection.  You need to remove the metal shard, set your broken leg, and find some nanite-gel, or this wound will likely kill you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you look around, trying to see a med-kit, preferably within arms reach, you hear an odd skittering noise that sounds close and seems to be getting closer.  A weapon might be nice right about now too.  Looking around with quite a bit more urgency, you spot both items, but neither is in easy reach.  Attached to a bulkhead, about 2 meters to your left, is a med-kit.  About 3 meters to your right is the grip of a weapon, just visible underneath the corpse of a man in a black jumpsuit.  You have a sudden flash...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>There is a man in a black jumpsuit, MPL (Military Pulse-Laser) in hand, shoving you down a dimly lit corridor.  You have the urge to kill him with your bare hands, but they are bound.</i>  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe odd approaching skittering sound pulls you back to the present.  You notice scabs circling your wrists and you wonder why you were bound and how the binding was removed, but now is not the time for reminiscing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou fight the urge to panic and force yourself to make a somewhat clear-headed decision\u2026</span></div></div>",

The skittering increases in frequency and volume, as if it were reacting to your movement.  You look over your shoulder and spot the source.  A translucent-white creature is crawling on several insect-like legs.  It resembles a tall preying mantis made of frosted glass, about 30 centimeters in height.  It pauses atop the corpse under which you spotted the weapon.  You\u2019re not sure whether you should freeze or pull yourself up and reach for the med-kit\u2026</span></div></div>",

The \u2018bug\u2019, for lack of a better term, sits facing you, less than 5 meters away and also not moving.  You try to keep your breaths shallow and steady, so that your chest doesn\u2019t move, and you wait.  Finally, after what seems like two or three minutes, it begins to move.  It prods the man in the black jumpsuit with its front legs for a few seconds, and then stabs the cadaver\u2019s neck with a clear tube.  You watch in horror as the tube fills with blood, followed by the bug\u2019s body, turning all but its legs crimson red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA dizzying wave of panic and nausea hits you.  You\u2019re unable to keep from trembling and your now loud rapid breathing is causing your chest to visibly convulse.  The bug turns to face you and raises up on its clear chitinous legs.  You tense, preparing to flail at it as it skitters with amazing speed toward you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt suddenly slows, just under two meters from you, and stagers sideways.  Then, without any help from you, it twitches violently and falls onto its back.  Its clear legs cease their twitching and curl up under it, like a dead spider.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gasp and catch your breath, wondering what just happened.  The possibility occurs to you that its digestive system encountered something toxic in black jumpsuit guy\u2019s blood.  You get another flashback\u2026  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are walking in a single file line of men wearing orange jumpsuits down a dimly-lit corridor.  As the man in front of you passes an armed guard in a black jumpsuit, he slips the guard something.  The guard sneaks it quickly into his pocket, but not before you catch a glimpse of a small bag of white powder.  So the guard\u2019s a junky.  Not surprising.  Your instincts for survival tell you to pretend not to notice.  You stare straight ahead as you pass the guard, waiting from a blow from his stun baton, but he just glares at you as you pass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shake off the vivid scene and wonder if this bug was killed by narcotics in the dead guard\u2019s system or if it just can\u2019t metabolize human blood.  You don\u2019t care to find out either way.  Remembering the need to fix your leg and arm yourself, you get busy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGritting your teeth to bare the tremendous pain, you steady yourself against the wall and stand shakily on your right leg.  You grab the med-kit with both bloody hands and fall back to the floor, successfully dislodging it from its mount.  Inside, you find everything you need.  Painkiller first.  You tear the already ripped pant leg to expose your thigh and press the bright red jet-injector to your clammy skin, pulling the trigger.  Two seconds later, you are feeling no pain and the room spins very slowly around you.  With partially numb but now steadier hands, you pull at the metal shard still lodged in your wound.  It comes out easily, but bright red blood flows quickly after.  Feeling sick and light-headed, you waste no time grabbing your shin with both hands and squeezing as hard as you can to set the bone back into place.  It snaps straight with a sickening wet click.  Thank God for pain meds.  You slap a new-skin patch on the bleeding wound and then grab the blue jet-injector, shooting your leg full of nanite-gel.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow running on pure adrenaline, you crawl over to the dead guard and pull the MPL out from under his corpse.  You look at the familiar feeling weapon and know that you have used one before, but you don\u2019t remember where or why.  You also notice the bio-lock trigger.  It's a good thing went after the med-kit instead of the gun, since the trigger is encoded with the dead guard's DNA pattern.  You're going to need tools to hack this.  Funny that you feel confident in that ability.  You tuck the currently useless MPL under your belt.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFighting off the urge to loose consciousness from blood loss and the effects of the painkiller, you crawl toward a section of ship with an in-tact door.  You reach up and wrench the door open, finding a small lavatory.  Perfect.  You crawl into the slanted closet-sized compartment and shut the door, pulling the \u201coccupied\u201d latch and hoping that the bugs are the worst things looking for you.  Finally, you let yourself drift into deep narcotic-induced sleep\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wake up feeling groggy and your head is pounding, but otherwise back in one piece.  You move your left leg to test it and find that the nanites repaired the bone and the laceration perfectly.  Not even a scar left under the layer of dried blood.  You\u2019re hungry and thirsty.  You reach out and unlatch the door, pushing it open tentatively.  Cooler, but still humid, night air rushes in, along with a cacophony of chirps, chitters and shrieks from who knows what.  You could probably walk now, taking your chances with the nocturnal critters and search the ship\u2019s wreckage for food and water, or you could get some more sleep and see if you can wait until you have some daylight\u2026</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You try the lavatory sink and find some water still in the line.  You suck it greedily out of your hand and splash it on your face before it runs out.  Feeling a bit better and more awake, you take stock of what you have in the dim phosphorescent light of the lavatory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou have a MPL, but before it will fire you'll need some tools to hack the bio-lock trigger since it is still encoded with the dead guard's vitals and DNA.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou have a med-kit.  There are 2 doses each left of the painkiller and the nanite-gel.  There are also 5 new-skin patches, an ACE bandage, clips, some gauze, a green jet-injector with 3 doses of detox, a DDP (defibrillator/diagnostic pad), an oxygen mask, and a monofilament scalpel.  It might be a good idea to look for more kits, since some extra jet-injectors might come in handy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are wearing a ripped, blood-soaked, dirty orange jumpsuit.  It bothers you, but you\u2019re not sure if it bothers you enough to take clothes off a corpse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou need rations, water, tools, and perhaps a better weapon until you can hack the safety on the MPL.  But most of all, right now, you need a flashlight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou cautiously slide the latch to \u2018unoccupied\u2019 and push the door slightly open to peer out into the darkness.  The nightlife is noisy.  The air is slightly cool and smells odd.  Like a cross between tobacco and moldy cheese\u2026  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou suddenly realize how unimaginably lucky you are that the air is breathable at all.  You fumble around for the DDP in the med-kit, pressing it to your forearm and hitting the button to diagnose.  The oxygen in your blood is low.  That explains the headache.  You also have small traces of arsenic and some unidentified compounds in your system.  You strap on the oxygen mask, cussing at yourself for not doing so earlier, and then, using the light from the DDP display, you find the green jet-injector and shoot your upper arm with a dose of detox.  The perfect mix of nitrogen and oxygen from the mask fills your lungs and you feel your headache start to recede almost immediately.  You give yourself another minute to completely clear your lungs and your head, then open the lavatory door and climb out onto the ground outside the fragmented ship's hull\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo beige half moons shining directly overhead, along with a billion stars, provide somewhat adequate light. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere is a massive trench dug by the crash through what looks like a dense jungle.  Strewn down the length of the trench, there are large and small chunks of the ship you were on.  On either side of the trench, there is dense foliage and tall thin trees choked with vines.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDark shadows prevent you from seeing much detail.  The sounds from the local nightlife are loud, varied, and emanate from every direction, but it doesn\u2019t sound like anything particularly threatening is approaching you.  Still, you would feel better with more light and a usable weapon if something decides to make you a late-night snack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou make your way to each of the larger pieces of wreckage, searching the debris for anything useful.  As you walk, you notice that your balance is a little off and your legs still feel a bit weak.  There must be slightly more than one gee of gravity here.  It\u2019s going to take some getting used to, and you\u2019ll probably get tired faster\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first thing you find is an intact, though completely shaken up, storage closet with several useful items.  You find a nice combination flashlight/lantern, 6 extra power cells (which will fit both the pulse laser and the flashlight), a box of large black plastic trash bags, a couple roles of duct tape, and a gallon jug of bleach.  You pour out the bleach, keeping it as a self-sterilizing water jug.  You open and double up a couple trash bags and toss in the box of bags, empty bleach jug, power cells, and duct tape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next thing you find is a few more dead guards.  You grab a second MPL (also unusable until hacked), 2 thigh holsters to carry your MPLs, 8 more power cells, and a stun baton.  The safety on the baton also needs to be hacked before you can power it, but even unpowered, it\u2019s not bad as a big stick.  You duct tape your flashlight just above the baton handle so that you can wield it like a short lit baseball bat.  Finally, knowing that the guards\u2019 thicker black jumpsuits offer a little more protection than yours and wouldn\u2019t stick out like an orange sore thumb, you break down and undress one of them, replacing your filthy-but-still-brightly-colored, thin, torn prison garb.  You then continue your search a little less self-conscious\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wreckage seems to get worse after that.  Still, after an exhaustive night search, you manage to find 2 more med-kits, a couple more sinks with enough water to thoroughly rinse and nearly fill your gallon bleach jug.  And a crate of 36 rations.  Individually, the rations are light, but carrying the entire crate of them would slow you down, even if you stuff them all into the trash bag.  Sadly, the tools you need to hack the weapon safeties prove elusive.  There doesn\u2019t seem to be much more of the wreckage worth searching, but you see that the sky is beginning to brighten with the approaching dawn.  It\u2019s time to make a decision:  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf you stay with the wreckage, you might be able to find more in the daylight and you might even manage a decent shelter.  Is a search party coming?  Do you want to be found and rescued if it means going back to prison?  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf you leave the wreckage, can you survive in the alien jungle?  Is this planet inhabited?  If it is, are the locals friendly?  Do they have a ship to take you home?  Where is home?  You sigh heavily and consider your options\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It lands on its feet and skitters in an arc around you, its front feet raised like claws, as it seems to look for an opening to attack.  You open the med-kit, causing the contents to fall and scatter, but you managed to grab hold of the mono-filament scalpel and pull the sheath off just in time for the bug to make another leap at you.  This time it latches onto your abdomen and begins cutting into your flesh with its razor sharp barbed legs as it extends what looks like a clear glass feeding tube.

You don\u2019t care to find out either way.  Remembering the need to arm yourself and fix your leg, you get busy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst things first...  You pull the MPL out from under the guard\u2019s corpse.  You look at the familiar feeling weapon and know that you have used one before, but you don\u2019t remember where or why.  You also notice the bio-lock trigger.  It's a good thing you didn't try use the MPL on the bug, since the trigger is encoded with the dead guard's vitals and DNA.  You're going to need tools to hack this.  Funny that you feel confident in that ability.  You tuck the currently useless MPL under your belt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGritting your teeth to bare the tremendous pain, you drag yourself across the floor to the wall with the med-kit.  You steady yourself against the wall and stand shakily on your right leg.  You grab the med-kit with both bloody hands and fall back to the floor, successfully dislodging it from its mount.  Inside, you find everything you need.  Painkiller first.  You tear the already ripped pant leg to expose your thigh and press the bright red jet-injector to your clammy skin, pulling the trigger.  Two seconds later, you are feeling no pain and the room spins very slowly around you.  With partially numb but now steadier hands, you pull at the metal shard still lodged in your wound.  It comes out easily, but bright red blood flows quickly after.  Feeling sick and light-headed, you waste no time grabbing your shin with both hands and squeezing as hard as you can to set the bone back into place.  It snaps straight with a sickening wet click.  Thank God for pain meds.  You slap a new-skin patch on the bleeding wound and then grab the blue jet-injector, shooting your leg full of nanite-gel.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFighting off the urge to loose consciousness from blood loss and the effects of the painkiller, you crawl toward a section of ship with an in-tact door.  You reach up and wrench the door open, finding a small lavatory.  Perfect.  You crawl into the slanted closet-sized compartment and shut the door, pulling the \u201coccupied\u201d latch and hoping that the bugs are the worst things looking for you.  Finally, you let yourself drift into deep narcotic-induced sleep\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>You dream of a prison transport.  A familiar black jump-suited guard just hit you with a stun baton for no reason.  You feel helpless as you choke down your anger and fight the urge to retaliate.  Suddenly there is a violent lurch and alarms start screaming.  The room is bathed in red flashing lights.  The guard looks frightened for the first time and dashes out.  You\u2019re left standing there with an intense sense of dread\u2026</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wake up feeling groggy and your head is pounding, but otherwise back in one piece.  You move your left leg to test it and find that the nanites repaired the bone and laceration perfectly.  Not even a scar left under the layer of dried blood.  You\u2019re hungry and thirsty.  You reach out and unlatch the door, pushing it open tentatively.  Cooler but still humid night air rushes in, along with a cacophony of chirps, chitters, and shrieks from who knows what.  You could probably walk now, taking your chances with the nocturnal critters and search the ship\u2019s wreckage for food and water, or you could get some more sleep and see if you can hold out until you have some daylight\u2026</span></div></div>",

You grab the handle of the laser and bring it around to pull the trigger on the nasty bug, point blank.  Nothing happens.  You realize with horror that the laser has a bio-trigger safety and it will only fire for the now-dead guard in the black jumpsuit.  You grasp and flail at the creature, trying to dislodge it, but it\u2019s barbed legs have dug into your skin like a giant tick.  What looks like a clear glass feeding tube unfolds from its head and stabs into your stomach.  You watch in helpless terror as the tube fills with your blood, and then you notice the pain is instantly gone, along with the ability to move any of your muscles.  You\u2019re completely paralyzed, not even breathing, as you watch the translucent creature gorge on your blood until all but its legs are crimson red.  Finally, blissful darkness takes you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are dead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlease feel free to go back and choose another path since, thankfully, this is only a story.</span></div></div>",
