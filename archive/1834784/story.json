Your nose itches for some reason, and you try to scratch it, but you cannot. Your arm is restrained above your head, along with your other arm. You try moving your legs, but they are bent at the knees and restrained in front of you. What could be happening, you wonder? Suddenly, you hear a voice on what sounds like an intercom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n???: Hello, Dilex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou suddenly remember your name is Dilex. How could you have forgotten? Something must've caused a concussion... You continue to listen to the voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n???: I want to play a game with you. You normally hate this, but let's see what happens now. Your brain has been planted with a small device that makes you think of certain things in certain ways that you are told. Don't worry, we didn't fracture your precious skull. Please.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grit your teeth at the voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n???: You might notice that you're only in shorts. While this may embarrass you, keep in mind that this will be important later. The game will start at the sound of your voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gulp in fear. You decide to...</span></div></div>",

That\u2019s why I have brought you here! Before you is a new test one that will require you to take a more active role in your tickling! Please look down at your feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked down. You were surprised to see a pair of boots covering your feet and legs halfway up to your knees. They appeared to strapped in place securely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n???: Try taking a step in them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou lowered one foot to the ground, only to draw it back up immediately. That tickled!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n???: The boots you are wearing are specially designed to tickle the feet of the wearer. The more pressure that is applied, the more they tickle. Also, as a warning, do not try to remove them, or you will be punished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gulped at that, not wanting to know what would be done to punish you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n???: You have five minutes to climb onto the treadmill. (A large timer with a red display screen turned on in front of the treadmill.) Failure to get on the treadmill within five minutes will result in punishment. Your time begins...now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe timer activated, counting down the milliseconds and seconds that were passing by. Struggling to stand, you were able to lift yourself up, despite the boots tickling you and throwing off your balance. Awkwardly, you walked/stumbled over to the treadmill, and with a little over two minutes left on the clock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n???: Well done, Dilex. You have completed the first part of your test. When this message ends, the treadmill will start up, and run for one hour. You are to stay on the treadmill, walking the entire time. If you stop walking, you will be punished. If you step off the treadmill, you will be punished. Your test begins...now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe treadmill lurched to life, making you stumble and nearly fall off. You recovered, and began walking with the treadmill. It wasn\u2019t going to fast - a brisk walk, really. However, the fact that you were being tickled with every step did make things more difficult.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDo you make it the full hour?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Failure to do so will result in punishment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gulped nervously, got up from your seat, and walked over to the square.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n???: Very good, Dilex. You\u2019ve completed the first part of your test. Please look above you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking up, you see a horizontal metal  bar hanging from the ceiling. At both ends are metal cuffs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n???: Place your wrists into the cuffs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou did so, and the cuffs snapped shut with clicks, trapping you within. You were pleased to note that the insides of the cuffs were padded, so they weren\u2019t digging into your skin. However, you were now stuck with your arms raised up, leaving your underarms and sides totally exposed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n???: In front of you is a maze. Many of the walls are lined with things that will tickle you as you pass. Please note that I said many, not all; some walls are clear. Please also note that some things will tickle you more intensely than others. Finally there are several routes that can be taken to get through this maze. The shortest route contains the most intensely tickling things, while the longest route contains the least intensely tickling things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Good to know,\u2019 you thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n???: Please be aware that you will be timed as you navigate the maze. If you take too long to get through, you will be punished. And if you do go over the time limit, the more you go over, the worse your punishment will be. Oh, and if you don\u2019t enter the maze in the next five minutes, you will be punished. Your test begins...now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGulping nervously, you walked into the maze. Hearing a sliding noise behind you, you look to see that the entrance had been sealed. No going back now. You walk forward a few feet, turn left (following the path), and encounter your first challenge. Both walls ahead of you were lined with long feathers for the next ten or so feet. Walking forward, you tried to stifle your giggles as the feathers gently brushed against your ribs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving gotten through that, you find yourself at an intersection. You can either go left, go right, or continue straight forward. Which way do you go?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Whilst you would normally feel only the disomfort and panic to get away, you feel oddly happy and giddy at the entire experience. Your feeble attempts at escape were instinctive, a natural reaction to being tickled, while it is actually a very pleasant to feel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou enjoy the very torturous tickling of the hairbrushes as they scratch their way all around your hyper sensitive underarms. Their electric touches finally get to you and you open up fully, letting a torrent of laughter erupt from your mouth, followed by a steady stream. Struggling is scarce and difficult in the way you are restrained, and, much to your pleasure, you find that even the most energetic of jolts cannot move you at all. Instead, all your energy is diverted to wiggling your thighs as much as able, though it is very restricted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApparently the computer isn't very imaginitive or the sequence isn't very long, beause this goes on for a long time to the point where you begin to lose track of how long you've been laughing. There is nothing in the desolate room to tell the time, nor could you see through you shut eyes even if there were. Over time the redundant tickling has lessened, and in the lack of any new methods or tools you feel your sensitivity dulling slightly but gradually.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust when you start to worry...</span></div></div>",

Everything else keeps on going though, which is more than enough of a perogative to keep laughing. Wondering what the computer has in store next, you wait impatiently as minutes pass without any new developments.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou manage to see through half-closed eyes three new tools approaching your nearly immobile body. One is an artist's paintbrush, which spins rapidly as it enters your bellybutton with explosive results. Whereas before the feather explored the recesses of your navel, the paintbrush covers everywhere in soft yet constant movement, forcing gales of laughter from your lungs. And the best is yet to come.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo electronic toothbrushes, attached to the machine with tape which gives it an impromptu appearance, lower themselves to your taught and defenseless hollows. A mixture of fear and giddy anticipation fill you, and you cannot help but watch as these new devices descend into the center of your armpits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bristle are facing away from you so that the plastic tip of both toothbrushes rest comfortably in your hollows. Without warning they run on, vibrating every so slightly yet incessantly. Each little motion pushes you a little bit farther into hysteria, and you're enjoying every second of it. The computer seemed to have been programmed with someinformation on you, as the places where the tools landed just happened to be the exceptionally sweet spots, getting the most out of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis carries on for some time, going well into a second hour and beyond. Every moment is consumed with tickling, and your laughter has long gone silent. Now completely devoid of energy, you cannot even wiggle your thighs anymore and leave yourself still and open for the machine to torment. With this new opportunity, the computer takes the chance to slide two long stiff feathers into your shorts. It pulls both back and forth, causing the bristles to brush against your terribly ticklish thighs. Tears begin to slowly appear in your eyes, but you just can't bring yourself to ask for it all to end.</span></div></div>",
