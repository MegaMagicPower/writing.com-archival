Grabbing the keys from the top of the small mountain of paperwork occupying the front seat of his car he let himself into his new home. As expected the interior was furnished and had a lived in feel although a cleaning team from the lawyers office had gone through to spruce up the place. Carrying a small bag of clothes up the stairs Tom found a large bedroom with an attached bathroom just down the hall from the master bedroom. Dropping his things for the moment Tom wandered down the hall toward the master bedroom intending to inspect it. Entering the large room Tom immediately took not of the hard wood floors the modern furniture which seemed wrong for a house inhabited by an old lady. Noticing a small object that lay gleaming on a side table with a small folded piece of paper next to it Tom went to examine it. Tom read the note first which claimed to have been written by his grandmother who entrusted her former home to him and this jewel which would ensure everything his grandmother hoped for him would occur.     </span></div></div>",

Inside was what could only be described as a laboratory but it seemed to be something more. Instead of fancy machines there where drying racks with plants on them, instead of lab tables there where old wooden stands with books and old looking papers scattered about them. In short Tom realized this was a witches layer. Going to one shelf which held many items who's purpose he could not even begin to guess. There where three tubes of liquid held in a triangle shape by an ornate bronze holder. There was small sack filled with what appeared to be powder; a large and old looking book with giant leather covers on either end. There looked to be a cliche wooden stick which could only be a magical wand, and there was so much more on the various levels of the shelves but Tom reached for one in particular.    </span></div></div>",

Examining it a little closer he knows the top had a screw set in it, twisting it and pulling away a long sharp needle appeared at the its end cleverly disguised as the top of the brass ornament.Placing the needle back in its built-in sheath Tom examined the brass ornament closer. When he looked upon with the other side he noticed there was some writing set into the metal. Looking closely can only discern a few words, but they made plenty sense when put together. Apparently, three vials were used to change one's appearance temporarily. Looking closer at the vials one was blue, the others clear and red. Having always been pretty bright Tom quickly figured out that the needle was for administering the liquid. Curious, Nate unscrewed the needle once more and went to dip it into one of the liquids.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich liquid did he dip it into?</span></div></div>",

Briefly considered how unsanitary this could potentially be but ignored it, only having thoughts are what this could potentially do. He held the needle in his right hand held out his left arm palm up. Without hesitation he made one tiny little prick onto the side of his arm, oddly enough it really didn't hurt. \"So I guess now I make my change?\" Tom had correctly guessed that it had to be a change to himself. He carried, himself a bodybuilder,make himself taller, the options are really endless. The new thought, speaking aloud he said \"make me very attractive\". Bracing himself for an expected change he was somewhat surprised when nothing occurred.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens? </span></div></div>",

It hardly drew a response in Tom's mind as it grew extending down his fingertips he began to take notice. Glancing down Tom notices nails growing longer in his skin changing tone. Feeling grew ever stronger as it accelerated up Tom's arms, to his shoulders, to his chest, to his waist, to his head, to his legs, to his feet, to his toes. The feeling was of cold tingling fire that raced along the line of every nerve he possessed. A gasp that transitioned into a moan escaped Tom's lips as he felt his throat tightened slightly in the corresponding pitch of the moment increased. His eyes half leaded and blocked by strange substance that seem to be descending from his head, he caught sight of something bumping out of his chest, two bumps in fact. There is a faint twinge of pain ran around his midsection and then another two slightly further down. Tom was in a state of ecstasy as his eyes fluttered in his body burned with erotic pleasure.<br>\r\nIt took long minutes for Tom's return to any semblance of coherent thought. Having just gone through one of the most emotionally and physically draining experiences of his life.As his senses return to normal began to feel, very off. He felt for lack of a better term lighter but strangely heavier in other places, finally everything felt more sensitive. Something was different but he just did not not what it was yet. When he managed to stand up and look in the mirror he found out what it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://favim.com/orig/201106/14/beautiful-blonde-emilie-nereng-fake-fashion-girl-Favim.com-75341.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://favim.com/orig/201106/14/beautifu...</a></span></div></div>",

He had no close family members, the uncle that had raised him having grown distant but still friendly, however the rest of his family was estranged and wanted nothing to do with him, or so he had thought. On a chilly October day he had received a call from a lawyer who regretted to inform him that his grandmother had died. It hurt slightly but Tom only vaguely knew his dads mom who had never been a part of his life nor indeed his fathers as she had remarried after having his father. In short the Lawyer informed Tom that he was entitled to inherit a sizable house and property from his now deceased grandmother. There had been some issues with his unknown step uncles and aunts but the property was his by law, and following some lengthy paperwork Thomas was on his way to visit his new property.   </td>",
