            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>        It was after school hours, and Jack was in his Language Arts class, finishing up some extra credit work. There were a few kids still lingering around in the classroom, albeit not for educational reasons. Jessica was sitting near the back of the classroom, drawing something on a sheet of paper. It was a little odd that she was here because she was a grade below Jack, but he thought that maybe she had the same classroom as him, just during a different period. Standing nearer to the door was Trish and her group of cheer-leading friends. Jack never really bothered them since they were the typical popular group. He didn't really feel like he fit in with them, so he just avoided them. Apart from them, there were a few other people which Jack didn't recognize, just hanging out doing whatever. Something that did catch his attention, though, was the empty desk with a sheet of what looked like test answers from some sort of science class, and a cell phone. On the desk next to this pile was an open purse. Jack came up with an idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEarlier in the week, Jack had managed to convince his mom to buy him an interesting item online. A shrink ray. A company listed as SRco. had recently brought out a work-in-progress shrink ray for \"professional and recreational use\", and Jack told his mom that if he brought in this functioning shrink ray, he would get massive extra credit for his class. Believing his story, Carey (Jack's mom) went ahead and bought <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now\", Jack thought, \"is the perfect time to try this baby out\". With that, he secretly brought out the cell phone-looking device, and pointed what looked like the proper end toward himself. He clicked the \"Switch On\" button, and without making a sound or even emitting any light, spontaneously reduced Jack's size down to three inches. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately for Jack, he left his cell phone in his backpack and not out on the desk, so he felt at least a little more secure about not having anyone steal it. But now that he was small, where was he going to explore?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>      Even though Jack had never gotten to know Trish, he thought this was the perfect time to get an up close and personal look at her beautiful body. Once he made it to the ground, Jack made the dash over to the door to catch a view of the cheerleaders. What he didn't realize, however, is that Jessica was on her way out when he began his run over to Trish and was in the perfect position for her foot to give him a ride through the air. And that just happened. Within a moment's notice, Jack was flying through the air, still heading in the direction of the cheerleaders. Once he started to make his descent, Jack realized that he was heading towards the midriff of not Trish, but her friend Kayla. While Kayla was not necessarily the most fit of the group, her personality matched the rest of the girls very well. She had long, orange hair with freckles aplenty and a very, very large butt, which was all Jack could see as the girls coincidentally turned around as Jack was making his final descent to the ground. The worst was yet to come, though, as Kayla's jeans were slightly sagging, not enough to catch the attention of anyone her size, but certainly enough to catch the attention of Jack, who was heading straight at the gap between her jeans and her back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack awoke to a firm pressure surrounding his entire body and the noticeable smell of sweat. It was too dark to determine visually exactly where he was, but considering what he had just gone through, Jack could take a good guess about where he ended up. \"Curse my damn luck\" he thought. \"I really can't sink any lower than this\". But he could, and he did. After a little longer of conversing with her friends, Kayla began to walk out the door and to the nearest exit of the school to head her way home. For Jack, this was a total nightmare. With every move Kayla took, her hips swung and Jack sunk deeper and deeper into the crack of the giant girl. On top of that, Kayla gave herself a wedgie as she tripped over an inconsistency in the path she was walking, which kept Jack safe and secure between the cheeks of the medium built Kayla.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter another fifteen or twenty more minutes of suffering between the sweaty, smelly buttcheeks of Kayla, Jack had enough energy to try and struggle his way out. He managed to get his right arm somewhat loose, but it wasn't enough to get the rest of his body loose. While this was happening, Kayla was nearly home when she felt a very prevalent itch in her butt. Thinking nothing of it, she nonchalantly clenched her cheeks, and the itch resided. When Kayla clenched her cheeks, Jack lost much of his newly gained energy, and decided it would be best to just wait until the colossal girl undressed or found him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore misfortune came to Jack when he managed to overhear Kayla's mom tell Kayla that they had to leave to go to a family party. Jack began to panic, fearing that he would never get out of this confinement and slowly have his life fade away in the massive, sweaty crack of a girl he never met. With all his might, Jack squirmed and squirmed, and although he was unable to move very far, he got the attention of Kayla. Instead of simply clenching her cheeks this time, which would have been plenty enough to retire Jack, she reached her hand into her pants to manually fix the itch. When she did so, she felt Jack, but instead of scratching him or pushing him downwards, Kayla grabbed him and pulled him out, thinking he was some miscellaneous object. When she got her hand out of her pants and went to take a look at what managed to find its way into her butt, Kayla was astonished. It was a miniature man!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah! Are you real? Are you alive?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a cough, Jack weakly replied \"Y-yes. My n-name is Jack\". Kayla couldn't believe her eyes or ears. She started apologizing profusely and set him down in her lap. Once Kayla had shifted to a comfortable position again, she picked up Jack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does she say?</span></div></div>",

In all honesty, he really didn't want to tell her, but he thought that this might be a good excuse for Kayla to get him home. \"I can definitely try, but I need to go to the family party. I probably won't be able to get you back to your house until tomorrow, is that okay?\" Kayla asked. Jack shrugged. \"It's definitely pushing the boundaries, but my mom might just assume that I went to stay the night at a friends' house. I guess that should be fine\". Kayla smiled. \"Great! But now that we're going to be with each other for the rest of the day, why don't we get to know each other more?\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Okay, cool. I'm Jack, nice to meet you\". Jack introduced. Kayla giggled and responded \"Likewise, I'm Kayla\". Kayla's mom then called for her to hurry up and get to the car. \"Coming, Mom!\" she yelled. \"I suppose you got to come with me, Jack. But I can't have them noticing you, so you're just going to have to sit tight and hide in here, okay?\" Kayla motioned to her bosom. Jack nervously nodded, and Kayla pulled back the neck of her shirt to reveal her slightly tanned, massive mountains of flesh. \"If you are uncomfortable, feel free to try and get my attention, okay?\" Kayla assured. Jack once again nodded, then Kayla slid him into her cleavage and snapped the neck of her shirt back into place, leaving Jack in the darkness, comforted by the warm and soft walls around him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ride was more or less uneventful. The warmth in between Kayla's boobs was very comforting, and Jack relaxed without any issues. The occasional bump in the road jolted Jack up and down in Kayla's cleavage, to her enjoyment. She never messed with hi, though, and just let him be after the nightmarish event of what had happened in her pants. Kayla hid it well, but she secretly wanted to do something like that again. Anyways, when Kayla and her family had arrived at the party, Kayla took a peek in her shirt to check in on Jack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You doing all right, little buddy?\" she questioned. \"Yeah, everything's fine in here\" Jack responded. Kayla giggled. \"Well, there is plenty more time for you to relax, so make yourself at home\". Jack laughed and went back to relaxing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was surprised. There was plenty of breathing room, very little pressure, and no ugly odor or sweat. That soon changed, however, when Kayla began messing around with a couple of her younger cousins. The five of them began roughhousing in the living room, and Kayla accumulated a significant enough amount of sweat to drench Jack, who was in the middle, what seemed like to him, of a torrential downpour. Having as much fun as she was, Kayla was unaware that the sweat she had accumulated had loosened her breasts' grip on Jack, and he was having trouble staying within her cleavage and not falling down her shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoes Jack manage to save himself and stay within Kayla's cleavage? Or does the sweat prove too much for him and he falls?</span></div></div>",

Jack was quick to shake his head. \"No, no, no. No thanks. That was pretty rough for me, I don't think I'll be able to handle a second time\".  Kayla disappointingly nodded. \"Okay, I guess no more doing that. But I should probably get you back home or something, what do you want to do?\". Jack shrugged. \"I mean, some of my stuff is back at the school, but I won't be able to get it until tomorrow. I suppose going home would be the best option for me, do you think you would be able to get me back?\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Possibly, if I can get out on my own after the family party. I don't think my parents would believe me if I told them that a little guy was trying to get back home and needed a lift. If I can't though, you'll be spending the night with me and I'll be taking you to school with me tomorrow\". Kayla liked the sound of that. She was starting to grow fond of having a tiny friend. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do whatever you can to get me back home. My mom will be overly worried if I don't show up\" Jack explained. \"What, you don't want to spend time with me? Do you not like me or something?\" Kayla asked, irritated. \"What are you talking about? I don't know you that well, it's not that that I don't want to spend time with you. I just have to be home so my mom won't worry about me\" Jack outlined. Kayla shook her head. \"You don't want to be with me, I get it. But you have to be with me, so get used to it\". Kayla grinned. She gave herself an idea. \"Since you already don't want to be with me, but have to, I suppose you should get more acquainted with my butt too, since you don't want to be with that either\". Jack was startled. \"Kayla, you're acting ridiculous. Did you not just hear me? It's not your fault I need to go home!\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Kayla didn't want to hear it. With one smooth motion, she moved her hand holding Jack over to her back and used the other hand to open the back of her pants. \"Well, this at least should be fun for one of us\" Kayla smirked. Jack looked down at the open valley that was awaiting him. \"Kayla, stop. Please! I promise that you aren't the problem. I like you! I think you're really nice!\" Jack pleaded. But his pleading fell on deaf ears as Kayla released Jack down her back. Instead of going feet first like the other time, however, Jack was sliding down towards the mammoth crack of Kayla face first. Jack closed his eyes and waited for the inevitable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few moments later, Jack opened his eyes, but there was no difference in light. The pungent odor of grime and sweat filled his nostrils and he gagged. The pressure around him was rather immense, once again preventing him from even flinching. The combination of this stench and pressure was too much for Jack. He was beginning to pass out. But before he did, Jack could make out the giggles of Kayla, which vibrated in the fleshy prison he was ensnared in. Kayla clenched her cheeks, and Jack was out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he came to, what was Jack's situation?</span></div></div>",

Kayla shook her head. \"Sorry, little guy, but I can't have you bailing on me. This will be the talk of the team, I can't let this opportunity go\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack was a little afraid. If he didn't get home, this girl might get attached to him and she might want to keep him for whatever purposes forever. \"But--\". \"Oh, good idea, little guy. My butt will be perfect for keeping you from leaving\" Kayla interjected. \"No!\" Jack screamed. But it was too late. Kayla had already started to motion Jack back to the all too familiar gap in between her jeans and her back. <br>\r\n <br>\r\nKayla pulled back the waistline of her jeans and orange panties, the dropped Jack. He landed on her right cheek, but his momentum took him right back to where he was before. This time, however, Kayla knew about Jack and intended on keeping him in there. So, just to make sure, Kayla pushed Jack down further and further until his head wasn't even visible anymore. She then clenched her cheeks to make sure he was nice and snug and went on her phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack was freaking out. Now, there was no possible way for him to escape and get back to his house. Kayla had pushed him so far down in her crack that he nearly reached the bottom of her cheeks. Jack thought that might be an advantage because if he could get loose, he would be able to drop down and escape that way. But unfortunately, the pressure was much too tight this low in her panties, so Jack was unable to move a muscle. He was just going to have to ride it out within this slightly overweight girl's damp and sticky buttcheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Kayla was having fun. She was very excited to be able to show Jack off to her cheer team, but for the mean time, Kayla was messing around with Jack, which gave her pleasure because of the sensations he let off. Every so often, Kayla would squeeze her cheeks together to get Jack to react, and his reactions always gave off a nice sensation. This wasn't the case for Jack, though, as whenever Kayla squeezed him, the pressure would pain him and her sweat would pour onto him. Kayla decided that she wouldn't be able to do this for the rest of the ride, though, she would probably get tired of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does she decide to do with Jack for the remainder of the ride?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>   Kayla thought that she should probably change things up a little bit to make everything a little bit more interesting for the remainder of the car ride to her family party. This time, instead of pushing Jack further down into her crack, Kayla chose to shove Jack further in, just to see if the further he went in, the more sensitive she would become. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack was having a tough time with visibility as Kayla's sweat practically rained from above, and the dirt and grime that resided this low in her butt was getting in Jack's way. Despite these hindering his ability to see, Jack spotted Kayla's hand coming back down from above, and he hoped that it was here to bring him back out. But he was way wrong about that. The massive hand used its pointer finger and thumb to grasp Jack and slowly move him further into Kayla's ass crack, closer to her sensitive hole. Jack was struggling to speak up as tons upon tons of flesh rubbed his whole body. When Kayla was finished moving Jack, he was far enough away from her hole that he wasn't in arms length of it, but the smell significantly increased. Kayla tested this new area out by clenching her cheeks together, and this time around, the sensation she received was much greater. So, she decided, this was the most optimal spot for Jack to reside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Kayla continued her ride to her family party, she occasionally checked in with Jack to make sure he was okay by squeezing her cheeks and expecting some sort of movement, which worked for the most part, until after one incident, where Jack didn't respond. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack had nearly lost all of his energy and decided not to move or struggle in any way. He was stuck here, and there was nothing he could do about it other than to persevere through it. But the combination of sweat, smell, and the occasional clenching of Kayla's cheeks was slowly but surely draining anything and everything Jack had left in the tank. Just as Jack was going to at least try and maintain consciousness, Kayla gave him one more good squeeze, and the last thing Jack remembers was the putrid smell mounting within Kayla's canyon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKayla tried once more to check for a response from Jack, but still nothing. She then started to panic a little bit and retrieved him from her pants. Fortunately, Kayla was sitting in the very back of her family's suburban, so none of her family that was in the car knew about this, or gave her a funny look. Noticing all the marks Jack had managed to scrape up while enduring Kayla's trials, Kayla licked her fingers and tried to rub them all off. Surprisingly, she was able to get a couple of them off, but there were still a few significant ones left. Regardless of the marks, Kayla thought she had accidentally killed him. Starting to sob, Kayla hugged Jack and quietly apologized to him, hoping that there was some chance that he had survived. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Jack regained consciousness, he was met with the other pair of mountains Kayla sported. They were absolutely massive, and from what he noticed, the gap between them wasn't that big. He started to cough, his body involuntarily trying to get out all of Kayla's fumes that he inhaled. When Kayla noticed this, her sobbing stopped and a glamorous smile spread across her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my gosh, you're okay!\" Kayla quietly exclaimed. \"I thought for sure you were a goner after all I put you through!\". Jack chuckled. \"Yeah, me too. But if I can survive something like that, I'm sure I could survive a ton\". Kayla giggled and apologized for her ignorance. \"Nah, it's all good. You have no idea how many times I have already wound up in situations like that\" Jack reassured her. As the two were still talking about what had just taken place, Kayla's family pulled in to their destination, and it was time for them to go to the party.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, do you want to come with me inside to the party? Or would you rather hang out here until it's over?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does Jack decide to do? </span></div></div>",

But once she started to piece things together, she realized that this was an actual person. And the person was none other than Jack, the guy who she considered her crush. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, is this a tiny little Jack? How fun!\" Jessica giggled. It didn't take long for Jack to regret his decision of going to Jessica. \"How did you get so terrifically tiny, sir?\" Jessica excitedly asked. \"Well, Jessica, as much as I would love to go into the details of how I got like this, I do need to be getting going. My mom needs me back home to get ready for my Aunt's stay\" Jack quickly replied. \"Oh going so soon. Are you sure?\". Jack was desperate to get out of there. Jessica doesn't have much of a filter, she could do anything to him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's so interesting having a live action figure,\" Jessica laughed. \"I could do anything I wanted with you, and nobody would be any the wiser\".

She slyly responded. \"Since I'm so much larger, it would take me no time at all to escort you back to your house\".  Jack thought about this offer. It's true that it would take him a long time to get back to his house at this size, but he still had the shrink ray. When he got away from Jessica, he would be able to grow back and go home without an issue. \"That's o-ok, Jessica. I r-really appreciate the offer, though!\" Jack spoke. \"Oh, I don't think you understand me, Jack.

But he didn't want to anger her any more than she was already, so Jack forced himself to answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I'm sure your pocket would be a good place for me to be\" he offered. Jessica rolled her eyes. \"That's not very exciting. I thought you would have been more energetic about this, Jack\". \"W-well, I just want to make sure that I-I'm not injured is all\" Jack weakly responded. Jessica chuckled. \"Do you honestly think I would intentionally harm someone as cute as little you?\". Jack was still concerned. Jessica never addressed the unintentional side of things. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Probably not, but what if you accidentally hurt me? That's more likely to happen\". Jessica sighed and just gave up. She had managed to coerce him in to coming with her, so she might as well just take what she got. \"Okay, fine. Hop in then, and we can get going\" Jessica muttered. But before she opened her pocket, she remembered that her other pocket had a hole in it, and if she put Jack in that one, he might \"accidentally\" fall into her jeans and get stuck. That would sure liven things up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, why don't you hop in this pocket? There's a lot less clutter\" Jessica suggested as she shifted her right pocket to Jack. \"Okay, whatever\". Jack hopped in, and Jessica's sly grin crept across her face once again. Walking along the sidewalk, she'll \"trip\" and jostle Jack into her jeans. Then she'll be able to make it look like he wanted to go there, and she'll get to have some fun with a miniature person after all. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica got going soon after, and exited the school. Instead of taking a left and walking along the road that led back to Jack's house, though, she went straight ahead on the crosswalk which led over to her house. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn Jessica's pocket, Jack got comfortable. \"This actually isn't as bad as I thought it would be\" Jack muttered to himself. He did notice something that might be of some trouble, though, and that was the rip in the back of the pocket which gave Jack a view of Jessica's black silk panties. \"Definitely don't want to end up in there,\" he thought, \"she'll think that I went in there intentionally, then I'll be in a whole load of a mess\".  While Jack was thinking about the opening in the back of the pocket, he wasn't paying attention to the sudden change in walking route. Outside, Jessica was briskly moving along her street, only a few more minutes away from her house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's when she decided to go for it. Jessica noticed a pretty significant elevation change in the sidewalk, and pretended to fall. \"Shit!\" she yelled. The intense motion tossed Jack around the pocket like a rag doll. In his final round of movement, Jack started to head to that ominous hole in the back of the pocket, just as Jessica had wanted him to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut does he slip in the hole and crash against Jessica's sensitive area? Or does he managed to stop himself before whatever catastrophe lay ahead? </span></div></div>",

He was unable to stop himself from traveling towards the hole in Jessica's pocket and winds up fitting perfectly through the hole. Landing on a rather soft spot, Jack quietly lays upright and hopes that Jessica didn't feel him. But he knew right away that that wasn't a possibility when he heard Jessica moan. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica slyly smiled. Her plan had fallen into place perfectly. Now was the time to seize the opportunity and make Jack her new toy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh? Is that Jack I feel down by my panties?\" she cooed. Jack was scrambling to get out. This was the absolute last thing that he wanted to happen. Now she might think that he went in there on purpose and wants to serve her as some sex toy or something. Jack was unable to get far, though, before Jessica pulled back her jeans to discover Jack trying to crawl back through the hole. \"Where do you think you're going, little man?\" Jessica seductively asked. She plucked him out and brought him up to her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I notice you're not too unlike many other boys. Would you care to have a go at your target, Jack?\" Jessica offered. Jack rapidly shook his head. \"No, Jessica. You have it all wrong, I wasn't in there on purpose. When you fell, I fell through the hole in your pocket and landed there. I didn't want to do that\". Jessica giggled. \"Likely story. Lucky for you, I'm in need for a boost. I encourage that you change your mind, Jack\". Again, Jack shook his head. \"Really, no thank you. Honestly, I need to get home and doing something like that will not help me whatsoever\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But this isn't supposed to be about helping YOU. This is about helping ME\" Jessica uttered with force. Just then, Jack looked around him and noticed that they weren't on the path to Jack's house. From what he could tell, Jack thought that this looked a lot like the route Jessica takes to get back to her house. \"Tell you w-what, Jessica. I c-can get back to m-my house from here\" Jack weakly promoted. Jessica laughed. \"You didn't sound too confident there, Jackie. Are you sure you can do it? I don't think you can, it's much too dangerous for a small fella like you to be wandering off by yourself\". Jack was insistent on going back by himself. \"T-trust me, Jessica. I-I can do it\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, this is just getting us off course from our original plan. Let's stick to that, shall we?\" Jessica said. \"What 'original plan'?\" Jack questioned. Jessica giggled. \"The plan where you hop into my panties and help me get over this glum day\". Jack tried shaking himself out of Jessica's hand. \"No! I don't want to do that, Jessica! I need to get home!\" he demanded. In an instant, Jessica's happy-go-lucky attitude was gone. \"Well, squirt, I'm in charge and I say that we stick to my plan, got it?\" Jessica charged. Jack was still resisting. \"No!\". \"Okay, then. I guess I'll just have get this thing started myself\" Jessica grunted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gave Jack an extra tight squeeze with her hand, which subdued Jack's attempts of escaping, and started to pull open the waistband of her jeans open. \"You know, Jack. You could have made this so much easier by getting in there and getting this out of the way quickly, but no. You had to resist and you had to delay the inevitable. Well, since you caused so many inconveniences for me, I need some more time to recover, so you'll just have to please me longer than before\". Jack, with fear in his eyes, looked back to Jessica. then down to the chasm that awaited him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jessica, we can work things out. I'll owe you a million favors when I get back to normal size, I promise!\" Jack begged. Jessica grinned. \"I say we compile those million favors into one giant favor. You'll just get to be my new pet, how does that sound?\". She didn't let Jack answer. Jessica dropped Jack down her stomach, and he slid head first down past the waistband of Jessica's jeans and into her panties, where he was met by an overwhelming arid climate and pungent odor. Jessica let out a loud moan, then sealed her panties shut and redid her jeans, making sure her belt was a little tighter than before so she could enjoy Jack a little more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat was Jack's plan now that he was trapped between the forest of hair and pink lips of Jessica?</span></div></div>",

He utilized this opportunity to hide in a large cluster of grass in a nearby lawn to get away from Jessica. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica hadn't felt a sensation in her nether region, as she had anticipated. As a matter of fact, she hadn't felt anything anywhere, not even in her pocket. That meant only one thing. Jack managed to fall out of her pocket and make an escape. Jessica was fuming as she got off the ground and took a look around the surrounding area, trying to spot a less than doll sized person. But to no avail. Jessica waited a few more minutes and searched for Jack, but was unable to make any progress, and gave up frustrated. She then continued on her normal path back home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Jack had seen that Jessica had given up and left, he did a victory fist pump. But now, he had to try and make his way back home from here. Oh! But he had the shrink ray on him, he could just change back to normal and go home! Actually, no, he couldn't. Jack looked around him and noticed more than a few people were wandering the surrounding street and he decided that it would be best if he didn't grow back here. Jack thought that if even one person had spotted him grow back to his normal size, they would try and accompany him whenever he shrunk down and seize him for their own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut now with no opportunity to grow back, how is Jack going to make his way home?</span></div></div>",

Jessica lightened up and smiled. \"Good, glad that you have finally decided to be rational about this\". Jack almost laughed. \"Rational?

Jessica gently placed Jack in her cleavage, then pushed him down into the depths until only his head stuck out. \"Comfortable?\" she giggled. Jack squirmed awkwardly. \"Not really, it's a little tight\" he responded. \"Good\" Jessica muttered to herself. \"I'll let you out when we reach our destination\" she informed. WIthout any disturbances, Jack nestled into Jessica's bosom and stayed quiet for the ride.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was maybe fifteen or twenty minutes tightly bound between the soft flesh of Jessica before Jack was jostled out of his confinement. As he was being dragged out of Jessica's shirt, Jack realized they weren't at his house. They were at Jessica's. Jack was too shocked to move as Jessica placed him on her bed, then called one of her friends. Jack couldn't tell who she was calling, or why, but he didn't care. Something was about to go down and Jack wanted nothing to do with it. When Jessica spun around to her closet for a second, Jack took the opportunity to climb down her bed and make a dash for the door. He wasn't successful, though, as Jessica turned around and noticed he was no longer on the bed. Taking just one step, Jessica nabbed Jack, still talking on the phone, and squeezed him to establish consequences, then once again laid him on the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTemporarily exhausted from the seemingly zero effort Jessica took in capturing him, Jack decided not to try and escape a second time, fearing that his fatigue would surely get him caught again and this time with more dire consequences.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA little while of waiting later, Jessica turned back to Jack and smirked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, little Jackie, for your audacious stunt, I've called up my friend Avery and we're all going to have a little bit of fun. All the three of us are going to play a few games, and I'm sure after this, you'll think twice about trying to escape\" she announced. Jack was worried. Avery and Jessica, although both quiet girls in school, were physically playful outside of school. Jack knew this for a fact because of the time they had tried to bring him over to Avery's house for some \"fun and games\". He shivered at the thought of what they did to try and get him over there. Regardless, this was a whole new situation he was dealing with, and now he was much, much smaller.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>     Not wasting any more time, Jack released himself from Jessica's grip, and slid down her chair. Irritated, Jessica looked down to try and find him. Once Jack made it to the ground, he sprinted as fast as he could towards Trish and her friends to try and hide between them. Jessica finally noticed him when he was about a quarter of the way to Trish, and got out of her seat to nab him. Fortunately for Jack, his small size allowed easy maneuverability between desks and could distance himself from Jessica with ease. Jessica, though, was having a less nice of a time and was growing more and more irritated by the moment. With too many desks in the way, Jessica lost Jack and went back to her chair, fuming. Jack looked back to see if Jessica was following him, but he was relieved to see that she had given up. He continued over to the cheer group and thought of a plan to get one of them to notice him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   It took him a little while to come up with a plan, but Jack finally thought that he could get the attention of at least one of the girls, if he ascended to a high enough vantage point. He climbed the nearest desk, making it to the top with ease, but he was still a little too far away for them to notice him. Looking around the desk, Jack noticed that there were several scraps of paper and some tape. He thought that maybe he could make a makeshift paper airplane and fly onto one of the girls. He took no time at all with the materials that he was given to make a sturdy, hopefully functional paper airplane which could hold his weight. Jack looked over at the girls, who were still chatting with one another, then decided to make his move. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Jack took a running start then jumped right at the edge of the desk and hoped that he flew. And he did! Even the steering was highly functional! Now that he didn't have to worry about the airplane even working, Jack was able to focus on his flight path. With the trajectory that he was taking, Jack looked to be heading towards the base of Trish's, the leader of the group, shirt. Without any issues, Jack made it, exactly where he was aiming for, in less than a few minutes, and when he hit the base of Trish's shirt, he ditched the plane and started his ascent towards Trish's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  But does he make it all the way up?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>     After his successful arrival, Jack ascended the mammoth shirt of Trish. He found the fabric to be especially easy to grip on to and climb. There were a few times where Trish's movements cause Jack to lose a little balance, but they weren't significant enough to send him tumbling back down. It didn't take long for Jack to get up to Trish's chest, but once he was there, he ran into some difficulties.Since Trish was so physically gifted, her rack seemed to serve as a barrier between Jack and communication. But, he took it on the best that he could, and even though it took him multiple tries, Jack eventually got over the hill. Literally. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n    By that time, though, the girls had been discussing where they were going to go next, since they couldn't stay in school forever. A pair of the five girls suggested going to the beach and suntanning while the sun was still out while another suggested going to chill at the nearby pool. Bah. This was just distracting Jack, outside of their restless movements, which were actually providing a little difficulty to his continuous ascent. He managed to zone them out for a few moments, and used that time to his advantage and made it up to Trish's shoulder. Her ear wasn't much further up, so if Jack could get up there, he would certainly grab her attention. As he was making his way up Trish's neck, the girls started to move. Jack lost his balance and fell back down to Trish's shoulder, nearly tumbling down into the abyss that was Trish's tan rack. Fortunately, he caught a good part of the fabric of her shirt and regained balance. The second time he climbed up Trish's neck, he made it. She was still walking, presumably to her friends' car, but this didn't matter so much at this point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   <br>\r\n\"Hey! Trish! I'm at your ear! Hey!\" Jack yelled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrish could hear something vague near her ear, but she wasn't quite sure what it was. For the moment, she blew it off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack was a little frustrated. Once again, he made another attempt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! Trish! I have money! I'm at your ear, take a look!\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time, Trish comprehended some of the words, the most important of which, was money. She flung her hand up to her ear and felt something. She grabbed a hold of it and brought whatever it was to her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Trish. You probably don't know me, but my name's Jack and clearly, I have an issue with my size\". Trish stopped walking for a second, in shock. \"Are you real? Like really for real?\" she asked, flabbergasted. \"As real as you are, ma'am\" Jack responded. Trish then opened the door to the backseat of her friend's car, sat down, then set him on the seat next to her while she buckled up. Meanwhile, the other backseat door opened, and Trish's bubbly friend Maria sat down. When Trish sat back up to grab Jack, she realized what had happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maria, you dunce, get up! You sat on someone!\" Trish exclaimed. Maria just laughed. \"Oh suuuure, Trish, whatever\". Maria then proceeded to rub the seat, flex and squeeze her cheeks, then finished it all off with a wet fart. \"I'm sure that your imaginary friend REALLY enjoyed that\" Maria taunted. Trish pushed her over, revealing Jack, stuck in between her tan cheeks. She carefully pulled him out, but he was out of it. \"You see?\" Trish said, \"I told you!\". Maria was astounded. \"Oh my god, oh my god, I am so so so sorry, little dude!\". Even though she felt bad, Maria still snickered. Trish turned away from her as the driver pulled away from the school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You okay, little guy?\" Trish asked. With a cough, Jack replied \"Yeah, yeah I think I'm okay\". Trish smiled. \"That's good. Tell you what, why don't you come over and spend the night with me? I'll take good care of you\". Something seemed off when Trish said that. Jack was a little suspicious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoes he agree to go over to Trish's house? Or does he prefer to be dropped off somewhere?</span></div></div>",

Jack quickly took her up on her offer. \"That would be great. Got like a tissue box or something for me to sleep in?\". Trish giggled. \"No, no tissue box. I got something even better, though\". Trish pulled back the neck of her shirt and revealed a dark blue bra, barely containing Trish's fleshy masses. Jack had to double-take.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-what? I'm not so sure about that\" Jack said, flustered. Trish giggled again. \"Then would you prefer this?\" she pulled open the back of her skirt to reveal silky white panties. \"Or, would you rather me hand you off to your good friend Maria?\" Trish moved Jack over to Maria, who winked at him and whispered, \"I'm always up for another round of roughhousing if you are, Jack\". Jack quickly shook his head and retreated to Trish. \"You know what, I think your first offer sounds the best to me. I'll take you for your word\". Trish smiled. \"That's what I thought, now hop in, Jackie! Your soothing slumber awaits\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack slid off of Trish's hand and gently landed on her right boob. He laid down and closed his eyes. \"You know what,\" he thought, \"this actually isn't that bad\". But Jack wasn't able to relax for too long as instead of keeping Jack on her breast, Trish nudged him toward the crevice between the two of her boobs. \"I didn't mean on top of them, silly. I meant in between. You'll be so much more snug and cozy in there\" Trish chuckled. Jack hesitantly walked over to her cleavage and looked down. It looked awfully tight and dark. Jack was unable to move back, though, as Trish tripped him up and started pushing him into the deep trench that was her cleavage. Once he felt snug enough, Trish stopped pushing, but she couldn't even see his head because of how far down in between her boobs he was. Trish lightly laughed, then started conversation with Maria.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the chasm of Trish's boobs, Jack didn't feel quite as tightly bound as he thought he would be. He had plenty of breathing room and was able to move his limbs pretty well. Trish was right, Jack was comfortable in there. After Trish had closed up her shirt, it was especially dark, but Jack didn't mind as he began to drift off to sleep with the rhythm of Trish's heart beat. He was awoken shortly thereafter, though, as Jack felt himself slipping further down into Trish's bra. He tried to grasp on one of the boobs next to him, but Trish's skin was too smooth. Unable to keep himself up, Jack kept slipping and slipping, until he reached the bottom of Trish's boobs and descended down her midsection. Jack looked down to see an inconsistency in Trish's belly, which was her belly button, but the other thing that caught more of his attention was the slight opening in Trish's skirt, which showed a passage into Trish's panties. Jack prayed that he wouldn't enter the dense forest of hair, but closed his eyes, unwilling to know what might happen to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Jack's descent ends, where is he?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Now that the girls know that he's there, he won't be able to get all the way up Trish unless some sort of miracle happened. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrish desperately tried to get whatever was crawling on her shirt off of her. It didn't look like any bug she had ever seen before. It almost looked like... a person? No, that couldn't be. People aren't normally that small. Trish kept swatting and swatting, but was unable to get the persistent little creature from falling off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guys, would you mind helping? I don't want whatever the hell this is to give me a disease or something\" Trish demanded.

When he turned towards the person who had grabbed him, he saw a girl with wavy black hair, dark brown eyes, pale skin, and from what he could tell from the front side, a very fit body. The girl pulled him up close to get a better look at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guys? I don't think this is a bug at all.

Yes, I'm a real person, my name's Jack and I'm sixteen. I needed to get the attention of one of you, so I could get some help\" Jack told. The girls gasped. Rylee was the first to approach him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, so you are real and you do speak. I suppose you were coming here looking for a good time, huh?\" Rylee sarcastically said. Jack was feeling a little pressure. \"No! No! I just needed help because I'm so small! That girl in the back was trying to kidnap me and I needed to get away from her!\". The girls looked back at Jessica and smugly laughed. \"Yeah, she is an odd one for sure. Well, girls, anyone want him?\" Rylee offered. Jack was confused. \"Want me?\" he thought, \"This isn't an auction\". Before any takers could bid, Trish swiped Jack out of Rylee's hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Considering he was climbing up MY shirt, I say that I should be able to take him\" Trish claimed. While the other girls weren't exactly thrilled to hear that, she was essentially the leader of the group, so they all relented. Trish then turned to Jack. \"Listen, little guy, my necklace was confiscated by a teacher and sent to the office, you think you can get it for me? I'll be down to do whatever for you if you manage to get it\" Trish winked. Jack wasn't entirely keen on doing it, but it wouldn't hurt to gain the trust of one of the most popular girls in school. \"Sure, I'll get it done for you. What does it look like?\". Trish smiled. \"It's a diamond-shaped necklace with a blueish tint in the middle, be sure to keep it nice and clean when you get it to me, otherwise I'll have to get back at you some way\" Trish smirked. Jack shivered. He wasn't interested in what she had to say if he didn't complete the quest properly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoes he go for the necklace today or does he wait? Or does he go back on his promise and decide not to do it?</span></div></div>",

This could be an issue. He stepped in a checked around to where the necklace could be. Near the nurse's room, Jack spotted a box labeled \"Confiscated Items\" and knew that's where he had to go. Maneuvering around the many chairs and shoes lining the room, Jack made it to the counter where the box was, but couldn't figure out how to get to the top. There wasn't really anything that he could grab on to which would help him get to the top. Jack sighed, and looked around him to see if he could spot a possible place to climb. The closest possible thing Jack could spot was the nurse's chair and desk, which were near enough to the counter of the box that he thought he would be able to leap over to it. Jack made his way over to the chair and began his ascent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClimbing up the chair leg, Jack had a few challenges, but nothing to hard to overpass. After a couple minutes, Jack made it to the center of the chair itself and took a little break. He soon had to get up, though, as he heard the massive steps of someone heading his way. Looking to his left, Jack spotted the school nurse making her way over to her desk. Jack shot towards the back of the chair in hopes of climbing the back of it and avoiding the gigantic woman. Before he could resume his ascent, however, the nurse sat down and Jack fell back to the seat. He hadn't been injured, but now Jack was back to where he was before, and he now had to take into consideration the nurse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were a few more options Jack could now approach to making it up to the desk. He could climb the back of the nurse, he could climb the back of the chair, or he could try and make his way up the front of the nurse and get her attention. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich was it going to be?</span></div></div>",

Trish pushed Jack back into her cleavage, but this time used her finger to slide him deeper between her mounds, to the point where he wasn't visible anymore.

Jack was flustered. \"Uh, I'm sorry Jessica, but I really think that it would be better if I went back to my house on my own. B-but I really a-appreciate your gesture\". Just when Jack turned away to run, Jessica snatched him by the arm and brought him to her face. \"It's really not a problem, my little Jack. I do insist you coming with me\" she said with an evil smirk before releasing her clutch on him. Jack hit Jessica's right boob, then slid into the vast expanse of her cleavage. He quickly squirmed his way to the top, but his attempt was in vain as a giant finger loomed above. \"Let's get you nice and secure, Jacky. Can't have you falling out, that might hurt you\". With that last little remark, Jessica's finger plunged Jack into the abyss of her pale and fleshy rack. Jack was then silenced by the two enormous hills, and Jessica giggled as she buttoned her shirt back up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Jessica gleefully walked towards the west exit of the school, Jack kept trying to squirm one of his appendages free, but without any luck. Jessica had pushed him low enough in her bra that the pressure from her two breasts pinned every part of his body together. Without any light to foreclose any opportunities to seek, Jack was unable to do anything about the unfortunate situation he was in. He could feel the pace of Jessica's heart, which was beating quick with excitement, and was more than warm enough for his liking. As her heart rate slowed down, however, Jack became accustomed to the rhythm, and drowsiness overtook him as he faded into a light sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack soon woke up. It was still dark and he could still feel the pressure of Jessica's breasts around him, but it was less than before. Something must have happened while he was asleep that slightly jostled him. Unfortunately, Jessica was still walking, so if Jack could manage to escape, he would have to take precautions to make sure he would be able to make it off Jessica alive. Jack was willing to take risks, though, and soon began squirming once again to get some sort of leverage in his fleshy prison.

She jiggled her breasts a little bit, causing Jack to sink further down and held tighter. Jessica rebuttoned her shirt and went back on her way. If there was any shred of hope of escaping before, it was surely gone now. Jack had nothing to do but listen to the rhythm of Jessica's heart beat and rub into her pale boobs. In just a mere moment, he fell asleep. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Jack awoke, he was no longer in the fleshy confinement Jessica had him in. Instead, he was somewhere dark. Unknowing of where he was, Jack didn't want to take any risks and move around. Luckily for him, though, he didn't have to wait long before Jessica was once again in his presence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack's world shook as the area he was residing in gradually moved to his right. Light came in and showed Jack's place of solitude to be a drawer of some sort. Didn't matter much, however, as Jessica picked Jack up and placed him on her bed. She smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, while you were out, I discovered something in that little pocket of yours\" Jessica slyly stated. Jack grew a blank expression, but was nonetheless nervous. \"It seems to me like you had a little toy of some sort that you didn't notify me of\". Jack froze. He checked both of his pocket but they were both empty: his shrink ray was missing. With fear, Jack noticed his device on the now open palm of Jessica. \"Why don't we try this thing out, shall we?\" Jessica asked. Confused, Jack nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica set the setting to one foot and pressed the button. In a moment's notice, Jack was back to one foot tall. \"Awesome! It really works!\" Jessica exclaimed. \"Yes!\" Jack added. \"Now you can get me back to normal size!\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa, whoa, whoa. Who said normal size, little man?\" Jessica questioned. Jack shrugged. \"I mean, you got this far. May as well just do it\". Jessica was the next one to shrug. \"Okay then\". Jessica clicked the device again and Jack once again grew. But for some reason, it wasn't to his original height. Although substantially taller than he originally was, Jack was only about three feet tall now. \"Jessica? Why am I not back to full stature?\" Jack inquired. Jessica just grinned. \"I don't know, but I definitely like you this way\". Jack began to panic. He saw the lust in her eyes and knew that he needed to act quickly and cleverly in order to bring things back in his control.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell you what, Jessica\" Jack proposed, \"I will owe you a few favors if you return me to original size and let me go home\". Jessica thought for a moment. \"Sure, that's fine. But you have to beat me at a game first\" she put in. Jack listened. \"Here's what we'll do. We're going to wrestle, and whoever can pin the other, shoulders down, for three seconds, wins. If you win, I'll return you to normal height and you can leave. If I win, you get to become more acquainted with this\" Jessica offered as she pointed to her ass. \"Right now, you're the absolute perfect height to become my new butt pal. So, what do you say?\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter taking a moment to think, what does Jack say?</span></div></div>",

Thanks for making it easier for me, Jacky\" she said sarcastically, determined to make him regret this little act of rebellion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack tried to plead with the angry giantess to stop, but was helpless against the crushing size and weight bearing down on top of him. Not that he'd even be heard through all that padding if he could move and breath enough to shout, anyway. When Jessica finally sat back and took her weight off him, he could only sit stunned and gulp in air for a moment - until he saw her start to pull her pants down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh-uh little Jack, I pinned you fair and square. No takebacks!\" Jessica declared, reaching out and effortlessly snatching up the three-inch Jack, as he got clumsily up and tried to run. She squeezed him slightly in her grip as she picked him up, reminding him who was in charge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack swallowed in fear and gave up struggling, as he looked right into his captor's cold and impassive gaze. \"O-okay, I get it, you won! Just grow me back and be your b- butt pal or whatever, okay!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica just smirked. \"What, back to three foot? Nah. I think for trying to cheat, you should do it at this size instead.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout letting go of Jack, she started pulling of his clothes with her free hand. He tried to resist, but was easily overpowered. \"Hey, butt boy, what're you holding on to those for? You realize they'll just get ruined where you're going?\" She asked, rolling her her eyes as she pulled off the shrunken boy's last piece of clothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRather than wait for an answer, though, she simply reached back and, unceremoniously, shoved his pathetically-flailing body into her ass crack. \"Alright, here's the deal, Jack\" she went on, finally smiling as she used her fingers to push him as far between her cheeks as he would go. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI thought it'd be fun to win the game and make you eat my ass.\" Pulling her hand back out again, sans Jack, Jessica went on: \"Even though you're smaller now, we're still gonna do that. It's just gonna be a lot harder for you now, so you should probably get started.\" She pulled up her pants and underwear again, zipping them up and effectively cementing Jack's position in her butt \"The sooner I'm happy, the sooner you get to stop and come out.\" She finished, flopping down on the bed to relax with a contented smile on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack in Jessica's butt, Jack was struggling to even to move or breathe in the enormous pressure from being squeezed between her fleshy mounds. It was insufferably hot and cramped in her butt, and he certainly had no intention of eating it. However, his inaction soon led to further suffering, as the impatient girl clamped down hard with her ass muscles around him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Didn't you hear me? I said you'd better get started!\" Jessica was starting to get annoyed with waiting, as she felt nothing from her tiny captive save for the occasional bout of twitching. She clenched again around him, harder this time, to no effect. Increasingly frustrated, Jessica was about to start yelling when she had an idea, and instead just smirked deviously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, last chance. Jack Either you start eating my ass <b><i>right now</i></b>... or it starts eating you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Jessica laughed aloud at her own announcement, Jack froze in fear. <i>'She wouldn't'</i>, he thought, breaking out into a cold sweat that did nothing to cool him in his pressure-cooker environment. <i>'Would she?'</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut does he put that theory to the test?</span></div></div>",

Ascending a chair, rather than descending one, proved to be a little more difficult for Jack. After maybe five or six minutes, though, he made it to the top of the chair leg, but still had to climb the little way up to the desk surface. Jack persevered, taking a minimal break in between making it to the chair and his ascent to the desk surface. Climbing to the desk proved to be much easier, for some reason or another, than climbing the chair, and it only took Jack maybe two or three minutes to make it to the desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce he made it to the top, Jack encountered obviously the biggest phone and piece of paper he had ever seen. His first thought was to go and check if the piece of paper had a name on it. Before he could make it to the top of the paper, however, someone was making their way to the desk he was on. Jack had no idea what to do, so he started running back in the direction of the chair, but tripped and fell on the surface of the phone.

Thinking Jack was one of the attachments on her car keys, the girl then pushed him into her cleavage, not stopping until he was completely surrounded by her mountains, tight and snug, preventing Jack from moving any. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Crap, crap, crap\" Jack thought. \"I have to find a way to get loose and get her attention\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoes he eventually get loose and get her attention?

Hey!\" Jack yelled as he ran across her sternum to her phone. \"I'm right here!\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl felt an itch on her chest and looked down to notice some sort of bug crawling across it. But she soon realized, this wasn't any bug she had seen before. It looked like a person?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell? Are you an actual person?\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes! Yes, I am! I was trying to get on your desk to get someone's attention and you grabbed me by mistake!\" Jack partially lied. \"Well how about that. I've never seen a human being so small before, how did you do it?\" the giant asked quizzically. Jack had to improvise. If she knew about the shrink ray, she might want to run a few \"experiments\". \"I have no idea! I was making up some missing work in my class and all of a sudden, I was blinded by a bright light and next thing I knew, I was super small!\" he fibbed. The girl was suspicious, but then again when something as ridiculous as a small person comes to be, why wouldn't the reason be just as ridiculous? Suddenly, a sly smile crept across her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, little guy, did you like it in there? I can schedule you another appointment if you'd like,\" she said with a wink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, no thanks. Nah, I'm good,\" Jack replied hesitantly. He was honestly afraid of the girl's intentions. The girl huffed, and tried to change his mind. \"Are you sure? It's absolutely free, I'll even throw in a little extra support\". Jack shook his head. \"Really, no thanks, I would like to get back to my stuff and text my mom about what happened\". The girl mumbled to herself. \"What was that?\" Jack asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow does she respond?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You'll be coming with me whether you like it or not\" Nicole demands and she slides open her bra, placing Jack in her left cup. \"Wait! Stop!\" Jack pleaded. But Nicole didn't listen. She closed her bra and covered her shirt, then demanded Jack begin \"getting to work\". Nicole pressed Jack into her nipple, then he knew what she meant. She wanted him to please her. Rather than making the enormous player mad, Jack did what he was told and began rubbing her nipple, hoping that this might put him on her good side and give him a chance to go back home. Nicole purred in delight as Jack pleasured her nipple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's the way, little dude, keep it up. If you do a good enough job, maybe I should give you an even better reward\" Nicole cooed. \"Yeah, getting me the hell out of here\" Jack thought. But he knew that's not what she meant. Jack knew that Nicole wanted him to pleasure her in more ways than just rubbing her nipple. Regardless, Jack continued and after a little while longer, Nicole got to her car and took Jack out, placing him on the passenger's seat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, now that we have got to know each other pretty well,\" Nicole winked, \"how about you tell me your name, my magic masseur?\". Reluctantly, Jack greeted himself. \"So, Jack, how about we go back to my place and have a little bit of fun?\". Before Jack could argue, though, the passenger door opened and Mia's head popped in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Nicky, mind if I come over for a few hours today? I need something to do before my parents get back from work\". Nicole looked down at Jack, then smirked and looked back up at Mia. \"Yeah, of course, hop in!\". Mia smiled, then entered the vehicle, giving Jack a panoramic view of the short yellow denim shorts she was wearing. Mesmerized, Jack could do nothing as Mia's massive derriere descended, placing him firmly in between her massive hills. For a second, Jack considered himself lucky as he was stuck on the outside of her shorts. A couple minutes after Nicole started driving, though, Nicole informed Mia of the tiny passenger she had brought along with her, and notified that she took his seat. The same sly grin that Nicole sported had made its way onto Mia's visage, and she began to have her fun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMia began to mess around with Jack under her, rubbing her ass on the seat, flexing both of her cheeks, bouncing up and down a little, all to play with Jack. She let out a quick, but loud and wet fart, which left Jack tearing up and with no energy. Noticing that he was in the middle of her ass, Mia pretended she had a wedgie, and pulled back the fabric that was lining the middle of her cheeks. Jack fell in, and once Mia had felt his presence enter, she let go of the denim, and Jack was placed face first into the sweat-coated crack of the Latina. Mia gave her cheeks one final squeeze, knocking Jack unconscious and keeping him nice and secure in between her tan mountains.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Jack finally woke up, where was he?</span></div></div>",

Jack awkwardly smiled then thanked Nicole for her help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter she left the room, Jack was relieved. For a moment there, he thought things were going to go south real quick. But fortunately, that ended up not being the case. Now, however, he had to figure out what was his next move. Jack took out his phone and looked at the time. 4:12 p.m. His sisters should be finished with what they had going on after school today, so his mom should be able to pick him up along the way from returning to get the girls. Jack sent his mom a text wanting to be picked up, then prepared to grow back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking precautionary measures, though, Jack looked around to make sure there wasn't anyone around who may see his antics, and once the coast was clear, returned to normal size. He got his stuff together without interruption then proceeded to exit the room and head to leave the school. That's when he ran into Trish, the leader of the cheer squad, by mistake. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, watch it, idiot!\" Trish exclaimed in disgust. Jack apologized. Before he could go, though, Trish grabbed him. \"Hey, aren't you that weird kid from Bio?\" she asked. Jack was puzzled. \"Uh, we don't have any classes together\". Trish brushed off this comment. \"Yeah, yeah, I remember you. You're the one who likes to look at our asses, right?\" she sneered, \"well then, would you care to give it a touch?\". Jack was befuddled. \"No, you got me confused with someone else. I'm gonna go, though, I'll cya later\". Walking down the hallway, Jack looked back as Trish and a few of her friends laughed and slapped their butts, mocking him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time he was out of the school, Payton had arrived to pick Jack up. Getting in the car, Payton quickly struck conversation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, how'd your day go, honey?\" she asked Jack. \"It wasn't too bad, got a bit weird at the end of the day, but otherwise not too bad\" Jack responded. \"Oh?

The girls sitting in the back were astonished and giggled to each other, making conversation presumably about it, but Jack couldn't tell for sure. His mom, on the other hand, was confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So that machine you have is a shrink ray? And you shrunk down all tiny?\" she quizzically asked. Jack nodded. \"Yeah, that's it. I know it seems a little wack, but that's the way it is\". Payton couldn't really wrap her head around the idea of it. \"I know you've had a hectic day, kiddo, but would you mind trying it out when we get home? I'm curious to know what exactly happened\". Jack sighed, not really wanting to, especially with Lucy and Izzy around, but he supposed that his mom did deserve to know. \"Sure, that's fine\". Jack overheard the girls giggle in the back. He slumped in his seat a little and dreaded the rest of the ride home. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they got back, Izzy and Lucy were anxious to see Jack's machine and raced to the door. Payton laughed and Jack groaned. In a few minutes, everyone was in the living room, with Jack standing front and center in front of the other three who were sititng on the couch. Jack took out the shrink ray and presented it to his sisters and mother. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is it. This is the shrink ray\" Jack said. The two girls uttered \"wow\" in amazement and Payton was in utter shock. \"Well, are you ready to see how it works?\". The girls excitedly nodded and Payton followed suit with a bit more modesty. This time, Jack set the setting to three feet knowing his sisters would probably have too much fun with him only a couple inches tall. Jack pressed the button, and in an instant, was three feet tall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSurprisingly, Payton was the first to say something. \"Wow!\" she exclaimed, mouth agape. The two girls, smiles consuming their faces, laughed. \"You see?\" Jack said. \"It's a functioning shrink ray. I could have gone smaller, but that's not as safe\". Payton nodded and said \"Well, now I understand. But, with everything under wraps now, I'm going to go take a nap, I'm exhausted. I'll make dinner when I wake up\". Payton then went up to her room and went to bed, leaving the three kids in the living room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, Jack, care to have some fun with us?\" Lucy cheekily asked. Jack suspiciously looked at her. \"What excatly did you have in mind?\". Lucy looked to Izzy, who explained. \"Well, we figured that since you have a working shrink ray, we could have some competiton fun. How does that sound?\". Jack, although very skeptical as to their intentions, decided that they may be right, it could be fun. \"Sure, sounds good\" he accepted. The girls smiled and brought Jack to the couch. \"So here's what we're going to do\" Izzy began. \"For the time being, you're going to stay the size you are and we'll play tag, with both Lucy and I being 'it'. If you can stay away from us for five minutes, you'll get our desserts  tonight, but if we get you before then, we get to do what we want with you\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis made Jack hesitate, but he thought that even though the stakes were high, he was very agile and could get away from the two easily. \"You got a deal!\" Jack smirked. \"Then it's settled\" Lucy responded. \"We do have to make sure to stay a little quiet, though, since Mom's sleeping. But you can start here in the living room, Jack, and we'll begin in our rooms\". Jack nodded in understanding, and the girls went to their respective rooms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow does the contest go?</span></div></div>",

The two girls giggled. \"Righteo, Jack, you're ours for tonight\" Izzy stated. \"Which means, you have to do anything we say\" Lucy cheekily added. Jack looked at the both of them and slowly nodded. A deal was a deal. Izzy turned to Lucy and spoke. \"With that in mind, what should we start with?\". The two paused for a moment then agreed on something. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You shall begin your night as our leg rest\" Izzy proudly uttered. Jack looked puzzled. \"Okay? That's all, cool\". Jack got down on all fours in front of the couch. \"Let's get this over with. How long do I have to do this?\" he asked. \"Until we are satisfied\" Lucy chuckled. Jack sighed, then the two girls hopped on the couch, took off their socks, and laid their feet on Jack. \"This is actually really nice, I mean, the sofa's kickout leg rest is nice but there's just something special about this\" Izzy smiled. \"Hardy har har\" Jack retorted. \"Oh? Is someone piping up?\". Izzy shifted her feet further down, towards Jack's head. \"Hey, boy, kiss it\" she demanded. Jack was disgusted. \"Are you kidding me?\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do I look like I'm kidding?\" Izzy responded, a sly smirk crossing her face. Jack rolled his eyes and hesitantly got closer to her foot. Izzy obviously had volleyball that day because the odor that eminated was strong and sickly. Jack did as he was told, though, and cringing, kissed her foot. The girls laughed. \"He's really obedient,\" Lucy put in, \"I love that\". Soon enough, Lucy stuck her foot over and demanded Jack kiss it. \"Why?\" Jack questioned, \"I already kissed Izzy's putrid foot!\". Sternly, Lucy reiterated her command. Jack, even more hesitant than before, once again did as he was told and gagged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good boy!\" Lucy exclaimed. After another ten or so minutes of having Jack as their leg rest, the girls decided to do something else. \"Okay, Jack. I think it's time for you to worship us a little, considering we're obviously bigger and better than you\" Izzy mocked. \"What the hell are you-\" Jack was interrupted when he saw Lucy nab his shrink ray and aim it at hm. \"Whoa, Lucy, be careful. That could-\" but it was too late. Lucy fired, and in a few short moments, Jack was a mere two inches tall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perfect!' the girls exclaimed. Jack turned and ran to hide under the couch, but Lucy picked him up, no problem. \"You know, I was pretty sweaty today after P.E. I was hoping you could clean up under my arms? That would be a big help!\" Lucy grinned. \"No! That's disgusting!\" Jack responded. His cries were for naught, though, as Izzy had already given Lucy a piece of tape, and she lifted up her arm to reveal a damp, dark armpit. Jack was horrified as he was pulled closer and closer until *SQUISH*. Jack was placed firmly in the center of Lucy's sweaty armpit, now drenched in what she had to offer. Jack tried to protest as Lucy taped him facefirst into the spot, but that resulted in sweat pouring into his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, 'little' bro, I hope you do a good job soaking everything up!\" Lucy laughed. Then, everything got really dark for Jack as Lucy lowered her arm. Jack struggled and struggled within the humid, wet confines of the strong-scented prison he was kept in, but would ultimately pass out after no more than five or ten minutes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he woke up, where was Jack?</span></div></div>",

But before he gave up so soon on this miniature adventure, Jack had one more place to check out. Mrs. Erickson's room. Normally, Mrs. Erickson was open to have kids staying after school in her classroom for any sort of activity, but when Jack made it there, there were only two other people other than Mrs. Erickson herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMrs. Erickson was a short but robust woman with short blonde hair and blue eyes. She taught a few elective classes, including Jack's favorite class, Accounting, and Jack and Mrs. Erickson had grown accustomed to one another. Jack was an excellent student in her class, excelling in whatever subject they were covering on a given day and being more than willing to help out a fellow classmate. Jack enjoyed Mrs. Erickson because she was very laid back, allowing pretty flexible deadlines and not overloading the students with homework. He had to admit, her body was definitely something worth talking about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Jack entered Mrs. Erickson's room, he was unsure where he should go first. In the back of the room, there were two senior-looking girls who were distracted on their phones. One was a tall brunette with small but perky breasts and an ass that Jack gawked at while the other was a moderately tall black-haired girl with plenty of junk up front, but no so much in the back. Jack thought that he possibly had ran into them a couple times before, but didn't know either of their names or really who they were much. At the front of the classroom, sitting at her desk, was Mrs. Erickson. Today, she was wearing a purple and white college team T-shirt with a black skirt. Even from down here, Jack could manage to peek into the open neck of her shirt and ogle at his teacher's rack. Jack noticed that her chair looked rather easy to climb, so if he wanted to get her attention, he could get up there no problem. The girls in the back of the room, although being further away from Jack, were sitting on the ground, laying up against the wall. This meant that Jack wouldn't have to do any climbing to get either of those girl's attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith these options in mind, where does Jack decide to go?</span></div></div>",

He gave in and just relaxed, hoping that whoever this was would be nice enough to understand how and why he got there and not have any funny ideas. As the girl walked, her chest swayed and the bounciness of her boobs flicked Jack's head from one into the other. He had to admit, he was enjoying himself a little. That was, until the girl got to the stairs. She began descending quickly, picking up her pace and the quick motion from her movement cause Jack to sink lower in her bra, now rendering his arms completely useless, even to squirm. Light began to diminish slightly, as all that Jack was now able to see was the mountainous flesh surrounding him. He was still able to breath fine, but without mobility, Jack didn't really care. He would rather pass out than stay trapped in this situation any longer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Fortunately for Jack, he only had to suffer a few minutes longer, as the girl got to her car and began looking for her keys in her boobs. She grabbed Jack, once again thinking he was a part of her key chain, and pulled him out, releasing all the pressure that had been irritating him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell? This isn't my key chain. Is that a person?\". Jack looked up to see who had confused him with a key chain, and it was none other than Nicole, one of Mia's close friends and while not necessarily a slut, she certainly had her way with guys.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes! Yes, I'm a person. I'm Jack!\" Jack announced. Nicole blankly stared at him, obviously confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jack? From eighth block History?\" Nicole asked. Jack nodded. \"Yes! I have no idea how, but I shrunk down in the middle of making up some work! I went to your phone to get help, but then you picked me up and threw me in your boobs!\" Jack lied. Nicole was having a little bit of fun with this. \"So you're telling me that out of the blue, for no reason, you shrunk? That makes no sense! I would have thought you used one of the recently released shrink rays and did this on purpose\". Jack was shocked. How did this airhead know about the shrink ray? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, no, but I have heard that there are some out there\" Jack continued to fib. Nicole shrugged him off. \"That story is completely ridiculous, I know you shrunk yourself on purpose, and I know that you came to my phone to try and have some fun with me\" she winked. Jack was indignant. \"No, no, no, you got it all wrong. I had no idea that the desk I went to had your stuff, it was just a coincidence\". Nicole laughed. \"Well, mister, I would say that this was a very fortunate 'coincidence', because I think that you and I can have a lot of fun together\" she smirked. Jack gulped. \"Uh, n-no that's okay, I n-need to get home\". Nicole once again ignored him. \"Why don't you and I go out for a ride, just the two of us? You know, just as a 'get-to-know-you kind of deal\" she said with a naughty look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Jack could answer, though, Nicole took the initiative. She opened the car door, then dropped Jack on the driver's seat. \"Well, well. How lucky are you to be getting the most exclusive seat in the car?\". Jack looked up and saw Nicole turn around, showing off her round, jean-clad butt. \"Now that all the passengers have boarded, I say we take off, don't you?\". Nicole then slowly lowered her butt down towards the chair, and Jack panicked. He ran towards the left side of the chair, nearest to the door. Unfortunately, he wasn't fast enough and Nicole's left cheek squashed him, slightly vibrating her cheek and Nicole purred. \"This is going to be so nice,\" she thought, \"having a little man all to myself will be so pleasurable\". Readjusting in her seat to get comfortable, Nicole raised her butt a little, allowing Jack to fall to the middle of the seat. When she sat back down, Nicole plastered Jack to the middle of her jeans, laughed, then drove away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere is she going?</span></div></div>",

She giggled. \"That was quite the ride, wasn't it buddy?\". Jack could barely speak, he was only breathing heavily. \"Don't worry, though.

Nicole carelessly tossed him in her bra and went inside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack, with most of his energy drained out of him, didn't resist. He simply laid back against Nicole's soft breast and waited.

With her gone, Jack could now make an escape. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, Jack had no idea where to go. If he even could escape, what would he do? He wouldn't know what leads where and what place he really should go. Jack ultimately decided, though, that anything would beat staying here. So, with no further thinking, Jack squeezed through the gap in the drawer and was soon standing on the nightstand. He took a look at his phone, which read 3:41, about six minutes after Nicole left him. Jack wanted to follow the time guidelines, even if Nicole ended up being a little late, just to make sure he was well off. Thus, with only four minutes to go before Nicole would reportedly return to her room, Jack acted fast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does he do?</span></div></div>",

Eventually, Jack felt his leg shake loose out of the girl's cleavage, and saw an opportunity to escape. Once again squirming, Jack managed to get his other leg loose then began to shimmy the rest of his body under and out from the girl's chest. What Jack didn't take into account, though, was the drop he was going to take after he freed himself from his prison. Once he was free, Jack suddenly began his descent down the shirt and midriff of the girl and was soon accelerating over her belly button. Jack looked down and noticed that the button on this girl's jeans was undone and a dark chasm awaited his arrival. Not wanting to fall from one confinement to another, Jack gripped on to the fabric of the shirt and hung on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack held on to the shirt for dear life as the swaying of the girl as she walked twisted and turned Jack's world. He knew that this wasn't going to be easy, though, but he was dedicated to avoid the dire consequences that lay below him. Jack began to climb down the shirt, not going to enter the opening in the jeans, but climb out from the bottom of the shirt, then make his hasty escape down the girl's leg. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite all the swaying from the girl's movements, Jack had little trouble navigating downwards and getting himself out from inside the shirt. When he was out, Jack grabbed on to the belt on the jeans and looked up to see who his unaware captor was. Jack turned pale for a moment. It was Nicole. She was notorious for her slutty behavior. Jack shivered as he imagined what she would do if she saw him. With haste, Jack descended from the belt onto the fabric of her jeans and climbed down as quickly as he could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoes he make it to the ground without any disturbances?</span></div></div>",

Looking back, Jack saw Nicole walk to the end of the hallway and exit the school, presumably heading to her car to head home. It was a good thing that he got off of Nicole, Jack wanted no part in ending up all alone with a horn dog like her. But now that he no longer had to worry about Nicole, Jack's next objective was unclear. He was standing in the middle of the Social Studies hallway and had a few options of where to go. He could follow Nicole's route and exit the school, enter one of the nearby classrooms, or head down the opposite way of the hallway and check out what other options there are.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack thought that the latter would be the best move, so without any further waiting, he turned around and marched his way down the hallway. No one was around the Social Studies hallway at the time, so Jack could relax and take his time. When he made it to a conjunction between the Social Studies hallway, the Math hall and the path to the cafeteria, Jack turned to make his way to the cafeteria. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn his way to the cafeteria, Jack passed by a pair of bathrooms and heard people within the Girls' bathroom. Curious as to what was going on, Jack decided to take a risk and enter. Turning around the corner of the entrance to the bathroom, Jack noticed two of the three stalls were unoccupied, and the one which was had a girl who sounded like she was crying. At the sinks, there were two cheerleaders who were doing their makeup. They were distracted with that and conversing with one another, so Jack could take the opportunity to climb one of them and get their attention. Although, perhaps it wouldn't be the best idea for a guy to get a girl's attention while in the Girls' bathroom. Ignoring those two girls, Jack was concerned about the third who was in a stall crying. Maybe he should go ask her what the matter is?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat decision does Jack make?</span></div></div>",

Before entering, Jack took a look at the footwear of the girl, thinking he might be able to recognize the person based on that, but was unable. He then ducked under the bottom of the door and entered. Looking up, the girl had her head in her arms and was sobbing. She had on a black sweatshirt with black jeans and sported dark brown hair. Jack took caution in apporaching her, making sure that his appearance wouldn't be too spontaneous for her. He didn't think it would be the best idea to climb her, thinking that she might think he was a bug. Instead, Jack stayed at the feet of the girl and tugged at her pantleg, without success for a little while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStaying persistent, Jack kept tugging on the girl's jeans for a few minutes, and finally managed to grab her attention. Slowly bringing her head out of her hands, the sobbing girl gasped, noticing the tiny person down at her feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn an instant, the girl snatched Jack up and threw him into her mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n*GULP*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow satisfied, the strange girl let out a sigh of relief and relaxed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLanding in a pile of mush, Jack stood up, shocked. It was now very humid, the environment very difficult to breathe in, and remnants of food scattered about, hindering Jack's mobility. He couldn't believe it. The girl ate him. Jack could feel the walls of the girl's stomach vibrate as she let out a burp and patted her belly a few times. He tried to bang on the walls and cause as much disturbance as possible to get the girl to hurl him back up, but it was no use. Jack tried scaling the walls, but the slick membrane coating them just slid him back down into the sludge of food. Now with nowhere to go but down, Jack gave up, praying that somehow he would be able to survive this ordeal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter what felt like hours, the stomach juices had finally done a number on the food surrounding Jack, and it seemed like he was next. Not wanting an agonizing death, Jack frantically searched for any possible hole or crevice he could manevuer, and he found one. Noticing a hole in the inferior portion of the stomach, Jack made his way over there and dove in. But instead of magically saving himself, Jack just dove further into the digestive tract and the acid here made quick work of him, breaking him down into nutrients that this girl's body needed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother few hours later, what was left of Jack was expelled, never to be seen again...</span></div></div>",

Confused on why exactly she stopped, Jack turned around and noticed Nicole's gaze upon him. Jack froze in place. Nicole had spotted him. After his spontaneous hesitation, Jack took off as quick as he could down Nicole's pantleg, desparate to avoid whatever sick ideas might come across her mind. He wasn't able to get far, though, as Nicole grabbed him and brought him to her face, curious as to what little creature had been scaling her. Once she got a closer look at what exactly the thing was, Nicole gasped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that a tiny little person I see?\" Nicole cheekily said. Jack didn't know what to do. Should he give himself up or wiggle free? Well, he waited to long and soon enough, Nicole had gripped a little tighter to make sure that whoever this was was hers. She giggled and asked \"Well, who are ya little guy?\". Jack gulped and hesitantly replied \"I-it's J-jack from eighth b-block h-history\". \"Oh, Jack is it? I don't recall us ever getting to know each other. Might we begin right now?\" Nicole slyly smiled. \"N-no that's o-okay. I-if you could put me d-down so I could g-go back home, t-that'd be cool\" Jack stuttered. Nicole laughed. \"I don't think so, little buddy. I think you and I are going to have some fun together\". Jack shuddered. This was what he was worried about. Nicole had a reputation of some interesting things and Jack was now going to learn up close and personal what those were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's get you back to my place so we can get started, hmm?\" Nicole cooed. Without waiting for Jack's argument, she closed her hand on him and walked into the nearest bathroom. Once she was in a stall, Nicole unbuckled her jeans which promptly dropped to the floor. Nicole opened her hand giving Jack a view as to what she had just done. Slowly looking back from the dropped jeans to Nicole, Jack was shivering. He felt he had a feeling of where this was going. \"Ready, little buddy? Why should we waste time and wait till I get home?\". After Nicole's offer, Jack went to make his escape. Jack only got to her forearm before Nicole grabbed him and once again brought him to her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Trying to escape, now of all times? Fine. Let's make this a party\" Nicole said with fire. Opening up the front of her silk red panties, she placed Jack in front of her lips and pressed him into them. Moaning, Nicole released him and snapped her panties shut, gasping another moan. Jack felt the humid environment as soon as he entered the panties, even before they were snapped shut. The wet surroundings caused Jack to slip and unintentionally move around, further pleasing the horn dog Nicole. She laughed her sexual laugh and slowly began pulling her jeans back up. Before buckling up her jeans, Nicole gave one final push on the outside of her panties which sent Jack head first into her pussy. She then zipped up the zipper and buckled her jeans back up, and began walking to her car. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You and I are going to have so much fun. I'm so happy you agreed to become a little toy of mine\" Nicole cooed. \"I'll never let you go, you are mine\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom there on, Jack never had the chance to escape. During his initial \"exploration\", Jack lost his shrink ray within Nicole and was doomed to remain that diminutive size for the rest of his life. Jack was never able to get away from Nicole, forever remaining her favorite sex toy.</span></div></div>",

Fortunately, Jack was moving well enough to evade her attention, but when he dropped to her shoe from the ankle of her jeans, he was sent flying. Everything seemed to go in slow motion for Jack as he was spiraling away from Nicole and moving to the south exit of the school. Not many people were near here even though the south exit was the main exit and entrance to the school. Much of the people there must have gone home already, Jack figured. Skidding across the floor as he landed, Jack was relatively unharmed. He looked around to see if there was anyone in his immediate vicinity, but there were none, so Jack headed outside to the main entrance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the main entrance, Jack noticed there was a car waiting at the curb, looking to be his mom's car. Unfortunately, there was no way for him to get there without his mom knowing his secret, and this was no place to be using the shrink ray to grow back. A little to the right of the entrance was a bench where a few girls Jack didn't recognize were hanging out. A little futher out from them was what looked like, at least from what Jack could tell, a prostitute. Although he had no idea why one of them would be hanging around a high school. That probably violated a bunch of laws. Past her was the direction to the school pool where Jack heard there was an open swim for anyone after school today. The capacity was only about 15 or so, so there shouldn't be too many people there. To the left of the door, Jack noticed Liv, Jessica's hardcore older sister. Standing next to her was a slender guy who was in the same dark type get-up that Liv was in. It seemed like everyone Jessica associated with, family or friends, had an eerie, dark vibe to them. From her reputation, Jack knew that Liv would probably torture him for pleasure, so it might not be the best idea to confront her at this size. Past Liv and the guy was the direction to the girl's locker rooms, a place high school boys only dreamed of going.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith these options in mind, what does Jack decide to do?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He slipped under the door, then headed to the nearest janitor's closet to grow back. Within a few quick moments, Jack was back to normal and he got out of the closet and exited the school oncemore. Walking to the car, Jack noticed out of the corner of his eye the unfamiliar girls watching him and he could hear a few giggles coming from them. Jack laughed to himself, thinking they were a little crazy for giving him such attention, and got in the car. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi sweetie, how was your day?\" Carey greeted. \"It was okay, just any run of the mill kind of day I guess\" Jack chuckled dryly. Carey smiled, then pulled out of the school and on the road home. \"So how did the extra credit thing go?\" she asked. Jack was puzzled, forgetting for a moment that he had to lie about the shrink ray. \"Oh!\" he realized, \"it went well, got enough points to raise my grade up from a B to a B+ so that's good\". Carey nodded in agreement. \"Yeah, definitely. Better points for your GPA\". After that last remark, silence fell as both Jack and Carey couldn't come up with anything to say. Until, that is, Carey wanted to talk more about the shrink ray.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what was the thing that you used for extra credit? A shrink ray?\" Carey questioned. Jack nodded. \"So what did you exactly do to get the extra credit? Did you try it out?\". Jack explained that he didn't need to use it, he just had to bring it in to the classroom for an inspection. \"Did you ever think about trying it out, hon? I mean, a shrink ray is a huge invention, if it properly works, it could be a huge step forward for technology\" Carey pushed. Jack laughed. \"Do YOU want to try it out, Mom? That's kind of the vibe I'm catching from you\". Carey nervously laughed, knowing full well she did. \"Well, I don't think it would hurt anything...\". Jack laughed again. \"Tell you what, Mom. We can try it out at the house when we get back, if that's okay with you?\". Even though she thought it might be a little dangerous using it near the house, Carey agreed. She was too excited to really care as much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Carey and Jack arrived at the house, they hastily got out of the car and into the house. Both were excited about running a test run. Even though he had already used it at school, Jack felt relieved that he wouldn't have to hide the shrink ray as much around his mom. Carey was just ecstatic about what could be a very useful tool for her, in many different ways. The girls, Izzy and Lucy, hadn't arrived at the house yet. Jack presumed they were still on their way home on the bus or something like that. This was the perfect time to use it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what should we try it out on?\" Jack asked. Carey blushed, nervous and ashamed of what she was about to say. \"Well, I need to ask a little favor from you, Jack. I have some food stuck in one of my back molars and I can't reach it. I was hoping you would shrink down and get it out for me?\". Jack double taked. Was she being serious? If something went wrong, Jack could be seriously harmed or killed! \"A-are you sure, Mom?\" Jack quivered. Carey nodded. Jack, still scared, nodded slowly and said he would try. Jack handed the shrink ray to his mom and showed her how to properly use it, then stood back away from her and any near furniture. With one swift click, Carey switched on the remote and Jack shrunk down to a few inches. She picked up her now tiny son and brought him to her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ready?\" she asked. Jack nodded and Carey opened her mouth and placed him on her tongue. The first thing Jack noticed was the pungent odor of his mom's coffee breath and the humidity of her mouth. He gagged, but stepped around, looking for the problem. In no time at all, Jack noticed the issue and promptly fixed it, then poking the roof of his mom's mouth to let her know that he was done. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoes everything go according to plan from here or is there a complication?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He climbed down his chair with ease, and with minimal distance between his seat and the desk with the open purse, took little time to arrive and climb the chair. Although slightly tired from all the maneuvering, Jack wasted no time in getting to the purse to explore. Once he made it into the purse, Jack began tossing aside crumpled class notes and lipsticks looking for anything that might help him, in particular, money.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n He wasn't searching long before the purse began to move and shake. The owner had returned to collect her purse. Jack tumbled backwards to the bottom of the purse as it raised into the air, with belongings falling left, right and center. Once all the items settled and Jack was adjusted to the swaying of the purse, he began climbing the walls to try and get a better look at whoever accidentally picked him up. Unfortunately, he wasn't able to scale much of the purse before falling back to the bottom. The light beaming in from the top of the purse was too bright to allow him to see his captor.

He groaned but Eiko grinned. \"Look at you, you tiny\" she giggled. \"Now we spend time together\". Against Jack's will, Eiko brought him to her chest for a hug, and practically smothered him.

You know I not good at English, need help\". Jack sighed. Maybe if he did this, Eiko would let him be for a little while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Fine, Eiko. I'll help you. But listen, if I do this you have to give me a little space sometimes, okay? You try and hang out with me much more than you should\". Eiko nodded. \"Okay, that okay. But if Eiko fail, Jack owe Eiko. Okay?\". Jack was a little hesitant, but he knew his way around English classes, he shouldn't have to worry about it. As long as he could get Eiko off his back, he would be willing to do almost anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Deal. Now, let's get to that class, I'm sure they're going to start pretty soon\". Ending on that note, Eiko stashed Jack deep in her bosom and buttoned up her shirt, leaving him in darkness. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later, Eiko arrived at the classroom she was making up the test in and unbuttoned her shirt, flowing in light. \"Eiko, you could have been a little bit more careful, I was way down there\". Eiko giggled. \"It okay, we here\". Eiko proceeded to take her seat and the advisor starting passing out the tests to the few students who were there to make it up. Eiko grabbed Jack and put him on the desk. \"Remember, when teacher not here, you here and do this\" she motioned to the test. \"When teacher here, you in here\" she pointed at her pale cleavage and giggled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, but if we want to be quick about this, shouldn't I be in your shirt pocket and not your breasts?\" Jack questioned. Eiko shook her head. \"No fun, I want you here\" she once again pointed at her boobs. Jack rolled his eyes. \"Okay, okay. Let's get this show on the road, then\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe teacher then handed out the tests, failing to notice Jack who was still on Eiko's desk, and announced to the class to begin. Immediately, Jack got to work answering question after question. Most of what he saw was just basic reinforcement questions, so nothing to difficult. As he did this, Eiko kept giggling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eiko! Shush! You might get us caught!\" Jack ordered. Unfortunately, Eiko's giggling caught the attention of the advising teacher, who promptly walked their direction. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIs Jack able to finish the test without getting caught? Or does the teacher catch him?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>   Whether it was Eiko's constant giggling or the thought of the teacher catching him, Jack lost his focus and just mindlessly went about answering the questions. Fortunately, he wasn't caught by the teacher, but the half-assed test was going to displease Eiko, and Jack knew what that meant. He, himself, had agreed to owe Eiko if he failed because he was so confident in his English. But now, Jack had a feeling he was going to need more than a break to get by Eiko's wrath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThinking he had done a good job, Eiko scooped up Jack and placed him on her shoulder, then started walking to exit the classroom and look for Brittany to head home. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You do good job?\" Eiko cheerfully asked Jack. He stuttered. \"W-well, Eiko, I, uh, got a little distracted by your constant giggling and I might not have given it my best shot\" Jack explained. Eiko looked cross. \"What you mean? You do no good? Did you make Eiko fail?\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no, no. Not fail, per se, but possibly not as good as it could have been?\". Eiko huffed. \"Well, as long as it pass, it okay\". Jack breathed a sigh of relief. He didn't have as much pressure on his shoulders now. As long as he managed to be just proficient, then he wouldn't have to make up anything for Eiko. But reality can bite, and when it does, it bites hard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Brittany and Eiko took Jack home, he returned to normal. Luckily, his mom nor his sisters knew about his excursion with the shrink ray, so another crisis averted, Jack thought. But the next day, Jack learned of Eiko's test score, and he knew he was in for a real treat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Jack was heading to lunch, he spotted Eiko and hesitantly walked up to her, wanting to know what score she got. When he approached though, Eiko was none too happy. \"Look what you did!\" she shoved the test in Jack's face. \"You made me fail! Now I need second English class! You owe Eiko! Big!\". Jack looked downwards. \"Listen, Eiko, I'm really really sorry, but you distracted me, I couldn't focus on the questions\" Jack tried to defend himself. \"You know what this mean? You owe Eiko favor, and now I use favor\". Jack sighed, a promise was a promise, regardless of how ridiculous it is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, Eiko, I understand. What would you like me to do?\". Eiko looked at Jack square in the face then told him. \"You shrink. I watch and you shrink\". Jack was confused. \"You did see me grow back? Does this have something to do with that?\". Eiko nodded. \"Yes, now you shrink. Shrink now, Jack\" she demanded. \"What, why?\" he asked. \"Because. You owe Eiko favor. Now shrink\". Even though he was curious as to why she wanted him to shrink, Jack did as he was told. Within a few minutes, Jack was a few inches tall, looking up at the massive and well-endowed, Eiko. She laughed. \"Good. Now you mine\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack froze after what he just heard. \"Excuse me? Eiko, what the hell are you talking about?\". Eiko picked Jack up and grabbed the shrink ray. \"Hey! Eiko be delicate with that! That's the only way I can return to normal size!\". Without hesitation, Eiko smashed the device within her fingers and giggled. \"Now that machine gone and Jack small, Jack is Eiko's\". Jack screamed. \"Eiko! Have you lost your mind?! How the hell am I supposed to get back to normal now?!\". With a smirk, Eiko replied \"You not be normal anymore. You my pet, now and forever\". Jack was unable to respond as Eiko unbuttoned her shirt, and stuck Jack deep within her monstrous cleavage. He tried to pop out, but Eiko just pushed him effortlessly back down until only his hair was visible. Eiko then buttoned up her shirt again and went on the rest of her day, feeling a great sense of satisfaction.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

When he woke up, Jack was resting on a soft mattress, presumably, he thought, EIko's bed. He immediately rose up to confirm his surroundings, but when he did, the only thing he saw was the mammoth Eiko who was now dressed in nothing more than a bra and panties, satisfyingly smiling down at him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello sleepyhead\" Eiko giggled, \"ready for fun?\". Jack was indignant. \"Eiko! You broke my shrink ray, god dammit, you need to help me!\". Defyingly shaking her head, Eiko retorted \"No, you mine now. We play with each other until dinner\". Jack was at a loss, he wasn't exactly in a position to fight back, since he was so small, Jack was completely at her mercy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, okay, tell you what. In return for playing your games, you have to get me back to my house. Sound like a deal?\" Jack offered. Eiko mulled it over for a few moments but ultimately agreed. \"Sound good, but we play what I want, okay?\". Jack nodded. \"Okay, we start cat and mouse\". Eiko then grabbed Jack and hoisted him off of her bed, down to the carpet. \"You get thirty seconds for run and hide, if I find you, I play with you. If you stay out my reach for four minutes, you win\" Eiko explained. Jack gulped and nodded. Turning around, Eiko held her hands up to her eyes and began counting. Wasting little time, Jack began prancing around Eiko's room, looking for a place to hide. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIs Jack able to hide somewhere before the end of Eiko's counting? Or does his indecisiveness prove make him a sitting duck?</span></div></div>",

Unsure but intrigued about what it was, Jessica was going to take a closer look, but Rachel retrieved her purse before Jessica had the opportunity to check it. Once Rachel had exited the room, Jessica had hastily collected her things and followed suit. Noticing someone head around the nearest corner, Jessica rightfully assumed that it was Rachel, and followed her, which led her to the girls' locker room, where Rachel was going to change and recover some things out of her locker. That's when Jessica peered around the corner of a few lockers and noticed the thing which had climbed into Rachel's purse on the bench.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Jack was too distracted by the giant Rachel and was completely unaware of the approaching Jessica. While Rachel was still turned towards her locker, Jessica snatched up Jack and made a quick retreat out of the locker room. She snickered, and once out of the locker room, Jessica uncovered her hand to see what she had caught, and gasped. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, well, well. It seems to me that little Jack has had a bit of a shrink spurt\" Jessica giggled. Jack turned around and looked up at the enormous fifteen-year-old. He was once again frozen, but this time out of fear. He spluttered, \"W-what the h-hell? Jessica, w-what are you doing?\". Jessica let out a calm laugh and peered down at her miniature friend. \"I noticed you get into Rachel's purse, but I thought you were just some bug. I don't know why exactly I would go after a bug, but you're much better than just some bug. You and I can have some real fun\" she cooed. \"What shall you and I do now, my tiny new boyfriend?\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack was panicking. \"But, but, but- I'm not you're boyfriend and you're not my girlfriend! This is totally wrong!\". \"Oh? You enjoy butts, huh? Well, mine might not be the biggest in the school, but I'm sure it's absolutely massive compared to you\" Jessica giggled. Jack retorted, \"No! That's not what I meant at all! Jessica, please just let me go!\". She ignored him, and undid the belt to her jeans. \"I bet you've dreamed about something like this for a long time, Jack. You are so fortunate to have found me\" Jessica soothed. Jack was indignant. \"I'm serious, knock it off! I need to get back home, I made a mistake and now I want to make up for it!\". As he was saying that, Jessica pulled back her jeans to reveal silk black panties. \"But there is such a thing as good mistakes, right? There totally are, and I assure you my itty biity friend that this is certainly one of them\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica then pulled back the waistband of her panties and lifted Jack over to her back. \"Like what you see?\" she giggled. Jack tried to plead and plead with her, but Jessica wasn't listening. She released her grip on Jack, and he started sliding down the steep slope of Jessica's back. \"Then why don't you get a closer look\" Jessica quipped. On the way down, Jack was trying to grip onto anything he possibly could, but it was no use. Within a few moments, he slipped into the dark cavern of Jessica's pants and was caught smack in the middle of Jessica's two pale hills. She chuckled then said, \"You feel nice down there, Jack. Maybe we have to schedule more than one meeting\". Once again, before Jack could do anything, Jessica slipped her finger down and pushed Jack further into her crack. As she did so, Jessica purred with delight, then snapped her panties shut and redid her jeans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow in a much too tight squeeze to move, Jack had to wait until his captor was generous enough to take him out, or he had an opportunity to squirm his way out. Until then, though, he was stuck in between the ghostly white cheeks of a fifteen-year-old goth-like girl for her pleasure. At least he was still alive and not suffocating, although the air was rather stale from Jessica working up a sweat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens to Jack from here?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>   As Jessica walked along the hallways to return to her drawing, her hips swayed and she clenched her cheeks. Within the trench, Jack was suffering. When sweat wasn't accumulating on his head, Jessica was messing with him, one way or another. Even though he was in a tight enough squeeze as it is, Jessica took precaution in making sure Jack had no chance of escape by clenching her cheeks together. Not only did this prevent from Jack moving any, it gave Jessica a pleasurable sensation. To make the situation worse, Jessica had purposefully let of some steam and the noxious gas released could go nowhere other than right to Jack, burning his nostrils and tearing him up. Thankfully, though, this torment only lasted a few minutes as Jessica ran into one of her friends, Alina. Alina, though the same age as Jessica, had a much more matured body. Her boobs were DD, easy and her ass, though not having a specific measurement, was equally as impressive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Alina. How's the room coming along?\" Jessica began. \"It's going well. My stupid parents keep making delays, though, so it's only like halfway done\" she responded. \"Damn, that sucks. Listen, I have something really cool to show you\". Alnia perked up as she heard that. \"What do you have to show this time? You always seem to bring out the good stuff\". Not one to make suspense, Jessica undid her belt and pulled back her jeans and panties to retrieve Jack. She plucked him up from the top of her crack, and presented him to Alina. \"Whoa, what the hell is that thing?\" Alina asked curiously. \"You know Jack? From Art? This is him. He managed to shrink down to just a few inches and I was fortunate enough to stumble upon him. You want to have a go with him?\" Jessica offered. \"Hell yeah I do!\". Jessica tossed Jack over to Alina, who grabbed him and brought him up to her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven though he only had to go through the tortuous ways of Jessica for a few minutes, Jack had been manhandled by the pale mountains that belonged to her. Waking up from a daze, he was met by another pale face, but this one didn't belong to Jessica. This girl had sharp blue eyes and dark blonde hair, quite contrasting to Jessica's black hair and brown eyes. Jack proceeded to get himself energetic enough to introduce himself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi... I'm.. Jack\" he mentioned slowly. Alina giggled. \"Hi Jack. I'm Alina. We have the same Art class\". Jack perked up when he heard the name Alina. Although only fifteen, like Jessica, Alina had a reputation for being a major horn dog and having a thing for special toys and plugs. Now around the same size as one of the aforementioned items, Jack was extremely nervous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, listen Alina. Would you mind handing me back to Jessica? We live pretty close to each other, and I think it would be better for me if I walked with her\". Jack lied. Jessica shook her head. \"We don't live THAT close to each other, he's bluffing\". Sweating a little bit, Jack looked back to Alina, but she was smirking. \"Oh, come on now, Jack. Did you really have to lie about such a trivial piece of information?\". Jack shook his head, but it was worth a shot. Alina chuckled then looked back to Jessica.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would you mind if I took him for a little spin? I think he and I have some catching up to do\" Alina winked. Jessica laughed and announced \"He's all yours\". Those deathly words sunk Jack's heart. He was now in the hands of possibly the horniest girl in much of the school, without any protection. Alina thanked Jessica, then turned around and started rummaging through her locker again, getting what she needed to take home. Once she got all she needed, Alina zipped up her backpack and closed her locker, then started making her way to the nearest exit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey-\" Jack began, but he was cut off by Alina immediately turning him upwards to her face once again. \"Well, amigo, I'm already in the mood, so let's get this started, shall we?\" Not letting Jack continue, Alina quickly opened the front of her black skirt and pulled open the front of her panties. \"In you go, little man, do a good job, and I might consider letting you go\". She dropped Jack, and once again he was plummeting into an area he didn't particularly care to be. Now tangled in the forest of pubic hair that was Alina's, Jack already wanted out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow does he go about escaping?</span></div></div>",

The door to the locker room suddenly swung open and Jack took his eyes off of Rachel to look at who just barged in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"There you are, come on let's get going\". The voice belonged to Rachel's older sister Emi, who, even though in college, liked to stick around Tahoma High School for the laughs and giggles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Okay, okay, let me grab something out of my locker, then I'll be on my way out\". Rachel replied. When she said that, Emi spotted something down on the bench near Rachel's purse and became transfixed. \"Yeah.. yeah, okay. Cool\" Emi returned. She was still staring at the thing she had spotted when Rachel had gotten her stuff and was ready to go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Okay, Emi, I'm ready to go. I'll meet you in the car\" Rachel declared before exiting. Once she had left, Emi approached the object and took a closer look. It wasn't an object. It was a person!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack turned around to find an enormous Emi transfixed on him. He awkwardly waved then greeted her with \"H-hey, Emi, how's it going?\". A sly smile crept across Emi's visage and she suavely replied \"Oh? A tiny Jack? How interesting! Would you care to come with me?\". Before Jack could reply, though, she had already picked him up. \"I have a little ways to drive, I could always use someone like you to give me an extra boost\" Emi winked. Jack was nervous. \"Boost? Emi I like ya, but that sounds a little suspicious\". She laughed. \"Suspicious? Don't think about it like that, buddy. Think about it like a moral support kind of deal\". Jack was still skeptical.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"I don't know, it just seems odd to me. Would you mind letting me down, though? I need to get out of here, I fell into Rachel's purse and I feel like if I get caught, some girl is going to think I'm a pervert and attack me\" Jack explained. Once again, Emi laughed. \"Well if you come with me, you won't have to worry about getting attacked because I'll be protecting you\". Jack thought about this and reconsidered. \"Well, as long as you can get me back to my house in maybe an hour or so, then I guess I can tag along\". Emi smiled, then pulled the tiny Jack into her chest for a hug. \"Yay, yay! Good choice, amigo!\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   The innocent act soon wore off, however, and the sly and stimulating Emi came out. \"Well, I suppose we should find a place for you to hide so no one discovers your situation\" Emi proposed. Jack responded calmly, \"Yeah, I suppose you could hide me in your shorts pocket\". Emi shook her head. \"Oh no, little man. Like I said, I'll be driving for a little while and I need a little boost. I was hoping you could help me out with that\". Jack tried to slip out of Emi's grip, but it was too tight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you think you're doing, com padre? You're not trying to wig out on me, are you?\" Emi squinted. \"You know what, I don't want you to answer that, I like you too much. Let's get going\". When she finished up speaking with Jack, Emi decided to slide him in her _______ to keep him \"safe and secure\" for the ride to her aunt's house.</span></div></div>",

She was in here to change into her swimsuit and head out to the pool. When she turned around the corner of a few lockers, Erica saw Rachel, but noticed something spill out of her purse. She couldn't tell from here what exactly it was, but she could tell that it was facing Rachel, just staying still. Intrigued, Erica made sure that Rachel wasn't looking, then snatched whatever it was up and dashed over to her locker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell just happened?\" Jack questioned to himself as he was now facing nothing but darkness. He tried to get up and out of wherever he was, but it was no use. It was starting to get hot, though, so Jack struggled as best as he could to get out of his confinement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen sat down in front of her locker, Erica felt the thing moving, so she opened her hand and what she saw amazed her. With her jaw loose with amazement, Erica asked \"Woah. Are you an actual tiny person?\". Before Jack was able to answer, though, Erica, in her excitement, ignored her own question. \"That is soooo cool! You must have so many struggles, but so many fun adventures!\" she fantasized out loud. Jack laughed. He noted that this girl didn't really have a filter, but he thought it was funny. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I'm small, but my troubles aren't endless. I mean, I do run across some obstacles at this size, from time to time, but for the most part, I'm good\" Jack informed.

Jack shook his head in disapproval. \"No, that is not something that you should do or 'have to' do. I should probably be getting home right now, so if you mind, please set me down\". Erica pouted. 'That's stupid, it would only take a second. Come on, it would be cool!\". Jack once again disagreed. \"Please. Just let me do my thing and maybe I'll owe you on later\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoes Erica take Jack's word? Or does she actually take him?</span></div></div>",

But he was to small to reach anything, so he decided that the best move to do would just be to leave. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nExiting the locker room under the rear exit door, Jack found himself at the pool, where it was an open swim day. It was pretty busy at the pool, with a group of guys hanging out near the deeper end of the pool, a couple girls at the shallow end, and a few people lounging in beach chairs which were strewn about the sides of the pool. There was a lifeguard on duty, and Jack recognized her as Kira, an Asian senior with a petite frame, but knock out looks. Although there were plenty of people there, the person that struck Jack's attention was a very physically gifted, busty woman who looked to be in her early to mid twenties. She had bronzed skin, silky black hair and soothing brown eyes. She was sunbathing, and Jack couldn't help but admire her beauty. While he was distracted, though, someone nearly stepped on him, which brought him back to focus. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nScurrying out of the way of passerbys, Jack contemplated what he wanted to do. He could probably get help from some of the guys, since he recognized a couple of them to be from his classes, but that plan fell off when he noticed Erica making her way to an open chair near them. Jack knew that if he took a risk and went over there, it was very likely that the possessive girl would try and make him hers. With that idea out of the picture, Jack could head over to the corner of the opposite end of the pool, where there wasn't many people and try to grow back, or go to either the lifeguard chair or to the busty woman's area. Although, this scene was a little dangerous, maybe he should try and leave the pool to go somewhere else?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith all these decisions in his mind, what does Jack decide to do?</span></div></div>",

Making sure people were preoccupied, Jack looked back then grew back. Although, now he was somewhat of an outlier since he didn't have a bathing suit on. He thought nothing of it and went and sat down near the busty woman, who had caught his attention earlier. She noticed his arrival and turned over from her tanning to greet him. She winked seductively at Jack and motioned for him to take the seat next to her. Nervously, Jack did so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, well, you're handsome. Might I ask for your name?\" the woman inquired. \"I-it's Jack\" Jack stuttered. The woman chuckled. \"Aw, how cute. You're nervous. Why don't we share a seat together, hmm?\". Jack doubletaked. \"What?\". The lady laughed again. \"Come, I can sit on your lap\". Jack was unsure of what to do. She knew he was in high school, right? And that they were at a public pool? The lady sensed Jack's uncertainty and grabbed his arm. \"Tell you what, cutie, I'm going to get in the pool. Maybe afterwards you'll have thought it through\" she winked. With that, the young woman dove into the pool and waded around. Relieved that this ordeal was over, Jack leaned back and accidentally hit the shrink ray. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn an instant, Jack was just a few inches tall, alone on his beach chair. \"Shit,\" he thought, \"what should I do?\". Considering his options, Jack decided that now that he was so small, he could spend time with the woman without the ridicule of others at the pool since it was unlikely they would be able to see him. But now the question was how was he going to get the woman's attention? Should he go the edge of the pool and/or get in? Should he hop on top of the lady's chair? Or does Jack decide against getting the busty woman's attention and go somewhere else?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He managed to get up onto the lady's chair in no time and approached her left leg. He touched her smooth skin, and she jolted. Jack looked frantically up towards the face of the lady, but she seemed rather undisturbed. Her movement was probably just a twitch. Jack began moving along her leg up to her thigh, and that's when he was in dicey territory. Fortunately for him, the lady was entranced on her phone, but that didn't make Jack any less susceptible to her attention if he mad the wrong move. Remaining still, Jack waited patiently for the woman to make her move. And she did. Within a minute, the woman flipped onto her front, fortunately away from Jack, to tan her back. Her massive, tan butt gleamed in the sun and Jack couldn't help but get distracted by it. Foolishly, Jack got closer to it and regretted his move as the woman immediately flipped back over, smothering Jack under her ass. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell? Did I sit on something?\" she exclaimed. The woman sat up and lifted her butt off of the chair to reveal Jack, arms and legs spread out as he was flattened. The woman gently laughed. \"Guess I have a visitor\". She pulled Jack off of her chair and laid back down. Smiling, she spoke to Jack \"What brings you over to this neck of the woods, my devilishly good looking, tiny sir?\". Jack nervously responded \"Oh, uh, it was a misunderstanding, miss, I should be getting out of here\". The woman chuckled. \"Nonsense, why don't you stay with me awhile? You can help me tan\". She then gave him a gentle, somewhat seductive kiss. \"Tell you what, handsome, if you can get my back and legs then I'll return the favor. Sound good?\". Jack hesitantly nodded. The woman flipped onto her front and squeezed some lotion onto her lower back and thighs. \"Take it away, my mini masseuse\" she giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack began rubbing in the suntan lotion up and down the woman's back, her cooing as he did so. Slipping every here and there because of the surface, Jack was nervous he might accidentally fall into her bikini bottoms. Once Jack was finished with her back, it was time to hit her thighs. Jack gulped. \"It's okay, I don't mind if you have to go down a little further\" the woman giggled. With precaution, Jack made his way down the side of the woman's right leg, making sure not to fall. He did so successfully, then made his way over to her left leg. This time, however, Jack wasn't so lucky and he stumbled right onto the middle of the lady's bkini bottoms. \"You okay back there?\" she giggled. Jack weakly replied that he was all right and got back to work. By the time he was finished, the woman had gotten a little fatigued and began to drift off into a light sleep. Jack peeked over her shoulder and noticed her eyes were closed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith this opportunity, Jack had a few options. He could take advantage of the situation and explore her body, try and wake the woman up, or make an escape and head in a different direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does he choose?</span></div></div>",

He hopped off her shoulder, onto the chair and slip off the leg from there. Jack then ran towards the edge of the pool nearest to the girls' locker room. He didn't really care where he went, as long as it was away from that lady. Jack stopped by a nearby table and caught his breath. Scoping out the area, the guys who were previously at this end of the pool had left, leaving the woman on her chair, and a few girls who were in the pool. To his relief, one person who Jack didn't see was the freshman girl who took him earlier. Now seemingly in the clear, Jack began walking toward the other end of the pool, opposite side of the woman, to leave. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's when Jack heard pounding behind him. He turned around and noticed a looming figure heading his way. It was Erica, the freshman. She had come out of the girls' locker room and was fully clothed, heading her way to the exit. Jack quickly moved around to a garbage can, which was conveniently close and sheltered himself beside it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! Almost forgot to throw this away\". Jack looked up and saw the massive figure of Erica leaning over the garbage can and heard her gasp. \"Aha! You're not escaping from me this time, little twerp\" Erica forcefully uttered as she snatched up Jack. She threw the piece of trash in her other hand away and brought her hand carrying Jack around her back. \"Now you stay put, I don't want to have to squish you\". Jack, too frightened to retort, stayed still as Erica pulled the back of her shorts open and placed Jack outside her panties. She then let go of the elastic waistband and it snapped shut, pinning Jack between the shorts and the middle of her panties. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough the swaying of Erica's hips slightly shifted Jack up and down, it wasn't enough to break him free of the pressure forcing him into Erica's backside. He was fortunate that she put him on the outside, but even from outside, the stench eminating from within stung Jack's nostrils. Obviously, she didn't shower. Eventually, Erica got into her mom's car, ready for a ride home, and the felt Jack nearly plaster under her enormous butt. She giggled to herself and shifted around, feeling Jack rubbing on her underwear. She chatted with her mom while she subtly did this, talking about how their days went. Finally, went the two got home, Erica got up from the seat and a great deal of pressure lifted off Jack. Outside the car, Erica reached in and grabbed him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now you see what will happen if you disobey me\" she spoke to Jack, \"Now let's go. You have some work to do\". Without waiting for Jack to respond, Erica closed her hand, encasing Jack. Once in her room, she released him onto her bed and explained what they were going to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat did Erica have in mind?</span></div></div>",

I need to get home!\". Erica chuckled. \"I am your new home now. You belong to me, and as such, you'll do as I say and I say that you stay in here until I'm done\" she demanded. Jack tried to wiggle out of the damp clothes in Erica's gym bag, but he wasn't quick enough to get to the top, as Erica had zipped the bag up and placed it in her locker. Jack heard a loud slam, then a little click, and he figured that he was now locked inside Erica's locker, with nothing other than her sweaty clothes to keep him company. He tried to unzip the bag, but Jack couldn't find any way to do so. There wasn't a zipper on the inside of the bag, unfortunately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack gave up trying to escape, and laid down on whatever article of clothing was beneath him. He took in the stale air of the gym bag and choked. It wasn't completely unbearable, but it certainly wasn't something Jack enjoyed. With nothing else to do, Jack drifted off to sleep, waiting for his captor to return so that he would have an opportunity to escape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack woke up to a loud click and creak. It sounded like Erica was back to change into her clothes. Jack stumbled as the bag was taken out of the locker and placed on the nearby bench. When the bag opened, Jack noticed that Erica seemed to be upset and completely forgot about him. While she was taking off her bathing suit, Jack tried to capitalize on the opportunity to escape, but something caught his leg and he fell. Jack had been caught in a piece of Erica's clothing and was struggling to get out of it. Looking back out of the back, Erica still had not noticed nor remembered Jack and Jack saw her giant hand reaching into the bag to grab a piece of clothing. He tried to scramble his way away from the hand, but he couldn't move far as he was still stuck in whatever piece of clothing it was. Unfortunately, Erica had grabbed the article that Jack was trapped in and brought it out of the bag. Jack continued to try and struggle his way out of the piece of clothing, but to no avail. He was hopeless as Erica went to put on the article.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat piece of clothing is it, and does Erica notice Jack within?</span></div></div>",

She grabbed Jack and threw him in her backpack for a moment while she changed into her swimsuit. \"I hope you'll enjoy where you're going because I might just keep you there all practice\". Erica pulled back the back of her bikini bottom and dangled Jack over the opening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! You can't keep me in there when you go swimming, I'll drown!\" Jack exclaimed. Erica shook her head. \"We're not actually going in the pool today, we're just going over some basic techniques outside the pool. The swimsuits are just mandatory. But you know, I might prefer to have a swimsuit on right now\" Erica winked. Jack gulped. Before he could protest any more, Erica released her grip on Jack and he began sliding down her smooth back. Falling legs first, Jack picked up speed and in none too long, slips into the tight grip of the freshman's mountains. Erica giggled, then snapped her bikini bottom back into place, squeezed her cheeks to make sure Jack was secure between them, and left for her practice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Erica arrived at the pool. a couple of her friends were already there with the coach, waiting for a few more players to attend. Erica checked in with the coach, then went over to her friends Madison and Lily to show them what she had found. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison was a tall blonde who also played volleyball. Her blue eyes paired well with her hair, and she sported quite the fit body. Her butt was very round, but not too large. Of course, she received lots and lots of compliments from her friends and some unfiltered boys. Madison wasn't as well-defined in her chest, but she didn't mind. She was able to show off her ass, and that was enough for her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLily was on the opposite side of the height spectrum, when compared with Madison. She was short, but had all the components of a curvaceous body, having plenty to show off both in the front and the back. Swim was her primary sport, but Lily also liked to play basketball and tennis on occasion. Similar to both Madison and Erica, Lily was very cheeky and attached to something very easily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Erica walked to her friends, she intentionally swayed her hips more than normal and flexed her cheeks, just to try and get Jack to react. And react he did. The constant rubbing of Erica's cheeks started to secure him a place between Erica's cheeks, plastered face first on the inside of her right cheek. Jack squirmed and moved with all his might to make sure that that didn't happen, to relative success. He wasn't able to get completely free from the vice grip Erica kept on him, but Jack was able to make sure he didn't become a personal tattoo on the ass of this freshman. When Erica arrived to talk with her friends, Jack was relieved. Just for the moment, at least, Erica's cheeks had stopped thrashing him and he was able to relax for a few moments. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis time of relaxation didn't last long, though. Jack heard the elastic waistband of Erica's swimsuit pull back, and he felt the fingers of Erica pull him up and out of the tight prison. Jack thought that he was home-free, but he was wrong. The first thing he noticed when he got out was the two other freshman girls gawking at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi, ladies\" Jack awkwardly introduced. Jaws agape, Madison and Lily were awestruck that this little boy was alive and thriving. \"Whoa!\" they synchronized. Erica smirked, feeling proud for her discovery. \"Where did you find him, Erica?\" Lily asked. Erica fibbed, \"He was mooching around in the girls' locker room, probably looking for someone to peek in on\". The girls giggled. \"Well, little guy, did you get your wish?\". Jack rolled his eyes. \"No! That's not at all why I was in there. I had fallen into a purse, and the owner of the purse took me into the locker room, where she found me\" Jack told as he pointed to Erica. All three girls laughed. \"Likely story, little fella\" Madison smirked. \"My name isn't 'little fella', it's Jack!\" Jack yelled. The girls continued to laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright girls, time to get practice under way!\" the coach bellowed. Erica, Madison and Lily rolled their eyes. \"All right, back in you go, Jack\". Erica ordered. \"Hey, wait a sec. You've already had your shot, let one of us have a go at him\" Lily butt in. Erica argued, \"He's mine, though. I found him!\". Jack intervened. \"Hey! I am not some toy you can just auction around! I am a living, breathing human being with rights!\". All the girls looked at him. \"Well, squirt, you're not in the position to argue with us right now, you could get yourself killed if you go off on your own\" Erica rebutted. Jack sighed, she had a point. \"Just choose which one of us you want to go with, and that'll settle it\" Lily offered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that in mind, who does Jack choose to go with?</span></div></div>",

Jack had to remain diligent as to the movements of Trish and her friends to make sure he didn't wind up smashed under any of their shoes, which he did successfully. After he maneuvered past the four girls, Jack made it to the doorway and exited into the West hallway. Again, there weren't too many kids since it was after school hours, but there were still enough to where Jack could have some fun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n       Straight ahead from where Jack was is Bridgette, one of Jack's really close friends. She had medium long blonde hair, freckles, and blue eyes. Jack and her always paid each other compliments on days where the other looked really nice, but always gave each other crap on any other day, which they both thought funny. Jack thought that if she learned of his situation, she would either make fun out of it or become protective, and either way, he would be fine. Closer to the crossroads of the four main hallways was Mia, a flirtatious beauty who liked to tease Jack quite often, \"accidentally\" bumping her breasts into him, or somehow positioning her butt in close proximity of Jack's hands. Whenever this happened, Jack always got funny looks from passersby who thought he was being a perv, but Mia got a good kick out of it. Knowing this, Jack thought that Mia would take advantage of Jack's small stature to place him somewhere he didn't want to be. Hanging out with her was Nicole, another very flirtatious girl who was always in the mood to have \"fun\" with guys. Jack thought it would be worse to be found by her, because you never know how long she'll mess around with you, and with Jack being so small, that could have disastrous consequences for him. And at the west exit of the school was Brittany and Eiko, who were getting ready to head home. Jack was cool with Brittany, but Eiko, the well-endowed Japanese exchange student, had a massive crush on Jack. Ever since she came to Tahoma in the exchange and lived in the house across from Jack's, Eiko had always wanted to spend as much time as possible with him. Jack could not imagine what Eiko would do with him if she caught him at this size. She might try and hide him to keep or even take back to Japan with her. The best possible scenario for Jack if Eiko caught him, Jack thought, would be if Brittany intervened and allowed him to return to normal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith all these options, where does Jack decide to go?</span></div></div>",

Thinking that he could pull a hilarious prank, Jack decides to grab a hold of the fabric and begins the expedition upwards. With Bridgette leaning inside her locker, her posterior isn't moving much, making the climb a lot easier for Jack. In less than a few minutes, he reaches Bridgette's shoulder. Snickering, Jack creeps up to her ear intent on scaring the holy hell out of her.

Looking downwards, Jack was heading straight for the floor, but if he didn't do anything and follow that path, he was going to end up taking a permanent nap.

He wiggled around, making the most violent movements he could to make a disturbance, but to no avail. Bridgette made no signal that she was aware of something in her pocket. Jack began to climb back out of her pocket to figure out another way to get her attention, but Bridgette stood back up and Jack fell back to the bottom of the pocket. Hearing a slam and a click, Jack figured that Bridgette had got whatever she needed to get, and was on her way out of the school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shit,\" he thought, \"if I don't get her attention soon, she might accidentally kill me\". Jack once again tried to make his way out of the pocket, but once again failed. Bridgette's movements kept throwing him off balance. Jack had nothing to do except wait for an opportunity and seize it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a couple more minutes of Bridgette's swaying, her movements stopped and Jack could hear her voice. She must have gotten distracted by a friend. This was the time for him to make his move. Jack quickly ascended the pocket with no trouble and made it to waistline of Bridgette's loose jeans. Jack didn't know what to do from here, but he had to act fast because he had no idea how much longer Bridgette was going to stay stationary. Looking up, he noticed that Bridgette's long blonde hair reached down to about halfway on her back, so Jack thought that if he could climb up Bridgette's tank top, he would be able to grab on to her hair and make it up to get her attention. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack swiftly made his move, and made it to Bridgette's hair in no time flat. As he began to ascend her hair, though, Bridgette dismissed with her friend and began her walk again. Jack struggled to climb with the constant swaying of Bridgette's hair, nearly losing his grip a couple times, so he decided that he should just wait out her movements, then begin his climb again. Around five or so minutes later, Bridgette reached her car and got in. Once she sat down, Jack resumed his climb. Without any sudden movements or jolts from Bridgette, Jack was able to ascend her hair with no problem and was at her shoulder by the time Bridgette started the car. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeaving some, Jack made his way over to Bridgette's ear and yelled. Noticing the noise coming off of her left shoulder, Bridgette stopped her backing up and attended to the issue. She looked over and couldn't believe what she saw. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god!\" Bridgette yelled, \"are you a human? No, no way. People can't get that small, that's just a damn bug\". Before she had the opportunity to swipe the \"bug\" off her shoulder, the \"bug\" spoke to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! I am not a bug! It's me, Jack! I shrunk!\" Jack exclaimed. Bridgette's eyes widened. \"Jack? Oh my god, are you okay?\". Jack laughed some and responded \"Yeah, I'm fine. Just a little banged up, but otherwise okay\". Bridgette picked him up off of her shoulder and held him in front of her face. \"Is there anything I can do? How did you end up like this? This makes no sense!\" Bridgette was losing her mind. \"Calm down, calm down! Everything is good, not a problem to be had!\" Jack reassured. \"I just need your help getting me back to my place\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, sure, I can do that\" Bridgette said, relieved. \"Thanks, I owe ya one\" Jack replied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the ride was somewhat awkward, neither one of them knowing what to say to the other. Once Bridgette had arrived at Jack's house, she kept him on her shoulder and walked to the door. She knocked, but there was no response. After trying a couple more times, Bridgette looked to Jack. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where's your family?\" she asked. \"Oh!\" Jack realized. \"My mom had to work a little late tonight and Lucy's over at a friend's house while Izzy's having volleyball practice. I completely forgot about that. Guess I have the house all to myself then\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...\" Bridgette begins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does she say?</span></div></div>",

Bridgette placed Jack in her pocket and walked the short distance back to her house, with little action happening. Once they got inside the house, Bridgette noticed her mom and little sister in the living room watching tv. \"Hey, Bridge, how was school?\" her mom asked. \"It was pretty good, nothing special but still\". She went and joined the two on the coach, temporarily forgetting about Jack. \"What are you guys watching?\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know, some reality show, it's more of a hit or miss, really\" her sister, Abby, replied. Picking himself up and hopping jsut over the edge of Bridgette's pocket, Jack took a peek outside to see who Bridgette was talking to. He noticed Rebecca, Bridgette's mom, had a shapely figure which was especially prominent in the tank top and jeans she was wearing. Jack thought she might be about 45 or so now, but she certainly looked a little younger. His gaze shifted to Abby, Bridgette's little sister. She looked to be around twelve, like Lucy, and was still developing. Jack thought that she had an edge on Lucy in the body department, though, because there were signs of something there both in the front and back. Like her mother, Abby's features were accentuated by the clothing she wore: legging shorts and a tightly fit T-shirt. Realizing Bridgette still hadn't noticed him, Jack immediately snapped out of his observant mode and climbed out of her pocket to get her attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe tugged on the base of Bridgette's shirt, and she looked down. Gasping, Bridgette snatched Jack up in her hand and quickly went to the kitchen, catching the attention of both Abby and Rebecca. Bridgette dropped Jack on the kitchen counter, then slightly bent down to get a closer look. But before she could start talking to Jack, Abby and Rebecca entered the kitchen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everything okay?\" Rebecca asked. Abby nodded in agreement. Bridgette nervously responed, \"Yeah, yeah, just was a little thirsty\". Hoping her movement would take their attention away from the counter, Bridgette went over to the cabinet nearest to the fridge and grabbed a glass. Turning around, she noticed Abby lifting herself onto the counter to sit down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Jack froze as he looked up and saw the rounded butt of Abby descending his way. Unable to move an inch, Jack was placed firmly in the center of Abby's clothing and stuck there. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, wanna do something, Bridge?\" Abby obliviously asked. Bridgette gasped for a moment, then responded \"Sure, sure. How about we go outside or something?\". Abby smiled. \"Sure, sounds good!\". Abby quickly hopped off the counter then went upstairs to change. Bridgette was unable to do anything as her sister carried away her friend, who was plastered on her legging shorts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens from here?</span></div></div>",

I'll have to leave you here, be safe!\" Bridgette regrettably informed Jack. Jack replied \"All good, I understand. Thanks!\". With that brief back and forth, the two went their separate ways. The good thing was, now that Jack was alone, he could transform back to normal size, which he promptly did. Afterwards, he opened the case of his phone and took a key to his house out of it and unlocked the door. Jack went inside and collapsed on the couch. What a day. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh crap!\" he thought. \"I forgot my backpack!\". Jack leaned up to go call someone, but decided he could probably get it back in the lost and found tomorrow and laid back down. With nothing else to do and already so tired, Jack dozed off, only to wake about a half an hour later to the sound of the front door opening. Jack jolted awake and in walked Izzy and one of her volleyball friends, Jocelyn. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, loser, I'm back\" Izzy taunted. Jack chuckled and responded \"How did practice go, nerd\". Izzy shrugged. \"It went okay, nothing too bad but nothing excellent either\". Jack turned and saw Jocelyn. \"Hey, how's it going\" he greeted. The girl just gave him a nod and a shy wave in response. Izzy laughed. \"I see you two are already getting along swell, I may as well declare myself a third wheel immediately\". Jack rolled his eyes. Izzy and Jocelyn came over to the couch. Spontaneously, Izzy leapt onto Jack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Izzy, you idiot, get off me\" Jack demanded. Both Izzy and Jocelyn laughed. Once Izzy got off Jack, she invited Jocelyn over to join her on the couch. There was silence for a few moments until an ominous rumble broke the silence. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh oh, I might have to let loose you guys\" Izzy giggled. Jack made a break for the kitchen knowing what was about to happen, but Izzy caught his arm and wrestled him to the ground. Pinning Jack's arms under her legs, Izzy spun around and gave Jack a panoramic view of her spandex-clad butt. \"Izzy! Don't!\" Jack pleaded. Instead of stopping, Izzy lowered her butt closer to Jack's face. He managed to get one arm free and tried pushing her off, but instead, caused her to fall on his face. The moment her ass touched Jack's face, Izzy let one rip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"MMMPH!\" Jack screamed, but was muffled by Izzy's padding. The fart went on for a few seconds longer and when it was over, Izzy fell over in hysterics. Even Jocelyn, who was in the background, was laughing. Jack gasped for air and coughed. \"Izzy, dammit, you suck!\". Izzy rolled her eyes and giggled. \"Jocelyn, you want a turn? I'll hold him down for you\" Izzy offered. Jack immediately got up. \"Oh no, that's not happening. I'll just go to my room for now\" Jack intervened. The two girls remained in the living room and giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack in his room, Jack contemplated pulling a prank on Izzy. Now that he had this shrink ray, he could shrink down and startle her. Or he could wait until Lucy got home and get her involved. Or does he decide against it?</span></div></div>",

Thus, the best decision was to just make a second attempt at climbing her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaking sure to take extra precaution in his second attempt, Jack began his ascent of Bridgette. Grabbing tightly on the backo of her white tank top, Jack shifted from her jeans on to there. Although Bridgette was moving rather briskly, Jack had no problems climbing from there. Once he made it up to her shoulder, Jack tried getting Bridgette's attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bridgette! Hey, Bridgette! It's Jack! Look at your shoulder!\" Jack bellowed. It seemed to have no effect as Bridgette kept walking. Instead of yelling again, Jack then began climbing her neck to get closer to her ear, but along the way, Bridgette jolted and Jack was sent careening down her front. As he sprawled his body trying to grab onto any nook and cranny on her neck, Jack peered below to see what course he was heading on. But on his way down, Jack hit an inconsistency on Bridgette's shirt which caused him to sporatically change directions and start falling down Bridgette's side, toward the water bottle Bridgette was carrying. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking advantage of this new opportunity, Jack grabbed on to the lid of Bridgette's water bottle and once again held on like his life depended on it, because it probably did. None too later after Jack grabbed on to the lid did Bridgette nonchalantly bring the bottle up to her lips to take a sip. She grabbed Jack in the process of taking off the lid and was startled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the-- is that a person?\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack was ecstatic hearing those few words. \"Yes, Bridgette! It's me, Jack!\". Bridgette was flabbergasted. \"Jack?! How-- what happened?\". Jack chuckled, but ignored the question. \"I was hoping that you would give me a lift home, if it wasn't inconvenient for you?\". Bridgette sighed and agreed. \"Okay, let's go\". She placed Jack and the water bottle in her purse, then continued walking to her car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens on the ride to Jack's house?</span></div></div>",

What she saw wasn't a bug, but from what she could tell, was a really small person. Mia immediately picked it up to get a closer inspection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hii, Mia,\" Jack hesitantly greeted, \"how are you doing?\". A huge grin formed on Mia's visage. \"Well, if it isn't Jack? How are we doing itty bitty cutie?\". Jack chuckled dryly. \"I'm doing pretty well, just laying low if you get my drift\". Mia giggled. \"That is just adorable!\" she exclaimed. \"Would you be interested in tagging along with Nicole and I back to my place? We can have the night ALL to ourselves!\". At this point, Jack knew that he made a mistake coming over here. \"Nah, I'm pretty booked tonight, just coming over to check in and make sure you're doing well\" he once again chuckled dryly. \"Awww, come on,\" Mia pouted, \"there's got to be something I can do to get you to come. There is nothing I would enjoy more than to host someone as handsome or as delicate as you!\". Nicole giggled. \"She's right, Jack. We would have just the most splendid time. Just the three of us\" Nicole persuasively soothed. \"Don't fall for their trap,\" Jack thought, \"they'll have their way with you if you go for it\". After collecting himself, Jack replied \"No, really girls, I'm super busy. Maybe another time, though?\". The smiles disappeared off the faces of Nicole and Mia. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But we don't want another time. We want you tonight\" they cooed simultaneously. Jack had to admit, their wooing skills were on point, he was having a hard time saying no. \"P-please guys, I should be getting going. Would you mind setting me down, Mia?\". Mia frowned, \"Why should I? You were just getting ready to come with us?\". Jack had a double-take. Had he agreed to go with them? They did make it sound like a good time, maybe he should go. \"Bah! They're getting inside my head!\" Jack thought. \"S-seriously, Mia. I have to go, put me down\" Jack ordered. \"Are you suuuure you don't want to go?\" Nicole and Mia once again cooed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Now, this was getting difficult.

The girls smirked at each other and Mia looked back to Jack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then you wouldn't mind if I kept you here?\" she motioned to her boobs. Jack shook his head, and Mia brought him up to her face and kissed him. \"You made the right decision, Jack, we're going to have a wonderful time\". Once she finished, Mia lowered Jack into her breasts and patted him on the head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Feel okay, little guy? I hope I don't have to use my other carriage\" Mia sarcastically remarked, casually referencing her ass. Jack once again shook his head and said, \"I'm fine, Mia. I don't mind being where I'm at, I'm comfortable\". Mia giggled and Nicole snickered. \"That's good, that's good. You look tired, Jack, want to take a little nap?\" Mia soothed. With a yawn, Jack nodded his head. \"Okay, well maybe this will help you some then\" she said as she gently pushed Jack further into the depths of her cleavage. Soon enough, Jack's head was barely visible, but both Mia and Nicole could tell that he had passed out. Their plan had worked. They now have a new boy toy all to themselves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Jack finally came to, and felt pressures to both his left and right. With very little visibility, Jack had no idea where he was at. He tried to move both of his arms, but neither budged. He tried to move his lower body, but to the same result. Jack's mind started to race trying to figure out what had happened. Then it hit him. He had allowed Nicole and Mia's flirting to break through his barriers and corrupt him. He was still trapped within the seemingly endless cleavage of Mia, with no hopes of escaping. With nothing else to do, Jack began belittling himself for being so weak and allowing two of his school's most stereotypical hoes to take him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, above, Mia started to feel Jack squirm around. She giggled. He did this to himself, and now he could do no more. Jack had fallen into her trap, and for the moment being, he was hers. Not long after Jack started squirming, Mia and Nicole had arrived at Mia's house, to a lack of any parental figures. Mia's parents both had to work late, so Mia was in charge of running the house, <br>\r\nwhich was a golden opportunity for her and Nicole to attract persons for their \"fun and games\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst and possibly only contestant: a miniature sized Jack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat do the two ladies begin with?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Without a moment's hestiation, Mia quicky swung Jack around and dropped him in the back of her panties. \"Oh, nothing! Nicole and I were just talking about what we were going to do for our partner project today\" Mia lied. The girls continued to talk as Jack tried to escape from his warm and fleshy prison. He squirmed as best as he could, but that only led to him falling further down Mia's crack. The further he went, the hotter and sweatier it became. Jack tried to protest and yell, but all that came of that was mouthfuls of Mia's excess booty sweat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling Jack's prevalent squirming, Mia pretended like she had a wedgie. \"Ugh, these shorts can be so uncomfortable sometimes\" she proclaimed. With that, Mia's shorts temporarily opened, bringing in some light in the dark abyss Jack was trapped in. Unfortunately for Jack, it didn't last long as Mia's finger came down there and pushed him further into her crack, making sure he was silenced and nice and secure. She pushed him far enough in to where he wasn't going to fall out, but wasn't making enough of a sensation to cause her to react. Once that was settled, Mia went back to talking with Bridgette and Nicole. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was hell for Jack. Now that Mia pushed him further into her ass, the smell intensified, as did the heat. Each breath he took, Jack cringed at the foul odor resonating from Mia. Sweat toppled onto him and he couldn't budge. Although the pressure between the two monumental cheeks was pretty great, the softness of them quelled Jack, to an extent. And by the time Mia and Nicole had finished chatting with Bridgette, Jack had been left unconscious from the combination of the smell, heat, pressure and softness of Mia's ass. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Jack came to, he realized he wasn't inside of Mia's shorts any longer, but rather sitting on a soft mattress. Looking around, Jack observed that he was in a brownish tinted room. Within a few more moments, Mia and Nicole entered, both wearing a shirt to big for them and nothing other than panties below that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Mia and Nicole get back to the bed, what does Jack do?</span></div></div>",

Feeling pretty confident, Jack rolled over to the two girls who were emptying parts of their backpack into their locker for the day. Eiko was crouching, probably putting something smaller away in the lower portion of her locker. Brittany, on the other hand, was standing tall, reaching to place some of her books on the top shelf of her locker. Out of the two, it would obviously be easier for Jack to get Eiko's attention, but that was something Jack was definitely not interested in. Instead, he went over to Brittany's outstretched ankle, and began tapping. Brittany didn't notice Jack's feeble attempts, but Eiko did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Noticing a bug messing around with Brittany, Eiko decided to make some fun. Without disturbing the bug's attention, Eiko swiped it up in her hand. Just as quickly as she had picked it up, she pulled back the waistband on the leggings Brittany was wearing and tossed the bug in. Brittany jumped. \"Eiko! What are you doing?!\" she yelled. Eiko was giggling. \"Just having fun. It funny!\" Eiko joyously shared. Brittany was annoyed. \"Honestly, sometimes you are just too much, Eiko. You need to have some restraint sometimes\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Jack had been whip lashed by the sudden instances and had no idea where he was at. It was dark and humid, but very very tight. Jack struggled to move any ligament or appendage, even his fingers. Little did he know, but he was hugging the tight left cheek of Brittany. As Jack continued to try and squirm, sweat moving from Brittany's crack slid down and soaked him. \"God, that's disgusting, what the hell is that?\".  The more Jack kept moving, though, the more sweat compiled onto him. He had no idea what to do. Without being able to move even an inch, Jack could do nothing more than to sit and wait for something to happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a little while, Brittany started to feel a sensation coming from her back side. Whatever Eiko did was finally starting to have an effect on her. She reached back and into her leggings to find out what Eiko put in there. When she felt movement, Brittany knew that whatever Eiko put in there was alive. She grabbed it using her pointer finger and thumb and pulled it out. When she turned it around to her face, Brittany found a gasping and soaked Jack. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jack?! Is that you?\" Brittany exasperated. When Eiko heard Jack, she lit up and turned towards Brittany. Jack, however, was not so lit up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, it's me all right. I was going to come over and see what was happening, but Eiko thought it was funny to throw me in your leggings and watch you squirm. Little did she know, but I was the one squirming,\" Jack chuckled,\"squirming to get out\". Brittany was extremely embarrassed and was apologizing profusely to Jack. She then turned to Eiko and scolded her. \"You see what you have done, Eiko? That little bug was no bug at all and you did some serious harm! Next time, be more careful!\". \"Next time?\" Jack thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, I hope you forgive Eiko, Jack\" Eiko apologized. Jack sighed but he was a very forgiving person. \"It's okay, Eiko, you didn't know that it was me. The real person you should be apologizing to is Brittany. You probably made her very uncomfortable\". Brittany blushed. Secretly, she actually kind of liked it. \"Sorry, Brittany. It mistake\". Brittany just shook it off. \"It's okay, Eiko. Just make sure you aren't so spontaneous anymore\" she chuckled. \"But now, what are we going to do with you, Jack?\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat do they decide on?</span></div></div>",

She didn't have a crush on Jack per se; I mean she always thought he was cute and charming, if a bit dorky. But he'd been her neighbor for as long as she could remember! As little kids they'd been close friends, hanging out all the time, until of course girls being friends with boys was so not cool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut seeing Jack in his shrunken form it just....it excited Brittany. She couldn't quite explain it, but she just wanted to take care of him, hold him close, squeeze him, do things to him...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I agree! Jack needs protection!!!\" Eiko practically shouted, causing her bountiful bosom to bounce up and down.  \" I can take him!!\" Eiko said with a ravenous stare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!!!!\" both Jack and Brittany exclaimed at once. Eiko looked a little stunned, but Jack quickly added \" I just think Brittany is a better choice since she you know... She lives here, knows how to get home....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I mean you know how many times you've gotten lost in the way home!\" Brittany quickly added. ,\"Plus, isn't your next period History with Miss Green? Didn't she say if you missed one more class she'd flunk you no matter what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEiko visably deflated \"no fair!\" Eiko began to long but then her face lit up \"Brittany, you're right. Take Jack back to your house!!! I'll meet you there after class!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, I thought you meant my hom...\" Jack started to say. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How can I take him home? I don't have any pockets!!\" Brittany said, not even hearing Jack's protests.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEiko gave a devilish grin. \"I know!\" And before Jack knew what was happening, Eiko grabbed Jack in her hand, spun Brittany around, pulled back her waistband and panties and dropped Jack straight into Brittany's butt crack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"EIKO!!! What are you doing?????\" Brittany shouted at her friend while blushing and looking around to see if anyone noticed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's the best place!! Soft, squishy, safe! Plus Jack can't mind, what teenage boy doesn't love a girl's butt!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack in the he other hand was in a literal state of shock. One minute he was listening to his friends discuss how best to protect him and then suddenly he was manhandled and dropped in the back of his neighbors panties! Not only that, but somehow Jack had lande front and center with Brittany's asshole. The brown wrinkly ring was enormous. A strange warmth flkwed off the the assholes many times and a bizarre smell that was both intoxicating and disgusting filled the air. Jack was dumfounded and dwarfed by the sheer magnificence of the butthole of his cute Asian neighbor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Jack could even react to his bizarre new surroundings, everything began to move...</span></div></div>",

Eiko nodded, but Jack was not so sure. Her infatuation with him might cloud her judgement and cause some trouble for Jack. \"You know, I bet I can get back home on my own, I got some stuff to do along the way anyways\" he lied. The girls looked worried. \"Are you sure? We live right next to each other, it would be a lot safer at your size if you came with us\" Brittany explained. Jack nodded. \"I'm positive. Although I am a little tired from the day's work. Ah, it's not big deal\". Eiko butt in. \"No, you come with us. I take care of you real well. Can't have you squashed like bug or taken\". Jack tried to intervene, but Eiko had already picked him up. \"See? Everything good now. I keep you here until we get home\" Eiko giggled as she unbuttoned her shirt. Jack tried resisting the loosening of Eiko's grip, but it was no use. As he fell towards the vast expanse of Eiko's pale, soft cleavage, the shrink ray fell out of Jack's pocket and in no longer than a minute, disappeared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEiko took one final look at Jack as he was now nestled hopelessly between her enormous mounds. She slightly pressed down on Jack's head, pushing him slightly further in between her breasts to keep him nice and snug, with no chance of falling out. Giggling, Eiko buttoned her shirt back up and began walking home with Brittany. Meanwhile, Jack was too busy panicking and thinking about his shrink ray to notice his predicament worsening. Once Eiko's shirt was buttoned up and the light slightly dimmed, Jack returned to reality, forgetting about the shrink ray. Jack tried to move to get out of his fleshy confinement, but he didn't budge. Panicking a little, he continued to wriggle and squirm but to no cigar. With nothing else to do but worry about Eiko's motives, Jack slightly relaxed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNoticing Jack's movements, Eiko giggled. Now that he was so small and at her mercy, maybe she could finally spend as much time as she wanted with him. Eiko cooed at the thought as she walked down the sidewalk with Brittany and decided to get a head start on her plans with Jack. Placing a hand on each breast, Eiko slowly and gently pressed the two together, trying to get a reaction out of Jack. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling pressure from both breasts leaning in on him, Jack cried out trying to get Eiko to stop. Jack had to admit, it felt pretty good because of the softness of Eiko's skin, but it was the shrink ray he was worried about. If Eiko pressed hard enough, she could damage or break the shrink ray wherever it was at. Hearing Jack's cries, Eiko eased up. But no more than a few minutes later and she was back to pushing her boobs together. Jack once again protested, but this time, Eiko held it a little longer. She loved the physical sensation Jack gave her in addition to the control she accrued. Fortunately, it was over soon after that as Brittany and Eiko had finished their walk to their house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrittany and Eiko stopped in front of their own driveway and checked on Jack before taking him across the street to his house. Unbuttoning her shirt, Eiko grinned at the sight of the tiny Jack squirming around between her breasts. Brittany quickly came to Jack's rescue, though, and took him out. \"Were you okay in there?\" Brittany asked. Jack replied, \"Yeah, but I think my phone fell out of my pocket while I was in there\". Eiko and Brittany looked at each other. Jack gulped. \"I hate to ask this, but E-Eiko, do you think I could go back and try to find it?\". Brittany quickly interjected: \"No, that's okay, I can check\". But Eiko stopped her. \"No, it ok, Brittany. Jack small, he could see it better\". Although Eiko knew that Brittany could probably find it, she liked having Jack in there. Eiko once again unbuttoned her shirt and Brittany hesitantly handed Jack back to Eiko. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTossing Jack back into her shirt, Eiko giggled. Jack looked back for a moment, then regrettably asked for a push. Without hesitation, Eiko offered her assistance. \"Okay, Eiko, thanks, that's good. You can stop now you're pushing me too far in--\" suddenly Jack was cut off as Eiko pushed him in much deeper than before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens to Jack?</span></div></div>",

He put the shrink ray in his pocket and began his ascent out. The hills of Eiko's were smooth and very difficult to traverse, often sending Jack right where he was before. \"Eiko!\" he called out, \"pull me out of here!\". For a few moments, Jack thought she hadn't heard him. That was, until a giant hand came in and took him out of the milky environment he was in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jack! Everything okay?\" Eiko worriedly asked. Jack nodded. \"Yeah, everything's fine. I found the r- my phone and it's still functioning. Could you take me back to my house now?\". Eiko looked at Brittany who gave her a slight, if disappointed, nod and looked back to Jack. \"Why? Don't want stay with Eiko and Brittany?\" Eiko asked, puzzled. \"No! No, that's not the case. I just have a lot of homework to do and my mom would probably worry about it\" Jack replied. \"But you so small? How you do homework?\". Jack thought Eiko was asking too many questions. \"It doesn't matter. I'll get around to it. Anyways, can I please go home?\". Brittany gave Eiko a nudge, telling her to listen to Jack. Eiko sighed and agreed to take him home. She placed Jack back in her plump cleavage and walked over to his house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce there, Eiko took Jack back out, of which Jack thought was a much more pleasurable ride, and placed him on the doormat. \"Take care, Jack. If you want, I can give you ride in halls at school since you so tiny\" Eiko giggled. \"Thanks for the offer, Eiko, but I should be okay. Thanks for the ride home\". Eiko nodded, recognizing his appreciation, then left for her house. Jack waited a few moments to make sure Eiko was out of sight, then brought out his shrink ray to return to normal size outside the house. He pressed the button, and in a few moments, grew larger. However, there was a complication. Instead of returning to his normal height, Jack was now only about three feet tall. He can hear movement and vocies in the house, his family is surely home. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut should Jack go inside at this size or should he figure out what's going on outside and try to return to full size?</span></div></div>",

The two massive breasts she sported toyed with him, sometimes keeping him firm in place and other times tossing him all over. Now, though, Jack was far enough down that he had some leeway in moving around and searching for the shrink ray. Since he had much better mobility, it didn't take long for Jack to find the shrink ray, but to his horror, it was in pieces. He assumed that when Eiko was messing around with Jack, she accidentally broke it. Terrified at the fact that he was stuck at this size for good until he got another ray, Jack began to slowly make his ascent through Eiko's milky rack. Once he surfaced, Brittany knew something was wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jack! Are you okay? Did you find your phone?\". Jack glanced at Eiko then over to Brittany. \"Could I speak to you for a moment, Brittany?\". She nodded and motioned for Eiko to hand Jack over. Once away from Eiko, Jack told Brittany about what had actually happened, and what the device actually was. \"Oh my gosh, so you're stuck like this now?\" Brittany gasped. Jack nodded. \"And now I don't know what to tell my mom because I was only supposed to have this for a school project\". Brittany thought for a moment, then offered to take care of him in the meantime and make up a scenario to his mom to explain his absence from her household. Jack hesitated at the thought, but ultimately conceded. Keeping Jack in her palm, Brittany walked over to Eiko and explained the situation, to which she responded with glee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eiko, listen, we have to take care of Jack right now, no messing around, okay?\" Brittany directed. \"Yes, understand\" Eiko giggled. Brittany glanced down at Jack, then back up to Eiko. \"All right, we should get inside\" she declared. With that, Brittany closed her hand and led Eiko inside the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the next few days, Brittany kept Jack hidden in her room, caring for him whenever necessary and hiding him from Eiko and the rest of her family. But Eiko began to grow more and more anxious about seeing Jack because her departure back to Japan was within the next few days. Does Brittany allow Eiko to have some fun with Jack or is she protective?</span></div></div>",

If you accidentally misplaced him and he got lost, who knows what would happen\" Brittany firmly reiterated. \"But I can keep Jack safe, I careful\" Eiko argued. Brittany shook her head. \"Eiko, please listen to me. I know you want to see him before you leave to go home, but we have to take every precaution in making sure Jack's safe. At his size, pretty much anything can hurt him\". Eiko huffed and walked back to her room. There, she contemplated sneaking into Brittany's room while she was somewhere else and taking Jack for herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Jack was laying down on the piece of cloth Brittany gave him for a bed. He didn't really have anything to do in the drawer she placed him in. Although he was bored as can be, Jack understood the reasoning and went along with it. Jack overheard Brittany and Eiko talking and chuckled. Jack thought Eiko was a really nice girl and he had nothing against her, but she was a little bit obsessive over him. Jack shuddered as he thought of what might happen if Eiko got her hands on him for even one night. He laughed. That wouldn't happen, Jack knew Brittany was protective enough. Or so he thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater that night, the girls were called to dinner. Making their way downstairs, Eiko paused for a second and told Brittany she needed to use the bathroom. Brittany nodded then went ahead to the dinner table. Wasting no time, Eiko went to Brittany's room and began frantically searching for Jack. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin the confines of the drawer he was in, Jack could hear the shuffling of items. Perhaps Brittany had left something up here and came back to retrieve it. But as the sounds shifted closer and closer to his area, Jack froze. Brittany wasn't so disorganized, she knew where everything was at all times. This must be Eiko. Pushing the drawer slightly open, Jack cliimbed up and took a peek outside and to his dismay, there was Eiko looking around for something. Instead of falling back within the drawer, Jack remained peeking outwards, which turned out to be a horrible mistake. Peering around the room, Eiko noticed something protruding out of the drawer of Brittany's shelf. Catching Eiko's attention, Jack immediately fell back within the drawer and did what he could to pull it shut, but it didn't matter. The drawer pulled wide open and there was the joyous visage of Eiko.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jack! Come, we spend time together\" Eiko excitedly said. Out of her excitement, she didn't wait for Jack to reply as she scooped him up out of the drawer and dropped him back in her bosom. She pushed Jack down far enough in between her pale mounds where he wasn't visible yet was tightly bound. Eiko buttoned her shirt back up, made sure everything eas neat and tidy, then went down to dinner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow does the rest of the night go? Does Brittany learn that Eiko has Jack or does Eiko sneak away with a new boyfriend?</span></div></div>",

Eiko's bosom was too tough of a match for Jack and his small stature. With each step Eiko took, her breasts swayed, bouncing into Jack and pushing him into each breast. After a few more moments of this, her breasts came to a stop as she sat down at the dinner table, bringing Jack to a standstill. As conversation began and dinner was served, Jack went back to finding a way to escape. He wriggled and squirmed, doing whatever he could possibly do, but at best only moved a millimeter or so. Jack's movements were pleasing Eiko. She silently giggled and subtly tossed her breasts in response to Jack's movements. Although not noticeable to the members at the table, this shook Jack's world and tossed him face first into Eiko's left breast. Now knowing that his movements registered as no more than a small satisfaction to Eiko and understanding that he really couldn't escape. Jack fell limp and waited for the dinner to end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter about a half an hour or so, the members at the table began to dismiss. For a moment, Jack cheered up, but remembered that he couldn't go anywhere. He once again began swaying to and fro against Eiko's boobs as she put her dishes away and retreated to her room, with Eiko smiling and giggling all the while. Once there, Eiko shut her door and unbuttoned her shirt to take Jack out. As she was unbuttoning her shirt, Jack saw an opportunity to escape and used all of his energy to make a beeline out of there, but only got a few inches before Eiko grabbed hold of him. She grinned and was about to speak, but then her bedroom door opened and in walked Brittany. With haste, Eiko shoved Jack down the back of her pants to hide him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Eiko. Have you seen Jack around? I'm afraid he escaped and is lost somewhere around the house\" Brittany stated. Eiko shook her head. \"No, I not seen Jack. Maybe he in your room, under bed or something?\". Brittany shook her head, disappointed. \"No, I checked. He isn't anywhere in my room. Maybe he came in here for some reason. Do you mind if I look?\" she asked. Hesitantly, Eiko agreed. Pretending like she didn't know where Jack was at, Eiko \"helped\" Brittany look. When she bent over to look under her bed, Jack was thrown into the depths of her crack, caught snug in between her warm and milky cheeks which caused Eiko to coo. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You okay, Eiko?\" Brittany questioned. Blushing, Eiko nodded and Brittany shrugged then got back to looking. The two continued searching throughout the room for another ten minutes or so before Brittany gave up and left. Barely after Brittany had left the room, Eiko pulled back her pants and reached in to get Jack. When he was brought out, Jack was sweaty and wide-eyed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eiko! What the hell, you could've gotten me help! And why in the world would you put me down there?!\" Jack exclaimed. Eiko chuckled. \"I love Jack. You make me happy and feel good. I hope you never big again\". Jack was exasperated. He didn't know what to do, though, he was at the mercy of a giant who was enamored with him. Before he did anything, Eiko yawned. \"Okay, Jack. Tomorrow big day. I leave to home at night. You coming\" she demanded. Jack rapidly shook his head. \"No, Eiko! I'm not some toy or some pet you can take wherever you want! As much as I like you, you're stepping over the line!\" Jack yelled. Eiko rolled her eyes. \"You go to sleep now. Goodnight\". She then covered his mouth as she opened her underwear drawer and slipped him inside. Eiko left the drawer slightly open to give Jack some air, but not open enough to let him escape. With no further resistance from Jack, Eiko slipped into bed and fell asleep.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Adjusting to the light, Jack unsurprisingly discovered that it was Eiko who was peering in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning, Jack. Ready for trip today?\" Eiko joyously asked. Jack shook his head. \"Eiko, please. I need to go home, this isn't okay\". Eiko laughed and replied \"It okay, I take good care of you and you be my tiny boyfriend\". She then picked up the pair of panties that Jack was laying on. \"I make sure you come with me, you ride back here\" Eiko said as she pointed to her massive behind. \"Eiko, no! I could be seriously harmed back there!\" Jack expressed. Eiko grinned. \"It okay, my butt not bad. Plus, we keep you out of sight of Brittany, so this perfect\". She then pulled down her pajamas and underwear. Jack took this small window of an opportunity to jump out of Eiko's panties and slide down her nightstand, determined on booking under her door. He had got a good portion of the way down the nightstand before Eiko noticed and intercepted him. \"No! Jack, don't do that. You coming with me!\" Eiko ordered. Swiping Jack off of the side of the nightstand, Eiko cupped him in her hand while she threw her legs through her panties, pulling them up to her knees, then talking to Jack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, time for you enter\" Eiko directed. She dropped Jack and he fell a ways, landing in the center of Eiko's panties. Jack tried to escape, but as Eiko pulled them up, the contours proved too difficult to traverse. He looked up right before making contact, with nothing but Eiko's derriere in sight. Then, it engulfed him. Eiko pulled her underwear nice and tight, securing Jack deep in her crack. Knowing she finally had complete control of Jack, she giggled. With nothing else to impede on her preperations, Eiko then finshed packing and cleaning up her room, then left to leave to the airport.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Jack didn't know what to do anymore. Without any daylight, he had no idea where to go and what movements might benefit him and what ones might screw him. Fortunately, the smell coming from this soft, cushy prison wasn't. As a matter of fact, it seemed pleasant. Additionally, the warmth eminating from within comforted Jack, as did the rhythmic motion of Eiko's cheeks swaying and rubbing together. Jack relaxed. All these factors began to lull him to sleep. And in no more than five minutes, Jack was out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack woke up slowly. There was a loud ringing in his ear. Looking around, he had no idea where he was at. Until he saw the familiar visage of Eiko's, which was smiling with glee. After staying confined in her undercarriage so long, Jack didn't have much energy to move, so he decided to talk to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eiko, where are we?\" Jack asked. \"We on plane. We on way to Japan where you be with me\" she explained. Jack then realized that this ringing was the sound of the plane engines. Jack, although with weak mobility, began to panick and tried to jump off Eiko's hand onto the seat next to her, but she just caught him with her other hand and laughed. \"Jack funny. You can't go anywhere\" she said and pulled Jack in for a wet kiss. Jack continued to panic, so Eiko decided that it was time he relaxed. \"Jack fussy. You stay here\". Eiko opened the front of her shirt and for the millionth time, dropped Jack. She pulled apart her breasts, causing Jack to slide down between them. Once he reached a certain point, Eiko let her boobs go and they smacked into him, holding him tight. Out of desperation, Jack took one final heave upwards, but it was too late. Eiko snapped her shirt back and the light dimmed. Jack finally gave up and accepted his situation. Sliding further down in Eiko's cleavage, Jack settled in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring the flight, Eiko would occasionally jostle her boobs to play with Jack. It would startle him, but there was nothing he could do about it. After the plane landed, Eiko took Jack out for a moment and kissed him. There was nothing stopping her from her little boyfriend now. After a few moments of giving him fresh daylight, Eiko opened the back of her pants to once again change Jack's setting. Jack, exhausted, did nothing more than relax and get tossed about by Eiko's mammoth ass. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the rest of his life, Jack was to serve as Eiko's miniature boyfriend/pet and never left her side again... </span></div></div>",

Now that he was all alone again, Jack needed to come up with what to do next. It was getting pretty late in the afternoon, around 4:00 and the school would be shutting its doors pretty soon. With the halls empty, Jack could grow back to normal and get out with no problem. Before turning the machine back on, Jack took a peek around to make sure no one was around and then switched it on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn just a few moments, Jack was back to normal and on his way out the door and on his way home. Since he stayed so late in the afternoon, his mom could have come and picked him up, but Jack decided that he wanted to walk back and see if there were any instances where he could shrink down and explore. Unfortunately, there weren't any opportunities on the route that he took, so the venture home was rather uneventful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce he got home and slipped his shoes off, Izzy came up to him. \"Hey, Jack! Now that you're back from school, wanna do somethin?\" she excitedly asked. Jack shrugged. \"I don't know, Izzy, I'm pretty tired. Maybe tomorrow\" Jack responded. Izzy slumped and as she did, she noticed something poking out of Jack's pocket. \"What's that?\". Jack looked down and noticed the shrink ray was coming out of his pocket. Quickly shoving it back in, Jack replied \"Nothing, just a science project\". \"What kind of science project?\" Izzy continued to question, \"could we test it out?\". \"Absolutely not, it's not a toy\" Jack shook his head. Seemingly defeated, Izzy walked away but paused and turned back around. \"Tell you what, Jackaroo. After dinner, you and I go play that racing game and if you win, we let the science project go, but if I win, you tell me what it is and we play with it. Sound fair?\". Jack was concerned. One of the last people Jack would want knowing about the shrink ray was Izzy, but she sucked at the racing game. Plus, if he won like he always did, Izzy would leave him alone. \"All right, you got a deal\" Jack said. With a little fist pump, Izzy went to the kitchen to get ready for their evening meal and Jack soon followed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the meal, how did the rest of the night ensue?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Great timing, Jack and I had a little bet about his sciene project. We're going to race and if he wins, we forget about it, but if I win, we'll get to learn what it is and toy with it\" Izzy explained. \"Awesome! \" Lucy giddly exclaimed. She sat down behind Jack, then the two initaited their race. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the majority of the race, Jack was in control. Nearly lapping Izzy on the third of five laps, he had no doubt in his mind that he was going to win. That was, until Lucy let out a little gas and threw him off his game. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! Lucy, that's horrid!\" Jack yelled, covering his nose and letting a hand off his controller. Izzy, who was far enough away from the gas attack, laughed and continued to race, making up substantial ground. After the distraction, Izzy was ahead of Jack on the last lap of the race. Jack was beginning to get nervous. He tried anything that he could do to slow down Izzy, but it seemed that little to no tactics could get the job done. By the end of the race, Izzy was well ahead of Jack and it was clear that she had won. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YES!\" Izzy excitedly yelled. Jack threw his head in his hands and sighed. Lucy, who had played a large role in Izzy's victory, was also gratified and smiling. \"Okie dokie, Jackaroo, go get it. A bet is a bet\" Izzy laughed. Reluctantly, Jack got up and went to retrieve his machine. A few moments later, he returned to the girls' delight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay guys, here it is. My science project. The shrink ray. In all actuality, I got it off the internet but it still counted as a good grade\" Jack said. The girls were ecstatic. \"Wow.... I can't believe it. What are we going to test it out on first?\" Lucy put in. Izzy grinned. \"Don't you know? Jack volunteered himself as the test subject\". Jack shook his head. \"Absolutely not, this is not a toy, that would not be okay\". The girls rolled their eyes. \"Quit being such a baby,\" Izzy mocked, \"gimme that thing\". She grabbed the shrink ray and pointed it at Jack. \"Whoa!\" he exclaimed, \"be carefult, Izzy. You don't know how to use th--\". In a flash, Jack was brought down to just a mere three inches. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It works!\" Izzy giggled. Lucy smiled. Her and Izzy thought the same thing: \"This is going to be fun\". Without hesitating, Izzy scooped up Jack and brought him to her and Lucy's gleaming visages. \"So, 'little' bro, what shall we do first with you so tiny?\" Izzy inquired. \"Possibly getting me back to normal!\" Jack screamed. The girls laughed. \"No, Jack\" put in Lucy, \"a deal's a deal, you have to play with us\". Jack gulped and conceded. \"FIne, what do you guys have in mind?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow do they respond?</span></div></div>",

Both now sporting sly grins, they came back to Jack and Lucy explained. \"We're going to play hide and seek with a catch. You have to hide and we'll come find you. If you stay hidden for longer than ten minutes, you win. If we find you before then, though, we get to have some fun with you, sound good?\". Jack shook his head. \"I don't know about that Lucy, that makes me a little nervous\". Izzy shrugged. \"We don't HAVE to do that. I mean, we could just have our fun with you right now, I mean look at you. Are you really in a position to bicker with us?\". She made a good point. Now that Jack was just a few inches tall and Izzy had the shrink ray, he was at their mercy. With no other choice, Jack obliged. \"Now, you can't leave the living room, that would make it too hard for us\" Izzy said. Jack nodded in understanding, then the girls went to the stairs to count to thirty. Jack looked around and had a few options to choose from. Out of the bunch, he thought that hiding in between the couch cushions would be the best bet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack made it up the couch as quickly as he could and right as the girls finished counting and peered into the living room, he dipped in between the cushons. Giggling, the girls said in unison: \"Come out, Jackaroo, or we'll come and get you\". Jack rolled his eyes. How clever. \"If you come out now and give yourself up, we'll take it easy on you\" Izzy cooed. \"But if you want to be difficult, you better hope you have a great spot\" Lucy added. The girls methodically made their way through the living room, looking under furniture, within cabinets and under the couch. Remaining at the couch for awhile, Jack thought about revealing himself. If he did, they would get to play with him, but as long as they were telling the truth, it wouldn't be as bad. However, Jack thinks he has a solid spot and can make it the full ten minutes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does he decide to do?</span></div></div>",

This gave Jack time to travel there and return the favor for all the pranks and junk that those two pulled on him. Before he left the high school, Jack switched off the shrink ray so he was able to travel to the middle school quicker, then grabbed his things from the classroom he was in and left for the middle school. The distance between the two schools wasn't far at all, maybe five to ten minutes walk, maximum. This came in handy for Jack today. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n    When he arrived at the school, Jack asked around the office to see if the staff knew where his siblings were at. Jack identified himself as their older brother and that he was there to pick them up and take them home.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>    Since Izzy was getting ready to go the gym, Jack figured that it a lot could go wrong for him if he went to prank her. So, he decided to go prank the youngest of his two siblings, Lucy. Portable two was located outside the school, not too far from the front office which left Jack with a nice and short walk there. Prior to entering the room, though, Jack brought out the shrink ray and turned it on, returning to a few inches tall. He then sneaked his way under the door and began his search for his sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack spotted her in the back left corner of the room, sitting next to who he presumed were a couple of her friends. Jack recognized Madison, who was the other black haired girl, but her body was slightly more matured than the rest of the girls even though they were all twelve. The advising teacher, Ms. Turner, was at the opposite end of the room, much nearer to where Jack was. Jack hadn't come up with how exactly he was going to prank his sister, but he couldn't pass up an opportunity to at a time like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack made his way over to his sister's area of the classroom and climbed the back of one of Lucy's friend's chairs. When he made it to the top, Jack looked down and noticed that whoever this was did not have her jeans pulled up very high because even from here, Jack had a large look at her crack. There weren't any arms on this chair, so Jack had to take a leap of faith and hope that he made it to the young girl's shirt. If he failed to accomplish this, Jack already knew where he would end up based on the sheer size of gap which showed the girl's white fleshy hills. Fortunately, there was enough space for a good running jump since Jack was small enough. After taking a few deep breaths, Jack went for it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe feeling he got once he completed this stunt was nothing short of amazing. Jack thought that there was no way in hell he would make it with his luck, but he managed to make enough momentum to get to the girl's shirt. However, a new challenge presented itself, and that was climbing to the shoulder of this girl and descending down her front without being noticed by her or any of the other girls, especially Lucy. Jack made it up to the girl's shoulder with no issues whatsoever, but now the real difficulties began. As he made it over to the front of the girl's right shoulder, he realized that none of the girls were actually focused on test taking, but rather idle conversation. This made getting caught a much likelier scenario, which would completely spoil the plan. On top of that, this girl was wearing a push-up bra which significantly increased the size and narrowness of her breasts. This meant that if Jack slipped on his descent of the girl, he wouldn't make it back out without assistance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Jack started his descent of the massive preteen, she jolted. Apparently having felt his movements on the tip of her shoulder, the girl shivered, causing Jack to stumble. He managed to recover easily, but it was still a scary experience. The rest of the way down was a breeze, and now Jack was on the table of the four girls: Lucy, Madison, the girl who Jack had just descended, and one other who was the talkiest of the bunch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKnowing that his sister was skiddish around bugs, Jack had an idea. He thought that if he could get her to feel him somewhere on her body, whether it be arm, face, leg, etc., Lucy would give off a huge reaction. But, luck soon ran out for Jack as Lucy had spotted something crawling in front of Jacqueline, the most physically gifted girl of the bunch. Even though she was a little irritable around bugs, Lucy had never seen one like this before and wanted to get it up close to inspect. Upon closer inspection, though, she saw something which very closely resembled her brother, Jack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way,\" Lucy gasped, \"Jack, is that you?\". Jack turned his head towards his enormous sister and smiled awkwardly. \"Hii, Lucy\" stuttered. Lucy gawked at her tiny older brother, but snapped out of it quickly. \"What happened? How did it happen? How are you here?\". Jack wasn't interested in answering any of those questions. \"I'm just here for a little bit of fun, I guess\" he chuckled. Just then, Lucy grew a sly smile as she thought of something to make things more interesting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does she think of?</span></div></div>",

Jack was starting to get more and more nervous. \"Come on, stop being silly. Just let me chill here and we should be all good\". Shaking her head, Lucy replied \"No, we have to have something for you to do! There isn't any reason why little you should just be sitting there when there are so many things that you could be doing\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, in an instant, Lucy picked Jack up and brought him to her face. \"You know, Jack, you've always been a fun brother, why stop now?\". \"What are you talking about, my idea is fun. Let's just try it out and you'll see for yourself\" Jack offered. \"No,\" Lucy rejected, \"it just isn't the same if you aren't doing anything. Tell you what, since you're being extra difficult right now, I'll keep you in a very special spot, just to make sure you don't have any funny ideas and to make yourself useful\". She then pulled open the front of her leggings and dangled Jack over the opening. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lucy, are you out of your mind?!\" he screamed. Lucy chuckled and reassured him \"Don't worry, I'll keep you outside of it. That way, we can still have some fun while not going too far\". Jack was indignant. \"Lucy! This is disgusting! Stop!\". She heard his cries, but chose to ignore them and instead released her grip on Jack, sending him within her leggings, landing on her springy black panties. Lucy giggled with pleasure. \"I'm having fun already, Jack. Aren't you?\". Jack was unable to answer, though, as Lucy let go of her leggings and they pressed Jack into the fabric of Lucy's panties. He was unable to even budge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBehind him, Jack felt the emanating warmth of his younger sister's womanhood and the softness of her lips. Even though Jack thought that this was completely out of control, he had to admit that he wasn't in the most uncomfortable position. He was able to sprawl all of his limbs outward so he wouldn't be cramped, and the softness of his sister's special area provided good support. What came next, though, really pushed Jack's limits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does Lucy do? </span></div></div>",

I don't know what he did to get that small, but that's surely him. You can play around with him, I don't mind\". Jack glared at Lucy, but she was already back to her work. He turned back towards the girl Gracie, and noticed her grey eyes were still fixated on him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-hi\" Jack stuttered. \"I'm Jack, Lucy's older brother. Would you mind p-putting me down? I would like to speak with her, if you don't mind\". Gracie shook her head. \"Not gonna happen, little guy. Lucy told me that I could play with you, and that's exactly what we're going to do\". Jack froze up for a second, not sure how to comprehend what she just said, but eventually he got what he needed to say out. \"I'm sorry, but I can't play. I need to talk with my sister\". Gracie rolled her eyes. \"You're really no fun, are you? Tell you what, if you manage to climb me and make it up to my shoulders before a five minute time limit runs out, I'll give you back to her. But if you fail to do so, you HAVE to be with me for a little while. Deal?\". Jack, thinking that he would be able to easily traverse the rather easy to climb fabric of Gracie's clothes (since he had done it before to get here), agreed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGracie turned slightly, and placed Jack on the back of her chair. \"The five minutes starts now, hurry up and get up to my ear, or I.ll make you one heck of a good plaything\" Gracie charged. Jack shuddered. He really did not want to know what kind of thing Gracie had in mind. Now on the back of the chair, Jack could notice that Gracie still had not fixed the gap in her jeans, and was still showing a significant amount of her backside. He ignored that, though, and began to climb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo minutes in, Jack was already halfway up Gracie's shirt, when she began to shift. There was no way she was going to make this easy for Jack, so Gracie had decided to occasionally voluntarily shift to try and delay his efforts. She really wanted to play with a real live toy, and this was an excellent time to do so. Jack managed to hang on for a few moments, before Gracie stopped moving and he continued his ascent. Looking up, though, Jack noticed an inconsistency in Gracie's shirt. He wasn't entirely sure if he could get past it or if he should take a different route, but regardless, Jack continued his way towards the issue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIs he able to get past it and make the rest of the trip to Gracie's shoulder in time?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>   Even though she was getting ready for gym, Izzy seemed to be the more deserving target for a prank like this. The amount of times Jack had to experience painstakingly slow visits with her butt, or kiss her feet, or smell her armpit, is much more than he cares to admit. Even though she's two years younger than Jack, Izzy has had unbelievably tricky tactics to set up Jack into these positions, but now Jack was in a proper position of getting back at her. He traveled over to the outside of the girls' locker room, and leaned his head up against the door to see if he could hear anyone inside. And he did. There were some showers running and walking, but Jack could make out the distinct voice of his sister, who sounded like she was talking with the gym teacher about her upcoming pacer test. But Jack didn't care about that. He cared about getting back at his little sister for all of the pranks she pulled on him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Before any girls came out of the locker room and spotted him, Jack switched on the shrink ray, and diminished in size back to the few inches the setting was set to. He tried to squeeze underneath the door without anyone opening it, but even with him being as small as he was, Jack was unable to. He would have to wait for someone to open it to get inside, which frustrated him a little bit. Jack didn't know how long it was until Izzy would get going on her pacer test, but something like this only delayed what he felt was payback even more. Finally, after five or so minutes of waiting at 3 inches, the first girl came out. Looking up, Jack determined that it wasn't his sister, and seized the opportunity to enter the locker room and go look for her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   At this point, all of the girls who were in the shower had already gotten out and dressed, which disappointed Jack a little, but that's not why he was here. He walked around the walls that separated the showers from the actual locker room looking for his sister, and finally found her speaking with someone who must have been a friend of hers. Jack stealthily crept around the loose shoes and socks that scattered the walkways, and wound up under the bench where his sister was sitting, waiting for her turn at the pacer. Looking for any sort of way up to the bench, Jack moved around as quietly as he could to avoid making any disturbances. For a few minutes, he couldn't find anything, but then his opportunity came as Izzy's friend set down her towel which Jack could use as a rope.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Once he climbed the towel and made it up to the bench, Jack looked over in the direction of Izzy. She was still chatting with her friend. This was the perfect time for Jack to make his move. With haste, he ran over to his sister, who was wearing spandex and a tight T-shirt, and tried scaling the back of her shirt. Luckily, nothing had gotten in Jack's way and he had gotten up to Izzy's shoulder in no time flat. Now he was in position. Now was the time for Jack to get his vengeance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, right as Jack was about to crawl inside Izzy's ear and startle her, Izzy's friend pointed out that there was a bug on her shoulder. Izzy immediately jolted, sending Jack tumbling forward towards the front of Izzy's shirt. His legs fell inside the shirt, but before his entire body fell into the dark crevice of Izzy's bosom, Jack grabbed on to the v of the t-shirt. Looking down, Izzy noticed the bug had just barely remained outside of her shirt and was clinging on for dear life. When she picked up the bug for closer inspection, Izzy identified the tiny bug as her brother, and broke out in laughter. She was confused as to how he got so small, but that didn't matter so much right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, Jack. I see you couldn't help yourself in trying to get back at me, huh?\" Izzy chuckled, \"Well, that's too bad. I was feeling generous today, too. I don't think I would have pranked you today, but now that you're here, and I'm feeling a little bit normal, why don't you get an even better close up with your favorite thing in the world?\". Jack shivered and gulped. He knew what Izzy was referencing. With her patented cheeky smile, Izzy brought the hand she was holding Jack with around her back, and used the other hand to open up the back of her spandex. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think you'll feel better after I complete my pacer. Your best friend should give you just what you deserve\" she chuckled. With that last little remark, Izzy released Jack, and he fell into the dark chasm of her spandex, settling deep in between the large, soft and sweaty mounds of Izzy's rear end. With one final laugh, Izzy snapped her spandex shut and went to complete her pacer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   What happens to Jack during the pacer?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>    Just walking out to the gym, the swaying of Izzy's hips and her cheeks rubbing together placed Jack in such a position that all of his limbs were kept in place. Even though Izzy was already sweating, this tight fit kept Jack firmly placed in his sister's massive hills, safe and secure. When she got to the line to begin her pacer, Izzy clenched her cheeks tightly one time, just to be sure that Jack wasn't going to escape the monumental torture she was going to dish out. Jack heard the starting bell ring, but he also heard a faint rumbling noise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Izzy's pace grew faster and faster to match the rhythm set by the pacer, Jack's environment grew tighter and tighter, despite Izzy's sweating practically raining from above. He was still able to breathe, which was nice, but the air, if you could even call it that, was stale, clogging Jack's nose and forcing a few tears out of his eyes. But it was about to get a lot worse for Jack. The rumbling Jack heard at the beginning of the pacer had recently grew louder and louder. When Izzy was about to make her fourteenth bell, it happened. It was relatively silent to the other kids who were doing the pacer with Izzy, but within the confines of her spandex, it sounded like a cannon firing. Worse than the sound was the stench. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the noise erupted, the smell immediately followed, covering Jack's whole body and driving up his nose. He could barely breathe, but the little bit that he could was the foulest stench Jack had ever encountered. On top of that, the shaking from the massive fart had covered Jack in his sister's sweat and driven him a little further into her ass. Fortunately, Jack wasn't too close to the hole which dispersed this rancid smell, but he was still too close for comfort. Outside of this noxious chamber, Izzy was having the time of her life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sensation of Jack's movements within her tight spandex made Izzy giggle and coo. She knew that it was her brother, which in a sense made this extra weird, but at the same time made it all the better. Izzy loved her brother very much, but also loved to mess with him. On top of the fact that Izzy was torturing Jack, she was enjoying the squirming he made. It made her feel in control but the physical sensation was so much better than that. Izzy giggled about the thought of what her brother was going through, but she was starting to get tired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pungent odor seemed to linger forever as Jack tried his best to maintain consciousness. The rubbing of Izzy's buttcheeks had drained him of most, if not all, of his energy. His body lay limp, completely at the mercy of Izzy and her ginormous behind. Just as Jack was getting ready to pass out, the rubbing of Izzy's cheeks had began to slow down. She was done with the pacer! He didn't have to suffer in here any longer!. The sudden joy from the end of the pacer seemed to almost completely rejuvenate Jack, and he regained full consciousness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSweaty and tired, Izzy entered the locker room after completing her pacer, and undressed, ready to take a shower. At this point, she completely forgot about her older brother being trapped within the confines of her cheeks, and went off for the showers without giving it an extra thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIs Jack still stuck with Izzy as she takes a shower? Or did he fall down with her spandex?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>    Rather than go sneak up on either Izzy or Lucy, Jack decided to explore other parts of the middle school. He'll have time to prank those two when he gets home. Still standard size, Jack wanders the halls looking for a good classroom to infiltrate. He spots a few where a lot of the students inside were just messing around on their phones, but Jack decided that he should go find one where most of the kids were attentive. That way, it was less likely that a student would have their eyes on the ground and spot Jack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter another few minutes of looking, Jack found a classroom that suited his idea. This a social studies classroom, Jack could hear the subject being taught inside, which he presumed was a US history course. Jack took out his shrink ray, and wasted no more time getting to the point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrawling under the door, the first thing that Jack noticed was the surprisingly young teacher who was at the front of the room, showing something on a projector. She looked to be in her late twenties or early thirties, had tied back brown hair, soft brown eyes and glasses, and sported one of the most perfect asses Jack had ever seen. It wasn't just one which was sizable, it had perfect curvature, according to Jack, and was complimented very well by the jeans she had on. Her chest was moderately sized, also not too big, not too small. Jack thought she was the perfect package and wanted to introduce himself, but he remembered where he was at and why he was there, so he decided, at least for the moment, he wouldn't go for it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe students were seated in individual seats which were aligned in single-file rows. There were a few gaps in between seats, so Jack had a go to just in case it was absolutely necessary. Jack began wandering the rows, looking for a potential student to either scare or start a conversation with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were so many to choose from, though, which person stood out to Jack the most?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>While on the larger side compared to her peers, Skylar also had massively developed assets. Looking up at the behemoth in her chiar, Jack was astonished. Not that he thought anything wrong of her, just at his current size she was unbelivably massive. Skylar was entranced on her phone which she held below her desk to keep out of sight of Ms. Green. Jack thought that because of this, she might notice him, but that wasn't the case. She was thirteen years old, after all, social media was pretty big with her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough initially having doubts as to whether or not he should climb her, Jack said screw it and just went for it. He knew that Skylar probably wouldn't feel him considering the attention she kept on her phone, but thought that if he went up her front she would eventually see him. Therefore, Jack began his ascent up Skylar's back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he initially reached the seat of her chair, Jack came face-to-face with her enormous backside. At normal size, it was huge. At this size, it was immeasurable. To add on, Skylar was wearing tight jean shorts. Jack was mesmerized for a few moments before remembering his objective and getting on the climb. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout halfway up, Skylar shifted. She noticed the teacher was heading her way, likely checking for phones out, and turned her phone off and sat up. This movement prevented Jack from climbing any further and had him focus on maintaining his grip on Skylar's tanktop. He nearly was pressed flat against the back of Skylar's chair as she began to sit back, but fortunately for him, she didn't get quite that far. Eventually, the teacher came and went and Skylar leaned forward, receding to her phone. This meant Jack could carry on his mission, which he did promptly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the top of his climb, Jack rested on Skylar's shoulder. It was a long climb up the girthy girl and had taken quite a bit of energy out of him. Jack took a quick peak at his phone to find the time, though, and realized he had to act fast. The end of the class was only in five minutes, and he didn't want Skylar unaware of his presence when the time came to end class. Additionally, the climb back down would be difficult, especially with time constraints. Thus, Jack hopped off of his butt and began to yell to Skylar's ear, hoping to get her attention. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuccess! Skylar heard something coming from her shoulder and peaked over to see what the issue was. She noticed a smallish figure jumping up and down and grabbed it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you?\" Skylar whispered, She then took a double take. \"Oh my gosh! You're a human!\" she quietly exclaimed. Jack nodded with glee. \"Yes! I was just having some fun and decided to get your attention\" Jack explained. \"Skylar grinned. \"Well, you came to the right place, little man. Let's get you back to my place and we can have PLENTY of fun\". Jack was unsure of what to think of this, but brushed it off and decided to play along. Skylar was happy to receive a welcome response. \"Class is about to end, so you can stay in here. Enjoy the ride, little man. I'll take you out when I get on my bus\". Skylar placed Jack in her cleavage and readjusted her tank top, securing her little passenger between her much larger than average boobs. Jack settled in, then waited for everything to play out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Skylar gets to her bus, what happens?</span></div></div>",

Wasting no time in trying to get her attention, Jack made his way to the base of her chair and began his ascent up the front right leg. He nearly fell as the girl shifted her chair for a moment, but he stabalized and made it the rest o the way to the seat. There, Jack had a couple choices. He could climb the front portion of the girl's shorts, although that was a sensitive area, so the girl might kill him if Jack chose that route. Jack could also climb up the girl's thigh or go around to the back and climb up her backside. Since the girl was leaning forward slightly, the fabric was stretched outwards, meaning Jack might have an easier time grabbing hold of the fabric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUltimately, Jack decided to climb the girl's thigh and make his way up her left arm to get to her shoulder and get her attention from there. The climb up the girl's thigh was a little unbalanced, but eventually Jack got himself up and continued on his trek. While he was climbing the girl's arm, though, the girl got up and walked to the front of the class, forcing Jack to leap for and hang on to the side of her tank top. She didn't stay long, though, and went back to her seat. Once she got there and the movements subsided, Jack climbed up her tank top, reaching the girl's chest in little time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom this vantage point, Jack wasn't able to get as good of a look at the girl's dashing brown eyes, but he still admired her looks. When Jack looked back to his own eye level, he noticed quite possibly one of the most complete bosoms he had ever laid his eyes on. But Jack didn't want to get distracted, so he quickly looked away and made his way to the tip of the Latina's shoulder. From there, he managed to get her attention rather easily, to the girl's shock. In a swift and sudden motion, the Latina shoved Jack deep into her cleavage, making sure no one else saw him so she could closer inspect him when she was able to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin the titan Latina's cleavage, Jack was getting accustomed to the softness of the surrounding flesh and the rhythmic beat of the girl's heart. After a few more minutes of hearing faint voices, Jack drifted off to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he wakes up, where is Jack?</span></div></div>",

Lookiing around him, he was still in the young girl's impressive rack, but without the pressure from deep within, Jack was able to move around some. When he looked up, Jack saw the awestruck eyes of the girl staring at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't believe this,\" the girl said in awe, \"he is real small person\". Jack picked up the broken English and South American accent the girl carried and chuckled to himself. \"Hello,\" he introduced, \"I'm Jack, what's your name?\". The Latina's eyes widened hearing the miniature boy's voice. \"I'm Lola\" she wooed. \"How are you small?\". Jack shrugged, trying to hide the fact that he had a shrink ray. \"I have no idea, I just came here to pick up my little sister's and BOOM. I'm tiny\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who are your sisters?\" Lola inquired. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Isabella and Lucy, do you know them?\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLola smiled warmly. \"Yes, Isabella in my Spanish class and Lucy has lunch with me\". Jack was happy to hear this, maybe Lola could help him get to them. \"Great! Do you think you could take me to them?\" Jack asked. Lola shook her head in response. \"No, I think you come with me, we should have some fun\". Jack was confused. \"What? But I'm here to pick them up, I must get to them\". Lola laughed when she heard Jack respond that way, mistakingly thinking he was there to physically pick them up. \"But you're so small? There no way you pick them up\" she giggled. Jack facepalmed. \"That's not what I meant, I meant that I--\" but before Jack could finish, Lola intervened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you can pick up Lola, you can pick up Isabella and Lucy\" she declared. Without waiting for Jack to reply, Lola brought him out of her cleavage and placed him on her chair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lola! This isn't what I me--\" Lola then dropped herself onto the chair, smearing Jack into the fabric of her jean shorts. Feeling him underneath her cheek, Lola giggled then said \"I told you, you can't pick them up. You come with me for the day, I'll take care of you\". Lifting her butt off the chair, Lola peeled Jack off of her butt and placed him on the desk for a moment. Jack once again tried to talk some sense into her, but Lola had already picked him up again and placed him back in between her boobs. Giggling, Lola kept pushing Jack down, then once she felt he was deep enough, pushed her boobs together and went back to class.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the rest of the middle school day, Jack remained trapped in his fleshy prison. When the school day finally got out, Lola walked to her mother's car and left back to her house, maintaining her little captor hidden until she got home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Lola does get home, what happens?</span></div></div>",

When she does and places him on the desk in her bedroom, Jack takes the opportunity to break out the ray and shoot himself, hoping to return to normal size. But something happened and the remote malfunctioned. Instead of turning Jack back to normal, the remote only brought him back to a measley 10 inches, making him barely larger than a doll. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNoticing the rapid transformation unfold in front of her own eyes, Lola gasps and quickly grabs Jack. Holding him closer to her face, Lola asked \"Jack? What you do?\". Jack awkwardly smiled, then replied \"Well, I was only trying to return to normal size. I need to get home, and I didn't think I could being that small\". A frown appeared over Lola's visage and she angrily responded \"Well, I think you need punishment\". Jack shuddered and doubletaked. \"Excuse me? Why?\". Lola shook her head and simply said \"Because\". Not understanding why or what she was going to do, Jack squirmed to get free of the early teen's grip, but which only further angered the girl. With a furrowed brow, Lola called in her older sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLola's older sister, Milo, was Jack's age with short black hair and a rather large build. Although being a little bit overweight, Milo participated in a few different sports and often worked up a sweat. This is something that Lola counted on when she called her in. Lola spoke to her sister in Spanish, and a sly grin slowly crept across Milo's face as Lola continued, to Jack's discomfort. When Lola finished, Milo nodded and laid down face first on the floor of Lola's room. She pulled down her leggings, revealing her tan, panty covered butt. Jack nervously looked to Lola who was giggling. Looking back to Milo, he noticed that she was pulling up the middle of her panties, revealing more and more of her sweaty and jiggly butt. When she felt that she had gone far enough, Milo stopped pulling, and Jack watched in horror as it got closer and closer as Lola began lowering Jack towards it. Before he made contact, though, Lola forced Jack's mouth open, then shoved him face first into Milo's undercarriage. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince Jack grew back to a little larger than a doll, he wasn't pushed all the way into Milo's crack, forunately for him. Regardless, Lola was pressing him in there pretty good, and her pressure kept Jack from moving any. Still with his mouth open, Milo let out a loud, pressure packed fart which shook Jack to his core and gave him the foulest taste he had ever experienced. Lola released her grip on Jack as she fell backwards laughing, and Jack's surroundings began to jiggle as Milo was equally in hysterics. Sweat began to compile on Jack as it kept sliding down Milo's cheeks, and combined with the rancid smell of Milo's gas, left Jack groaning and gagging. He wasn't out of trouble, though, as before Jack could get out, Milo pulled up her pants, not realizing Lola didn't take him out, leaving Jack hugging the wedgie Milo had left herself, wheezing and drenched in sweat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack tried to get her attention, but his muffles were silenced by the mammoth ass of Milo and her clothing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens to Jack from here?</span></div></div>",

He assumed that the rest of the people there was Lola's family.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSurrounding the table, there was Lola's mother, Lorenna, a middle age stay-at-home mom with a bombshell of a body, Milo, Lola's slightly overweight older sister, Chico, Lola's younger brother, David, Lola's father who in all honesty was just there to make sure he wasn't yelled at by Lorenna, and Lola. Being just an elementary kid, Chico didn't have much of an attention span and left soon after his first glance of the tiny guy on the table, and David pretended to go play with Chico to hide the fact that he had no interest in what was on the table. Although those two didn't have much of a care for Jack, the other three were glued to the table, in awe of the miniature man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack tried to bellow out to Lola, but before his was able to, Lola unfastened him from the table and picked him up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lola!\" Jack yelled, \"You need to get me home!

I didn't ask for this! I think I should be able to go back home and see my family, just as you are able to be with your family right now!\" Jack argued. \"You're just a toy\" Lola giggled, \"You belong to me and my family now, you do as we say\". Jack was distraught and tried wiggling out of Lola's grasp, but she only squeezed tighter. \"Trying to escape? I think you need punishment\" Lola ordered. She then grabbed Milo's arm and motioned for their mother to join them as Lola directed the three of them plus Jack to a bedroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce in the room, Lola dropped Jack on the bed and the three titans, while keeping an eye on Jack, spoke to each other in Spanish. When they finished talking with each other, Lola spoke to Jack. \"Since you need punishing and haven't been introduced with us yet, we have come up with a plan to kill two birds with one stone\" Lola explained, \"You will do something for each of us three and at the end, if we feel like you done good job, we take you home\".

With that in mind, he grabbed the shrink ray out of his back pocket and pointed the proper end at himself once again. Jack hit \"Switch off\" and he returned to normal. All was well, at least from what he had assumed. Unbeknownst to Jack, Eiko and Mia had witnessed Jack return to normal and had an idea of what he was capable of. Jack started toward the West exit of the school, but before he was able to get to the door and while Brittany was distracted, Eiko got in the way of the door. \"Hi, Jack\" she giggled. \"How your day went?\". Jack played it off as Eiko just being clingy. \"It went well, thanks for asking, Eiko. How did yours go?\". She smiled and responded \"It okay until now. I saw you size change, you show me how it work?\". This flustered Jack. \"W-what?! That's crazy, c-changing size is impossible!\". Eiko giggled her bubbly giggle and got close to Jack. \"If ever want to show Eiko, just tell and I be here\" she whispered. Jack shivered and tried to shake her off. \"I-I have no idea what you're doing, but it's a little strange. A-anyways, I got to go, I'll talk to you later, Eiko\". Jack stuttered. Eiko smiled her happy smile as Jack walked out of the school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA little ways into his walk home, a car rolled up to Jack. \"Hey, stud, what's going on?\" Mia teased. Jack rolled his eyes. \"Hello, Mia. Is there anything I can help you with?\". \"As a matter of fact, yes. You see, back at the school I saw something really interesting and I was hoping you could clue me in to what it was\". Jack sighed. He knew Mia wasn't the sharpest tool in the shed, but it would be rude to just leave her hanging. \"Go ahead, what can't you understand\". Mia smirked and told Jack about what she saw in the hallway. \"I was hoping you would be able to show me what exactly you have going on and maybe even play a little game with me? How about it, champ?\". Jack shuddered. The fact that two people saw him transform size is bad. The fact that those two who saw him were Eiko and Mia  made things a hundred times worse. \"I-I have no idea what you're going on about, b-but it's pure nonsense\". Jack tried to recover. Mia chuckled. \"Then maybe my eyes are going bad. I'll talk to you lateerrr, Jaaaack\" Mia sang. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't believe what just happened. I'm in so much shit right now, I have to find a way to avoid those two\". Jack thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat plan does he formulate?</span></div></div>",

But who was he going to contact? First, it was going to be very hard to explain the situation with Mia and Eiko AND hard to explain how and why he acquired a shrink ray. The first person that came to mind was Bridgette. She was a good and trustworthy friend of his, plus she lived next door, so she could drop him off at his house, no problem. But Jack felt a little awkward asking her because of their tight friendship, but he does know that he can count on her to protect him whenever he needs it. A second option would be Rachel. She was also very caring and understanding, so Jack was sure she would do him the favor of hiding him from Eiko and Mia. But Jack had a massive crush on Rachel, and he thought that if he asked her to do this, it might ruin his chances of getting anywhere near a \"thing\" with her. While Rachel was on the mind, Jack also thought about Emi. \"Even if Eiko and Mia had somehow figured out that I was hiding with someone, there's no way that they would think that I would be on HER,\" Jack thought. He took his time to deliberately mull over the options, but with daytime running out and night time falling, Jack would need to ask someone soon if he wanted to find a way to avoid Eiko and Mia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho does Jack decide to ask?</span></div></div>",

When they met, Jack got straight to the point and explained the whole situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, I would need you to hide me in your pocket or something, just for the day\". Emi giggled and replied, \"While I am flattered that you want me to be your guardian angel, how can I? I'll be up at Emerson (the college) in my own classes\". Jack nodded, he thought she was going to say something like that. \"Well, I already texted my mom and told her that I would be going and staying the night with a friend tonight, so that we could catch up on a project together, then go with each other to school tomorrow morning. So, I could shrink and come stay the night with you tonight, then go with you to your college courses for tomorrow. What do you think?\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmi, while not showing a whole lot of it, was absolutely ecstatic. Having a whole night and day with a shrunk down version of Jack? An impassable opportunity. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, that sounds good to me. When do you want to head back to my house with me?\". Jack shrugged. \"If you're ready now, we can go now. I'll just have to go get my stuff then I'll be out and will shrink in the car\". Emi slyly smiled and uttered, \"Perfect! I'll be waiting at the car then\". The two then temporarily went their separate ways.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin five to ten minutes of going back to his classroom to grab his things, Jack was at the car with Emi, them both waiting for Rachel. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Should I let her see me?\" Jack asked. \"Or do you think it would be better if we kept her in the dark about this plan?\". Knowing Rachel's feelings for Jack, and wanting him all for himself, Emi suggested that he should shrink now and avoid making contact with Rachel. \"Who knows? Maybe she would tell someone else about this and then the word about your shrinking ability would make it all over the school\". Jack would never think that Rachel would do such a thing to him, but just to be sure, he went with what Emi had told him, and shrunk down right then and there. Emi grabbed the mini Jack, and pulled him in close for a kiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter she gave Jack a little smooch, Emi spotted Rachel coming towards the car, and instinctively went to hide Jack. She didn't have any pockets on her tights, though, so Emi decided that she may as well have a little fun with Jack while he was small. \"Sorry Jack,\" Emi pretended to apologize,\"I have no pockets, you're going to have to go in here\". She pulled open the front of her tights, also pulling the front of her panties as well. Jack immediately questioned her. \"Do you have to also pull open your panties. Like is that really necessary?\" Emi's sly grin crept across her face again and she nodded. \"You'll be extra close to me so you won't fall out\" Emi justified. Before Jack could argue any more, Emi threw him in, then snapped back her panties and tights, which pressed Jack right up against the lips of her sensitive area. She let out a small moan, then greeted Rachel as she stepped into the car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Jack was completely grossed out by the alternative method Emi used to hide him. He knew he shouldn't move any because of how sensitive of an area this was and how easy it would be to arouse Emi. But Jack really did not enjoy the pursing of Emi's lips or the light juices that occasionally came out and soaked his clothes. All in all, Jack couldn't wait to get out of here. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens to Jack next?</span></div></div>",

Just let me finish up real quick and I'll be with you\". Once Carey finished doing her task, she took a seat at the kitchen table and motioned Jack to come join her. \"What's going on?\". Jack was fidgety. \"So you know that shrink ray I got for extra credit? Well, when I was making up work after class, it somehow was switched on and I wondered around real small for a little while,\" Jack bluffed. Carey gasped. \"Are you okay? Are there any bruises? Did you break anything?\". Carey was about to get up to inspect her son for damages when he told her to calm down. \"It's okay, Mom, I'm fine. The main thing I'm concerned about is that once I grew back to normal, these two girls saw the transformation and now I think they want to have some fun with me\". Carey nodded, following along. \"I was wondering if you had any advice for what I should do or if you could do something for me to make sure that these girls don't have their way with me if I somehow shrink down again?\". Jack's mom thought for a minute before responding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Well, what do you think would work? Are you looking to completely get away from them from here on out? Or do you just want to avoid them momentarily, to try and get them to forget what happened?\". Jack shrugged. \"I mean, I think it would be pretty rude if I just outright ignored them from here on out, but if that got the job done, then maybe I should do that. But honestly, I would prefer if it was just temporary. I don't think it would be a good look if I completely shunned them\". Carey took a moment to think. \"Well, as much as I hate to take you out of school, I could bring you with me to work up until the end of the weekend, just to make sure they don't know where to look for you.

I guess we'll have to sneak you in then\". Jack was surprised. \"Couldn't we just ask your boss to allow me in for a few hours, a couple days? I mean, how in the world would you sneak me in?\". Carey smiled. \"With the shrink ray, of course! No one would notice a tiny little boy traveling along with me!\". Jack was concerned. That sounded a little to enthusiastic for his liking. Yeah, his mom cared about him a lot and was overall a very joyous person, but still, it was a little off-putting. \"But where would you keep me?\". Carey laughed. \"Where else would I keep you? My purse! I'll put in a few snacks so you don't get hungry and shrink down a water bottle or two to make sure you stay hydrated\" she assured. Jack felt a little better, but still had his concerns.

Worse yet, what if she forgot it at work over the weekend? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Right, I'll wake you up at 8:30 tomorrow, we'll have breakfast, then get going. Sound good?\".

Are you sure you want to do this, hon?\" Carey questioned. Jack nodded. \"Absolutely. I know you'll take care of me well, Mom\". Carey smiled. Without any further hesitation, she pushed the \"Switch on\" button and down went her son, to the measly size of a few inches. She reached down and plucked him up, gave him a sloppy wet kiss, then placed Jack in her purse. Carey then grabbed her coffee and went to her car to drive to work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack felt the occasional bump and grind the car took, but he didn't mind. Within the confines of his mother's purse, he had no problem with whatever was going on outside. He had plenty of snacks, water, and entertainment (by that, just his phone, but he could spend hours on it without losing interest). After a few more bumps and turns, they had arrived at Carey's work, where she was a receptionist. Carey got out of the car, finishing her coffee and grabbing her purse. She hadn't yet forgotten about her tiny son, and peeked in to check in on how he was doing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm doing well, Mom\" Jack laughed. \"No issues anywhere in here\". Carey smiled and closed the purse up once again. She had nothing to worry about. She was a responsible mother and Jack was a responsible boy. She never thought that Jack could get lost or harmed in any way. Carey arrived at her desk, and set her purse down on her chair. Jack was curious to know what his mom's workplace looked like, so he got up and tried undoing the zipper from the inside, but to no avail. He decided to text his mom and see if she would let him out for a moment, which she did, no problem. Carey moved her purse onto her desk and sat down, then moving Jack onto her shoulder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is a pretty cool place\" Jack remarked. Carey chuckled dryly and responded \"Well, it's not much but it does more than enough to put food on the table\". After a few minutes went by of Carey and Jack talking, a deliveryman arrived, hoping Carey could sign off on a package for one of the employees working in the building. She leaned forward, grabbing the clipboard and began to sign the document. When she did this, though, Jack tumbled backwards and his misfortune got the better of him as he started falling down his mom's back, heading for the seat below. Jack hit the chair softly, obtaining no injuries in the process. Unfortunately, now he was nowhere near close enough to speak with his mom, so he had to hope and pray that she remembered about her tiny son that was on her shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoes she remember him and realize he wasn't on her shoulder anymore? Or did the delivery distract her enough to forget about him?</span></div></div>",

Not only would it be difficult to explain if his mom found him there, but who knows if he would be discovered at all?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot finding Jack on her desk or anywhere else in front of her, Carey looked down at her chair, then turned around.

Jack laughed. \"That certainly was an interesting experience, just don't forget about me if anything like that happens again\". Carey nodded with care. \"Of course, dear. Losing you would be the last thing that I would want to see happen. With that being said, we need to get you somewhere where we won't have to worry about you getting lost again\" Carey explained. Jack nodded in agreement. \"Yeah. I mean, you can just put me back in your p--\" but Carey interrupted him. \"I think I know just the spot for you. It might be pretty tight, but at least I'll be able to keep an eye on you\". She quickly took Jack off of her shoulder and set him in the middle of her massive breasts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There. Now everything should be all better\" Carey soothed. Jack tried to argue. \"Mom, I could just stay in your purse, like it's not a big deal. You could trust me if you placed me in your purse, I would have nowhere to go\". Carey laughed, vibrating her chest and Jack. \"Nonsense, dear, if I put you there, I might spill it and you could fly off somewhere. If I kept you between my breasts, we wouldn't have to worry about something like that\" she validated. Even though that wasn't the most sound thought in the world, Jack was having trouble arguing with it. \"Exactly,\" Carey said as she noticed Jack's difficulty to speak, \"now I must get back to work, so I have to keep you nice and secure\". Carey squeezed her breasts together and Jack popped up and out. \"No, that won't due\" she muttered. Carey plucked Jack up from the top of her boob, placed him right back within her cleavage, and this time pushed him down a little ways, to keep him tightly wound within her breasts. She squeezed again, and this time Jack stayed lodged in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a grin, Carey got back to work. In between her breasts, Jack sighed, but settled in and began getting a little drowsy.

She took the package off of the second tier of the desk and set it down in front of her, then readjusting in her chair to deal with the shipping situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Jack got up from his fall, a shadow loomed overhead. He looked up to find what was clouding his light and discovered the absolutely huge butt of his mother hovering above. Jack tried to escape to the back of the chair, but he couldn't. The desk chair was on a slope which influenced the seat to lean forwards, preventing Jack from traveling to the back and instead sliding him to the middle. Once he got to his final destination, Jack once again looked up and gasped before being consumed by the jean-covered ass of his mother. The pressure was immense, but Jack was fortunate enough to find a slight enough gap in between Carey's butt and the chair to have an air pocket. If he was going to be trapped under anyone's behind, it would be better to be on the outside where there wouldn't be any sweat or stale air, and Jack was lucky enough for that to happen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nApparently, Jack had been significant enough for his mother to sense that she had something under her butt, and she once again readjusted in her chair to try and subdue the disturbance. This movement slid Jack back and forth along her ass, rubbing his face and body into the fabric of her jeans. Jack thought that this was the end and he would end up an insignificant stain on the jeans of his own mother. But this wasn't the case. Jack managed to survive this incident, with minimal injury too, and tried to squirm his way out from under the gigantic weight, but was unable. Still sensing the same disturbance under her butt, Carey once again readjusted, this time moving Jack closer to her front, also leaving him a looser position in the process.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that Jack was able to move some, he seized the opportunity and itched and clawed his way out from underneath his mother and moved forward to the gap in between her legs. Looking back, Jack was in the presence of Carey's enormous crotch. Even though it was covered by Carey's jeans, Jack looked away, disgusted. He thought that there would be no way that he was going to climb up his mom's crotch to have a chance at speaking with her, but after attempting to climb up the far too smooth fabric on either side of her thighs, Jack had no choice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a deep breath away from the musky region of his mother, Jack began his ascent up the tight area 'of her crotch. Even through the jeans, Jack could smell a very musky and funny aroma, gagging in the process. He was ashamed that he had to do this. Climbing up the exterior nether regions of Carey, Jack didn't make his presence known, which was a big deal. If his mom felt him and assumed he was an itch, Jack could have been pressed into his own mother's pussy, and although on the outside, the premise of that made Jack feel nauseous. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo longer than five minutes later, Jack was away from the nether regions and making his way up Carey's midriff with ease, planning on making it up to her ear in no time flat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlong the way, though, does something go wrong or does Jack make it up to his mom's ear unbothered?</span></div></div>",

Jack struggled for a moment, but he couldn't even move his fingers. SIghing, Jack gave up and relaxed. Lauren giggled softly, then snapped her shirt back, leaving Jack in darkness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Without her son in mind, Carey sat forward in her chair, and the sudden elevation change sent Jack flying through the air, away from the receptionist desk and towards the other office workers. He landed on a pad of sticky notes on a table nearer to the middle of the office, by the coffee machine. When he recovered from the landing, Jack looked around to try and spot his mom, but was unable to. He decided to climb down and go look for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Jack got to the floor, he searched for any possible people who could help him get to his mom, and saw a few potential candidates. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStraight ahead from where Jack was standing was the desk of a new intern the company hired, a short but physically gifted brunette who looked to be around eighteen or nineteen. The desk across from her looked to be a man in his fifties or so, but his demeanor gave Jack the creeps, so he decided that the man wasn't a viable option.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Two desks over from the man was a woman who looked to be Carey's age with a more petite body frame and wearing glasses to accompany her short blonde hair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last option Jack spotted wasn't a worker from this company at all, but one of the lunch ladies from his school, Wendy. Jack was confused as to why she was here, but if he had to guess, she must have been visiting someone. Anyways, Wendy had short, curly brown hair with very large breasts and an ass to match. The two things that might push Jack away from her was the fact that Wendy was nearing fifty five years of age and was a widow, so he thought that she was especially lonely and needed some sort of boost to get her going. That may explain why she was here at the office.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOut of these people, who did Jack decide would be the most helpful person to get him to his mom?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Little did he know, Izzy had overheard Jack talking with their mom about his situation. Making sure her mom was in bed and Jack was asleep, Izzy crept into Jack's room, looking for the shrink ray. She found it sitting on the nightstand next to Jack's bed, and stealthily made her way there. Still not making any sound whatsoever, Izzy picked up the shrink ray and grinned. This could be one of her favorite pranks of all time. Although Izzy didn't know that the shrink ray didn't emit any light or noise, she decided that she would shrink Jack right there on the spot. The fact that it didn't make any noise or create any light was just icing on the cake for Izzy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomehow, despite the drastic change in size, Jack didn't wake up, to Izzy's delight.

She came up with a couple options.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first idea Izzy came up with was to take Jack to school with her in the morning and show him off to her friends, and possibly pass him off to one of them.

Making sure she didn't wake Jack nor their mother, Izzy tip-toed her way over to the slightly open door and slowly pushed it open enough for her to enter. She could hear her mother snoring and turning in her bed, so Izzy knew that her mother was sleeping soundly and wouldn't have to worry about waking her as much. It was Jack that she had to concentrate on, since he was in her breast pocket. Izzy managed to make it to her mother's dresser without any issues regarding Jack or Carey, and slowly opened what looked like Carey's underwear drawer. Izzy snickered and gently picked Jack up from her pocket and placed him within a pair of Carey's panties, hoping that she would pick them the next morning. Izzy then made her stealthy escape and went to bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning, Carey got up and went to Jack's room to get him ready for the day. But he wasn't there. She assumed that Jack must have changed his mind about the plan and went to school. Shaking it off, Carey went back to getting ready for her day. She grabbed a pair of tight jeans, a bra, a tight hugging tee shirt, and a pair of panties, then went to take a shower. By Izzy's doing and Jack's misfortune, the pair that Carey picked was the one that carried Jack. Since Jack was such a deep sleeper, he had no idea that he was being carried to a very unfortunate fate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack woke up to the sound of rushing water. He yawned and checked his surroundings to see where the noise was coming from. But he could see nothing other than a light pink tint, belonging to something he was unfamiliar with. Jack reached out to touch whatever it was that was covering him, and it was made from a very light fabric. While he was trying to figure out the mystery of this unknown material, Jack heard what sounded like the shower handles turn off. He was very confused. Jack looked down at himself to try and figure out what was going on, and then he realized what was happening. When Jack contrasted his body and the material below and around him, he pieced together that he had somehow been shrunk by his shrink ray and was in the panties of one of his family members. Based on the size of it, this pair of panties belonged to his mom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat Jack had suspected was true, as he looked up and found his bare naked mother drying off in a towel and reaching for her pile of clothes. This first article that she grabbed was the pair of panties that Jack was confined in. He yelled and screamed, trying to get Carey to notice him within the light silk fabric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoes Jack succeed in doing so or does he become one with his mother's flesh?</span></div></div>",

Jack was reassured. Eiko hadn't been here long enough to know where Jack's Aunt lived and Mia wasn't close enough to Jack to even know where Jack himself lived, let alone his relatives.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Not long after Jack had talked with his mom, she came back and told him what was going on. \"Aunt Lauren would be delighted to have you over! Funny thing is she has one of those shrink rays too, and has been looking for someone else who has one to share their knowledge with her,\" Carey informed. Jack was surprised. Normally, his aunt was behind in all of the new releases and advancements in technology, but something must have clicked inside her brain. Jack was even a little bit impressed. <br>\r\n <br>\r\n    \"Awesome! That should make this experience a lot more fun than I was expecting!\" Jack beamed. \"I'll be taking you over there around 5:30, then you'll be having dinner with her around 7\" Carey told her son. \"Cool, cool. That sounds good!\" Jack replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    When 5:30 came around, Carey had already taken off with Jack to her sister Lauren's house. Jack hadn't seen his Aunt Lauren in some time and was excited to see her again, but was especially excited to talk with her about the shrink ray. Around twenty minutes after they had left, Carey and Jack arrived at Lauren's house. Lauren was already outside to greet the two, and invited them inside to hang out for a little while. Carey had to go, though, because she needed to go pick up Izzy and Lucy from their individual soccer practices. Jack grabbed his things, then waved goodbye to his mom, and followed his Aunt Lauren into the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    Jack wasn't sure whether it was just how long it had been since he had seen his aunt, or whether he had just been not paying enough attention, but his Aunt Lauren seemed to have put on a few pounds. She wasn't overweight, but she certainly had a wide waistline and her bosom was quite perky as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"So, Jack, I have heard that you have gotten a hold of one of the recently released shrink rays\" Lauren chatted. \"Yeah, that's right. The one I have, though, only currently has two settings, and that's three inches and normal\" Jack responded. \"Oh that's funny, mine has an extra setting\" Lauren said. Jack leaned his head in confusion, but asked to see it. Within a few minutes, Lauren brought out her shrink ray, and sure enough, it had an extra setting on it which read \"One foot\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"Do you mind if we test it out on something?\" Jack inquired. \"Oh, not at all, Jack,\" Lauren gave permission. \"As a matter of fact, why don't we try it out on you?\". Jack hesitated a moment. \"What? Why would we do that?\".  \"Why not? I haven't yet seen someone shrink down, it would be very brave of you!\" Lauren clarified. So, Jack did what he was told, and set the setting to one foot, then hit the \"Switch on\" button. Something seemed to have gone wrong, though, because instead of shrinking him to one foot, the machine shrunk him down to three inches instead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"Oh shoot, the one foot setting must be under maintenance or testing or something\" Jack sighed. \"I suppose I should return to normal size, sorry Aunt Lauren\". Before he had the chance to change back; however, Lauren picked him up and confiscated the shrink ray from him. \"Aunt Lauren, what the hell?\" Jack yelled. \"Oh, my dear Jack, we haven't had our fun yet. Until we do, I think this is the perfect size for you\" Lauren smiled. \"I'm a bit drowsy, though, care to join me in a little nap?\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    Does Jack join in on his Aunt Lauren's little siesta? Or does he have other plans?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He was a little exhausted from the day he's had, he might as well go along with it and take a nap. \"Okay, Aunt Lauren, I'll take a nap with you\". \"Wonderful!\" she exclaimed. \"But you're so small, if you fall or leave to go somewhere, I might not be able to find you, and we can't have that can we?\" Lauren sarcastically pouted. \"What? Just grab a tissue box and place it on the nightstand next to you! I won't go anywhere, promise!\" Jack said. \"Oh, that won't do. Here, I have an idea!\". In the blink of an eye, Lauren pulled open the front of her shirt and casually dropped Jack in. \"Aunt Lauren, please! This is completely ridiculous!\". The gargantuan woman just laughed. \"It's completely necessary, though, Jack. Now I'm able to make sure you won't wonder off and get yourself in danger!\". The more she laughed, the further down Jack slid between the sweaty mountains of his own aunt. \"Is she crazy?\" Jack thought. \"Or just weird?\". Jack briefly stopped sliding down the rack of his Aunt Lauren, but it wasn't \"secure\" enough for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a brief instance, the darkness of Aunt Lauren's shirt was quickly filled with light, as Lauren had pulled it open. \"Yes!\" Jack thought. \"This woman has finally come to her senses!\". But is was a ruse, as a shadow soon befell the trapped teen as her finger had entered to push Jack to oblivion. And that is exactly what it had seemed like to Jack. As he was pushed further and further down, the sweat piled onto him and the pressure kept getting greater. The pushing stopped. Jack settled in what seemed like the lowest possible point in his aunt's bra that he could be. Darkness once again overtook him, as his aunt buttoned her shirt back up and began to take off her pants to get ready for her nap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, a shred of luck fell in favor of Jack, as Lauren had pushed him so low in her bra, that her sweat had made a good lubricant to slightly free his lower body below the bottom of her boobs. Lauren was still standing up, which meant that if Jack could act quick enough, he could use gravity to take him down and off the body of his deranged aunt! Jack began squirming with all his might, trying to get the rest of his body free from the fleshy walls, to a few minor successes. As Lauren began walking to her bed, though, Jack had finally managed to get free and was taking a trip down the midriff of his aunt!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, to Jack's horror, there was only one place he was heading towards. The velvet silk lacing of his aunt's panties. He was placed squarely in the middle of Lauren's chest, so it would only make sense that he was heading right toward the middle of her panties, which again to Jack's dismay, had just the right gap to fit in something of his stature. Jack tried all that he could to try and head to his aunt's leg, but it was no use. He had reached the waist and soon after. plunged into the dark and pungent forest of his own aunt's nether region. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLauren had been completely unaware of the mishaps of Jack as she walked back to her bed. She thought she had finally managed to subdue him, and was giddy as to what her and Jack were going to do once they had both rested up. Once she had made it to her bed, Lauren felt a tingle in her panties and went to calm it. She gently pressed the outside of her panties, which seemed to somewhat quell the unique sensation. Unknowingly, she had inserted half of her own nephew into her. Lauren then collapsed onto her bed, laying face down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack was living an absolute nightmare. He had just been pushed into his aunt's vagina and was nearly covered in her fluids. Worse yet, his aunt then laid down, pushing him even further in and holding him firm there!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat was going to happen next to poor Jack?</span></div></div>",

She pointed the shrink ray at Jack, but instead of changing the setting back to normal, she kept it at the small setting to see what would happen. Jack felt relieved as he thought his aunt had come to her senses. But in the instant of Lauren using the shrink ray, Jack learned that this wasn't the case.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOpening his eyes after the process, Jack discovered that his aunt's hand was even larger. He looked up to discover that Lauren had seemingly grown. Or was it that Jack shrunk more?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aunt Lauren, what did you do?!\" Jack screamed, furious. Lauren pretended that she had done this by accident. \"Oh my gosh! I am so sorry, Jack, the machine must have malfunctioned and shrunk you some more! Not to worry, though, you're safe with me!\" she smiled. Jack sighed and sat down in her hand. Just a few moments ago, Jack had been just a few inches tall, at the mercy of his massive aunt. Now, though, he's even smaller, maybe just a few centimetres tall, and at the mercy of his ENORMOUS aunt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay, Jack! Everything will be okay!\" Lauren giddily reassured him. She was bringing him in for a hug, but Jack stopped her. \"What's the matter, Jack? I was just trying to give you a warm embrace\". Jack responded, \"Well, yeah, but I'm a lot smaller and your breasts are a lot larger! I could have gotten lost in there!\". Lauren chuckled. \"Yeah, I suppose that's true\". She shook her rack, bouncing her boobs up and down. \"But it would be a very safe place for you, Jack, would it not?\". Jack was getting uncomfortable. \"Aunt Lauren, I'm your nephew, please knock it off\". She stopped and looked down at him. \"I'm sorry, Jack. Tell you what, I'll go make us some snacks and grab some water, then we can just relax and watch a movie, how does that sound?\" Lauren proposed. \"Okay, that sounds good\" Jack replied. Lauren then placed Jack on the coffee table in the living room and went to the kitchen to follow up on her offer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she came back, Lauren set the food and drinks down, then sat on the couch. Jack was finally getting excited. About the food and water, though, not as much the movie. Jack hopped onto the plate of salami, and started getting to work on an abnormally large and tender piece of meat. Lauren noticed, and laughed. She then grabbed the remote to the television and started the movie. Setting the remote back down, Lauren leaned to the table and grabbed Jack. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Easy there, tiger. Need some water to wash some of that down?\" Lauren asked. Jack nodded, and Lauren obliged. Without even a second thought about what she did, Lauren dropped Jack into the glass of water. Once emerging at the surface, Jack spluttered up some water and glared at his aunt. He didn't bother yelling, or anything, as she had already leaned back on the couch again, and he was in a glass, so Lauren probably would not have heard any of his pleas. Now accepting that he was drenched, Jack relaxed and floated on his back, taking the occasional sip of the water. A little while into the movie, though, and Jack was getting tired of floating around the boring glass. He finally decides to try and get his aunt's attention with a yell. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLauren leaned in to grab the glass of water, but was she doing it because she heard Jack? Or had she forgotten that she placed him in there and was getting thirsty?</span></div></div>",

At this point, she should be pretty big, although Jack couldn't rule anything out since he didn't even recall the slightest bit about her. A few moments later, Lauren placed Jack on the ground, and then he saw her. Carys, Jack's little cousin, was only four and still wearing pull-ups. She had short and curly brown hair with brown eyes. Looking up, Jack thought that the little toddler was the size of a building as she towered over him. She hung around her mom, wondering where Jack was at.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mommy? You said Jack was here. Where is he?\" Carys asked. Lauren chuckled. \"Look down, honey. Jack had a little accident\". Jack cursed under his breath. He wasn't supposed to be like this, but his troublesome aunt thought it necessary, apparently. Carys spotted Jack and gasped. \"Whoa! Jack so tiny! He's like a little dolly. but tinier!\". Jack decided to greet himself. \"Hi, Carys,\" he uttered, \"long time no see\". Carys giggled. \"Hi, Jack. Let's have some fun!\". Carys then reached down and picked Jack up, to Lauren's delight. \"Alright, you two, go have fun. Carys, keep an eye on Jack\" Lauren laughed. She then went to her room and crawled into bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarys eyed Jack, excited to play with him. \"Well, Carys, what do you want to do first, I suppose?\" Jack asked. Carys giggled once again. \"You are the perfect size for my dollies!\" she exclaimed. \"Although, I already finished playing with them, so maybe I can have some more fun just with you!\". Jack gulped. He was afraid of what Carys would do. She was only four, she could be very unpredictable. \"Why don't we just hang out?\" Jack proposed. \"That would make everything safer\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't want to do that, Jack. That's boring\" Carys pouted. \"I have an idea! Here, let's go back to my room\". Instead of keeping Jack in her hand, Carys opened the back of her diaper. \"Carys, what are you doing?!\" Jack yelled. \"Keeping you safe, silly. You're too small to be walking out here\" Carys giggled. She released her grip on Jack, and he nestled between the soft, peachy toddler's cheeks. Carys snapped her pull-up back and smiled as she walked back to her room. Fortunately for Jack, the squeeze in his younger cousin's behind was not too tight, rather loose and comfortable. That was completely ruined by the smell, though, which was absolutely rancid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they arrived in Carys' room, she pulled Jack out of her pull-up and set him on the ground in front of her. Jack took in a huge breath of fresh air and sighed. It was much nicer to be out of that disgusting pull-up. \"So, Jack, I think we could play together\" Carys offered. Jack was reluctant to oblige, but nervously asked \"Well, what did you have in mind?\". Carys paused for a moment before answering, \"I want to play Godzilla!\". Jack was dumbfounded. How did she know what Godzilla was, and what did she mean by it? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean, Carys?\" Jack asked. \"Since you are so little, I'll be a giant monster and chase you around!\" Carys excitedly announced. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoes Jack go along with this idea and play with her? Or does he decide that he needs to get back to his Aunt Lauren?</span></div></div>",

Oh no, what am I thinking, you can't talk with her without making eye to eye contact!\".The girl then sat up, positioned her knees on Jack's arms, and hovered her rather large jean-clad butt over Jack's face. \"That's better. Now what did you need, Jacko?\". Jack groaned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Come on, Izzy, this is serious. Knock it off and let me talk with you, face to face\". Izzy laughed. \"Oh, you want to talk with me face to face? Give me a sec\". Izzy then grabbed on to the side of her jeans and started to pull them down slightly, just enough for Jack to see her light pink panties. \"Izzy, stop!\". But she wouldn't. The more Jack told her to knock it off, the further she pulled down her jeans until they were below her waist and all that Jack could see was his younger sisters pale, panty covered derriere. Suddenly, Izzy's stomach grumbled. \"You hear that, Jack? I think my keister wants to have a word with you!\". With a lightning fast transition, Izzy dropped onto her older brother's face, leaving nothing uncovered and wedging his nose in her crack. Just as soon as she sat on his face, Izzy let out a long, loud fart and burst out laughing. When she did, Jack pushed her off of him and through the persistent cough he had, belittled her for what she did. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Now that your shenanigans are over, will you please listen to me?\" Jack pleaded. Izzy smiled, and hugged him. \"Yeah, yeah, no problem\". Jack rolled his eyes. \"Okay, since you wasted so much time torturing me, I'll just make this plain and simple so I can make dinner without wasting away from your noxious gas\". Izzy giggled. \"So Mom got me a shrink ray so I could get some extra credit in my science class, but it went off yesterday without intention, and I was stuck small for a little while and--\". Before Jack could finish, Izzy interrupted him. \"Oooh! It would be so much fun if you were small! Can we do that next?\". Jack shook his head. \"No, that is definitely not on the agenda. Anyways, like I was saying...\". From there, Jack proceeded to explain the whole situation, to which Izzy responded cheekily. \"Okay, if you insist on trying something like this, I'm okay with it\" Izzy winked. \"Izzy, please listen to me. If we do go through with this plan, you have to promise to be careful with me, okay? Without attention to detail, you could lose me, or worse yet, kill me\". Izzy nodded. \"Okie dokie, I understand. I'll talk with Lucy and see if she thinks she could be up to the task of doing this\". Before Jack could stop her, though, Izzy was out of the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Jack chatted with Lucy about the situation, who does he decide to tag along with for a day?</span></div></div>",

When both the girls came back upstairs, he told them what was going to happen, laying out the plan plain and simple to make sure they both understood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And Izzy,\" Jack told, \"please be careful with be. Don't be as playful as you normally are, that could bring us to other scenarios which might be really strange, okay?\". Izzy nodded and giggled. \"Yeah, yeah, I got it. Tomorrow is going to be a 'big' day for me for sure\". Both Izzy and Lucy were in hysterics. Jack just rolled his eyes, and decided it would be best to just go to dinner now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce he got downstairs, Jack noticed the dining room table was all set and ready to go, with his mom washing up in the kitchen. Soon after Jack came down, so did his sisters, and the whole family was then at the kitchen table, having dinner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom, you want to hear something cool?\" Izzy asked. \"Okay, honey, let's hear it\". Before Izzy could say anything, Jack pretended to cough then slammed his hand on the table and glared at Izzy. \"Are you okay, Jack?\" his mom questioned. \"Yeah, I'm fine, just got some broccoli going down the wrong side is all\". Izzy and Lucy snickered, but Jack didn't think it was funny. He knew what Izzy was going to share and he didn't think that his mom would approve of his idea. \"Anyways, what were you saying, Izzy?\" Carey asked. \"Oh, it wasn't anywhere near as interesting as that, I don't feel the need to share anymore\". The dinner went on relatively normally from there, Carey trying to make idle conversation with her kids, but nothing spectacular coming of hit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce dinner was finished, the kids went upstairs to get ready for bed. \"So Jack,\" Izzy inquired. \"how do you want to do this? Are you going to shrink and sleep with me, then go to school? Or are you going to shrink in the morning?\". \"That's a good question, Izzy. I think I'll...\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You're right, it would be much faster to leave if you just shrunk tonight, plus Mom probably won't know you did shrink\". She had a point, Jack hadn't thought about what his mom might do if she caught him shrinking. \"Good point. I'll go get the shrink ray then I'll be in your room\". Jack went to his room, grabbed the shrink ray, then entered Izzy's. There, she was all ready to go with her sweatpants and tank top. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ready to get this show on the road, Jack?\" Izzy chuckled. Jack sighed. \"As ready as I'll ever be, I suppose\" he glumly responded. Jack brought out the shrink ray, then hit the \"Switch on\" button. And just like that, Jack was back down to three inches once again, looking up to his know enormous sister. Jack was a little frightened, actually. When he was normal sized, he got an up close and personal view of his sister's biggest \"asset\", but now, he would imagine, it would be as if looking at a massive hot air balloon. Izzy reached down and scooped up her older, but tinier, brother and giggled. \"You're so cute when you're tiny\" she chuckled. \"Oh, we'll have so much fun keeping you safe from those other two girls. We have to do this more often!\". Jack shuddered. All of a sudden, Jack thought that he may have made a mistake in picking Izzy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Izzy, remember. This is only for one day, you must be gentle, and don't think of this as a game! It's strictly for protection reasons!\". Jack exclaimed. \"Oh, hush now Jack. Come on, let's get you tucked in\". Jack was a little confused. Wouldn't she have put out like a tissue box or something for him to sleep in? But reality hit soon enough as Izzy brought Jack up to her massive chest. \"You'll be nice and cozy in there, Jacko\" she giggled. \"Not to mention, safe. Plus, I might even enjoy it. I never thought having a 'little' brother to look after would be so much fun!\" Izzy thought out loud. Before Jack could respond, Izzy pushed aside her breasts and dropped Jack in between them. As he was struggling to climb out, she let go and the impact of the two mounds crashing into him ceased all of Jack's movements. As Izzy breathed and chuckled, Jack's body bounced a little, sending a little bit of his body further up, releasing some of the pressure and possibly creating an escape for him. Before Jack could capitalize, though, Izzy had already sent a finger down to push him into the depths of her cleavage, where he would be secure, with no way of escaping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There we go, all better!\" Izzy smiled. \"Goodnight Jacko!\". Jack groaned. \"Goodnight Izzy\". Izzy then laid down on her side, further smothering Jack between her boobs. Jack let out a heave, but quickly getting accustomed, and dozing off to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning came in no time at all, and it was time for Jack to go to school with his much bigger sister, Izzy. Jack was a little groggy, but overall well-rested. He was surprised he was able to survive in the expanse of his own sister's boobs for an entire night. He was then picked out of her rack and placed on the table next to the bed. \"Gooood morning, Jacko! I hope your stay was all that you thought it would crack up to be!\" Izzy laughed. Jack just shook his head. \"Just get ready for school, the sooner you can hide me, the better\". Izzy listened to him and changed clothes, from sweatpants and a tank top, to tight jeans and a tight T-Shirt. \"Alright, all ready. Time to go, Jacko!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere does Izzy place Jack while she goes down to eat breakfast?</span></div></div>",

I'll make sure to be on my desk for you to find me when you get up. When you do get up, come into my room and get me. For the time being, just put me in your pocket or something, so Mom thinks that I walked to school early. When we get to school, you can take me out for the class and I'll stay put, just so I can get a little air and to stretch. And, if you need it, I'll help you out with your work. Repeating that for the rest of your classes should take us to the end of the day, where I can grow back to normal and walk home with you. Does that sound good?\". Lucy nodded. \"Great, thanks Lucy! This should for sure get those two girls who saw me grow back to normal off of me\". Before Jack could leave and go to bed, though, Lucy grabbed him on the shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You owe me a couple of favors for this, okay, Jack?\". Jack rolled his eyes. \"Make it one and you got a deal\" he responded. Lucy shook her head. \"If it's only going to be one, then I'll get to play around with you a little bit, if I get bored\". This time, it was Jack's turn to shake his head. \"Then why should you get a favor? That deal sounds completely rigged\". Lucy shrugged. \"Then I guess I won't take you to school with me. Go talk to Izzy if you want to get those girls off your back\". Lucy started to walk away, but Jack blocked her path.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right, all right, I'm sorry. You got yourself one favor and if you get bored, you'll be able to mess around with me, okay?\" Jack offered. Lucy giggled. \"Sounds great, Jack. Thanks!\" Lucy hugged her older brother, and he chuckled. \"I'll see you in the morning. Goodnight\". With that, both kids went to bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorning time came around rather quickly.

He heads downstairs after formulating his plan, and has dinner with his family.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the night is rather uneventful, but then morning comes and Jack gets up a little earlier than normal and grabs his shrink ray. Making sure not to disturb his mom or siblings, Jack goes down to the living room and looks for his mom's purse. He spots it on the armrest of the couch, then sits on the couch and shrinks himself. He manages to climb up the armrest easy, and jumps into the purse. Since he woke up so early, Jack decides to take a little nap to regain some extra energy for the day ahead. Using a little dispenser of tissues as a pillow, it doesn't take long for Jack to drift off to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack is woken up by the swaying of the purse and its items within. He successfully sneaked into going wherever with his mom! There is no way that either Eiko or Mia will remember about the shrinking now that they won't see him. Suddenly, the purse it set down with a thud, and the sound of an engine starting rings through the air, making Jack all the more excited about how well his plan is working. He continues to wait for the new destination to arrive, and after maybe another twenty minutes, it does.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe purse is once again swaying as Carey picks it up and takes it with her into a store. A little while into her shopping spree, Carey drops her purse and the contents within, including Jack, spill out all across the aisle. Even though he's sitting out in the open, Carey doesn't she her tiny son and moves on before having the chance to take him with her. This left Jack in the middle of a supermarket aisle, with nothing but groceries surrounding him. Since he couldn't go back to his mom since she disappeared into the store, Jack went around looking for the nearest available person to help him. When he reached the end of the aisle he was on, Jack noticed a a few potential candidates to help him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Straight ahead, waiting in line, looked to be a mother similar in age to Carey. She had blonde hair, blue eyes, and sunglasses dangling above her head. With an equally impressive body as Carey, she must get plenty of attention. Noticing how she has no other people with her, Jack might be able to get her attention pretty easily.<br>\r\n   To the right of her was a teenage clerk who looked to be on break. She had straight black hair, brown eyes, and a nicely shaped body. Not necessarily large or petite, but medium. \"Is that Jessica's sister?\" Jack thought. \"She certainly looks a lot like her\".<br>\r\n   To the left of the blonde woman was a woman who looked to be in college. She had wavy brown hair, cute brown eyes, and freckles. She had a modest chest and a cute, but not large, butt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith these people as potential saviors, who does Jack approach?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">Characters:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack (main character): 16 years old, Jack is beginning his Junior year at Tahoma High School. He has an athletic build with dark brown hair and heterochromatic eyes (brown/blue combination). Given his condition, he\u2019s plenty popular with the girls, yet he doesn\u2019t have the ability to go for the girl he himself likes, Rachel. Jack\u2019s father is deployed in the military, so he doesn\u2019t see him much, but he has a caring mother in Carey, with two sisters, Isabella, who goes by Izzy, and Lucy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarey: 44 years old, Carey has maintained a very fit and curvaceous body. Despite her age, she still gets the occasional gawk by a male passerby with her curly brown hair and soft, brown eyes, accompanying her body well. She\u2019s loyal to Jack\u2019s father, despite him not being around very much, and is very caring towards her three children.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsabella (Izzy): 14 years old, her body has already matured very well and attracts boys from a variety of grades. Her long, flowing brown hair and blue eyes make an equally impressing match in comparison to her body, wooing many who get to know her even superficially. A bubbly personality, Izzy likes to tease her brother quite a bit, but nonetheless cares for him deeply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy: 12 years old, her body has not yet developed like her sister, but her looks are possibly even more impressive than her siblings\u2019. With long black hair and deep brown eyes, her looks accompany her mischievous personality very well. Similar to her sister, Lucy likes to have her fun with Jack, but also like Izzy, has a deep compassion and admiration for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel (Jack\u2019s crush): 16 years old, Rachel is also beginning her Junior year at THS, like Jack. Her hourglass shape makes many boys in and out of her grade go crazy, but she has her sights set on Jack. Rachel considers him a really close friend, but is keeping her true feelings for him secret. If he was in any trouble, Rachel would be the first to answer the call of duty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmi: 19 years old, Emi is Rachel\u2019s older sister. Even with her very curvaceous body, Emi doesn\u2019t seem to attract the right crowd for her liking. Although in college, she has seemed to take a liking to Jack, unbeknownst to him. Emi is a very opportune girl and would take advantage of any situation in her favor, especially if it involved Jack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBridgette: 17 years old, she is one of Jack's neighbors and one of his closest friends. Since they live so near to each other, they talk and hang out very often. Even though they're so close to one another, neither really feel that they should try and break into a relationship. Bridgette always is willing to protect Jack whenever necessary, regardless of what the situation may be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDerek: 16 years old, Derek is Jack\u2019s closest friend, aside from Bridgette. They have been friends ever since elementary school and have enjoyed hanging out a few weekends at a time for years. Derek has dirty blonde hair and likewise with Jack, an athletic build. He always comes to the aid of Jack whenever necessary and Jack does the same whenever Derek is in need.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEiko: 14 years old, Eiko is an exchange student from Japan, speaking fluent but broken English. Her exchange family lives across the street from Jack, allowing them to interact most days before, during and after school. She has relatively short black hair, dark brown eyes, and paleish skin. Despite her age, she has an extremely matured body, with DD cups and a butt to match. Ever since she arrived at Tahoma, Eiko has grown extremely attached to Jack and wants to be around him whenever possible, sometimes too much for Jack\u2019s liking. If a situation ever arose where Jack would be put in a position of inferiority, Eiko would immediately take advantage of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrittany: 15 years old, Brittany is Eiko\u2019s exchange host. Her petite figure doesn\u2019t bring the attention of many, but she doesn\u2019t mind much. She is of Asian descent, with longish black hair, tanned skin, and dark brown eyes. Her happy-go-lucky attitude attracts her many friends, and that\u2019s enough for her. In terms of her relations with Jack, she\u2019s fond of him, especially since they often walk to school or ride the bus together since they live in such close proximity. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMia: 18 years old, Mia has finished growing into her body, and her Latina background certainly does her many favors. Even though she\u2019s a grade ahead of Jack, she shares many of the same elective classes as him, and as such, has gotten to know him pretty well. A very playful spirit, Mia always likes to tease Jack, especially with her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrish: 17 years old, Trish is the traditional popular, cheerleader student. She has dirty blonde hair and a build that many boys, regardless of grade, drool over. She shares a few classes with Jack, but doesn't normally talk with him. Her thoughts about Jack are unknown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica: 15 years old, Jessica is closer to being a goth than about anyone Jack knows. She's not full out goth with black everything, but she likes to wear stockings and fairly dark makeup, which actually compliments her dark eyes and black hair very well. Under the darkish posterior, there is a very possessive, playful and mischievous spirit. Even though they don't talk all the time, Jessica really enjoys being around Jack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</td>",
