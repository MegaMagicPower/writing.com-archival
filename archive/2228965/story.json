            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You drive along a winding mountainside road, admiring the magnificent view of the Canadian wilderness mixed with the beautiful sunset. You had two weeks off from work for vacation, and you were determined to make the most of every moment of it. You had asked some locals a few towns back if there were any good places to stay in the area. They seemed hesitant to tell you, but they informed you of a place called The Pinebrook Hotel about twenty miles from there. You asked them for directions, but they refused to say anymore, telling you the place was cursed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou brushed it off as a local superstition, as you didn't believe in such things. You eventually managed to get directions from the bartender of a local tavern, but even he warned you not to go, saying if you came out you would be completely mad! Again, you disregard his warning and head for the hotel. You've been driving for a couple hours, and your GPS isn't saying that you're getting any closer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore confused than frustrated, you keep driving until finally you see a grand, luxurious looking hotel, college with a huge swimming pool and all the stuff you would expect a luxury resort to have. After parking your car and unloading your luggage, you enter the main lobby and are stunned by what you see. The place is lavishly decorated, complete with an enormous crystal chandelier hanging from the ceiling. But that's not what stuns you...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's the other guests!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou see a family of humanoid cats walking across the lobby, a werewolf at the bar, and Teddy Roosevelt chatting with George Washington over in the corner, just to name a few things! You rub your eyes to make sure you're not hallucinating. Sure enough, they're all still there. You figure they must be having some kind of convention, and it's all just people in costumes. You approach the front desk, where a woman with red skin and horns is managing the check ins. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome to the Pinebrook Hotel.\" She says \"How long will you be staying with us?\" \"Two weeks.\" You reply, and she types at her computer for a bit before handing you your room key. \"Frank!\" She calls, and you turn to see what could only be described as Frankenstein's monster in a bellhop outfit. \"Please escort him to his room and carry his bags. \" Frank grunts in response before picking up your luggage and leading you to the elevator. On the way there, you pass Marilyn Monroe and Elvis. Quite detailed costumes, you think, even the staff is dressed up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you reach your room, you see a humanoid cow woman in a maid's outfit exiting it. \"Oh, hi there!\" She says cheerfully \"I hope you find your room satisfactory, I just made sure everything is perfectly clean for ya!\" As she steps aside to allow you in, you see that the room is indeed in pristine condition. Frank sets your bags on your bed before giving you a little tip of his hat and leaving. After the long drive here, you are absolutely beat, and  collapse on the bed for a nap. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater on...</span></div></div>",

You have been dreaming of people removing ludicrous costumes only to have more ludicrous ones beneath. You are almost glad to be awoken.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stumble to the door and open it without really thinking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI am sorry, Moo-nsieur.\u201d You step back. It is that humanoid cow-woman. What you had assumed was some bizarre costume seems very convincing this close up, especially the way the mouth moves when she speaks and the way she blinks and the way her ears twitch and her nostrils flare and the fact her hands with fingers each of which seem to end in small hooves move so freely\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMoo-nsieur?\u201d she asks. You stumble backwards and she follows you inside, closing the door behind her. \u201cAre you okay? Should I call the medical staff?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026 yeah, no\u2026 I don\u2019t think\u2026 What are you?\u201d The words come out before you can stop them, and your blunt rudeness makes the house-maid stop in her tracks, hands on her wide hips, tail swishing angrily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI am a worker here at the Pinebrook,\u201d she states angrily. \u201cYour phone is off the hook, and you have a message.\u201d She hands you a card. You take it, glancing at the phone. She\u2019s right; you must have dislodged it before going to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrying hard to ignore her accusing stare, you read it: You are cordially invited to dinner this evening with Dr Acula in penthouse apartment 1.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho is Dr Acula?\u201d you ask, glad to change the subject.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe is one of the investors whose money made this hotel possible,\u201d she replies curtly. However, she makes no attempt to move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou understand and drop your eyes. \u201cI apologise,\u201d you say. \u201cI was out of line.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe walks up to you and places a hand on your shoulder, then leans against you. \u201cI can stay a little longer if you would like,\u201d she whispers. She shifts her body and you feel her chest rubbing against your arm. \u201cSix in there,\u201d she says. \u201cNo waiting.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou resist the temptation to scream and throw yourself out the window. \u201cSorry,\u201d you say with a forced smile. \u201cI am taken.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you change your mind,\u201d she whispers and walks to the door with an exaggerated swing of her hips, her tail sticking up a little. Her tail. Her real tail. With a final glance over her shoulder, she leaves you alone. Real. She is a real cow-woman. What\u2026?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo. You must be imagining things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sit down on the edge of the bed and stare at the card in your hand. You don\u2019t have long to make up your mind whether you are going to attend or not; it is certainly almost time for the evening meal and you are feeling rather peckish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, you decide to\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You are unsure if exactly what to do, so you grab a brochure that is sitting beside the room service phone. The first thing you see is a picture of a pool. No-one is in it, but it\u2019s a swimming pool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerfect. You could do with a dip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou dress in your bathing costume, grab a towel and go outside to the glorious late afternoon air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stop short as you exit through the doors. Marilyn Monroe is there again, this time sun-bathing on a towel and wearing as little as possible without being classified naked. You hear a twang and look up in time to see Tarzan execute an Olympic level dive into the clean waters beneath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are still amazed at the detail of these costumes as you wander along to the first empty deck-side lounger you find. You drop your towel onto it. It forms the shape of a person. \u201cHey!\u201d growls an angry voice from underneath it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry,\u201d you say as you lift it. There\u2019s no-one there. You reach a hand out. You feel something there, but\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you mind?\u201d that voice says again, and your hand is slapped away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou open your mouth to say something else, but a shadow falls over you. You look up as a large man swoops out of the sky, his white eagle wings folding across his back as he lands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou just stare at this new arrival, a gaze he returns intensely. \u201cPlease leave Mr Griffin alone,\u201d he says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut there\u2019s no-one\u2026\u201d you start, then stop as a bottle of suntan lotion is lifted. A bit is squirted out and then it appears to cover a face before fading as it is rubbed in. \u201cMr Griffin?\u201d you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes?\u201d the voice growls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry,\u201d you mutter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s okay.\u201d You hear the deck-side lounger creak and now you notice an indentation in it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe winged man gently takes your elbow and guides you towards another lounger. \u201cThe Invisible Man has been a regular guest for years,\u201d he explains. \u201cPlease do not upset him.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry,\u201d you repeat. Your mind is reeling. Costumes? Invisible? Flying? Cows? You had the distinct impression that Pinebrook Hotel was a lot more than it seemed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou need a swim. That\u2019s what\u2019ll help. You drop your towel on the lounger indicated by the winged man, then go across to the water. It all looks fine. Tarzan is back on the diving board and the Creature from the Black Lagoon is floating on the opposite side of the pool, and you can see no-one else. You jump in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe water feels soft and bouncy and you are lifted up high.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey!\u201d yells the winged man, who you realise must be the life-guard. \u201cWhat have we told you about annoying paying guests?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look at him but realise he is not talking to you. He is talking to the middle of the tentacled water thing that is currently holding you aloft. You hear a blurbled response. \u201cWell, put him down or I will get Merlin to come out here and dispel you. Simple.\u201d You are lowered to the water and everything calms down. \u201cSorry about that,\u201d the winged man says. \u201cHe likes to show off. But water elementals are remarkably good at keeping the pool clean.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stare at him. This is getting weirder.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">The Pinebrook Hotel is like no other vacation destination on Earth. Not because it has anything that you wouldn't expect it to have, but because of it's staff and clientele. See, nobody is exactly sure where the hotel even came from. It doesn't appear on any maps, nobody has seen any brochures for it, and nobody remembers ever hearing of it's construction. It's as if it just appeared out of nowhere! But that's not the strangest thing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThose who have actually been to the hotel, are usually labled as insane when they leave, because of people claiming to have seen things such as real live monsters, humanoid animals and long dead historical figures and celebrities. As a result, the general consensus is that the place is cursed and most ordinary tourists avoid the place like the plague. But here's the craziest part: Those claims of monsters, anthros and famous dead people? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey're all true!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRules<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. Feel free to add your own guests to the story. Be they mythical creature, furry, celebrity or fictional character. Plus anything in between!<br>\r\n2. No killing characters.<br>\r\n3. I may add or change rules as I see fit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEnjoy!</td>",
