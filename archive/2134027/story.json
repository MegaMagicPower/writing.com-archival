If you wish to write in this story I have a few rules for you to follow, if you're just reading then these won't bother you but it might be worth reading if you do decide to add to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. No Sex-I have rated this story 13+, meaning that sex can be referred to but no sex scenes are allowed, also remember that most of the characters are teenagers. So please even keep the insinuated sex to a minimum and preferably only between adult characters. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. Don't kill off characters- Ok, so in all hero stories character are dying and being resurrected every three issues so you can have characters die but don't finish a story at them dying, allow people to continue the story and resurrect the character later on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. Follow the 13+ rules- There are a few rules that need to be put in place to keep this story 13+ rating.

According to the owner of the orphanage he grew up in Austin was left at the doorstep of the orphanage when he was a baby with nothing but a note that had his name on it. For many years Austin accepted that he would never know his true parents however eventually he did start wondering about them, why would they leave him? Were they still alive? Would he ever be able to find them? It made Austin feel so useless that he couldn\u2019t answer any of those questions. While growing up at the orphanage he was often bullied by the older kids and tried avoiding most contact with them by hiding in the orphanage library reading books. He loved reading comics and stories about amazing superheroes that could save the world and protect people, everyone loved them and he wanted to be just like those superheroes, obviously thought that was impossible since superheroes don\u2019t really exist. That was what he thought however at about the age of fourteen Austin was reading his superhero comics as usual when he heard a faint whisper calling his name, curious he followed the sound and found that it was coming from a book. Hesitantly he grabbed the book and looked at the cover, it had an odd writing that Austin had never seen before in his life. And that was the strange part; he had never seen the type of writing on the book in his life however he could read it perfectly. The book read \u2018Spell Book\u2019 and the bottom of the book had in smaller writing \u2018please open\u2019. Being the stupid little kid with no sense of caution as Austin was he opened the book, releasing a yellow aura that his body absorbed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn\u2019t until about a week later that Austin learnt of his new powers. While he had grown up quite a bit the older kids still loved to give him a hard time. While trying to defend himself from one of the bullied Austin formed a yellow energy shield between him and the offender. Austin didn\u2019t believe it was him until the shield dropped and the surprised bully charged at him, resulting in Austin sending a beam of energy towards the bully and propelling him backwards. Impressed by his new abilities Austin read the spell book and started practicing some of the magic inside it, he soon learnt that he could summon the book at any time by using his magic energy to materialize it. After he was confident with his abilities in magic he began to protect his area from crime under his new guise as Wizard. As soon as he was legally allowed to live by himself he moved out of the orphanage to live in Silver City. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout Him/Her<br>\r\nPersonality: Austin likes to think of himself as an open book, he doesn\u2019t try hiding anything about his personality, which consists of several major qualities, but more let\u2019s people see different parts of his personality depending on how much he knows them. By default Austin acts cheerful and friendly when first meeting anyone, he is optimistic and aims to please as to make a good impression. Once he\u2019s more comfortable with the person he becomes more laid back and easy going around them. He likes to tell bad jokes and puns around his friends and on occasion will randomly start singing some of his favourite songs. Only his best friends get to see his quirky and stubborn sides as he like proving his point or dancing around while listening to music depending on the occasion. Wizard is as much a wisecrack as Austin is however he also can and will act serious if he needs to. He likes to talk during his fights in order to distract his enemies, sometimes psycho-analyzing them to get on their nerves. He\u2019s preferred method of battling is to attack from afar however he is still accustomed to close ranged combat.<br>\r\nOccupation: Barista at Quick Bean<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLikes: <br>\r\n-Mystery<br>\r\n-Upbeat Music<br>\r\n-Fancy Dress Parties<br>\r\n-Dancing<br>\r\n-Mythology<br>\r\nDislikes: <br>\r\n-Obnoxious people<br>\r\n-Silence<br>\r\n-Stupidity<br>\r\n-\u2018Fake\u2019 Magic (Requiring a wand)<br>\r\nHobbies: Writing Mystery Stories<br>\r\nFears: Having his power used to hurt people.
