They were really into it, not noticing much else. It was something about pies. It made him hungry. Not really wanting to say anything, he retreated into his own personal thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat John didn't know was that Lily was watching him, and had been for a while. She had an annoyed look on her face. Sometimes she forced a giggle, but Lily never actually laughed. In frustration, she removed the long, blonde hair coming down to his feet and replaced it with his normal hai-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWait, what?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, in any case, John was back to normal, though he hadn't noticed anything OUT of the ordinary.He just kept walking. Lily looked at him, nodded, and poked him in the back to talk to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" said John.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"John, there is something I have to give you. You probably won't believe it at first, but neither did I,\" whispered Lily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why are you talking so softly? Is the gift so important that my friends can't hear about it?\" replied John. He decided to keep his own voice soft too, just in case.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, yes. In fact, I almost forgot: I have to do something when I transfer this! Hold my hand.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hu-\" was all John could get out before she yanked his hand with her right. Holding up her left hand. Lily bowed her head and concentrated, willing all her energy into it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn started looking around to see why his friends hadn't noticed this yet, and realized that everyone was frozen in time. He decided against asking Lily, seeing as whatever the hell she was [b]doing[/b], it seemed important. Plus he was pretty scared anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy now, a transparent ball of... something was in Lily's hand. Still holding John's, she raised it up to her own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Take it, quickly! Before I lose focus!\" Lily urged. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot exactly sure what to do, John just closed his hand around the ball of something. He instantly felt a surge of power flow through his body, startling and almost knocking him to the ground. Luckily, the transfer had already finished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Done!\" exclaimed Lily, as she recovered from doing a difficult task<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okayyyy... so what WAS that? And why is everyone frozen in time?\" John shouted, confused.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Knowing that John would want to know what the hell was going on, Lily launched into her sorta-prepared explanation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, to answer your first question,\" began Lily. John got comfortable, since he knew from her tone of voice that this would take a while. \"John, it's not that long! Basically, when I was about 9, my grandfather transferred the power to me to swap or morph body traits or parts. That was just before he died, actually. So I had fun with it, just changing people. It went on for a few years, then I started to get bored with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I spent the next few years changing everyone back, since I didn't know if the next person to receive the power would actually care enough to do so-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd care!\" John interrupted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That doesn't matter right now. So as I said, I was changing everyone back. Well, at least the people in my general area. And then last year, I found out we were moving. I thought, 'Maybe this is what I need! New people!' It didn't really work. I was just as bored.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, in the end, I just decided to give my power to someone else. Which would be you. And that's what I did just then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... see,\" John eventually said. It was either a very well thought out story, or the truth. The crazy truth. Which would somehow make more sense. After all, what else could that ball of something be?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I think I believe you... no matter how weird and physics-defying that is,\" John said, causing Lily to light up at the fact that he actually believed her. \"But why is everyone frozen still?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, that comes with the power. You can only do it when you're transferring the power to someone else, though. By the way, I think you should unfreeze everyone,\" stated Lily, matter-of-factly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right,\" muttered John. How exactly do you unfreeze time anyway? It didn't even make sense to freeze it, so maybe it made more sense to unfree-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There you go! Good job,\" exclaimed Lily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? I didn't-\" was all John could get out before he noticed everything started to move. Quite quickly, the world was back to normal. Tina and Tom were still talking about pies. That didn't interest him anymore. For now, he wanted to test out his new power.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomehow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhh, Lily, how exactly do I swap body parts?\" John inquired, hoping it wasn't going to be really complicated like the transfer was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, it's simple. All you have to do is think about it, concentrate a bit, and poof! It's done. A little warning though: No one else will really react to the swaps and changes you make. They'll think that it's normal and that the person was always like that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Even you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, I don't know. Why don't you try it out? That way we can both learn something new,\" Lily finished the conversation, and waited for John to do something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn knew that whatever change he made would have to be obvious to both of them. However, he didn't want to do a change too drastic. Both of them had black hair, so he settled for changing that. For some reason, the idea of making their hair long, blond and coming down to their feet came to him. Not knowing why, or really caring, he started to concentrate.</span></div></div>",

At that moment, John got an idea, well two acually. One was to see how drastic the changes could be without anyone noticing, and if he could change names. The first thing he did was focused on his best friend, and gave him very girly, and perky b-cup boobs. He then focused on his name, and thought of the name Jake. As a child, he always liked that name. As nothing happened, he wondered if he couldnt do it. When he turned around, Lily was gone, and time unfroze. \"Jake! Come over and talk!\" Tina yelled, next to his best friend with boobs, and what looked like a bra strap underneath his shirt. \"Oh yeah, this is gonna be fun.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Walking down the road with your group of John, Tom, Lily and yourself, you were rather loudly chatting with Tom about pies. You didn't really remember how you got to this topic, but right now Tom was clearly against pies. And you wouldn't have that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look Tina, I just. Don't Like Pie. Can't you accept that?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NEVER! All humans like pie deep down. It's a fact of life.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...so does that mean I'm not human?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm... maybe. But you're human enough!\" you sputtered, definitely not expecting him to come to that conclusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I'm NOT human?\" he responds with annoyance. Getting tired of this argument, you decide to end it quickly: a job reserved for only your second mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...I don't remember you having two mouths until then, but... I'll just go along with this. <font class=\"size1\" style=\"\">Is that even NORMAL? I mean, really-</font> \t<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look Tom. You're human and no amount of pie hating can change that. But I will force you to admit that you like pie, right here, right now,\" you respond, saying the last part with both mouths and thus, two identical voices.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine. I like pie. Happy now?\" Tom reluctantly says. You smile twice. \"Very.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA tap on your head alerts you, and you turn around. \"Yes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I talk to you in private?\" says Lily. You wondered why she wanted to talk to you. Lily was a strange person at school, not because of her personality, but because everyone seemed to think that strange things happened around her. Yet oddly (or rather, not oddly) enough, no one had seen these things, so these things stayed as rumors just circulating the black haired girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure,\" and you motion her over to a nearby bench. As you do, you feel a strange sensation around your face, but think nothing of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay. What is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I've been trying to find someone right for this gift, and I've chosen you,\" chatted Lily nervously, unnoticed by your eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You chose me? Yay!\" you said quickly, getting excited. If she took a long time to choose someone, then the gift <b>has</b> to be good, right? Although, why would she choose you anyway? Eh, who cares?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will warn you, this is no ordinary gift. Now, hold my hand,\" whispered Lily. You decided to go along with it... for now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were standing face to face with each other when she held up her left hand, and in that moment, time stood still. You looked at her, her deep green eyes, long, silky smooth black hair and rather average B cup breasts sticking out at you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNone of which appealed to you, since Lily was female. But as you looked around her, the strange energy ball-like thing growing in her hand jumped out at you, while you were wondering how you couldn't have noticed that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut as you keep looking, it dawns on you that time actually HAD stood still. John and Tom were frozen, not moving. A bird was stopped mid-flight, wings outstretched, but not falling at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Quick! Take it!\" yelled Lily, shaking you out of your thoughts. When you looked back at her, her left arm was outstretched in your direction, weird thingy floating on her hand. Without thinking, you take it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rather extreme transfer of power between the two of you nearly sent Lily to the ground, and actually DID send you to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was that all about?\" you exclaim, picking yourself up. \"Why is everything-\" You cut off your sentence as you notice your surroundings, and indeed, they were moving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhh... What was with that energy thingy? Is it supposed to be my gift?\" you wonder out loud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, it is,\" responds Lily, an uncharacteristic serious look on her face. Seeing your confusion, she motions for you to rejoin her. \"Sit down. This could take a while. And believe me when I say this is all true.\"</span></div></div>",

That was just before he died, actually. So I had fun with it, just changing people. It went on for a few years, then I started to get bored with it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh huh,\" you nod, dumbfounded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I spent the next few years changing everyone back, since I didn't know if the next person to receive the power would actually care enough to do so. And I know you are Tina, so don't interrupt,\" she adds quickly, causing your retort to die in your throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I was resetting things back to normal, at least in my general area. Anyone overseas, well, the fun thing about this power is that reality seems to shift so that whatever change I do makes people think that's normal. So as long as no one noticed them, I wouldn't feel too bad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyway, last year, I found out we were moving. I thought, 'Maybe this is what I need! New people!' It didn't really work. I was just as bored.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, in the end, I just decided to give my power to someone else. Which would be you. And that's what I did just then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA brief silence follows as you digest this information. It was pretty crazy -VERY crazy- but it would take something crazy to explained what just happened anyway. Still...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And this is all true,\" you say eventually, deciding to play along for now. \"How do I do it? And what about the time freezy thingy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, it's simple! Just think of the change you want to make on the person -or people, I should add- that you want to affect, and presto! They're changed,\" Lily replies enthusiastically. \"As for the time freeze, that comes with the power. You can only do it when you're transferring the power to someone else, though. I guess it's so that no one else notices.\"  \"Oh, and another thing: making other people know of your changes costs extra,\" she adds on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right,\" you respond, drawing out the word after that... interesting explanation. Then the last part of what Lily said hits. \"What? You said that-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know I said other people don't find anything unusual about the changes. However, you can make certain people aware by concentrating a little harder when you make the edit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you notice the changes?\" you inquire. \"After all, you did have the power until a few minutes ago.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd assume, but I'm not sure. Why don't we find out?\" she proposes, standing up. \"It's a perfect way to test both my noticing ability and for you to test out your new power!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess,\" you say, not really sure how to act. You look around the area for ideas, and get one from Tom, who was rather loudly bragging to John about his superior penis size compared to John's. John himself seemed to really not want to be part of the conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I'm going to make you outclassed, Tom. By a woman.</i> you think, stressing the last part in your mind's voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Well, assuming this works.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nClearing your head so you can concentrate, you copy his dick in your mind, give it to Lily, and lastly, enlarge it by about twice its size. You could clearly see the oversized package in her tight jeans, and start to get excited that she was telling the truth and that you do have a body-altering power.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLily...</span></div></div>",

Suddenly, Tom noticed that everyone had seemed to freeze in time except for himself and Lily. \"What the--\" \"Tom, I want to give you something\" said Lily. \"O.K what is it\" asked Tom. \"When I was about 4 my grandpa gave me this power, He said that i could morph people how I wanted to, but eventually it got boring changing people, so i spent the next few years changing everyone back, then, about a few years ago i found out that we were moving so I thought \"maybe this is what i need, new people\" But it still wasn't the same, so I decided to just give my power to someone else and I chose you\" said Lily, as a light came out of her and into Tom, a second after that, time unfroze. </span></div></div>",

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">For some reason, you have gained the ability to swap or edit the physical features of anyone nearby. The strange part about it is that everyone else doesn't react, and thinks the person was always like that. You can make others notice, but it takes some effort and concentration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharacters (listed in order of importance):<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn Reese<br>\r\n19, kinda average, plays video games, a little shy. Likes pointing out unnecessary things that are. Like that. Main character of male path.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTina Reese<br>\r\n19, John's twin sister, very outgoing. Kinda random. Close bond with her brother. Main character of female path.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom Wiel<br>\r\n20, John's best friend for a long time, talented in both sports and computers, but not much else. Is confident and willing to try new things. Except cheese. He hates cheese.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah Mitchell<br>\r\n18, John's girlfriend and Tina's best friend, moved in two years ago and has developed a close bond with them. A smart student, but especially skilled in art. She loves drawing, you see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLily Eni<br>\r\n18, a new girl who arrived 3 months ago yet has developed a friendship quite quickly with the main cast. The original holder of the power (as far as this story goes), she passed it on to John/Tina because she got bored with it. At least, that's what she says. Otherwise, average teen girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHenry Reese<br>\r\n44, father of the family. Can seem intimidating, but is rather nice overall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAngie Reese<br>\r\n39, mother of the family. Odd sense of humor and far too friendly to most people.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome rules:<br>\r\nUse good grammar and spelling. I'll probably edit out minor mistakes, but if your chapter is like \"an tne he sad ;oh jmister im sory,\" I will delete it.<br>\r\nNo killing the main characters.<br>\r\nNo incest or any gay sex of any kind. Anything else is fine.<br>\r\nIf you must have choice chapters, put something to read in there.<br>\r\nKeep the POV consistent., aka: 3rd person for John and 2nd person for Tina. (I know that's inconsistent, but I can't be bothered to edit it now.</td>",
