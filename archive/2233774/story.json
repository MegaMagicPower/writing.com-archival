            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cGuess you picked the wrong sidewalk to head home on, huh?\u201d You smirked, clenching your fist tighter. The tiny you\u2019d snatched off the ground fought fruitlessly, banging his miniscule fists into your thumb. You could barely feel him, but damn if it wasn\u2019t hilarious watching him struggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSCREW YOU!\u201d The tiny screamed up at you, bug-sized face full of hatred. Your smirk only grew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cListen, man, I had a pretty crappy day at work.\u201d You sighed theatrically. \u201cA full shift on my feet taking orders kills a girl. Your only purpose here is to cheer me up, okay?\u201d You flicked his head with your free hand, watching with enjoyment as his squishy face dented inward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a second, the tiny\u2019s head reformed, enabling him to talk again. \u201cYou\u2019re sick! I\u2019m a person, just like you! Why are you doing this?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou scoffed. \u201cA person? Uh\u2026definitely not. You\u2019re a bug, at best, and a worthless piece of trash freak at worst. You\u2019re like an insignificant little speck.\u201d Your grin widened. \u201cFrankly, from where I\u2019m standing, I\u2019d say that tinies like you deserve to live a cruel life. Little one-inch insect.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tiny, remarkable, looked even angrier than before. Usually they broke by now, and frequently they begged you to let them go. However, this tiny did the absolute most unexpected thing. In a final fit of rage, he raked his fingernails into your skin, cutting open a gash on your thumb. The wound was very small, but it stung like hell, and started leaking blood instantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOW! You freak!\u201d You cried out, crushing the tiny up into a ball in your fist. Before you could finish squishing him, the struggling tiny spat derisively at you, a glob of his saliva splattering into your open wound. You didn\u2019t notice though, too preoccupied with reducing him to a crumbled blob in your fist. Steam was practically billowing out of your ears; you were so mad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a few deep breaths to calm yourself down, you steadied your rising aggression levels. You wiped the blood from the cut on your thumb, and then gently licked the wound, trying to stop any further bleeding. No way you\u2019d give the tiny any satisfaction of victory by putting a band-aid on it. Speaking of\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking over to your car, you paused by the closest sewer grate and callously flicked the tiny inside, watching as he fell into the dank darkness of the sewer line down below. You\u2019d hoped for a more creative plan with that tiny, but you were way too fed up with him by now. All you wanted to do was just get home, grab some things, and head over to one of your friend\u2019s houses for a party tonight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you drove back home, your mind kept thinking about the crappy day you\u2019d had. Honestly, it wasn\u2019t all that different from most days. Lengthy shifts at the local diner, \u201cDining Delights\u201d, took up all your time from Monday to Friday. At least it was the weekend now. Your best friend, Yumi Hada, had looked cute in her waitress uniform, which was a plus, but she always looked cute. You\u2019d never admit that you had a crush on her to her face though, paralyzed with fear that it would ruin your friendship with her if she didn't feel the same way about you...and, in your mind, why would she?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHonestly, the more you thought about it, the more you felt your life had fallen into an inescapable rut of disappointment since graduating from Owenton High School. You\u2019d hoped to just get a job for some extra cash until your vlog took off, but so far you weren\u2019t averaging more than twenty or so viewers. As such, you\u2019d been stuck working as a waitress for nearly two full years with no end in sight. This made you a bit jaded and self-conscious. Add it to the mental list of things you were self-conscious about then: Your below-average height, slim and less-pronounced curves, and dead-end job.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt least tinies always made things better (this particular night an exception to that). You weren\u2019t sure when your distaste of tinies began. Maybe it was when you kept playing with them like little dolls in elementary school. Maybe it was when a tiny kept calling your terrible names until you put him in his place in middle school. Maybe it was when you found how fun it was to watch others unknowingly torment tinies thanks to your meddling, a technique you developed in high school. Regardless, the cruel treatment of tinies was practically your pastime.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPulling into your driveway, your car again made weird sputtering noises, a sure sign it needed a visit to the car shop soon. Groaning, you got out of the car and headed into your house, which was a standard but sizable two-floor house. The bottom floor contained the living room, kitchen, washroom, and a bathroom, while the second floor had five bedrooms and a second bathroom. Your backyard had a small inground pool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn\u2019t make it two steps into the house before you were pulled into a suffocatingly tight embrace and showered with kisses. Two things clued you off that it was your mother doing this to you. One, only she\u2019d be this overbearing with her affection. Two, it was impossible not to notice the two massive breasts squishing around your head, a consequence of the height disparity between you and her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright, mom, I get it.\u201d You said, pushing away from her, while not completing fighting down a smile. It WAS nice to be loved, after all.<br>\r\nPriscilla Hayes smiled brilliantly at you. \u201cOh, but I could just keep loving you forever, Alex! You\u2019re gone from home so long during the work week!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shrugged. \u201cIt is what it is. I\u2019m about to leave again, actually. A party down the street.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mom pouted in an over-exaggerated manner. At 44 years old, she really could still act like a child. Even still, she was the greatest mom that anyone could ever ask for. She was doting, sure, but her over-affectionate nature meant you were always well taken care of. It was also impossible to not take note of your mother\u2019s extremely curvaceous, hourglass figure. How she maintained it at her age was beyond you, but it was crazy impressive. You only wish she\u2019d passed it onto you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom behind you, a voice cried out. \u201cHey, what\u2019s up, Alex?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turned to face the voice, only to have your head slammed into another sizable chest, this was considerably more toned but no less big. You pushed back again, glaring up at the towering figure of your older sister, August.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStop doing that, August. It\u2019s annoying.\u201d You sighed, but your words only prompted a chuckle from your older sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan\u2019t get through a day without being called \u2018annoying\u2019 sis! It\u2019s my favorite part of the day!\u201d August joked, laughing melodically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAugust was the spitting image of your mother when she was in her youth, give or take a little bit. 26 years old, and August was easily the tallest Hayes woman, standing at 6\u20190\u201d. She was almost indescribably beautiful, her deeply tanned skin and auburn hair immaculate. Her curves were only a little smaller than your mother\u2019s, but were also leaner and more toned, a sign of August\u2019s lifestyle. She loved to exercise, and was also the gym teacher and swim coach at Owenton High School.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlipping out from behind August, one final girl grinned at you happily. You smiled back at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPenny! How\u2019d your first week of senior year go?\u201d You asked her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAugust scoffed, feigning offense. \"MY week of teaching was good too! Why didn't you ask me, huh?\" She grinned teasingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPenny smiled at her older sister's antics, then tilted her head. \u201cNot so bad. Super easy, but I\u2019m still finding ways to enjoy it.\u201d She looked at you knowingly, then discreetly flicked her gaze to August\u2019s firm bubble butt. Sure enough, when August turned around a second later, you could just barely spot the faint outline of a mangled tiny guy smeared onto August\u2019s left butt cheek, glued to her yoga pants. He looked like he\u2019d been through a lot all day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAugust herself clearly had no clue, as she sauntered from the room and plopped back onto the couch. This was par for the course for August, who was as scatterbrained and unobservant as they came. She was joined a moment later by Priscilla. Only Penny lingered by your side, fighting to keep down a smug grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPenelope, your younger sister, was 18 years old, and one of your greatest (and only) friends besides Yumi. You\u2019d grown up as her role model and mentor, and now she practically idolized you. Sometimes it bothered you that she was 5\u20199\u201d (hence four inches taller than you), and also that she was noticeably more developed in the bodily maturity department, all while two years your junior. Still, you loved her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou\u2019d also passed onto her your hatred of tinies, and she\u2019d taken it to heart even more than you had. To be totally frank, sometimes you felt that Penny as a little TOO obsessed with torturing tinies. You certainly had fun doing it, but Penny seemed to enjoy it more personally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe\u2019s not the only one I got today, sis.\u201d Penny whispered in your ear. \u201cUntil August showers later tonight, there should still be a tiny gunked up between her toes.\u201d The faintest of blushes dappled Penny\u2019s cheeks. \u201cBig sis is such a great help in putting those bugs in their place, isn\u2019t she?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor some reason, right as Penny said that, the cut on your thumb burned a little, and you felt nauseous. Putting a hand to your head, you mumbled a half-hearted reply. \u201cUh huh, yeah.\u201d</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Penny looked disappointed in that response, but recovered quickly, reverting to normal conversation. \u201cUm, but anyway\u2026I\u2019m one of the lead members of the Owenton girls\u2019 soccer team this year. I\u2019ve also been cast as the evil queen in our school\u2019s presentation of \u2018Snow White\u2019. That\u2019s exciting, I guess!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded vaguely. \u201cSure is\u2026ugh.\u201d You wavered a bit, Penny instinctively reaching out to steady you before you caught yourself. \u201cListen, I\u2019ve got a headache. It\u2019s not you, though. I just need some meds before I head out.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPenny nodded, grabbed a few different bottles from the medicine cabinet and handed them to you, and then scurried back off into the living room. She rejoined your older sister and mother. Apparently, they\u2019d been watching a movie together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou chugged a few different pills with a glass of water, mentally begging your body to get over itself and feel better, and then headed upstairs. Just about at random, you threw shirts, pants, and underwear into a bag to take over for the party and inevitable sleepover. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were an independent girl, and your mother knew better than to try and keep you tied down at all times. Owenton wasn\u2019t a massive town, so your mother gave you just about total reign over the place. You\u2019d spent entire weeks away from home chilling at Yumi\u2019s place with barely a word to your family. It just felt good to get away from time to time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrudging downstairs, you walked into the living room to announce your departure. \u201cI\u2019m heading out now. For the party. Could be sleeping over for the next few days.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAugust and Penny nodded understandingly, but Priscilla frowned. \u201cOh, honey. Are you sure? What about\u2013\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou rolled your eyes, not entirely sure what your mom was caught up on. \u201cI\u2019ll be fine, mom. Love you. Bye.\u201d Without waiting, you spun on your heels and pushed through the front door, heading back outside to your car. Fighting through your pounding headache, you drove a few blocks down the road before life decided to give you a figurative middle finger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour car\u2019s engine sputtered and died, stopping your car dead in its tracks in the middle of the road. Too exhausted to even swear or punch the car, you simply dialed up Angie, Owenton\u2019s most renowned mechanic. Informing her of the issue, she promised she\u2019d be over in a jiffy to tow your car to her shop. She was a family friend, and you trusted her, so you let her know that you\u2019d be walking home in the meantime. Screw the party.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe stroll back home didn\u2019t take long, but it was still killer. Your head pulsed with pain, and your stomach was flipping and twisting into knots. Your eyes prowled along the sidewalk, begging some tinies to appear so you could take your mind off the pain and have some fun. Alas, no tinies showed up. Why weren\u2019t they ever around when you needed one? Their life was so stupid and simple, the least they could do was make yours easier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReaching your house again, you decided to sneak in through the back door so as to not alert your family of your presence. You knew August would tease you about not taking proper care of your car. You apparently passed your stealth check, as you silently moved upstairs without alerting anyone. It was hardly time for celebrating though, as by now you were sweating veritable buckets thanks to the fever you were now running.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoused in sweat, you gulped down some water and stumbled into your bedroom. You stripped out of your clothes in a desperate attempt to feel cooler (as you weren\u2019t usually one to sleep naked). Tossing your clothes into your dirty hamper, you collapsed into bed, begging sleep to grab you. As you slowly passed out into unconsciousness, your head was filled with vivid dreams. Dreams of your life finally changing, a dramatic twist of fate finally breaking you from your routine rut of boredom\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf scientists were asked to explain it, it\u2019d be unlikely that any answer they came up with would be suitable. From all knowledge known so far, it was physically impossible for anyone other than a man to be shrunken down by the shrinking virus and reduced to a tiny. In the 50-odd years since the epidemic hit, only men have been affected, and it was no general knowledge that no girls could or would ever be tiny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, as the night dragged on, that is exactly what happened to you. While you slept fitfully, your body reduced in size, more and more with each passing minute. Before long, you too were only about an inch tall. Your innards had changed as well, shifting and morphing into their new, proper shapes. The cells that controlled the squashing and reforming defense mechanism integrated all throughout your body, completing the transformation into a tiny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerhaps all the pieces had just come into place. August\u2019s biological father was a man named Adrian who had sadly passed away from cancer just a year after her birth. Both you and Penny were born from sperm donors your mother had utilized. Penny\u2019s secret father was a normal man living somewhere on the east coast, but what no one would ever discover is that your biological father was a tiny himself. Hence, the tiny genes had been in your blood, dormant, since the day you were born.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlso, the night\u2019s events had served as an undeniable catalyst. The tiny you picked up off the street was not a truly ordinary tiny. His own blood was a rare mutated form of the shrinking virus. Completely normal to him, but the DNA of his blood contained molecules that were actually extremely aggressive in triggering the shrinking effects. Perhaps some of his DNA getting into your bloodstream because of his spit had kickstarted your dormant shrinking genes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe it was something else altogether, like the hodgepodge collection of medicine you\u2019d haphazardly gulped down earlier. Maybe you\u2019d contracted it somehow from a patron at the diner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr\u2026maybe it was just fate, and its infinitely cruel sense of humor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWHAT THE HELL!?!?\u201d Your scream pierced the heavens, though in reality, was nothing more than a bug\u2019s buzzing whisper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince waking up ten minutes prior, your brain had fought to come to terms with the reality that now faced you. Though you had first believed it a dream, pinching and then slapping yourself had not resulted in waking up. In fact, all you\u2019d done is slightly dent your face, only for it to reform a second later. Somehow, despite the theoretical impossibility of it all, you were now a tiny. One inch  in height, and malleable in nature.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shook with horror, fighting the overwhelming urge to pass out from the fright of it all. It was only the sense of \u201cwrongness\u201d the spurred you onwards. This wasn\u2019t you. You weren\u2019t a tiny freak like all the others. You weren\u2019t just an insignificant speck, some unnoticeable bug. Your life wasn\u2019t worthless. YOU DIDN\u2019T DESERVE THIS!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrawling to the side of your bed, you slid down to the floor and then crossed your room to the door, disgusted by the fact that it took you almost five minutes to do so. The extra plush carpeting in your room was nearly a jungle to traverse. Finally, you made it, slipping under the crack in your door and out into the hallway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour only thought was getting help, and quick. This could be reversed; this could be fixed. You could be changed back. No way this was permanent, right? No way this was your life now. All you needed was some help.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Off to your left, near the end of the hallway, you could see that the bathroom door was open, and the lights were on. You also heard the faint voice of your mother gently humming, and you recalled that she often liked to take long, hot baths in the early morning before starting her day. There was no one you trusted more than your own mother to rescue you from this nightmare, so you booked it down the hallway as fast as you could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, fast was relative at your new size. Though the hallway carpet was shorter and easier to traverse than your own bedroom, it was still not unlike running on wavy sand dunes at the beach, and you tripped and stumbled several times. It took you five minutes to even draw near the bathroom, and you were fairly out of breath by the time you actually did so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWiping sweat from your brow, you panted heavily to catch your breath as you meandered to the open bathroom door and looked inside the bathroom. Surprisingly, it was empty, and you realized your mistake just one second too late. Your mom\u2019s pleasant humming started up again, frighteningly loud, and you whipped around to find her strolling from her bedroom towards the bathroom, crossing right into your path.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou froze in abject terror, the sight of your now giantess-sized mother casually walking forward more horrifying than anything you\u2019d ever witnessed in your life. There was something about her peaceful expression and casual demeanor that contrasted so sharply with the sheer enormity of her body. You were so stunned that your brain didn\u2019t even think to move before Priscilla\u2019s right foot slapped into your body, her big toe impacting with your chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour gut crumpled flat from the impact, and you were launched backwards, sailing into the bathroom. Your miniscule body bounced and slid along the tiled floor, deeper into the bathroom. It hurt, and the rational part of your brain quickly realized that without your newfound squishy properties, an impact like that should\u2019ve popped you open like a grape. Like it or not (and you absolutely did NOT like it), you were now as weak and puny as all tinies, and a simple step from your mother could obliterate you with ease.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdding insult to injury, Priscilla was wholly oblivious as to what she\u2019d done, and she merely entered the bathroom and closed the door behind her. She then tossed the flimsy bath robe she\u2019d been wearing aside, baring her fully nude body to the empty bathroom, and singular tiny girl. She then walked over to the tub, once more crossing near you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes had bulged out of their sockets looking at your mother\u2019s unbelievably gigantic curves as she took off her robe, but thankfully you had a shred of common sense that compelled you to sprint away as she came walking by. Your mom had always had a hourglass figure to die for, but from your vantage point, her massive breasts were like globe-sized mounds of flesh, and her plump booty looked fit to swallow you whole, never to release you again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLost in thought about what to do now, you remained on the floor while Priscilla turned the searing hot water on and began filling the tub, while simultaneously dumping a generous helping of bubbling liquid into the water as well. She continued humming her merry little tune, tapping her foot to the rhythm, and you watched with morbid fascination as your mom\u2019s toes slapped up and down, drumming along the tiled floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA moment later, and your attention was caught by the sight of Priscilla\u2019s loofah hanging over the edge of the tub, just barely touching the floor. Inspiration struck you in that moment, and you realized that it wouldn\u2019t be hard to scale the frilly loofah up and onto the edge of the tub, which would give you a much greater vantage to get Priscilla\u2019s attention from. Clearly, she wasn\u2019t likely to spot you down on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAvoiding her feet by a wide margin, you reached the loofah and hopped on, your inconsequential weight not shifting it at all. Putting your lithe body and mild acrobatic talents to use, you scaled the loofah with relative ease. Once or twice your hands got tangled in the small gaps in the loofah\u2019s composition, but it was only a minute or two by the time you flipped up onto the edge of the tub.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatching your breath for a second, you noted that the tub was now filled to the brim with hot water and a miasma of bubbles. As if to drive this point home, Priscilla grinned and turned the water off, then moved to enter the tub without hesitating a second. This suddenness caught you off guard, and soon, your mother\u2019s hand was racing towards you as she moved to brace herself upon entry. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shadow of her hand moving to engulf you, your mind raced with panic.</span></div></div>",

STOP!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThrough some miraculous means, Priscilla actually heard your tiny voice, and she withdrew her hand hastily. Glancing in confusion around the bathroom, your giantess mother\u2019s roving gaze finally settled on your miniscule body. She titled her head in thought, and then recognition shone in her face\u2026although it was a distant sort of recognition, and her lips curled into a disappointed frown instead of the loving care you desperately wished of her right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, a perverted little tiny!\u201d Priscilla lamented aloud. \u201cHow rude of you, you little thing!\u201d Frown deepening, your mother brought her open palm back towards your body and flung it downwards in a slapping motion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour hopes shattered at the same instant your body did, as your mother\u2019s hand easily squashed your flat as paper, crumpling you down and leaving your little more than a stain on the edge of the tub. Your own caring mother had completely failed to recognize you, and the severity of your new lot in life came crashing down on you. It was overwhelming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSettling into the tub, Priscilla moved her hand from your body, and stared at your crushed form. Her expression was one of dissatisfaction. \u201cI mean, really. I love you tiny little things, and try my hardest to respect your rights and feelings. But then you perverted guys do things like this! It\u2019s so depraved!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs your mother continued to talk to you, oblivious as to your real identity, you fought valiantly to reform and pop back to normal. It was a tricky task, seeing as how you\u2019d never had to do something so mentally exhausting in your life before now, but you began making progress after a moment. However, noticing your progress, your mother grabbed the nearest bottle of shampoo and plopped it down onto your body, keeping you flat and pinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh, ah! No doing that silly little reinflating thing!\u201d Priscilla tsked while shaking her finger. \u201cYou can ask my daughters, and they\u2019ll tell you I\u2019m a doting and friendly woman, but they will also tell you that I\u2019m fair. AND, a tiny like yourself being punished for spying on me while I bathe is absolutely fair.\u201d She laughed lightly. \u201cYou will stay put, little thing, and wait until I\u2019ve finished bathing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough her words were slightly muffled under the bottle of shampoo, you still mostly picked up on what she said, and her words chilled you to your core. Not only had your hopeful savior failed to recognize you, but now she was going to punish you? You were desperate to avoid this fate, but try as you might, you simply could not wiggle or squirm out from under the shampoo bottle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPriscilla\u2019s bath did eventually come to an end a half hour later, and your mother rose from the water like a goddess, stepping out from the tub and drying herself off. After slipping her bath robe back on, she took a cursory glance around the bathroom to make sure she hadn\u2019t forgotten anything, and her eyes fell on the shampoo bottle balance precariously on the tub\u2019s edge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow, why is that there?\u201d Your mother mused softly, having entirely forgotten about you thanks to her heavenly, thirty-minute bath. Grabbing the bottle and moving it, she instantly spotted your almost comically squashed body and frightened expression. Her eyes lit up. \u201cAh, right. My little would-be bathroom spy! Come here, you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMentally freaking out, your physical body still couldn\u2019t do a thing as Priscilla scraped you from the porcelain tub\u2019s surface and dropped you into her palm. Through your one uncrushed eye, you noted your mother was taking you into the spare room instead of her own bedroom. Your mom often referred to the room as her \u2018design studio\u2019, and it was where she did all of her work as a freelance clothing designer. As soon as Priscilla stepped into the room, a flood of once pleasant but now horrible memories raced into your mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSee, your mom had fully jumped on the bandwagon of a relatively small company known as Micro-Flex, which specialized in comfy clothing inspired by the stretchy and malleable qualities of tinies. She\u2019d bought some stocks in the company years ago, and now that Micro-Flex was a huge business, and practically a household name, your mom had made bank. Of course, it wasn\u2019t the money she cared about, but the materials.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMicro-Flex brand materials were now sold in stores across the United States, and your mom kept a constantly supply of them in her design studio at all times. She had the normal supplies one who expect, like fabric dyes and paints, brushes and threads, specialized clothing molds, and a life-size mannequin for measuring purposes. She also had crates of Micro-Flex material. The material was stretchy, malleable, and super soft to the touch. In fact, it was just about exactly like a squished tiny would be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis is why, up until today, you\u2019d always cherished this room of the house. You\u2019d long lost count of the various cruel means by which you\u2019d disposed of tinies you\u2019d picked up off the streets. Priscilla was in her own little world inside of this room, and was laughably easy to manipulate into torturing tinies while remaining blissfully unaware. Suffice it to say, you could think of quite a few orders that your mom had made and shipped out that were a good deal more LIVELY than your traditional fabric garments.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, now all of that was turned back on you, the newly tiny scared-out-of-her-mind girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill powerless, you could only let out a mute scream as Priscilla grabbed an empty Tupperware container, pulled off the lid, and dropped you inside. Your papery form fluttered into the container, which Priscilla sealed up tightly a second later. It took you a minute or two, but you finally reformed, and you hopped to your feet and pressed up against the plastic wall, banging your pitiful fists against it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThrough your blurry vision outside the container, you watched your mom finish scribbling some words onto a sticky note, which she then taped to the top of your container. Tears now freely coming down your face, you beat your fists harder and harder into the plastic, drawing the attention of your giantess mother right as she was preparing to leave the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, don\u2019t worry, little one.\u201d Priscilla cooed. \u201cI\u2019m not a cruel woman, I promise. I know life can be hard for you tinies, so I\u2019m only keeping you in there until later tonight\u2026or perhaps tomorrow morning. Just long enough for you to think about what you\u2019ve done.\u201d Your mother wagged her finger at you. \u201cI\u2019m flattered you think a woman my age is worth spying on, but it was still a naughty thing that you did!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChuckling to herself, Priscilla sauntered out of the room, your panic-induced pounding on the plastic producing no sympathy from her. She merely turned off the light and closed the door, leaving you alone in total darkness inside of the design studio. Wracked with a crushing feeling of defeat, you sank to your knees and curled yourself up into a ball.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome time passed, perhaps a few hours but you couldn\u2019t know for sure, and the door to the design studio swung open. As the lights flicked on, you pulled yourself to your feet and rubbed the tear stains from your eyes, ready to once more pour your heart into an attempt at getting Priscilla to notice you. Because, surely, it was her coming to let you free, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo, not in the slightest. It was none other than your sister, Penny, who strolled into the room with a happy smile and inquisitive eyes. She appeared to be scanning the room for something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh\u2026sticky notes. Sticky notes, sticky notes\u2026hm.\u201d Penny mumbled to herself, turning in a circle before spotting the small pad of sticky notes beside your Tupperware prison. Grinning, your younger sister bounded over to you and scooped the pad of notes into her hand. Though she wasn\u2019t who you had expected to see, she could still save you, so you resumed pounding your fists on the walls of the container.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDrawn by the noise, Penny glanced at the container, and she spotted the note. Peering down at it, she murmured its contents aloud as she read it. \u201cUh\u2026tiny little pervert spying in bathroom\u2026punishment is sitting in container\u2026release at night or morning\u2026\u201d Your sister froze, and her jaw dropped slightly. \u201cWhat the hell?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSquatting, Penny peered inside the container right at you, and you froze under her intense scrutiny. As her face morphed into one of sadistic enjoyment, you waved your arms around and shouted at her to notice you, but it was useless. The blurry plastic casing of the container shrouded your real identity from her, and your voice didn\u2019t even begin to reach her ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, little freak thinks it\u2019s okay to be a perv?\u201d Penny scoffed. \u201cYeah, no. See, this is why I tell mom that tinies are useless bugs. Maybe she\u2019ll believe me one day.\u201d Your sister ripped the sticky note from your container and crumpled it in her fist. \u201cAnyway, won\u2019t need this note. From what I can tell, mom\u2019s forgotten about you already. Why not make this even more fun, then?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrinning maliciously at you, your confidence in being found shriveled into nothing. Somehow, just from a simple perspective change, your darling younger sister had gone from angelic sweetheart to a demon of your nightmares.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>From inside your Tupperware prison, you could just about see the sadistic ideas dancing around in Penny\u2019s head. Though she was still eyelevel with you, her eyes had grown cloudy and unfocused, and you knew she was devising the perfect plot to torment you with. You knew, because you\u2019d seen the same look in her eyes hundreds of times. You knew, because Penny only thought of tinies as bugs and freaks that were hers to toy with and abuse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou knew, because you\u2019d taught her how to think that way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, your younger sister\u2019s eyes flashed with excitement, and she lightly bit her lip. \u201cTell ya what, tiny? Would you like to come out of that container? Huh, would ya?\u201d Penny teased, beginning to pry the lid of the container off. You violently shook your head to signify your refusal, knowing Penny was just toying with you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis brought the smallest frown onto her angelic face, and Penny sighed. \u201cNot going to play along? Fine. I wasn\u2019t giving you a choice anyway.\u201d Penny ripped the lid clean off and snatched out at you, faster than you could have ever hoped to react. Her giant hand squeezed around you in a clenching vice, and her fingers quickly went to work smoothing and flattening you out into a paper-thin disc shape. Any protest on your lips died as she squeezed your lungs into a smear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLying you in her palm, Penny smirked at you and snorted with laughter. \u201cGeez, you\u2019re so disgustingly weak. I really have no idea how some of you bugs get it in your head that you\u2019re equal to humans.\u201d She sighed wistfully and looked over her shoulder. \u201c\u2026only wish Alex was here to see what I\u2019m about to do to you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe irony hit you like a slap to the face, and you put all your remaining energy into one desperate wiggle. Sadly, all you accomplished was further burying your face under Penny\u2019s thumb, thus effectively obscuring the one-way Penny\u2019s might\u2019ve noticed who you were. As it was, she couldn\u2019t see the horrified expression of her beloved older sister at all, and she certainly didn\u2019t take note of the obvious differences in your crotch region compared to a normal tiny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking back at you, Penny let loose a full, slightly unhinged smile as she began to further mold and shape your squishy body. You were powerless to stop her the entire way, and couldn\u2019t do a thing as she gripped you and stretched you out longways, while simultaneously squeezing the rest of your body smaller. In the span of a minute, she\u2019d effectively turned you into a rectangular shape, about a foot in length, but only an inch or two in width.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then proceeded to smash her thumb into your face and rubbed it around, smudging your facial features into an unintelligible blob. You mentally pleaded with her to stop, but obviously your silent pleas fell on deaf, uncaring ears. Penny simply kept smiling as she reduced your face to a blurry smear, drastically muddying your vision, and utterly eradicating any chance at screaming out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPenny also did the same to the rest of your body, smearing and smudging any of your recognizably human features into simple blurs of tan. When all was said and done, you were really nothing more than a simple tan rectangle of squishiness flopping around in Penny\u2019s hand. One would have to look close to spot the imperfections in Penny\u2019s cruel handiwork. The past version of you would\u2019ve applauded Penny. The current version of you could only internally cry at the pain and humiliation of it all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a frustratingly casual skip in her step, Penny dashed from the room, down the hall, and downstairs. She swished around in her hand, and a small part of you hoped you\u2019d slip from your giantess sister\u2019s fingers and escape her wrath. Sadly, Penny had years of experiencing handling tinies, and she had you clenched in just the way to keep you gripped tightly while also appearing casual and inconspicuous to anyone who saw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEntering the living room, Penny walked up to Priscilla, who was watching some soap opera on the TV. The pretty blonde beamed at her mother and spoke. \u201cHey mom! Are you busy?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNever too busy for you, Penny sweetie!\u201d Priscilla smiled warmly, and shut off the TV. \u201cWhat do you need?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I remembered August telling me she\u2019d wanted to buy a new thong.\u201d Penny said, throwing in a convincing giggle. \u201cI feel like she has plenty already, but you know how she is. Anyway, I wondered if we could just make her one up in your design studio instead of buying her one.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPriscilla\u2019s face lit up, her daughter saying the magic words. \u201cOh, I\u2019d love to do that!\u201d Her expression grew playful. \u201cWhat did you mean by \u2018we\u2019 though?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPenny laughed. \u201cI was thinking maybe you could show me, step-by-step. I even brought you some fabric that I think will work well.\u201d Your younger sister delicately placed you in your mother\u2019s smooth, warm hands. Priscilla wasted no time running her hands up and down your naked body, poking and prodding at you with the analytical focus of a professional.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, she gave breath to your fate, and Penny\u2019s success. \u201cAh, this is a perfect strip of fabric! Great choice, sweetie. Let\u2019s get started!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking the lead, Priscilla hopped from the couch and headed upstairs, with Penny hot on her heels. Your mother swung your carelessly by her side, lightly bumping you against her wide hips over and over, and your blurry vision caught sight of Penny smirking with smug satisfaction, a faint blush on her cheeks. You hated her immensely right now, but also had truly no one to blame but yourself and fate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEntering the design studio, your mother took a seat in the comfy, wheeled desk chair by the largest desk in the room, and laid your flattened form gently out in front of her. Though you wasted no time in trying to reform, Penny\u2019s smudging and smearing of your body had done a real number on you, and your pitifully smashed body simply refused to respond fast enough.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cOkay, you\u2019ve got a good start here, sweetie.\u201d Priscilla noted, glancing at Penny, who stood eagerly by her side. \u201cWe just need to form the loops for August to step her legs through, and then touch up the rest of the thong. It\u2019ll be easy!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPriscilla then grabbed at your mangled arms and legs, and mistaking them for just parts of the Micro-Flex fabric strip her darling daughter had picked out for her, began shaping you more and more into the thong it seemed destined you\u2019d become. She pulled your limbs taut, and massaged them into thinner stringy strips. Meanwhile, she cupped the center of your body and smoothed you out, curving your malleable form while simultaneously pinching you a bit tighter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThrough the tangle of your mother\u2019s mercilessly probing fingers, you caught a hazy image of Penny\u2019s face lighting up with malicious excitement, and your heart dropped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPenny leaned forward. \u201cHey mom, is it possible to make this thong blue? Probably should\u2019ve picked out a blue fabric strip, I just totally forgot August mentioned wanting it in blue until now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPriscilla rubbed her daughter\u2019s head affectionately. \u201cIt\u2019s not problem at all, Penny. All we need is a bowl and some blue liquid dye. They\u2019re over on that table. Would you grab them for me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAbsolutely, mom!\u201d Penny\u2019s head bobbed ecstatically, and she hurried back in seconds with an empty bowl and the blue dye. Priscilla popped the cap off the dye and poured a generous amount of liquid dye into the bowl. During this time, she\u2019d set your mangled body down, and you realized with horror that you could hardly even feel your contorted stringy limbs, let alone dream of reforming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the bowl full, Priscilla scooped you up and rather unceremoniously dunked you into the bowl of cold blue dye, heedless to your silent screams. \u201cAnd\u2026there we go! This thong will just have to sit for\u2026oh, ten minutes or so. It\u2019ll absorb the dye rather easily, which is a huge benefit to using Micro-Flex materials. That, and they are so easy to mold!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThey seem like it!\u201d Penny agreed, fighting hard to keep her victorious smile off her face as she watched what she still believed to be a perverted useless tiny submerged in the dye. \u201cThis is pretty fun, mom. Maybe I can try my hand myself some time?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis studio is yours, if you need it!\u201d Priscilla gestured broadly to the room, and the two Hayes giantesses shared a laugh, both cherishing their happy family bonding time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey continued their pleasant conversation the next ten minutes, while you could do nothing but wonder how you hadn\u2019t drowned yet. Apparently, it was another superpower of tinies that you now possessed, but the cynical part of your mind felt that all it had done was keep you alive for the torment that was now going to follow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPriscilla lifted you from the bowl dutifully on the dot ten minutes later, and laid you down on her desk. You caught a brief look at yourself in the mirror, and saw that, sure enough, your entire body had been dyed bright blue. All of your skin, the smudged features that Penny had smeared, and even your hair were entirely blue. It was such a shocking sight that your mind went from horror straight to hopelessness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mom, blissfully unaware of the unfathomable torture she was subjecting her own daughter to, picked up a nearby blow-dryer, plugged it into the wall, and clicked it on. The oppressively hot air blew out over your entire body, and you could feel the sticky wet dye drying and cooling almost immediately. Worryingly, it felt as if the dye was hardening around your very being.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow, we just dry it off!\u201d Priscilla explained to Penny, who watched with rapt attention. \u201cIt only takes a minute, and when the liquid dye settles, it forms a sort of sealant over the material. That sealant will preserve the coloring of the fabric through hundreds of trips in the wash cycle! It also keeps the material from losing the shape you want it to keep.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPenny had to look away to keep her mother from seeing the full flaring of her pink cheeks as her breathing hitched. \u201cO-oh? That\u2019s awesome! Wow!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hadn\u2019t heard a word of your mother\u2019s last statement due to the overwhelming wind pressure from the blow-dryer, but maybe that was for the best. If you knew just how screwed your were, you might\u2019ve given up all hope entirely. As it was, you held onto the slim chance that fate would save you from this. It had forced you into this cruel existence as a tiny, surely it had to do something nice for you eventually, right? Balance out?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe final step was done quickly and efficiently, as your mother connected your left hand with your left foot, and your right hand with your right foot, and sealed the connections with some super bonding glue she brushed on. The glue hardened in seconds, binding your hands and feet together tighter than you could ever hope to break on your own. Your limbs now formed the two supporting loops of the thong shape, while the rest of your body made up the thong itself. From what you could tell, your head was where the backside would be, which was a horrifying revelation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHanding you to Penny, your younger sister flashed you one quick look of sadistic glee before smiling much more genuinely at Priscilla. \u201cThanks so much for doing this, mom!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnytime, sweetie.\u201d Your mom gushed. \u201cBy the way, do you know why I had that Tupperware container sitting out?\u201d She pointed to your empty prison from an hour ago. \u201cI can\u2019t recall what it was for.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEver quick on her feet, Penny shrugged inconspicuously. \u201cIt was probably nothing important then, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPriscilla hesitated for one moment before nodding. \u201cYou\u2019re right, Penny. Nothing important.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThanking her mom one last time, Penny turned on her heel and left the room. She spotted August\u2019s bedroom light on, suggesting your older sister had just gotten back from her trip to the gym. Sure enough, as Penny entered the room, she found August stark naked and still a bit glistening from the shower she\u2019d taken before leaving the gym.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe auburn-haired giantess raised an eyebrow at Penny\u2019s entry into her room. \u201cUh\u2026what\u2019s up, sis? Need something?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cActually, I have something for you.\u201d Penny explained, and she held your thong body out. August eyed you appreciatively, but with apprehension. \u201cRemember when you asked for a new thong?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour older sister furrowed her brow. \u201cDid I? Can\u2019t say I do.\u201d She sighed and then laughed. \u201cMust\u2019ve slipped my mind then. I take it this is that thong? Did you make it for me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPenny blushed. \u201cWell, mom did most the work. I just watched. Maybe next time I\u2019ll make something for you myself.\u201d The blonde giantess grinned, and dropped you into August\u2019s awaiting hands. \u201cBut yes, this is for you. Enjoy it!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI totally will!\u201d August confirmed, giving Penny a quick hug. With one last lingering look, your younger sister hurried out of the room, leaving you alone with the towering and terrifying form of your naked older sister. She was looking at you with admiration, but no recognition, and how could she be blamed? After all, you were a freaking thong, and dyed completely blue. In the span of an hour, Penny and Priscilla had wiped your last shred of humanity away!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPondering aloud, August shrugged. \u201cEh, might as well wear this now. Feels hella comfy.\u201d The oblivious giantess laughed softly and began lowering you to the floor. Her incredibly long legs seemed to stretch on for miles, and far above them were the wide hips and thick bubble butt your sister proudly possessed. As she stepped one foot into each of your limb-formed loops, panic you'd never felt in your life seized you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll that ran through your head was how you could possibly get out of a situation this hopeless now.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As you stood motionless staring straight up at the towering form of your now giantess mother, you weren't even really paying attention to what was transpiring in front of you until it was too late. Stepping over you into the tub, you wanted to shield your eyes from the indecent sight as your mothers hips hovered over you for a moment. You couldn't look away, transfixed in a crude mix of awe and horror as you saw her cheeks part slightly as she stepped into the bath before clapping together as she stood in the bubbly water. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven just a step into the tub caused the ground beneath you to shake, and you couldn't help but tremble slightly at how overpowered each of your sense was by the sheer presence of your own mom in front of you. You gulped as you saw the loofah fall gracefully off the side of the tub entirely, resting in a clump at the foot of the bath. Welp, there goes your smooth exit plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPreparing to sit, your mother's hand flew towards you as she bent her knees and went to grab the side of the tub. Hesitating, your now extremely malleable body put up no fight at all as you flattened like putty beneath your mom's palm. You expected death of course as you were totally consumed by darkness, but you were once again saved by your new ability to be crushed to nothing and suffer no permanent damage. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully Priscilla moved her hand immediately upon settling, releasing a lively sigh of pleasure as the especially hot water met with every inch of her generous curves. Stuck to the side of the porcelain tub like some tan sticker, you focused as hard as you could on popping back into a decent human shape. How the hell did those damn tinies make it look so easy? This was taking a ridiculous amount of effort and concentration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter about a minute, you finally popped up, practically jumping up in joy at your newfound success. Looking right at your target, you saw Priscilla basking in the heat of the bath, frothy white bubbles lapping at her huge chest just barely poking out of the huge tub. You sort of expected her to just see you immediately, your tan body and light hair making a clear contrast with the shiny white wall of the bathtub, but unfortunately her eyes were gently shut in a sort of tranquil bliss. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tried to shout, only to see most of your face, particularly your mouth, was still flattened shut. You rolled your eyes wondering when you'd get a break before taking both hands and beginning to make an attempt at prying it open. Right as you popped it free however, a limp arm lazily rose from the mass of bubbles and drifted it's way over you. Like a massive unstoppable hurdle, you only managed a meek scream as it toppled over you, causing you to fall backwards and sail through the air back to the damn floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nExpecting to be a flattened puddle after such a far fall of probably two feet, you were surprised to land upon a bouncy little cushion. Looking down, you couldn't help but thank the lord for saving you as you saw the fluffy loofah broke your fall. You hopped in place for a moment enjoying the springy albeit rough texture before you were reminded of what knocked you down here. A few inches away Priscilla was grasping aimlessly at the tile floor next to you, her fingers gently dancing around. They seemed to be slowly making their way towards you as they probed away, and you snapped out of your confusion as they hovered directly over you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tried to jump away, taking any fall damage was far preferable than being scooped up with your mom's favorite little scrubbing contrivance. As you leapt, your foot snagged tightly to a rough loop in the loofah, totally entwined in the deep exfoliating mesh. You tugged at it fervently, tugging and pulling as hard as you could to be free from this entanglement. As Priscilla's fingers met with the fabric, her eyebrows raised on her angelic face, her eyes never opening from their graceful closure. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked up at the palm of your mom's hand as it enclosed on you, merely managing a last cry of \"MOMMM! STOP!\" before her dainty grip flattened and silenced you.<br>\r\nAs Priscilla brought the loofah over the rim of the tub, her eyelids parted and she lightly perked up as she thought she heard the distinctive sound of her lovely Alexandra calling for her. Wetting the loofah in the searing water, Priscilla listened for a moment as your skin was burned a bright red in the hot water. Reaching over for the body wash, Priscilla went about routinely dousing it in soap and frothing it up as she curiously called back, \"Alexandra, honey? Was that you?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou watched your mom call out for you as you helplessly lay flattened and entwined in her loofah. Your mom was gazing outwards towards the door expectantly, not even looking at you as she squeezed out a hefty glob of overpoweringly fruity body wash onto your entire body. It stung your eyes like crazy to do this, but you couldn't help but peer through the pink goo at your mom's now distorted face as you saw her shrug carelessly before bringing her other hand on top of you to spread out her body wash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSatisfied with preparing her useful loofah, and unknowingly her own daughter, Priscilla elegantly raised an arm before inelegantly smearing her loofah into her arm pit. As she scrubbed away at her upper body, Priscilla sighed before dreamily pondering aloud, \"Ahhh, sometimes I miss that girl so much it's like I'm hearing her voice...\" Moving her loofah aimlessly along her chest over to her other arm, you were silently groaning. The rough texture of the loofah contrasted with the silky smooth skin of your mom was tearing at you, not to mention the humiliation as your face was smeared directly against the sweaty underside of your own mom's armpit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point your wrists and ankles were thoroughly entwined with the loops of the loofah, and your body was coated in a dense layer of white suds. Your mom's hand was very unfortunately directly opposite your body, meaning you were getting a full frontal experience of wherever Priscilla decided to clean next. Just then, Priscilla propped an ankle up against her bent knee, preparing to get a good scrub on her left foot as she continued to muse to herself, \"Silly me, I saw her just yesterday! I really need to accept that she's a fully grown adult, she doesn't need my help at every given second.\" Your screams would never reach anyone's ears as Priscilla playfully rinsed you in the searing water before scrubbing away at her sole. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile the flesh of Priscilla's foot was far rougher than her overwhelming breasts, it was still remarkably well taken care of. This didn't stop your torment unfortunately as Priscilla scrubbed harder against her arch than her upper body, and you got a mouthful of disgusting foot flesh. You were getting far far closer to your mother's foot than you ever thought you would have in a thousand years, and you were getting an overpowering experience with it as your body was used as floss to clean the bits of dirt from between her toes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinished scrubbing the grime onto you from both her feet, Priscilla rolled slightly to her side. \"I mean, if I had it my way, I'd keep her with me <i>always</i>. But oh there I go being overbearing again!\" Priscilla giggled to herself. Popping her mountainous booty out of the water, you could make out through the thick steamy haze made by the bathroom's steam and the soap in your eyes the destination you were headed towards next. With a renewed frenzy of uncontrollable disdain, you struggled and thrashed like never before. You did not want to be plunged into there, you feared you'd never get come out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPopping your mouth free as the sides of the loofah made contact with the sides of Priscilla's booty, you had a fraction of a second before you were plunged into the abyss. Barely managing to squeak out a scream, you wailed \"NOOOOoooooo-\" before being cut off with a mouthful of Priscilla's dirty bath water as you were swallowed below the surface of her crack. Priscilla paused her advance as she swore she heard yet another meek cry. Your continued whimpers were drowned by booty flesh however and no sound escaped Priscilla's thick backside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLetting out a disappointed sigh as she didn't hear anything yet again, Priscilla began scrubbing away at the deep expanse of her crack. \"There it was again! I need to relax...Alex isn't even home right now!\" Priscilla's booming voice filled with painfully juicy irony actually barely managed to reach you over the sloshing of the bath water only adding to your torment. You cursed with what mental power you had that wasn't being overwhelmed by the dizzying flurry of ass flesh flying into you. Your tiny plea for mercy from Priscilla was having disastrous consequences as now you were caught with your mouth open, stuck flattened as Priscilla took it on a grand tour of every inch of her massive globular ass. The soap nor the bubbly bath water did anything to wash the awful dirty and musky taste of Priscilla's booty from your mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFond thoughts and memories of her cute daughter Alexandra were floating through Priscilla's mind as she scrubbed herself clean with a cheerful hum. If only she could hear your desperate screams she'd no doubt stop subjecting you to this torture, but Priscilla was lost in only the most innocent of thoughts. Giving one last deep push to scrub the deep parts of her cavernous ass, Priscilla smeared you against her flesh dutifully. She could've sworn she felt some minuscule smoothness brush her backside but she instantly disregarded it as her simply being overly sensitive back there. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiving her body a good final once over, Priscilla wrung the loofah vigorously before hanging it on a shower hook. After relaxing for another half hour, she finally had enough and pulled the plug. Letting all the water flow out, Priscilla dried her body thoroughly and decided she should really get to making breakfast. With a refreshing swing in her hips, Priscilla flipped the lights off and left the bathroom...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Right across the hall from you, Penny\u2019s door was still closed tight, and you could hear the faint humming sound of her fan spinning. This all suggested that she was still sound asleep, or at the very least, in her room. You weren\u2019t ignorant of Penny\u2019s idol worship of you, and found it pretty endearing. Now, you were hoping that you could rely on that care and support to ask for her help in reversing your disgusting transformation into a tiny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNever once did the thoughts of Penny\u2019s tiny torment fetish cross your mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSneaking across the hall was easy, while wiggling under Penny\u2019s door frame was a bit harder. Though you hated to give validation to your new, cursed body, you ended up pinching yourself flatter to slip under easier. You reformed in seconds upon reaching the other side of her door, and you made a mental vow to not use your tiny-gifted abilities if you could avoid it. You were better than those other bug-sized freaks, damn it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter your eyes adjusted to the dark, you spotted the outline of Penny\u2019s body sprawled out on her bed, revealing that she was, in fact, still sound asleep. This was a bit problematic, as Penny was a notoriously heavy sleeper in your family. Almost nothing aside from physically shaking her awake could get her out of bed before her body naturally woke her up. Still, you weren\u2019t deterred, and you sprinted across her room towards where one of her bedsheets was hanging off to the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsing the bedsheet as your point of access, you put your physical abilities to good use, utilizing your now nearly imperceptible weight to hoist your body up, scaling the bedsheet higher and higher. While climbing, you noted Penny\u2019s school stuff sitting against the wall, including her zipped-open backpack. You wondered if she had something going on today that would explain why she left it sitting out in the open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, you reached the top of the bed, and audibly gasped with fright at the sight that was before you. Though you should\u2019ve been prepared for it, it still momentarily stopped your heart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour younger sister, now a full-blown giantess, was lying on her stomach, head buried in her pillow, stretched out across her bed. She was absolutely massive, and difficult for your brain to comprehend. She was like a goddess of slumber, huge and incredibly intimidating. Contrasting with the scary impression she made was her attire and demeanor. She was wearing cute, frilly pink panties and matching bra, and she kept making adorably soft moaning and mumbling noises.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSnapping yourself out of your horrified trance, you weakly approached Penny\u2019s left foot, delicately touching her soft skin with your bare hands. Penny didn\u2019t move a muscle, or show any signs of having felt you. With a bit more force, you punched her foot, then kicked it, but still no result. Your efforts were pointless, and it dawned on you that perhaps your only hope was getting closer to her head and screaming for her attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou began doing just that, but it was slow going. Penny\u2019s plush mattress was indented due to her own weight, tripping up your feet whenever she so much as twitched. There was also an almost insurmountable temptation to lie down and fall asleep yourself. Penny\u2019s bed was frighteningly welcoming, and you wondered if everyday surfaces such as these were always so strikingly different for a tiny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHalfway to Penny\u2019s head, you groaned in frustration at your slow travel speed, and cried out angrily. \u201cPENNY! WAKE UP AND HELP ME!\u201d You shouted, your tinny voice barely registering over the hum of the fan, and Penny\u2019s own cute snores. But it did in fact register, just not in the way you\u2019d hoped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMfgh\u2026\u201d Penny moaned incomprehensibly, and for a second you thought you\u2019d actually woken her up, only for that dream to crash down around you as Penny\u2019s entire body began to shake and turn. She was rolling over, and you were directly in her path.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were momentarily stunned by fright at the sight of Penny\u2019s body rolling onto its side, paused for a second, and then came down towards you. Penny was flipping from her stomach onto her back, and it dawned on you exactly where you were at the moment as your younger\u2019s sisters tight, frilly panty-clad butt rushed towards you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScreaming, you willed your legs to move, only to find the indenting of the plush mattress slanting the ground back towards Penny\u2019s ass, dragging you closer to your demise. Scrambling with renewed fervor and an intense panic, you rushed up the slick fabric slope of the mattress, up until the last possible second before impact. Then, Penny\u2019s butt plopped down with a soft \u2018whump\u2019, and the blonde girl lazily smiled in her sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou\u2019d escaped the worst of it, but it was still an intense wake-up call to the horror of your new life. Penny\u2019s butt cheek had smushed you flat, but only barely, and your one free hand was able to pry yourself out from under your younger\u2019s sister\u2019s booty and back into fresh air. As you reformed, you glumly thought about how the humiliation of your own sister\u2019s butt cheek terrifying you would sit in your mind forever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing, and much more on edge, you continued crawling towards Penny\u2019s blissfully smiling head.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>While continuing to traverse the seemingly endless expanse of your younger sister\u2019s bed, your eyes had fully adjusted to the darkness of the room, and you were able to make out Penny\u2019s features in significantly clearer definition. As you gazed at your monumental sister\u2019s face off in the distance, you saw her smile quiver and morph into a trouble frown, and her brow creased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor some reason, your pulse began to quicken, and it only doubled in intensity as your giantess younger sister began to murmur louder, her body twitching slightly. From what you guessed, she was falling into the clutches of a nightmare, and as her anguished moaning grew more intense, it dawned on you just how horrible a position you were in, stuck as you were on the middle of her bed right beside her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure enough, less than a second after that revelation, Penny let out a sharp cry, and her hand slapped out forcefully. It would\u2019ve hit nothing but empty air, but instead, you were directly in her hand\u2019s path, and your younger sister\u2019s spastic slap was more than enough to crumple your tiny body and send you flying backwards off of her bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour own tiny cry of surprise fell on deaf ears as your sister bolted upright in bed, breathing heavily. Her own eyes far from adjusted to the dark, she didn\u2019t see a thing as your tiny form spiraled through the air helplessly, before finally slamming into the top of her backpack over by the wall. Your arms indenting and flattening from the impact, you could only widen your eyes in panic as your body tumbled down into the zipped-open abyss of her backpack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou splatted down onto some sort of fabric, and were instantly lost in a tangle of unseen clothing garments. You reformed quickly, and tried your best to climb out to safety, but the walls of Penny\u2019s backpack were far too high to scale at your height. This didn\u2019t stop you from trying for the next five minutes, even though it was all futile. Penny\u2019s backpack was an inescapable prison as it was now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, your younger sister had calmed herself down by taking several deep breaths, and then slid out of bed and got dressed. She changed into freshly cleaned underwear and then slipped on a cute, blue t-shirt and matching skirt. After checking the time on her phone, she grabbed a few more articles of clothing, and then moved over to her backpack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the middle of failed attempt number twelve, you were staring up at the tantalizingly close opening at the top of Penny\u2019s backpack thinking of some new way to try climbing out. Just then, Penny herself appeared, and you abandoned your escape attempt to instead jump up and down while waving your arms. You felt confident Penny would spot you immediately\u2026until you saw the thoughtful expression on her face, the fact that she was looking straight ahead instead of down at you, and the bundle of clothes in her arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFreezing up, you barely had time to scream before your sister dumped the rest of her clothes into her backpack, and you were buried under a mound of indistinguishable garments. Your puny body flattened out under the pressure, try as you might to beat your small fists against the clothes weighing down on you. A second later, and you heard the zipper gliding into place, sealing you inside your makeshift tomb. A moment after that, the backpack was hefted up into the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSliding the backpack over her shoulder, Penny frowned and spoke aloud, murmuring. \u201c\u2026okay. Think that\u2019s everything. Ugh. Didn\u2019t mean to sleep this late.\u201d The blonde giantess checked her phone again. \u201cShould have time for quick breakfast.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnaware of what she\u2019d done (but understandably so) Penny strolled quickly from her room and skipped down the stairs, backpack swinging around on her arm all the while. You were flipped and tossed inside the dark confines of her backpack over and over, unable to tell which way was up as your body was squished and twisted this way and that. You could only let out infrequent strangled pleas for help which didn\u2019t come close to penetrating through the backpack and up to Penny\u2019s ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGobbling down a quick breakfast, your sister jumped into her car outside, tossed the backpack into the passenger\u2019s seat, and drove off. Though you could hear the low rumbling of the car\u2019s engine, you couldn\u2019t hear much else, and had no idea where Penny was going. A pang of regret crept into your heart as you realized just how little you\u2019d paid attention to your family member\u2019s lives these past few months.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPenny\u2019s drive wasn\u2019t long, and soon she had parked her car, picked up her backpack again, and was carrying you somewhere. From under a mountain of frilly, soft fabric, you strained your ears to pick up on any recognizable sounds, but got nothing. You could only impatiently wait for Penny to stop walking and jostling you around, and then maybe you\u2019d be able to crawl to freedom once she set the backpack down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour wish came true a minute later, but not at all as you were expecting. Penny slowed her walking, unzipped her backpack, and then flipped the whole damn thing upside-down, dumping all the contents inside the backpack outside. You cried out in surprise at the unexpected freefall, before slapping down onto some soft fabric or another. Miraculously, you weren\u2019t buried under all the clothes, but were instead mostly on the top of the pile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour head reformed first, and you peeled yourself up and glanced around. Eyes blinking to adjust to the light, you quickly realized with increasing panic where you were:</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>From all the way downstairs in the kitchen, you could make out the sounds of someone rummaging around. At a guess, you presumed it was August, as she was the only Hayes woman to get up and get moving this early on a Saturday. You had your reservations about relying on August for help, but figured if she was awake and alert, it wouldn\u2019t be too bad. Plus, your stomach was growling for food, so having a bite to eat after being noticed would be nice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith this plan in mind, you walked the rest of the length of the hallway to the stairs, and then descended down to the first floor. It was a tiring process of crawling to the edge of the step, falling down and squishing slightly, reforming, and then doing it all again for every single step. All told, it took you over five minutes to descend the stairs, then another few minutes to reach the kitchen. It was a miracle August was still there after ten minutes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon entering the kitchen, your jaw dropped open in sheer shock at the sight that you saw. On a normal morning, seeing your sister saunter around the kitchen whipping up a filling meal was nothing new. But now, from your bug-sized perspective, August was a towering, gorgeous giantess, equal parts mesmerizing and alluring, as well as terrifying and incomprehensible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll at once, you were hit with a wave of nausea as a sea of memories flooded into your head all at once. You kept staring at August, taking in her curvaceous and toned appearance, and noting her attire, which consisted of a revealing black sports bra and black compression shorts. You remembered the time where you\u2019d discreetly slipped a tiny into her open cleavage. You recalled molding a tiny into a hair tie, then \u2018gifting\u2019 the little guy to August for her birthday. You thought of all the tinies you slapped onto her butt by pretending to just give her a friendly \u2018butt pat\u2019.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou remembered all the ways you\u2019d used her and her oblivious, scatter-brained nature to torment tinies\u2026and then recalled that you WERE one now. Coming to her for help was a terrible mistake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSadly, it was one you figured you\u2019d have to own up to. Now that you were here in the kitchen, August was far and away the closest and easiest person to get immediate help from. Steeling your nerves, you slipped past her while she was standing by the counter, and made it to the kitchen\u2019s tables closet leg. It was a smooth wooden leg, but with that sort of sticky, glossy feeling when you rub your hands on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLatching onto the leg like a little spider, you shimmied up and up and up, your arms begging you to stop, but your determined will taking you all the way to the top. From there, you used your minimal but applicable acrobatic skills to flip around the underside of the table, maneuvering from the leg and up onto the tabletop. Taking solace in your victory, your stopped to catch your breath and rub sweat off your face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, August had finally finished getting her breakfast ready. She\u2019d woken up rather early to do it, but she\u2019d just finished whipping up some delicious pancakes, from the mix to the finished product. Sure, she\u2019d dropped her mixing spoon on the ground three times, and she\u2019d let half the mix pour into the drain instead of her bowl, but whatever. She\u2019d had enough to make three thick, tasty looking pancakes, and that was enough for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarelessly, she dropped the plate onto the table, accidentally jostling the top pancake off of the stack. You sat up from where you were lying down, only to let out a strangled cry as a house-sized pancake slipped off the stack and toppled down towards you. Scrambling frantically, you crawled across the table to safety, barely avoiding being buried under the breakfast delicacy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, oops.\u201d August chuckled to herself and grinned. \u201cThat was pretty dumb of me. Heh.\u201d Licking some mix off of her fingers, she grabbed the pancake without looking and dragged it back onto her plate, all while rummaging in the cupboard for an empty glass. She had yet to even glance at the table anywhere near your direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom your new vantage, watching August was like watching a slowly brewing storm of chaos. She was a whirlwind of energy that left destruction and enjoyment in its wake, in equal measure. It had always endeared people to her in the past, and she was quick to make friends because of her quirky mannerisms. As a tiny, though, August was pure, unadulterated terror, and you began to seriously consider just running from the kitchen instead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPouring herself a glass of orange juice, August set the glass down near her plate, then strolled out of the room, once again not glancing in your direction. You stamped your foot impatiently, and waited for her to return. A minute later, she did, bent over at the waist and dragging something on the floor with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOookay! Pancakes, check! Juice, check! Gym bag\u2026check!\u201d August murmured excitedly to herself, still walking backwards into the kitchen as she did so, dragging her gym bag along with her. Your throat tightened and your heart skipped a beat, watching her huge, shapely rear end wiggle closer and closer. \u201cWhat am I forgetting?\u201d Your older sister mused, tapping her cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, impact occurred, and August\u2019s firm ass slapped into the table, jostling it. Not expecting the severity of the tremor, you were bowled over onto your face, slamming into the table and squishing slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, August let out a cute gasp and whirled around, just barely catching her orange juice glass before it spilled. With you planted flat on the table from your loss of balance, your titanic older sister didn\u2019t spot you at all, but she DID see what was right behind you: the bottle of syrup.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh right! Syrup! Aaaaand\u2026check! Breakfast time, and then gym time!\u201d She giggled, leaning over the table to grab the bottle, eyes firmly locked on it, and not your miniscule form stuck in the middle, right between the bottle and her plate. Her abundant breasts swung like a pendulum as she leaned over, nearly threatening to squish her own stack of pancakes flat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnable to pick yourself up in time, your eyes widened in panic as August grabbed the bottle then dragged it straight backwards across the table, directly towards you!</span></div></div>",

Your strangled cry was cut short as your lungs flattened, and you flipped head over heels backwards towards August\u2019s plate. In the brief nanosecond where you were looking upwards, all you saw was your older sister\u2019s beautiful face staring straight ahead, having no idea what she\u2019d just done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough it felt much longer, the whole incident was less than a second, until your bug-sized body slapped into the side of August\u2019s plate and flipped up onto it, squishing slightly into the side of her mountain of pancakes. You pried your face back from the pillowy, doughy pancake pile, and frantically pried at your squished lips, trying to reform them so you could cry out to August.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs frightened as you were, you didn\u2019t even fully realize that you\u2019d been knocked up onto your older sister\u2019s plate on the opposite side that she was. This meant that, as August sat down to begin eating a second later, her stack of three pancakes completely hid you from view, even as the auburn-haired giantess looked at her plate with anticipation and licked her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, time to chow down, and then burn this all off at the gym!\" August declared passionately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSyrup bottle in hand, August titled the bottle upside-down and squeezed, dumping a veritable waterfall of syrup down onto her plate. The syrup splattered the top pancake, and then rolled down the sides, soon soaking nearly her entire plate in sticky, sugary goodness. Letting out a soft laugh at her own expense, August grinned, and utterly failed to hear your quiet exclamation of panic from behind her pancake stack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter all, you had been right in harms way, and the moment you\u2019d finally reformed your mouth to scream out, the flow of syrup rained down upon you, splashing onto your body. The viscous goop knocked you onto your back, smacking your head against the porcelain plate. Momentarily dazed from the impact, you could only widen your eyes in horror as more and more syrup sloshed all around you, adhering to your tiny naked body like superglue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom out of the corner of your eye, you saw the glistening sheen of sharp metal as August lifted her knife and jabbed it into the top of the pancake stack. She then began casually sawing through the stack, slicing her yummy breakfast meal into bite-sized chunks. Fear hit you like a truck watching her knife descend closer and closer, and with almost animalistic determination you hefted your body out of the syrup swamp and rolled out of the way. You didn\u2019t know if knives could kill tinies, but you were in no hurry to find out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRolling to the side, you ended up coming around the stack of pancakes, and face to face with your older sister. You tried to shout up at her, only to find your lips fused shut due to the syrup utterly coating your body. Also, because of the syrup, your tiny form just looked like an indistinguishable brown blob. August didn\u2019t glance at you at all, and simply kept cutting into her pancakes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFacing August, your back was turned to the huge stack behind you, and you were caught by complete surprise as it toppled forward. Sliced clean by your older sister\u2019s knife, chunks of pancake fell down around you, with one sizable bit slamming into the back of your head. The impact knocked you forward, face-first into the syrup goop, wholly submerging you as the pancake chunk settled above you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow buried out of sight, you thrashed wildly to break free, but it was no use. The syrup coated your body like a slick, sticky second skin, and the chunk of pillowy pancake pressing down on you weighed into you just enough to keep you submerged. You tried and failed over and over to stand up, and your panicked efforts only doubled as you made out the muffled sound of your giantess sister\u2019s stomach rumbling greedily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUp above, August had finished dissecting her pancake mountain, and was more than eager to dig in. Practically salivating at the filling breakfast feast she\u2019d prepared for herself, your sister set down her knife and picked up her fork, then jabbed it into the nearest piece of pancake chunk. Her fork didn\u2019t pierce all the way through, but it was enough to firmly dig into the chunk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, your gargled and incomprehensible screams bubbled through the syrup goop as you felt four sharp metal prongs lightly scrape at your back. Stuck as you were, face-first onto the plate with the pancake above you, you were all-too aware that August had just about speared you with her fork. Time was running very, very short for you to do something about your predicament, and you could only silently beg August didn\u2019t make things worse than they currently were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeedless to your pleas, August did in fact make things worse, as she began dragging your chunk of pancake all around her plate, gathering up as much syrupy goodness as possible. In doing so, she smushed and smeared your body flatter and flatter, engraining you into the doughy pancake that was squishing into you. Your feeble pleas soon grew silent as your lungs were crushed flat, along with the rest of your body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally satisfied, August lifted her fork up, bringing the sopping, syrupy pancake chunk closer to her mouth. Through the haze of syrup coating you, you gazed at your giantess older sister, begging her to see you (and not fully realizing just how difficult it was to make out your tiny form by this point). You attempted to squirm or wiggle, but it was no use. Your fate was in August\u2019s hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSadly, your sister merely licked her lips and opened her mouth, her plush lips parting to reveal the dark, dank depths within. Her eyes closed in excited anticipation of her first delicious mouthful, ruining your final hope of being spotted by her. As she moved her fork closer to her mouth, and her hot breath washed over you, your mind wondered how your normal life had shattered so completely that you were reduced to this. You'd be nothing but nourishment for your older sister, and she'd never have a clue...unless something saved you in these very final moments.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A cursory look around the second-floor hallway clued you in that you\u2019d apparently slept much later than you\u2019d initially thought. Obviously, your family was all together downstairs, but why? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeading to find out, you walked the rest of the length of the hallway to the stairs, and then descended down to the first floor. It was a tiring process of crawling to the edge of the step, falling down and squishing slightly, reforming, and then doing it all again for every single step. All told, it took you over five minutes to descend the stairs, then another few minutes to reach the kitchen. You could only hope your family hadn\u2019t moved from the living room yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure enough, they hadn\u2019t, and seeing them briefly took you aback, your body shaking with terror. Each of the other Hayes women were towering giantesses to your new miniscule form, stunningly beautiful paragons of attractiveness and power in equal measure. You had never felt so helpless and insignificant in your life then you did while watching them now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor some reason, they each had a suitcase present, with your mom finishing zipping up her own, Penny already having hers on wheels by the door, and August still trying to squeeze her belongings inside. You wracked your brain for a reasonable explanation as to this behavior, but came up with nothing, walking forward while you thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully, Penny\u2019s booming sigh clued you in a second later. \u201cMan\u2026I wish Alex was coming with us.\u201d She said glumly, aimlessly kicking at the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mom shook her head sadly. \u201cI tried to ask her last night if she was sure, but she seemed more interested in the party. It\u2019s a shame, but she\u2019s a grown woman now. She can make her own decisions.\u201d Priscilla reasoned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAugust, trying and failing to organize her stuff suitcase, scoffed. \u201cCan\u2019t say that makes sense to me. I mean, who values a party over a freaking beach resort?\u201d She laughed. \u201cHer loss though.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stopped dead in your tracks, a flood of memories rushing back to you all at once. It was a pretty poor decision to stop moving and get lost in thought while so close to Penny\u2019s aimlessly swinging foot, but your mind was wholly preoccupied at the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou recalled your mother mentioning a surprise week-long trip to a famous beach resort known as \u2018Seaside Sanctuary\u2019 a day or two ago. She was prone to these spontaneous trips frequently, and in your excitement for the party, it had slipped your mind entirely. You felt a pang of guilt at unintentionally pushing family time aside for your own selfish wants, as well as a personal sense of loss. You\u2019d never been to Seaside Sanctuary before, and heard it was heavenly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA moment later, August jumped to her feet in a panic. \u201cOh crap! My favorite bikini top is still upstairs.\u201d She grinned sheepishly. \u201cBe right back!\u201d She said before dashing upstairs. Penny rolled her eyes and smiled at her sister\u2019s antics, and your mom did the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLocking eyes with August\u2019s messy suitcase, Priscilla stepped forward, then nodded to Penny. \u201cHelp me with this, dear?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPenny flashed her a thumbs up and moved from where she stood. \u201cSure thing, mom!\u201d Your younger sister grinned, eyes firmly locked on Priscilla, and not on her bug-sized sister down by her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were knocked from your thoughts in the most literal sense, as Penny\u2019s foot slapped into your body, sending you careening up into the air with a painful crushing of your stomach. Unnoticed by both of your family members, you flew up and into August\u2019s suitcase, landing on one of your older sister\u2019s stretchy thongs. You blushed bright red at the embarrassment of it all, but it was hardly the biggest concern at the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWorking in tandem, Priscilla and Penny began maneuvering and shuffling around all of August\u2019s belongings, piling them neatly into stacked rows. Your tiny body was knocked to the side as Penny dragged a few pairs of socks into place, and you were slapped in the face by a lacey pair of panties, your legs getting tangled up in the strings. You screamed for help, but your pitiful cries were drowned out by a chorus of pleasant laughter from your family.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlipped over onto your back, you cried out again as Penny slammed her fist down into your body, trying to squeeze the pile of lingerie flatter to save space. Your body crumpled into paper, and your mind screamed in confused agony at the all-new sensation of being nothing but a squishy bug to your normal-sized sister and mother. You suffered, while only able to stare up at them smiling and joking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they finished, you were thankfully given a moment to reform, your body slowly popping back to normal size. However, before you\u2019d even finished halfway reforming, August came bounding down the stairs and skipping into view, holding a stylish black and red bikini top in her hands. Grinning at Penny and Priscilla, she proceeded to slam the top down into her suitcase without looking, and it came down right onto you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour choked cry was strangled short as the top crushed you flat, and then moments later, the pressure on your miniscule body doubled as August zipped up the suitcase nice and tight. All sounds became muffled, and everything was darkness as the suitcase trundled along on its wheels, August rolling it out of the house alongside her family. You uselessly tried to wiggle free, but to no avail. You couldn\u2019t move a muscle, and as August put her suitcase into the car, and Penny and Priscilla laid theirs on top, the weight tripled, and you felt suffocated from all sides.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo release came, no crazy coincidence saved you. The three-hour drive to Seaside Sanctuary was entirely in the cramped but ironically sweet-smelling confines of your older sister\u2019s suitcase. You moved through the whole plethora of emotions, ranging from depressed sobbing to unjustified anger at August, back to sheer boredom of nothingness. You couldn\u2019t do a thing but wait and hope for this to end quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPulling into the Seaside Sanctuary parking lot, the three normal-sized Hayes women grabbed their suitcases and strolled inside the lavish front doors of the resort. Sitting comfortably beside the massive expanse of the Pacific ocean, the main resort building was styled like an extravagant palace, eight stories tall and incredibly long. No normal family could ever afford to stay here, but thankfully Priscilla had secretly entered and won a contest for all-expenses-paid, deluxe week-long tickets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Priscilla checked in at the front desk, August and Penny observed the main map of the resort complex. Apparently, Seaside Sanctuary just about had it all. The two sisters took note of the full-service spa and massage parlor, the luxury dining room, the sauna and hot tubs, the mini water park, and of course, the beach itself. There was probably even more waiting to be discovered over the course of the upcoming week. It was incredibly exciting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting three copies of their suite key, Priscilla led her daughters down one of the hallways and towards their room, which was on the first floor. Stepping inside, they were taken aback by the sprawling layout, which had three individual bedrooms, a central room with an 80-inch television, and two bathrooms. Each giantess wasted no time claiming their own room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAugust rolled her suitcase into her chosen room and flipped it up onto the king-sized bed inside. She hastily unzipped the top and threw it back, but was then distracted by the sound of her phone ringing. Smiling, she paused what she was doing and turned her attention to her phone, simultaneously granting you an amazing chance for the first time in three hours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo longer crushed by pressure, you began reforming your body back to three dimensions. It was slow going, but in minutes you were fully formed, though still underneath August\u2019s bikini top. Try as you might, it was a bit too heavy to push off or wiggle out from under, leaving you still a bit trapped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA moment later, and Penny and Priscilla walked into the room, already having changed into their swimsuits and planning to hit up the beach before dinner. Penny was wearing a cute pink two-piece, modest but still sexy. Priscilla was practically on the other end of the spectrum, with a stringy top that left little to the imagination, and a bottom so thin it was practically flossing her cheeks. She was blushing bright red in embarrassment, having apparently thought it would fit her curvaceous frame more modestly than it did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSis! Get changed!\u201d Penny teased. Flexing her toes, she briefly slipped her flip-flops off. August sheepishly put away her phone, and began taking off her street clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry. Got distracted.\u201d August admitted, looking at Penny while fumbling for her bikini top. Gripping it, she flipped it around, and unintentionally sealed your fate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnable to get out, you were dragged with the top as August grabbed it, and ended up tumbling down into the depths of the curved inside of the left cup. The bikini was massive in order to support August\u2019s rather large breasts, and thus was way too steep and deep for you to climb out of yourself. You could only shriek in panic as August moved to put it on, her gigantic bare breasts drawing closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s a cute top, sweetie.\u201d Your mother noted, leaning forward to get a closer look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks! Bought it a while back, and love it!\u201d August explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir own mundane conversation aside, you were rapidly running to escape the cup, as while August tilted it to fit her breasts inside, the surface was easier to run on. You were determined not to let this happen, but time was growing short.</span></div></div>",

            ],
            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>From the last remaining sliver of vision you had, you saw your mother\u2019s inquisitive face peering around August to look at her stylish bikini. Though you couldn\u2019t prove it, you could\u2019ve sworn your mother made direct eye contact with you, and a frown shadowed her radiant face, only to be replaced by horrified realization a second later. Then, everything grew dark as August squeezed her abundantly sized breast into the cup, filling up the entire space around you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAUGUST, WAIT!\u201d Priscilla cried, scaring August into freezing her movements. Even Penny gaped in surprise, taken aback by your mother\u2019s outburst.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGeez mom, what\u2019s up?\u201d August winced. \u201cYour scream made my heart skip a beat!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStaring ahead without blinking, Priscilla shakily pointed to the bikini top. \u201cTake that off, August. Right. Now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAugust wasn\u2019t about to argue with your mom, so she wiggled her breast back out of the cup, releasing you into the light and fresh air once more. You were soon sent tumbling and spiraling through the air as the bikini was flipped upside-down. You shouted out in a high-pitched wail, arms flailing helplessly, until you slapped down onto the soft surface of your mother\u2019s awaiting palm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGroaning, you stood wearily on Priscilla\u2019s palm, and then up at her face. She was peering down at you intently, an expression of horror and grief written on her flawless features. Turning to the side, August\u2019s gigantic face filled your view, and she looked at you curiously, a small smile playing on her sensual lips. To your other side, Penny stood silently, her eyes widening and jaw dropping more and more with each passing second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh shoot! There was a tiny in my top!\u201d August laughed, the last to catch on to what was happening. \u201cGood eye, mom.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPriscilla numbly shook her head. \u201cN-no\u2026it can\u2019t be.\u201d Lips trembling, she looked at August, then at Penny. \u201cIt\u2019s\u2026A-Alexandra!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were totally exhausted ten minutes later, after the whirlwind of shouts, tears, and questions. Eventually, everyone calmed down a bit, but everyone was obviously still shocked by the revelation of the fate that had befallen you. You were still resting on your mother\u2019s palm, and the blush of embarrassment hadn\u2019t left your cheeks yet. You were, of course, still stark naked, and having your family members stare at and examine you was humiliating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell\u2026\u201d Priscilla spoke up, regaining her confidence. \u201cI think we have to cancel this vacation. There\u2019s no way we can get help for little Alexandra now.\u201d She explained, and you winced at her usage of the word \u2018little\u2019.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPenny quirked her mouth to the side thoughtfully. \u201cI agree. Alex needs our help right now, and there\u2019s nothing we can do here to help her get back to normal. The sooner she\u2019s not a bug-sized tiny, the better for her wellbeing.\u201d Your younger sister looked at you and managed a weak smile that didn\u2019t quite reach her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour older sister folded her arms. \u201cWait, hold on. How do we know that there\u2019s nothing we can do for lil\u2019 cutie Alex?\u201d August grinned down at you. \u201cWe don\u2019t have a clue what causes shrinking, or what fixes it. We don\u2019t know if she even can be fixed!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPenny\u2019s expression grew cloudy. \u201cDon\u2019t say that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAugust shrugged. \u201cI\u2019m just throwing things out there. What\u2019s the rush on all of this? We don\u2019t know much right now, and we\u2019ll know that same amount\u2026which is nothing\u2026if we go back home.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mother shook her head. \u201cMy precious baby isn\u2019t safe like this!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCourse she is!\u201d August beamed, and your mother frowned, puzzled. \u201cI mean, we\u2019re keeping her safe right now. Why can\u2019t we keep her safe and by our side all week?\u201d The auburn-haired giantess threw out a lopsided grin. \u201cI\u2019ll admit, I\u2019m being a little selfish in wanting to stay here, but who\u2019s to say adorable little sis won\u2019t have fun too?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stomped your foot on your mother\u2019s palm. \u201cNo, August. I want to go home!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour older sister merely giggled, and quickly leaned forward towards your mother\u2019s palm while puckering her lips. You froze at the suddenness of your sister\u2019s actions, and could only feebly brace yourself as August\u2019s plump lips impacted with your body, enveloping you whole in a wet embrace. You fell backwards with a slurping noise a second later as August leaned back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, you are just the cutest little thing right now! Looking all pouty!\u201d August gushed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPenny crossed her arms. \u201cI don\u2019t know. A lot of things can\u2026\u201d She paused, and her eyes briefly lost focus. \u201c\u2026happen to tinies.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you could wipe August\u2019s saliva from your face and agree with Penny, your mother spoke up. \u201cPenny, are you saying I can\u2019t take care of my own little girl? I won\u2019t let a thing harm a hair on my baby\u2019s head!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if to drive her point home, Priscilla moved her palm closer to her chest, and soon empty air behind you became a titanic wall of exposed breast flesh. Briefly distracted, you were caught off guard as your mom poked you lightly with a finger and pushed you into her right breast, lightly squishing your face into her hot, smooth skin. You tried to push back, but you were far too weak to even fight against a single finger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPriscilla smiled warmly, and nearly cooed. \u201cI\u2019ll keep my precious girl safe and warm. Mommy will look after her.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUnless she wants to spend time with me.\u201d August suggested. \u201cWe\u2019ll totally have fun!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPenny sighed. \u201cSo, wait, are we staying? In that case, I\u2019ll take Alex. I\u2019d do anything for my big sister.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019tcha mean \u2018adorable little sister\u2019?\u201d August teased, laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill firmly squeezing your mother\u2019s breast, you couldn\u2019t speak for yourself, so Priscilla did. \u201cRegardless, allow me to use the bathroom once more, and then our little darling can speak for herself.\u201d Daintily, your mother pried you from her breast and set you down on the edge of August\u2019s bed. She then strolled into the nearest bathroom, closing the door behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAugust looked set to launch into more playful teasing and affection, when her phone buzzed. Picking it up, your towering older sister looked at it and laughed. Focusing, she appeared to start typing on it, most likely responding to something funny a friend had said. Still wiping the last bits of saliva off your arms, you didn\u2019t quite notice August slowly meander towards you while engrossed in her phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNever once looking up from her phone, and still laughing, August backed towards the bed and prepared to sit. It was only when she was actually casting a shadow over you that you realized what was about to happen, and your startled cry came out half-heartedly and weak. Time seemed to slow as the colossal ass of your older sister descended from above, the two perfectly sculped, doughy cheeks of her booty filling the sky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOut of the corner of your eye, you could see Penny staring right at you, eyes widened in panic and mouth opening to warn August. Your heart filled with warmth for a single second, knowing Penny would be your savior\u2026until your angelic view of her shattered. Penny froze, several conflicted emotions battled on her face, and then she closed her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn those last nanoseconds, you saw her lightly bite her lip as a faint blush tinted her cheeks pink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAugust plopped onto the bed with a muffled clap, and you were squished in an instant. Of course, your airheaded sister didn\u2019t feel a thing, and merely kept texting her friend. Wiggling her voluptuous rump to get more comfortable, August smeared your flattened body across her left cheek, your body entirely squished into the exposed flesh her revealing bikini bottoms didn\u2019t cover. As you flattened out, you felt a crushing sense of loss (literally and figuratively), as your older sister reduced you to nothing beneath her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPenny, meanwhile, was struggling to think straight as the blush in her cheeks flared even more. She knew she should\u2019ve warned August so you wouldn\u2019t have been crushed, but it just felt so right seeing a tiny get what they deserved. The moral part of Penny\u2019s mind reminded her that you weren\u2019t a tiny, but her precious older sister, but the primal part of Penny shuddered with joy seeing August so casually smear you against the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA second later and August stood up, having finished texting her friend and also slipping her flip-flops on. The damage was done, though, and you were firmly stuck to your sister\u2019s booty, jiggling along with her wiggling cheeks as she walked to the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAugust paused at the door. \u201cAlright, who\u2019s taking our cutie sister? God, she\u2019s the size of the old dolls I used to play with.\u201d August smiled, then frowned. \u201cAlso, where is she?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEyes boring into the obviously Alex-shaped imprint on August\u2019s butt cheek, Penny\u2019s face contorted in the image of struggling, until finally bursting loose. \u201cShe\u2019s on your butt!\u201d She exclaimed forcefully, then took a deep breath. \u201cI think you sat on her.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAugust gaped. \u201cShoot, really?\u201d She sauntered over to a mirror and spotted you, clear as day. She couldn\u2019t help but laugh as she picked you off with her fingernails. \u201cHugging my butt a little too tight, huh sis? Silly little girl!\u201d Your older sister joked, though thankfully let you reform in her palm without any further incident.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA moment later, and Priscilla left the bathroom, none-the-wiser as to what had transpired. She cleared her throat and looked compassionately at you. \u201cAlright, let\u2019s let our sweet baby decide. Who do want to be with today, honey?\u201d</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cI\u2019ll\u2026uh\u2026can I be with Penny?\u201d You said, reaching a decision.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was impossible to ignore that look of sadness on your mother\u2019s face, nor the disappointment on August\u2019s, but Penny\u2019s reassuring smile helped you to be okay with your decision. A bit more carelessly than she should\u2019ve, August tossed you over to Penny, letting your fly through the air. You screamed, but Penny caught you gently and with ease, cupping her hands around you to cradle you and prevent you from falling out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAugust put her hands on her hips. \u201cI guess I\u2019ll see you two for dinner in the dining hall, right? Have fun hanging out.\u201d She smirked playfully at Penny. \u201cDon\u2019t have TOO much fun with adorable little Alex without me, though, okay? Save some of our newly mini sister for all of us, huh?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe dashed from the room, Priscilla hot on her heels with chastisement. \u201cAugust. She is your sister, not a toy! Don\u2019t pick on her!\u201d Your mom called out, and soon the two of them were out of sight and earshot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a deep breath, you turned back around and looked up at the humongous face of your younger sister. She was staring at you almost analytically, but when she realized you were staring back, she snapped out of it and winced. A single tear dripped from her eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cS-sorry about not stopping August from sitting on you.\u201d Penny murmured softly. \u201cI\u2026uh\u2026froze up. This is all just so new to me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot realizing what had truly gone on inside Penny\u2019s mind, you nodded. \u201cThat\u2019s fine. This is, obviously, new to me too. I mean, I hate it, but it is what it is for the moment.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPenny, surprisingly, growled. \u201cI hate it too. You don\u2019t deserve this, big sister. You\u2019re perfect, better then anyone else I know, and if I grow up to be half the woman you are, my life will be okay.\u201d She was more determined than you\u2019d ever heard her in your life, and her words genuinely resonated with your cynical heart. \u201cBut now you\u2019re been changed against your will into one of those freaks! A tiny!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know.\u201d You nodded. \u201cIt sucks, and I have no clue how it happened. But, August is right. We don\u2019t know how to fix it, and trying to rush a solution won\u2019t help. If I have to be tiny for a little bit, it beats being stuck like this permanently.\u201d You forced a laugh. \u201cAt least I\u2019ll get some time off from work for this, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPenny smiled slightly, but didn\u2019t laugh. \u201cMaybe. But still, if I ever find that tiny who cut you last night, I swear I\u2019ll do things to him that no one has ever dared do to a tiny before. He\u2019ll beg me to stop.\u201d Penny laughed quietly, then beamed down at you. \u201cI\u2019ll make you proud, Alex. Anything to help my big sister change back to normal, and stop being one of those bugs.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou knew she meant well, but her words still chilled you. Penny\u2019s borderline obsession with torturing tinies had been a bit much when you were normal sized, but now that you were the same size as her victims, it was downright bloodcurdling. So, you merely nodded vaguely, and the conversation ended.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrabbing her beach bag with one hand while keeping you securely cupped in the other, Penny strolled from the suite and down the hallway towards the back exit of the main resort building. Her steps had a rhythmic bounce to them, and after figuring out the rhythm yourself, you found it easy to stay firmly and comfortably balanced in her palm. You spared a smile up at your giantess sister, and she smiled back before heading outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDescending a huge staircase from the back of the resort building led right down to the pristinely preserved beachside section owned exclusively by Seaside Sanctuary. It was about a mile-long stretch of beach marked off by right cones and flags at either end. In the middle of the beach was a lone lifeguard tower. The water was sparkling in the sun, and waves were rolling in at moderate strength.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinding an open spot, Penny dexterously unrolled a towel from her bag and set up a small umbrella, all while keeping you safe in her hand. She also dabbled some sunscreen onto her body, and offered you a small glob as well, which you gratefully accepted. Though you were loath to admit it, it was almost fun, even if you knew it would\u2019ve been even more fun at your regular size, and not as a stupid tiny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting down on the towel, Penny held you out in front of her and frowned. \u201cWhat now, Alex? Is there anything you feel comfortable doing at your si\u2026er\u2026I mean. You know.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou rubbed your chin. \u201cI don\u2019t know, honestly. Ugh.\u201d You swore under your breath. \u201cWho goes to a beach resort but can\u2019t do anything fun because they\u2019re a freaking tiny?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe can think of something.\u201d Penny suggested, and you nodded in agreement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next moment, two very crucial things happened. Off to your right, you spotted an incredibly well-endowed woman in her late 20s sauntering along the beach before finally settling on a spot about ten feet away. She began unrolling her towel into place. To your left, you noticed a seagull flapping around aimlessly, before suddenly appearing to divebomb straight towards you!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPenny noticed the gull too, and she reflexively clenched her hands to her chest with a yelp, desperately trying to shield you from the gull. Of course, the gull was merely aiming for some dropped bits of hotdog a few feet from your towel, but you appreciated Penny\u2019s fast reflexes while saving you. You just wish she hadn\u2019t flattened you out into a pancake between her palms in doing so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPulling you back from her chest, Penny winced at seeing your crushed form. \u201cOh my gosh, I\u2019m so sorry, Alex! I thought that gull was\u2026oh wait. You can\u2019t talk, huh?\u201d Penny wondered aloud, watching as you slowly inflated back to normal. As you reformed, your one squished eye watched as Penny\u2019s mouth curled into a slight sneer, almost on its own. Quietly, Penny mumbled something. \u201cForgot all you weird tinies can\u2019t talk when squashed\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo sooner had to statement left her mouth then Penny clapped her spare hand to her face, seemingly trying to force the unwelcome thought back into her head. And, without her free hand to cover you as you reformed, a particularly blustery gust of wind a moment later hit the beach, and your still flat and papery form was whisked right off Penny\u2019s palm and into the air.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Your younger sister screamed out and jumped to her feet, momentarily losing sight of you. You were certainly losing yourself too, flipping around nauseatingly through the air until the gust finally died down. Helpless to stop your trajectory, your miniscule body slammed down in a rough landing onto the plush pink towel of the woman ten feet to your right that you\u2019d seen earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou reformed a second later, weakly dusting yourself off as you sat up. The woman was before you, but was blocking the sun, thus casting herself as a shadowy silhouette. You waved your arm at her, hoping she\u2019d take you back to Penny after spotting you, and you at first assumed she was going to do just that as her body grew closer and closer. It was only as your vision cleared up the details of her curvaceous body that you realized your impending future was anything but.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman, who was not looking at you at all, had just finished taking off her top and bottoms, and now completely nude, was lying down on her towel for a nice, long tanning session. Oblivious to the horrorstricken tiny beneath her, the woman sprawled out on her towel, smiling blissfully as the warm heat of the sun touched her nude body. She didn\u2019t even hear the faint squelch of your body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou\u2019d tried to run, but hadn\u2019t achieved anything at all. Your body was utterly decimated by the woman\u2019s right breast. As you\u2019d noted earlier, the woman was unbelievably endowed in the chest department, and her massive mammaries were like meteorites falling onto you. Your malleable body squashed out under their weight, the pressure flattening you and a layer of slick sweat sticking you to her skin. You were crushed just under her right nipple. The only upside was that you were facing outward, but that hardly mattered much currently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully, Penny had managed to mostly track your erratic movements through the sky, and had noted your landing spot. Though she hadn\u2019t made it to the woman in time to rescue you, she had seen your body vanish beneath the busty beach babe\u2019s boobs. Fighting down a growing urge in her chest, Penny lightly tapped the woman\u2019s shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExcuse me, miss.\u201d Your sister gently spoke. The woman, who had just finished retrieving a bottle of tanning lotion from her bag, looked at Penny and smiled pleasantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes?\u201d She asked, her voice melodic and beautiful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI was wondering\u2026um\u2026\u201d Penny struggled to put her thoughts into words, her eyes constantly flicking from the woman\u2019s face to where her boobs had almost comically squashed out onto the towel. Images of you smushed under those breasts danced in Penny\u2019s head, and she mentally shooed them away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCapitalizing on Penny\u2019s hesitation, the woman offered Penny the tanning lotion bottle. \u201cActually, could you do me the hugest favor in the world? Could you rub me down with this lotion? Pretty please?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPenny, taken aback, was too stunned for words. \u201cUh\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman sheepishly chuckled. \u201cIt\u2019s hard for me to do it on my own. I know this is a weird request, since you don\u2019t know me. If it helps, my name is Elisa. What\u2019s yours?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour younger sister, instinctually a do-good people pleaser, grabbed the bottle from Elisa almost on auto-pilot. \u201cIt\u2019s\u2026uh\u2026Penny.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPenny, huh? Cute name!\u201d Elisa giggled. \u201cYou\u2019re really helping me out here, Penny. I\u2019ll have to make it up to you later. A deluxe ice cream sundae from the sweets parlor? It\u2019ll be my treat!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNodding vaguely, Penny began lathering up Elisa with tanning lotion. The extremely well-developed woman wiggled pleasurably as the cool lotion dripped all along her body, Penny performing her unexpected task perfectly. Your sister kept a constant eye on Elisa\u2019s breasts each time she moved, watching as they dragged a bit back and forth against the towel. Unconsciously, Penny began to bite her lip, and felt a faint hotness in her cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThoroughly lathering up Elisa from the backside, Penny was caught by surprise as the curvy woman quickly flipped onto her back, putting her frontside on full disapply. She beamed warmly at Penny. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t mind doing the front too, would you? I could throw in one of those massive stuffed dolphin plushies they sell in the gift shop, if it\u2019ll help sweeten the deal!\u201d The friendly woman laughed happily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Penny\u2019s eyes were wholly glued on your body, just as you yourself were glued to Elisa. Smashed under her tit and unable to wiggle or reform in the slightest, the past five minutes had thoroughly stuck you to her breast like a sticker. You were exposed to the air and sun once more, but still adorned Elisa\u2019s breast until you could get free. You focused all your effort on reforming (which you still didn\u2019t quite know how to do, mentally speaking), and also made eye contact with your sister. You felt confident she'd save you soon, but the longer she hesitated, the more confused you were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPenny saw you looking at her, and she winced. She began to reach a hand out to help you, when Elisa spoke up, a bemused expression on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry, this is weirding you out, isn\u2019t it? A stranger asking you to fondle their body. I\u2019m super sorry. I\u2019ve just been dying for this tan for months now, and with the excellent job you\u2019ve done so far, I know I\u2019ll be looking like a crazy sexy tanned goddess!\u201d Elisa grinned. \u201cSo don\u2019t feel weird about this, alright? I\u2019d say we\u2019re practically friends by now!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPenny\u2019s blush kicked into overdrive, and her breathing hitched. It dawned on her just how oblivious Elisa was to her tiny sister\u2019s fate, as your position below Elisa\u2019s nipple on her right breast utterly blocked you from view. All the power in this situation fell into Penny\u2019s hands, and that thought alone made her feel some kind of way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at you, all she could see was that nameless tiny she\u2019d plucked off the street years ago, as she did pretty much this exact same thing but used August as her tool. It had made her feel so good back then, and seeing it play out again now stirred those old feelings anew. All the while, the moral part of her mind screamed at her to rescue her poor older sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhatever she chose to do next, it would entirely decide your fate.</span></div></div>",

She obviously couldn't leave her sister behind on this strange woman's breast, no matter how much she enjoyed watching tiniest get squished. She tried not to stare at her sister's tiny form as she continued to lather Elisa's breasts with lotion, covering every spot except her sister's location. Then, as subtly as she could, she slipped her fingernail along her skin and peeled her now pancake shaped sister off of Elisa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Agh, think you scratched me.\" Elisa said, clapping her hand to her breast, slapping where you had been only a moment before. From your position in Penny's hand you watched as Elisa's breast jiggled from the impact, realizing you easily could have remained part of her tit permanently if Penny hadn't saved you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry about that, my bad.\" Penny said, hopping to her feet and hiding you behind her back in one movement. You were hanging in front of your sister's giant ass now, hidden from the sunbather who'd smashed you. \"I was just finishing up anyways.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No worries, thanks for all your help.\" Elisa said, smiling and waving to her new friend as she backed away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPenny pulled you back in front of her as she turned back towards her towel, watching with her usual interest as the tiny girl in her hand reformed back into her sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks for the save Penny. Glad I'm not stuck to her giant tit anymore.\" You said. \"Please be more careful though. I can't get squished like that again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could see the conflict on your sister's face. Penny was clearly trying to tell you something, if she could just find the words. Finally, she spoke: \"About that Alex. I don't think there's any way to keep you from being squished. I think that's just part of being a tiny. Which is why I'm going to make sure you get squished the right way.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean Penny? You can't just let me get squished!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPenny shook her head. \"You don't understand Alex. I'm saying you're going to get squished no matter what, so I'm going to make sure we do it safely. I'll flatten you into something for me or August, and you can stay like that until we get home. Then once we are home from vacation we can figure something out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? Penny that's the dumbest thing I've ever heard! Don't you dare-\" Your voice was cut off as Penny pressed her thumb down on your mouth, squishing it shut as she prepared her plan. You could tell from the grin on her face that this wasn't just for your sake. She was clearly enjoying this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does Penny turn Alex into? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. Penny decides to turn Alex into a tattoo on her butt cheek, letting her fully reform into her normal girl shape and then flattening and tanning her into her skin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. Penny makes Alex into a hair tie and uses her to tie her hair up into a pony tail. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. Penny squeezes Alex into a bikini bottom and slips her into August's suitcase when she goes back to the room.</span></div></div>",

Inspiration struck you, and you realized that heading towards the door would be a surefire way to get noticed, as you could get the attention of both the visitor at the door AND whoever in your family went to open it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith this plan in mind, you walked the rest of the length of the hallway to the stairs, and then descended down to the first floor. It was a tiring process of crawling to the edge of the step, falling down and squishing slightly, reforming, and then doing it all again for every single step. All told, it took you over five minutes to descend the stairs, then another few minutes to reach the living room. Honestly, it was unlikely anyone was even at the door anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr, you would\u2019ve believed that had the sound of keys being lodged into the lock not begin mere seconds after having that thought. Continuing to walk across the living room, your steps grew slower and slower as keys jangled in the lock, and then the handle began to turn. From your vantage, you couldn\u2019t see a thing but a blurry silhouette through the window, but guessed it was someone your family knew well if they had their own set of keys to your house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the door began swinging open, you glanced behind yourself, seeing no other member of your family yet. Suddenly, you were struck with terrible fear at watching the door swing inwards. Your truly insignificant scale was now dawning on you, your new vulnerabilities and pathetic size striking a depressing level of fear into you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was way too late to do anything about that, though, as the door finished opening, and the mysterious visitor stepped inside.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was impossible not to recognize the titanic form of your best friend Yumi Hada as the door finished swinging open, and she stepped inside. Of course she\u2019d have her own key to the house, you\u2019d given her a spare copy with your mother\u2019s permission years ago. She spent so much time hanging out at your house that Priscilla just about considered her a fourth daughter. You had no idea why she was here right now though, but to be honest, your mind was a bit more preoccupied to dwell on that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYumi\u2019s sheer size was unfathomable from your new perspective. Yumi had always been a few inches taller than you, and undeniable more developed than your own slim frame, but she was practically a goddess now. Her pitch-black hair was impeccably swept in a hanging position over half her face, and she was dressed in low-cut midriff baring purple blouse and matching purple miniskirt. Her rather large boobs threatened to spill from her top with each step she took, and her wide hips and sizable booty stretched the fibers of her skirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour cheeks burned bright red, and you couldn\u2019t look away from her no matter how hard you tried. Your crush on her was just about blossoming into a full-on devotion to worship her, and you had to physically slap yourself out of your trance of admiration for your curvaceous giantess friend. It was a good thing you did so too, because after closing the door behind herself and setting down her purse, Yumi strolled right in your direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPanicking, you shouted up to her frantically, but your tinny voice didn\u2019t reach her ears. The rational part of your brain was confused by this, because you always remembered tinies having shockingly powerful voices for their size. Perhaps your newly shrunken vocal cords hadn\u2019t matured yet. Regardless, the primal part of your brain took over, and you ran like heel out of the way of your titanic best friend and her massive flip-flops slamming into the floor closer and closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou just barely avoided being crushed to flat paste under her heel, landing on your back and staring straight up at her. Once more, you momentarily lost your rational thinking, as your eyes greedily rushed up Yumi\u2019s long, shapely legs and up under her miniskirt. You could just barely make out her jiggling bubble butt way up above you, humongous and perfectly sculpted. Once more, you slapped your cheek to refocus your thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting up, you watched as Yumi walked to the middle of the room and peered down the hallway towards the kitchen, wondering where everyone was. She was standing close to the armrest of the couch, and an idea sprung into your mind to scale the couch, climb up the armrest, and then shout for her attention from there. Deciding on this plan of action, you began sprinting closer to her, though your pace lessened as you heard someone descending from the second floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA moment later, Priscilla, only clad in a revealing bath robe, rounded the corner. She smiled warmly at Yumi, and embraced the girl in a hug. Yumi returned the hug enthusiastically, loving your mother dearly, and fully embracing her unorthodox position as the fourth Hayes daughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYumi, dear. How are you? What brings you here?\u201d Your mother gushed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYumi grinned. \u201cI\u2019m doing pretty good, Miss Hayes. Figured it was a beautiful morning for a walk, so I stopped by! Hope I\u2019m not waking anybody up.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPriscilla waved her hand dismissively. \u201cOh, please. We always have time for you in this house, Yumi. As long as you don\u2019t mind my attire.\u201d Your mom giggled, and gestured to her bath robe, which was already slipping off her shoulders and revealing the thickness underneath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot at all.\u201d Yumi chuckled. \u201cYou look absolutely killer, Miss Hayes. Own it!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mom blushed at the compliment. \u201cStop it, Yumi. You flatter little old me.\u201d She smiled good-naturedly. \u201cBesides, you\u2019re a rather developed young woman yourself to. That outfit is sure to turn heads!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYumi spun in a small circle, her abundant curves shaking as she did so. \u201cIt is, isn\u2019t it? Actually, I was going to show it off to Alex. Is she still asleep?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mom frowned slightly, but still maintained her cheery demeanor. \u201cActually, she\u2019s at a party. Or rather, sleeping over at one. She didn\u2019t tell me much, just that it might be a few days until she\u2019s home again. Must be quite a party\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour best friend nodded. \u201cGuess so. Maybe I\u2019ll check in on her later.\u201d The Japanese giantess stretched her arms and looked back to the door, where she\u2019d set her purse. \u201cAnyway, I won\u2019t hold you up. I\u2019ve got some errands and such to take care of today. Boring stuff.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPriscilla laughed, and gripped Yumi\u2019s shoulder affectionately. \u201cI know how that is, dear. Well, have fun today.\u201d She moved back to the stairs, then turned once more. \u201cYou know, if it isn\u2019t too weird for you, you can call me \u2018mom\u2019. You\u2019re over so much you\u2019re practically another of my daughter\u2019s anyway!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYumi\u2019s face lit up beautifully, making her look like an angel. \u201cAwesome! I\u2019ll be sure to do that, mom!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPriscilla beamed happily then sauntered upstairs, and Yumi turned on her heel and strolled back to the front door, a skip in her step. Unfortunately, as you\u2019d been so distracted by the conversation between your best friend and your mom, you hadn\u2019t made as much progress to the couch as you\u2019d planned, and all you\u2019d really ended up doing was putting yourself significantly closer to Yumi\u2026and now directly in her path.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith little time to react, you could only weakly brace yourself as Yumi\u2019s right leg swung forward with her next step. The front of her flip-flop slammed into your stomach, and sent you flying backwards through the air, right towards the front door. Your bug-sized body slapped into the door, bounced off, and then fell straight down and into the open recesses of Yumi\u2019s purse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnable to stop your descent, you slipped deep inside her purse, sliding under her wallet, phone, a few packs of gum, and some loose change. Recovering from the hit, you immediately tried to scramble up and out of the purse, but a second later, Yumi lifted it off the ground, and the weightless feeling knocked you and everything else around, jostling you like crazy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you even finished getting your bearings, you heard the unmistakable zipping sound of the purse closing up, and then everything was darkness. All you could do was rock back and forth as Yumi rhythmically swung her purse side-to-side, off to wherever her next mysterious destination was. You didn\u2019t even try to scream her name at this point, as you knew it was useless. Like it or not, you had nothing to do but wait for your next chance whenever she unzipped her purse again.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Your imprisonment in Yumi\u2019s purse continued for the next twenty minutes as your oblivious best friend walked happily down through the pleasant streets of Owenton, waving and smiling at just about every person she passed. Yumi had a way of making friends with everyone, and brightening up any situation. How much was because of her winning personality, and how much was because of her gorgeous physique, you couldn\u2019t say. Still, Yumi was happy she could make other people smile, and that was enough for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust when you thought your ceaseless swaying and rocking back-and-forth in Yumi\u2019s purse was never going to come to an end, your best friend finally made it to her destination. Though sounds were a bit muffled outside of her purse, you could still hear a multitude of voices chattering indecipherably, and the unmistakable sounds of ovens beeping and fryers burning. Yumi had taken you to Dining Delights.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe curvy Japanese giantess grinned and said good morning to each of her coworkers, before slipping into the employee break room in the back of the restaurant. Setting her purse down, Yumi unlocked her assigned locker and retrieved a small bag from inside, pulling it open to reveal the uniform of Dining Delights: red and brown button-up blouse and brown slacks. Knowing no one else was around, Yumi went about stripping off her current top and skirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChanging into her uniform, Yumi frowned slightly at the annoyance of the uniform\u2019s size. Dining Delights hadn\u2019t owned a uniform that fit Yumi\u2019s well-above-average body, and to this day had not ordered a more comfortable replacement. As such, the buttons barely slid into place, especially around her abundantly sized chest, and the pants hugged her hips and clung to her legs like a vice. Now, Yumi didn\u2019t care that the uniform only accentuated her feminine charms and drew stares. She was a flirt at heart. Yumi just detested how restricting and mildly painful it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing, the black-haired giantess dropped her street clothes into the now empty bag and shoved it back in her locker, then unzipped her purse. Without looking inside it, she stuck a hand in and fished around for her phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMomentarily stunned by the light shining down as Yumi unzipped her purse, you were caught by surprise as her gigantic hand sank into the purse towards you. Trying to dodge it, you failed spectacularly, and found yourself pinned between Yumi\u2019s thumb and her phone. You attempted to squirm free, only to be squished thinner as Yumi clenched her hand around her phone and withdrew it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill not noticing you, Yumi moved to toss her purse back into her locker. As she did so, her grip on you loosened slightly, and you slipped free. Falling through the air for a second, you soon splatted down onto the hard-wooden table below, impacting like a cartoon character by flattening out. You mentally winced at the pain, and went about trying to reform quickly so you could stand back up and get Yumi\u2019s attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning to her phone, Yumi sat down in the chair beside the table, simultaneously kicking off her flip-flops and switching to high heels while also using an application on her phone to clock-in to her shift. This gave you plenty of time to reinflate back to three dimensions, sprint to the edge of the table near Yumi\u2019s arm, and shout up to the heavens.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYUMI! DOWN HERE! PLEASE!\u201d You screeched, hating how pathetic you felt all the while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough initially not showing signs of hearing you, Yumi soon frowned, put down her phone, and turned in her seat towards you. Her giant head tilted down towards you, and she leaned forward. Her beautiful face soon filled your vision entirely, and you began quivering despite yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn inquisitive expression crossed Yumi\u2019s face. \u201cOh, what\u2019s up, tiny? How did you get in here, little one?\u201d She began to smile, and she flicked her finger gently into you in a poking motion, knocking you onto your butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour hopes fell down a peg, but you weren\u2019t deterred. \u201cNo, Yumi! It\u2019s me! IT\u2019S ME, ALEX!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour best friend looked prone to poke at you again, before freezing. Her eyes began to widen as she leaned even closer to you, so close that her cool, minty breath washed over your body when she exhaled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo. Freakin\u2019. Way.\u201d Yumi whispered, expression slack. \u201cA-Alex?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYumi leaned to the side of her chair and shrugged. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry, girl, but I\u2019ve got no clue.\u201d Your best friend shook her head ruefully. \u201cI mean, I thought science said that you couldn\u2019t reverse shrinking.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stomped your foot angrily. \u201cScience also says that girls can\u2019t shrink, yet here I am! I\u2019m an exception to all of this, Yumi! I don\u2019t deserve to be a tiny!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYumi nodded compassionately, but a grin soon broke out on her face. \u201cOn the one hand, I hear you. On the other, you just look so adorable stomping your foot like that. Like a little kid throwing a tantrum. So cute!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gaped, and crossed your arms, only furthering Yumi\u2019s point with your pouty behavior. \u201cStop being mean, Yumi. Do you have any idea how awful it feels to be like this?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNope!\u201d Yumi admitted bluntly. \u201cAnd I\u2019m not saying it isn\u2019t awful. I\u2019m just saying we shouldn\u2019t freak out about this. If we\u2019re confident we can grow you back, then I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll do it! Obviously, I will totally help however I can.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sighed in relief. \u201cThanks, Yumi, that really\u2013\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut!\u201d Your towering best friend smirked playfully. \u201cUntil then\u2026don\u2019t you think we can have some fun how you are now? Like, explore all of our possibilities!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes widened in disbelief. \u201cWhat? No, I just want to\u2013\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLike, imagine that ways we could prank our friends and family when you\u2019re so tiny and adorable like this! Think about it! Or, you and I could do some fun tests\u2026for science, of course! See how far you stretch, how much weight you take before squishing. That sort of thing.\u201d Yumi\u2019s face was alight with passion. \u201cOr, or we could\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Yumi droned on, she was beginning to lean closer and closer to the table, drawing just a bit nearer to you as she did so. Soon, her gargantuan breasts were squeezing against the side of the table, and then rolled on top of it, creeping forward like a steamrolling wall of flesh thinly trapped behind a red blouse. Yumi simply kept prattling, oblivious to what she was doing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou, internally wanting to shout up at her to stop moving, or at least physically back yourself out of harm\u2019s way, instead stood entranced, like a love-struck idiot. Yumi\u2019s breasts squished closer and closer across the table as the distracted giantess listed one \u2018fun\u2019 idea after the other. Your mind was putty, no thoughts crossing your mind save for how massive Yumi was to you, a veritable goddess. Her breasts only were a hundred times your diminutive size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, anyway, I\u2026oops!\u201d Yumi finally took a breath and glanced down, sheepishly noting just how much she rolled her tits onto the table while leaning forward. Scooting back in her chair, she happily noted your position on the table, and that you were unharmed. Grinning, she scooped you up into her hands, moved you up to her face, and puckered her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing Yumi\u2019s lips approach snapped you from your trance, and you genuinely thought she was about to eat you whole. Your voice launched into a cry of panic that was instantly silenced by Yumi\u2019s plush lips enveloping your tiny body. Her lips engulfed you completely, hugging your miniscule naked form from all sides. It was pure ecstasy, and your mind flipped into an entirely different dumbstruck trance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPulling you back from her lips, Yumi giggled at your awed expression, though seemingly missed the fiery blush in your cheeks. \u201cAll I\u2019m saying, Alex, is that we shouldn\u2019t be freaking out about this whole mess. It sucks, yeah, so let\u2019s turn it around by having some fun with it. Look on the bright side, and all that!\u201d She laughed melodically. \u201cBe a shame to not have fun when you\u2019re so darn cute like this, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing Yumi call you cute almost physically affected you, and you grinned like a dope. You were still grinning even as Yumi moved her hand to her prodigious chest, pulled back the small breast pocket on her blouse, and dropped you lightly inside. The fall disoriented you a bit, so you scrambled to flip yourself around, ending up with most of your body in the pocket, and only your head poking out from the top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWh-what are you doing?\u201d You asked her, still trying to calm down from that unexpected kissing tease.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKeeping you safe. Don\u2019t want you to be alone, right?\u201d Yumi gave you a thumbs-up. \u201cThis way, you\u2019ll be close to my heart for the whole shift!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blushed brighter, and pulled yourself deeper into her pocket to avoid her seeing you. \u201cTh-thanks\u2026Yumi.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnytime, ya cute tiny!\u201d Yumi grinned, then stood up. \u201cAlright, work time. I\u2019m behind a bit as is.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Yumi strolled purposefully from the break room, pushing open the door and heading out to the kitchen. With each step, her breasts jostled slightly. Even Yumi\u2019s bra and the tight blouse together couldn\u2019t fully control them, and the effects of their jiggling were doubled pronounced on you. You could feel the ripples of her flesh through the thin fabric of the blouse, the warmth of her flesh emanating into your small pocket and turning it into a sort of heated bed for you to curl up in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking further into the kitchen, Yumi glanced around to see where she\u2019d be needed next. Her gaze fell on one of the chefs who was in the midst of stirring a massive pot of meat sauce. Intoxicated by the smell, and eager to help out if needed, Yumi wandered over, smiled at the chef, and leaned forward to take a whiff of the pot of sauce.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Admittedly, it took you more than a second to recognize the person who had appeared in the doorway. The woman was towering and stunningly beautiful, with firm and abundant curves accentuated alluringly by her tight, dark blue button-up blouse and form-hugging, dark blue dress slacks. However, as you took in the sight of her strawberry blonde hair pulled back in a bun, pale skin that suggested a lot of time indoors, and trademark glasses, you pieced it together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was your Aunt Jenna, the 38-year-old younger sister of your mother, so of course she\u2019d have a key to your house. Jenna had a relatively secretive job as a scientist at some biochemical lab right outside of Owenton. You recalled it being named \u2018Futureworks\u2019, or something along those lines. Though she lived only ten minutes away, you only saw her every few months, as her work kept her incredibly busy. She was a nice and caring woman, if a tad eccentric with her overly analytical and boundlessly curious nature.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had no idea why she had stopped by, but what you did know was that she was walking right towards you, and the sight of her three-inch heels clacking against the floor steadily in your direction sent an uncontrollable panic through your body. Dashing to the side, you narrowly avoiding being reduced to a smear, and watched from the floor as Jenna approached the couch and gently sat down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight as Jenna sat down, she took off her glasses and produced a silky cloth from her pocket. She began to rub the lenses of her glasses to clean them. A moment later, and your older sister August meandered out of the kitchen, pancake crammed into her mouth. Spotting Jenna, she walked closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey there auntie!\u201d August grinned, startlingly Jenna, who proceeded to drop her glasses onto the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGoodness, Penny! You just about gave me a heart attack.\u201d Jenna sighed, catching her breath. \"Have you grown?\" She inquired, and August threw her a lopsided grin, putting her hands on her hips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPenny? Geez, auntie. Still blind as a bat without your glasses, huh?\u201d Your sister teased, prompting a frown and furrowed brow from Jenna. A moment later, your aunt gaped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, you really are August, aren\u2019t you. My apologies, darling.\u201d Jenna grimaced and blushed. \u201cThat\u2019s embarrassing. Yes, I am still a bumbling fool without my glasses.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I wouldn\u2019t say fool.\u201d August sat down on the couch beside her. \u201cYou\u2019re the smartest person I know. How\u2019s all that science-y stuff going down at the lab?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenna smiled coyly. \u201cWell, you know I can\u2019t tell you much in detail. All I can say is that it\u2019s going well, but we\u2019ve hit a wall. We haven\u2019t had a tiny volunteer for trial experiments for the past month, and it\u2019s stalling our research.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour older sister cooed. \u201cOoh, you get to play with tinies all day long! I wish that was my job!\u201d The auburn-haired girl smiled dreamily. \u201cI\u2019m lucky if I get one or two in the classes I teach. And NONE when I\u2019m coaching the girls\u2019 swim team.\u201d She winked at Jenna. \u201cYa know, because, duh! There aren\u2019t any tiny girls. Wouldn\u2019t that be adorable though?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenna laughed, and continued her conversation with August, while down on the floor, you winced at your older sister\u2019s unintentionally ironic statement. Still, you hoped that getting the attention of Jenna would be the easy solution to your troubles. August had spoken true in calling her smart. Jenna was a certifiable genius, and she\u2019d surely have a way of reversing this curse you\u2019d been inflicted with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReaching the floor near her feet, you paled momentarily in the presence of Jenna\u2019s lightly tapping heels, each impacting causing the tiniest of reverberations that shook your balance. Beside her feet were her glasses, still not picked up. In your mind, you reasoned that putting yourself beside them was a surefire way to get noticed by Jenna, and secure your rescue. To this end, you crept over to her glasses and waited patiently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later, and August stood back up. \u201cWell, I\u2019m hitting the gym in a minute. It was really nice talking to you again, auntie!\u201d She grinned, and Jenna smiled back. \u201cI\u2019ll go tell mom that you\u2019re here. Hopefully you actually recognize her!\u201d August said with a lilting laugh, and headed upstairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenna winced, and called after her. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, August!\u201d She shook her head ruefully, then glanced down at her feet. \u201cSpeaking of, though, it\u2019s about time I pick these up.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou braced yourself for the moment of truth as your titanic giantess aunt leaned forward in her seat and reached down to the floor to pick up her glasses. Her massive hand drew nearer and nearer, eventually clasping around her glasses. As soon as it was close enough, you began beating your fists on her thumb and yelling out Jenna\u2019s name. Surprisingly, it worked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenna\u2019s hand recoiled a bit, knocking you onto your butt in the process, and your aunt moved her face even closer to you. Her face filled the sky, and her eyes looked at you intently, blinking rapidly. Frightened out of your wits, you gave her a half-hearted wave. For some reason, Jenna showed no signs of recognizing you, and your blood ran cold as you realized she hadn\u2019t put her glasses back on yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2026is that?\u201d Your aunt whispered, her breath blowing out your hair from the wind at this close distance. Having moved from fear to pure terror, you were too paralyzed to even think of moving, and just sat there stupidly, waiting with bated breath for what Jenna did next.</span></div></div>",

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\"><u><b>Backstory (Written by Hectic)</b></u><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn an event that some called a medical mystery and others called an act of god, a type of shrinking virus spread to every corner of the earth, affecting part of the population while leaving another part completely fine. Those who fell victim to this virus rapidly shrunk down to one inch tall, but at the same time gained a strange durability and malleability that has baffled scientists and doctors alike. However, the tiny people were not ones to complain about these newfound characteristics, as they were the only things preventing their lives from being taken by a stray step or anything else of that nature. The third most interesting aspect about this inexplicable shrinking is the fact that only men seem to have suffered from it, with women across the world remaining completely unaffected. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom the first day of the shrinking event it was expected that society would change drastically, and while it definitely did, surprisingly much of it remained the same. There was no evil women\u2019s takeover or forced servitude of the now smaller men. For the most part, many men who had a job that did not require physical labor of any kind were able to continue living somewhat normal lives. Certain laws were put into place which prevented too much malicious behavior from befalling the tiny men, but these were really only enforced when a woman would purposefully try to kill, kidnap, or otherwise torture them. The vast majority of the time women would get away with any accidents between them and the tiny guys with a small slap on the wrists.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><b>Your Story</b></u><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy now, 50 years have passed since the initial shrinking virus epidemic first swept across the globe. Humanity has adapted, and made great strides to accommodate the tiny population. Entirely separate tiny housing communities, tiny school systems, and tiny restaurants now exist in many places across the USA. Companies readily produce tiny-sized clothing and food, and the first bikes for tinies just hit the shelves (any other tiny vehicles are still a ways off). For all intents and purpose, life has adapted to the new normal, though circumstances are still far from perfect between tinies and their normal-sized counterparts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd, of course, men continue to be the only victims of the shrinking virus, the sole gender that makes up the tiny population. Or at least...they were until today. But now, in the modest Californian town of Owenton, things are about to change forever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><b>Main Characters</b></u><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u>Alexandra Hayes (You)</u> - The main character, and 20 years old. You normally go by \"Alex\". You have tanned skin and a lithe, slim body, more acrobatic than athletic. You style your dirty blonde hair in wavy fall down to your neck, framing your face and bringing out your blue eyes. You know that you're still attractive, and you've been hit on before, but you're always self-conscious of your less than pronounced curves (especially in comparison to the rest of your family) and below average height (you are only 5'5\"). Since graduating from Owenton High School, you've been working at the local diner \"Dining Delights\" as a waitress, hoping for your social vlog to take off. You detest tinies, finding them to be nothing but bugs, and will gladly toy around with one if they cross your path. You're also more than a little interested in girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u>August Hayes</u> - Your older sister, and 26 years old. Her tanned skintone is a shade darker from her hours out in the sun, giving her an alluring presence. Her messy hair, auburn colored, is almost always tied back in a ponytail. Her hazel eyes complete the look. August is unbelievably beautiful, something you've always envied her because of. She's 6'0\", fit and toned, and possesses a curvaceous body most girls your age would kill for. Somehow, August seems to be constantly unaware of her own sex appeal, and never seems to notice people staring at her sizable chest or prodigious rear end. Doesn't help that her choice in clothing is frequently tight and/or revealing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, August doesn't notice a lot of things. If there's anything you can say about your older sister, it's that she's an oblivious, scatter-brained airhead. She's liable to set her phone down on a chair, talk to you for a second, and then plop right back down on her phone, then proceed to wonder where it went for the next hour. It's pretty endearing, and aside from that, she's a hard worker and a great motivator. Those characteristics are a probable cause as to why she was hired as a gym teacher at Owenton High School, and was also appointed coach for the girl's swim team. She loves her job...almost as much as she loves tinies. Contrasting with your own sharp distaste for tinies, August finds them infinitely adorable and cute. She can hardly contain herself around them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u>Penelope Hayes</u> - Your younger sister, and 18 years old. She frequently goes by \"Penny\". Her skintone is tanned similarly to your own, and her blue eyes are also a mirror of your own. A key difference is in her hair: Penelope's brighter blonde tresses are much longer, and hang down like a waterfall to her mid-back. Another key difference is in the looks department. Standing at 5'9\", Penny is already four inches taller than you, despite being two years younger. Penny is also a good size or two bigger than you in the chest department, and the rest of her body is similarly developed (though far from August's levels of curviness). The disparity between you and her frustrates you to no end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat frustration is not a two-way street, however. Penny adores you, almost to an unhealthy degree. As August was away at college earning her bachelor's and then master's degree, Penny only had you to fully rely on while growing up, and she's since come to idolize you. This extends to your hatred of tinies, which Penny has wholeheartedly jumped on board with. In fact, Penny's almost fanatical with her torment of tinies, like she personally enjoys every second of it. It's extreme, even for you. Regardless, when she's not being a tiny-focused sadist, Penny performs in the Owenton High School theater productions, and she also is a member of the girls' soccer team. She just started her senior year.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u>Priscilla Hayes</u> - Your mother, and 44 years old. One look at her, and it isn't hard to see where the family resemblance came from in the Hayes household. Priscilla has the same tanned skintone she passed onto her daughters. Her eyes are hazel, like August's, and her hair is a strawberry blonde color, like a mix between you and your sisters' hair colors. Priscilla keeps her hair short, in a stylish bob. She is also 5'10\". Of course, one would be forgiven if they didn't notice Priscilla's hair or eyes first when looking at her. Your mother has only grown more beautiful with age, and she's an absolutely vision. Though she's gained weight since quitting her old job to work from home, its gone to all the right places as far as most people are concerned. Priscilla has impressive curves and a hourglass body to die for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatching her heavenly beauty is her angelic disposition. Priscilla is a doting, loving mother who would do anything for her darling angels. Overbearing to a fault, Priscilla showers you and your sisters with love daily. Her profession is that of clothing designer, and she runs her own online store for her fashion designs. People from across the country send in their commissioned designs, your mom expertly creates them (in a spare room in your house she converted into a clothing design studio), then ships the finished products out. Your mom loves her work, especially when she utilizes the latest in Micro-Flex brand stretchy and squishy material. Priscilla is also spontaneous and energetic, prone to planning surprise family trips and trying crazy new things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u>Yumi Hada</u> - Your best friend, and also 20 years old. She is of Japanese descent, and has silky smooth and lightly tanned skin, brown eyes, and straight black hair with bangs that she keeps swept across her part of her face. Yumi stands at 5'8\", and constantly teases you about her height advantage. An early bloomer, Yumi has been well-developed since middle school, and her body has only grown since then. Her chest is quite large, as is her butt, and since she doesn't exercise as much as she knows she should, there's a certain jiggliness to her curves that frequently draws eyes. Kids used to call her \"fat\" in middle school, but it wasn't long before the term morphed to \"thicc\", and everyone was asking her out. Yumi is bi-sexual, and a bit of a flirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYumi hardly takes anything in life seriously, often coasting through day-to-day with a lackadaisical attitude and devil may care outlook. She's the first to volunteer for anything and everything, and her infectious optimism and sense of humor drags you along often too. Yumi comes from a family of wealth, and therefore is more than enough well-off to just coast through life. She's also a mischievous prankster who will never pass up the opportunity to mess with someone, but always in good fun. Similarly to August, she finds tinies to be cute, but instead of wanting to love and hold them, Yumi's first instinct is to play with them a bit, especially if it involves a prank. She tolerates your much crueler behavior towards tinies, but never participates. Currently, you see her every single week while working at \"Dining Delights\", since she is also a waitress there. You've had a crush on her for years now, but have been way too afraid of making your friendship weird by mentioning it to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><b>Minor Characters</b></u><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u>Aunt Jenna</u> - Your mother's sister and your aunt, and a stunning 38 year old woman. She's similar to your mother in some ways, while different in others. Her skintone is considerably paler due to her time spent indoors every day because of her profession, but she has the same hazel eyes and strawberry blonde hair, which she keeps pulled back in a bun most of the time. She also wears glasses, and is just about blind as a bat without them. She's tall, standing at 6'0\", and possesses an attractive body without being quite as absurdly bountiful as your mother. Her curves are substantial, but definitely more modest in comparison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenna works in a lab just outside of Owenton, a head scientist for a biochemical company known as Futureworks. She works long and stressful hours, so even though she lives close by, you aren't able to see her much. When you do see her, she's frequently ready to party, drink, and let loose, which is her way of destressing from her job. She has an unabated fascination in tinies, finding them curious little specimens, and she's told you that Futureworks often hires tiny workers to serve in lab tests. You aren't sure what those are all about, as everything in the lab is kept top secret. Still, Jenna is a humorous and good-spirited woman, and you like spending time with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>More to be added in the future!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><b>Quick Rules</b></u><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis story is written in primarily second person (you, your, etc.) Please keep it that way. However, if you want to write a bit from someone else's perspective, third person can work for that when needed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex cannot die. She can only be squished, squashed, flattened, stretched, and anything else you think of. She will reform in time, given the chance to do so. Keep the story going!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTry not to write chapters that are exceptionally short. A bridge chapter from time to time is just fine, but too many and the story starts feeling weak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLastly, avoid heavily sexual/insertion content and any giant male content. Basically, just don't introduce any other guys into the story, UNLESS they too are tiny. That could be interesting (just make sure Alex is always the main character). Everything else goes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRead, add, and enjoy!</td>",
