You spotted several party goers sprawled out on the floor still asleep an saw the wreckage of a killer graduation party.  As you did so though you caught a rather strange sight.  You blinked twice and realized that you were staring at the wall in a way that should be impossible, as the rest of you would have to be INSIDE the wall!  \"What the hell...\"  You say slowly, trying to readjust yourself to see how this was possible.  Despite your best effort though you couldn't seem to move, and when you tried concentrating you realized that the whole of your body was totally numb!  \"What the shit?\"  You begin to panic, scrambling for ideas.  Has you broken your neck?  Were you still dreaming?  Why can't you move or feel anything except for your head?!<br>\r\n\"Hey champ, how are we feeling today?\"  You hear a female voice say coldly from behind you.<br>\r\n\"Huh?  Who's that?\"  You ask, unable to get a view on the person.<br>\r\nThe person laughs a dry and humorless laugh and states \"It's Elizabeth silly, who else would it be?  I should just tell you that it's nine forty five, so you have a little less than forty hours remaining to win our bet.\"  She said.<br>\r\n\"What bet?  What are you...\"  Then you remember.<br>\r\nIt was a mean thing to do, but after threatening to make your head explode using her spells if you didn't turn the music down you had had enough.  You called Elizabeth out for her bullshit. You told her that her magical crap was all a bunch of bullshit to make her seem cool and mysterious and said that if she knew how to use such powerful magic she'd have more than one friend.  You knew it was an awful thing to say, especially since it made Damien laugh his ass off, but after spending the whole party complaining that the music was too loud, that there were too many people, that you were too young to be drinking, that the chips tasted stale, etc. you were fed up with her, especially since you only invited her because Helen made you.<br>\r\nThen Elizabeth made a bet with you.  She made you take three shots for memory loss and impaired motor skills, then she told you the terms.  If her magic was real then you'd have all of your body parts separated and partied with for the night and would have only 48 hours to get them all back.  If you failed, any parts that you didn't have attached to you could NEVER be put back on!  If she didn't have magic though, or if you found all eighteen (nineteen if you counted your head) of your parts Elizabeth would become your personal slave.  You accepted.<br>\r\nWell first off she obviously had magic, as you were now just a head lying on the ground.  Second you realized that holy shit she actually was a witch, and third you realized that you had no idea where all of your parts were, as everything after the three shots was just a haze.<br>\r\n\"Well, I better get going.  Good luck!\"  Elizabeth said, walking out of the room.<br>\r\nShit, this was bad!  So, you're Sam, but WHO are you?</span></div></div>",

You weren't fat by any stretch but you were not well muscled, and couldn't do much physical activity without getting winded.  You sported a cute if slightly boyish face with short brown hair and big brown eyes that won you a fair amount of attention from more sensitive ladies.  Your downstairs was average according to your limited knowledge of the subject but the girls who had experienced it all said you used it well enough.  You had had your share of girlfriends (3) but where currently in a transitional period after a nasty break up a month ago.<br>\r\nNow however that all seemed irrelevant as you were currently not really a man at all, just a disembodied head lying on its side while the clock ticked away!  You where about to call out for help when you realized to your horror that the person closest to you was Damien, who was known to be a light sleeper.  Waking him up while you were like this would be damn near suicidal, and you're sure that he would take the opportunity to fuck you over like he did every time he had the opportunity to do so.  You cursed under your breath at the shitty luck, until something caught your eye.<br>\r\nLying just two feet away from you was your cell phone, a crappy little flip phone, but it still appeared to have charge!  You began inching your way across the floor with your jaw, taking an agonizingly long time to cross such a short distance.  You became acutely aware of the fact that with each nudge you were getting closer to Damien's bearded face, but had to push those thoughts aside as the phone was so close to you now!<br>\r\nWith only last nudge you were on it!  You triumphantly stick your tongue out to press three to start speed dialing your sister Maya, knowing that she hadn't drunk a lick last night and would be the most likely to wake.  You press down with your tongue...</span></div></div>",

Maya it's Sam.  Listen, I need you to come down stairs and get me now!  It's kind of an emergency, so hurry!\"  You whisper, trying not to rouse anyone else.<br>\r\n\"What do you mean come get you?  Why don't... wait...\"  She put the pieces together, remembering what had happened last night.  You heard her laughing both through the receiver and faintly from upstairs, laughing uproariously at your predicament.  When she finally settled down almost a minute later she spoke into the phone again, still giggling.  \"What's wrong?  Are you in over your head?\"  She joked.<br>\r\n\"Not funny!\"  You hissed, not wanting to waste a second while your body parts were still on the line.  \"Now help me out!\"<br>\r\n\"Hey, I'm not the one who blew his top and got on the bad side of a witch!\"  She responded.<br>\r\n\"Hey, you didn't believe that she was a witch either!\"  You defended.<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but I wouldn't have been a huge dick head about it!\"<br>\r\n\"Shut up and help!\"  You commanded.<br>\r\nShe finally agreed.  \"Fine, I'll be down in a second my little knucklehead, just stay put!\"  She chirped.  You softly groan at her last joke before hearing her hang up.  Moments later you hear her come down the stairs and soon her perfectly manicured feet come into view.  You feel her soft hands wrap around your head and lift you to eye level, revealing her grinning face.  \"Hey sleepy head, how are you doing?\"  She asked, giggling at her excuse for being clever.<br>\r\n\"I swear, when I have Elizabeth my personal slave, I'm going to magic your voice away!\"  You spit bitterly, causing Maya to laugh.<br>\r\n\"Yeah yeah, IF you get all of your parts back.  Speaking of parts, lucky for you, I have one stashed up in my room for you!  I was able to find it before I went to bed.\"  She informed you.  Excellent, after only being up for a few minutes you had a part back!  One down, seventeen to go!  Maya carefully steps over all of the sleeping guests and carries you to her room.

Maya smiled and set you down on her bed, atop some of the pillows.   She looks at you for a small while, smiling at you a she did.  \"You know, if we can't find all of your parts in time, you'd make an awesome pillow.\"  She remarked.<br>\r\n\"We ARE going to go look for my body parts, right?\"  You affirm, hoping that your sister hadn't just given up on you already.<br>\r\n\"Oh, of course Sam!  I'm just saying that IF we don't find them all...\"<br>\r\n\"Let's not talk about that.\"  You state, already nervous about the prospect.  \"Let's just talk about getting me together.  So, do you happen to know where any of my other body parts might be?\"<br>\r\nMaya thinks for a minute, then says \"Yeah, I think I know where one or two might be.  Tom probably has one, as I told him to snag a piece before he went to bed.  Damien probably has a few but I think it may be hard to get them from him.  If we could get his girlfriend Gina on our side-\"<br>\r\n\"Gertrude.\"  You correct.<br>\r\n\"Whatever.  Anyway if we can get his girlfriend on our <br>\r\nSide we might just be able to get some parts out of the two of them.  I'm pretty sure Natasha snagged a piece of you... knowing her it was probably either a hand or your... yeah.  So, who do you think we should talk to?  Tom is the most likely to just give the part back, Natasha probably has a valuable piece of you, and Damien probably has several of your parts.  They're all potentials.\"<br>\r\nYou think for a moment, and decide on ________.<br>\r\n\"Alright, fair enough.\"  Maya agrees.  She hoists you up, but finds you pretty heavy, and she struggles to carry you.  \"Are you kidding me Maya?  I can't weigh more than twenty five pounds right now, are you little chicken bone arms serious not up to that?\"<br>\r\n\"Shut up, or I swear I'll drop you!\"  She says, setting you back down on the bed.  \"Yeah, I'm not carrying you around all weekend, we're going to have to find some other way of moving you around.\"  She says.  She starts looking around the room and spots...<br>\r\n\"NO!\"  You shout.<br>\r\n\"Well I'm not carrying you.  It's either that or you get to e my pillow for life.\"  She says.<br>\r\n\"Come on, it's demeaning!\"<br>\r\n\"More so than being just a head being carried around?  Because that's the only way I'll be lugging you around.\"<br>\r\nYou sigh, accepting your fate.  \"Fine.  Go ahead.\"<br>\r\nMaya walks into the corner of he room and grabs the stroller that she had been using for home ec class.  Normally a practice baby was place in there, but currently it was in it's crib.  She brought the stroller up to the bed and moved you into it.<br>\r\n\"Comfy?\"  Maya teased.<br>\r\n\"Fuck you.\"  You replied.<br>\r\nMaya wheeled you out of the room and the two of you went to find...</span></div></div>",

If you generally like my work I think you'll like this.  Anyway, back to this story!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt would be best to get the easy parts out of the way first (no pun intended) so you decided on meeting up with your brother Tom to see if he had any of your pieces on him.  It was luckily a short stroll down the hallway, luckily not passing anyone.  Maya knocks on the door to Tom's stairwell loudly, knowing that he would be hard to rouse.  Tom resided in the attic of your house, having set up a small room, gym, and office up there for himself.  In all honesty there was no need for Tom to live with your family, he had earned 85K in the stock market last year alone and had only spent a couple thousand of it, mostly on gifts for his two siblings and your parents.  You think he was just afraid of being alone, hell the man occasionally used a night light after he watches horror movies.  Plus it was probably for the best as Tom was about the furthest you could think of from a reasonable and capable adult, and despite having some sort of omniscient super sense when it came to bond trading he had difficulty walking and talking at the same time without tripping.<br>\r\nAfter a long series of knocks the two of you hear unintelligible mumbling and groans.  \"Tom, come down here, we need your help!\"  Maya calls, causing Tom to slur out more nonsense.  Tom was not a morning person, and you could tell that he had had one too many drinks last night (that number being one drink, as Tom was a notorious lightweight) and was a bit hung over.  \"Up and at 'em, it's time to get Sam back in one piece.\"<br>\r\nTom muttered something but stopped halfway through it.  There was a long silence, followed by rapid stomping down the stairs, then rapid falling down the stairs, then rapid getting back up.  Tom flung the door open, slightly glassed over eyes now as wide as disks.  He stared at you for a long time, awkward silence building as he did nothing but breathe through his mouth and stare.  \"Holy hell, I wasn't dreaming!\"  He said, finally breaking the silence.  \"Elizabeth really did take you apart!\"<br>\r\n\"Your powers of observation are astounding Tom.\"  You say with a roll of your eyes.  \"Now would you please help me get back together, we're on a time limit here!\"<br>\r\nTom nods in dopey fashion before lifting you up and carrying you up the stairs, Maya rolling the now empty stroller up behind you two.  \"Yeah, Maya told me to grab something before I went to bed, and if I remember correctly...\"  He trails off, setting you back in the stroller to search around his cluttered living quarters.  Soon enough Tom announces \"Ah, here we go!\"  and produces...</span></div></div>",

While the thought of someone like Natasha having a \"valuable\" piece of you isn't exactly unpleasant, you'd rather not run the risk of losing <i>that</i> particular part. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where is Natasha?\" you ask as Maya pushes you out of her room and into the hallway. She stops just before the flight of stairs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not sure, but I'm willing to be she isn't alone,\" Maya says as she turns you around in the stroller and carefully backs you down the steps. In the seat of the stroller, you cringe with each bump.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWorriedly, you mutter, \"Careful... careful... care-\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm trying, shut up! You're buckled in anyway.\" Maya shouts at you. The two of you reach the bottom step and you breathe a sight of relief. Maya turns your stroller around and pushes you through the empty living room.  No sign of Damien and again you breathe a sigh of relief, until you realize that that means he's made off with a piece of you and you curse. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Quick, look around, see if you can find something!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaya checks around the living room, lifting up couch cushions and checking underneath the furniture. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anything?\" you ask. Maya just comes up shaking her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing in here. Let's check the kitchen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaya wheels your stroller through the living room and into the dining room, which is also empty. You had expected to find somebody left over from last night's party, but the house seems empty with the exception of Maya and what's left of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like everybody went home,\" she says. Maya checks around the kitchen, opening cupboards and the refrigerator, but coming up empty handed. \"And there's nothing in here either.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shit! Now what are we going to do!\" you shout. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaya nervously chuckles and mutters, \"That pillow thing sounded kind of nice...\" You growl, if you had hands, they'd be wrapped around Maya's throat. Maya laughs. \"Relax\", she says, \"We've still got time. We're gonna get you together. Natasha lives just up the street, we'll go get your... <i>stuff</i>.\"<br>\r\nMaya wheels you towards the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait- you can't take me out like this!\", but Maya continues.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I'm not going to get <i>that</i> by myself. Besides, this is all your doing, remember? The least you can do is come with me while I push you around all day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you can protest further, Maya pushes you out into the day.Sitting there in a baby stroller, no arms, legs, hips; little more than a head and a bust, you feel absolutely humiliated. If you had hands, they'd be covering your eyes. You lower your head, blushing as Maya continues to push you down the sidewalk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is so humiliating...\" you mutter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh hush, nobody's even around. Besides, they'll just think your my baby.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm a man, dammit!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well.. actually... no. Not until we see Natasha, anyway.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grumble and resign to your embarrassment. She has a point. After a couple of blocks, Maya pushes you up the walkway of the modest home of Natasha's foreign exchange family. Maya pushes you towards the steps. She leans the stroller back, lifting the front wheels off the ground, and slowly makes the climb. Again you find yourself mumbling, \"Careful... careful... careful...\" Maya slams the front end of the stroller down and jostles you forward. You nearly shout as you come close to falling out. Luckily you were buckled in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See? Told you I had it,\" she says as she presses the doorbell. It chimes throughout the house, but there doesn't seem to be an answer. Maya peeks her head into the small window on top of the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Try it again\", you tell her, not wanting to be your humiliating excursion to be for nothing. Maya presses the button again. Once more it chimes. She turns back to you and shrugs. Suddenly, the front door opens and Natasha stands there,  soaking wet, and wearing nothing but a towel. She appears angry at her shower being interrupted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? What the fu... Oh... it's <i>you</i>.\", she slyly says with a little chuckle. \"I was wondering when you were going to show up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, Natasha. I know you have a piece of me. I know it's one that's.. <i>important</i> to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatasha laughs again. \"Well, it's important to me too. After last night, it's <i>very important to me.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look up to see Natasha flash a grin. You blush and can't help but be a little turned on. After a moment of awkward pausing, Maya clears her throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, ew. And can we do this inside, please?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatasha steps aside and Maya pushes you into the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cute stroller\", Natasha says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks\", you both say at the exact same time. Maya pushes you into the living room. You nervously look around. Natasha sits down on a chair across from you. Maya sits down on a sofa and you \"sit\" in your stroller. There's another long silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, so... about my...\", you begin, breaking the quiet. Across from you, Natasha, still dripping wet, crosses her leg and for a brief moment, you get a small glimpse of what's under that towel.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmirking, she says,\"Yes, yes, you're little... problem.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Little!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaya sighs, \"Look Natasha, can you just give it to him please. We don't have a lot of time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I understand that. How much time do you have left? 40 hours or so? I guess we should just get right down to it. Yes, Sam, I have a piece of you. Yes, it's an important piece and yes, I will give it to you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhew, you think. However, Natasha continues.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... for now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For now!?\", you and Maya both exclaim. Natasha nods.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, for now. You see, I've become quite attached to my new friend. And well, I'd hate to see it go forever. \" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you asking me to have sex with you?!\", you shout, though you sounded a lot more insulted than you actually are. Natasha is fucking <i>gorgeous</i> and <i>waaaaaay</i> out of your league. This could be a win/win if you play your cards right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, of course not\", Natasha says, crushing your dreams. She continues, \"So here's my offer: I give it to you for now, and when you get yourself together and get Elizabeth's powers, you use those powers to give it back to me one day a month, every month.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can't be serious...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not in a position to joke. I'm doing <i>you</i> a favor here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You think it over. This is one hell of an opportunity, but you don't know how comfortable you feel with loaning out your-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He'll do it.\" Maya states.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What!?\" you turn to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, we all know where this was headed. Just say yes so we can get it already. The clock's ticking.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nContemplating for a moment, you nod in Natasha's direction. \"Alright, you got a deal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatasha smiles again, gets up from her seat and walks out of the room, leaving you and Maya alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is already starting to be a pain in the ass\", she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, well at least you have an ass\", you counter. Maya scoffs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's another thing. What are we going to do with it? You don't have hips or anything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou think for a moment. You could attach it to yourself now, but that would be awkward. You could also attach it and detach it now to at least give you something to feel, but that would also really raise the risk of injury. As you continue to mull it over, Natasha returns to the room, still wearing a towel and holding with both hands, your junk. You can't help but exhale at seeing something you never thought you'd see again. Natasha hands it to Maya.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRepulsed, Maya pulls her hands back quickly. \"Eww!\". Your junk drops on the floor, and from your view in the stroller, you can't help but cringe. Natasha picks you back up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what are we doing?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou decide to...</span></div></div>",

Maybe if you can get her on your side, she can convince Damien to give up a few of your pieces. And who knows? She might have a few herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, so Gertrude it is then.\"  Maya pushes your stroller up your driveway as you return to your home. She approaches a blue car parked in the driveway and opens up the passenger side door. Maya unbuckled yoinfrom your stroller but you stop her before she picks you up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait wait wait!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it?\" She asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Going around the neighborhood is one thing, but if we're going to the other side of town, I can't be out like this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh come on, I'm sure nobody is going to notice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou bob your head up and down, trying to gesture to your current form. No arms, no legs, no hips. And to top it all off, no clothes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm a half naked half man with his dick in a grocery bag. I'm pretty sure people are going to notice.\" You flatly state. Maya rolls her eyes.\" Look, can you get me a shirt, at least?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, fine.\" She groans. \" Wait here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like I have a choice...\" you say under your breath as Maya takes off into the house, leaving you sitting alone in your driveway. You're stroller is parked so it's facing the street and you notice two joggers running down the block. Their pace slows as they pass you, and the two jogging women stop and stare at you. You lower your head and blush, completely humiliated. Eventually, the two joggers run off, and you breathe a sigh of relief as Maya comes back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Took you long enough.\" You mutter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah well I'm the one with the legs, so deal. Here.\" Maya throws a t-shirt over your head and you feel at least a little better. You look at the empty shirt sleeves dangle uselessly and sigh. You hope you get to fill them out again soon. Hopefully you can get this whole mess over with otherwise you're going to have a whole lot of pants and shoes going to waste. Maya picks up the plastic bag holding your genitals and before you can reach shoves the plastic loop into your mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold this a sec.\" she says and she hoists your trunk up with a strained groan. She sets you down on the passenger seat, buckles you in and shuts the door. You look around the car, the plastic bag still held in your teeth, for a place to settle down. You try and set it down on the seat next to you but it falls to the floor. You sigh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaya jumps in, starts the car and you two are off to Gertrude's. On he horizon, the sun is beginning to set. You look at the clock on the dash nervously. It's almost night time. You don't think you'll have much luck tracking down pieces of you after it gets dark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you step on it a little?\" You ask with a little bit of attitude. You don't mean to be a dick, but your <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you?\" Maya retorts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know you're little jabs are really starting to get old. I've got enough going on without your mocking.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Need I remind you, that all of this is because you couldn't keep your big mouth shut? You got yourself into this mess. I'm the one nice enough to help you out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe's right. You have no right to be a dick. Especially since it's sitting in a plastic bag on the car's floor right now. You turn and look out the window as Maya keeps driving. You sit in silence until Maya starts to fiddle with the radio and stops on some pop song. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All the pieces, the pieces, pieces of me...\" the singer sings. You bang your head against the cold glass window as the whole universe appears to be conspiring against you. You feel car start to turn and you look to Maya, who appears to be pulling into a drive thru. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm starving. I've been running around all day, carrying you everywhere.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How can you think about food at a time like this?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour question is answered as you hear her stomach loudly rumble. Satisfied with her reply, Maya pulls into the line. It's pretty busy and will no doubt cause you a delay. You look at the clock on the dash again. You wish you had a foot to tap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You want anything? Burger? Chicken fingers?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd rather MY fingers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, fine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah fine, chicken fingers I guess.\" You concede. After a few minutes of waiting, Maya finally gets to the speaker box and places your orders. As she approaches the window, Maya fumbles for her money. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shoot.. do you have a dollar on you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look at her incredulously. \"No. I must have left my wallet in my other pair of pants. You know, the ones with the LEGS IN THEM!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, got it.\" She says as she pulls out another dollar bill. You watch as the man behind the register stares at you blankly and again you feel embarrassed. He takes Maya's money, hands her a bag without ever saying a word and Maya drives off. Finally, you're on your way to Geet-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaya pulls to a stop in the parking lot and grabs the bag of fast food next to you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean I can't really drive, eat and feed you all at once, can I?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Feed me?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well yeah, how the hell else are you going to eat?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hadn't thought of that and you slam the back of your head into the car seat. Maya takes out some of the food and holds a piece of chicken in front of your face. You sigh, shake your head and reluctantly take a bite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is so god damn demeaning.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh stop being a baby.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's easy for you to say. You're not the one who spent their day in a stroller and now -\" Maya cuts you off as she shoves another piece of chicken in your mouth. While you're chewing, Maya eats some of her own food. You catch her staring at you curiously?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was just thinking, what's going to happen to that food? I mean, where does it go? Do you even have to go to the bathroom anymore?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hang your head, embarrassed at the line of questioning, as good as a question it is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know Maya. Can we please hurry up? We're losing daylight and the longer it takes, the less time I have to find all of me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry we get plenty of time. We'll find your pieces. At the very least, most of them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Most?!\" Maya shoves another piece of chicken in your mouth. After another good while, you two finish your meals. Maya wipes your mouth for you and gives you a sip of her drink before she drives off and finally heads to Gertrude's. For real this time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n10 minutes pass before you guys arrive at Gertrude's suburban apartment building. It's dark out now, and you just hope she's home. Maya loads you back into your stroller and pushes you through the glass doors. After a quick search through the directory, Maya presses the buzzer. You sit there and wait for a response. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You had what barely qualified as B cups, frail looking limbs, and your hips and butt weren't much to speak of, but most guys couldn't keep there eyes off of your face, which always made you feel great!  Acne never hit you, so you had porcelain smooth skin and a little round head topped off with long brown hair always tied in a ponytail behind you.  Your eyes were a dazzling forest green and they sat perfectly spaced above a cutesy button nose, which itself was positioned over thick red lips.<br>\r\nYou had had two boyfriends in the past, one of whom you actually went all of the way with (though both had gotten some head) and while he didn't say you were a mind blowing experience (despite what you had heard that all boys say all sex was the best) he said you put a lot more energy in than your body suggested (whatever that meant).  You had never been with a girl before except for Natasha, which most people at your school don't even count as getting it anymore since she's statistically had sex with 80% of all humans in a five mile radius (and the fact that she had no stds to show for all of this still baffled you) but you had had some weird fantasies, and wouldn't be totally opposed to...<br>\r\nNever mind.  Regardless that was irrelevant right now, as you currently didn't have a body to speak of.  You looked around and saw three things.  Firstly that bastard Damien was only three feet away, his stupid douche face snoozing away slowly drooling on your carpet.  Clara was on the ground five feet away and to the right of Damien, her head on a pile of jackets that served as a makeshift pillow for the night.  Right between them was your crappy flip cell phone, still open and still with battery!<br>\r\nNow you had a conundrum.  Both Damien and Clara were known to be light sleepers, and calling out to to Clara could accidentally wake Damien, which is just about the last thing in the world you wanted.  Going for your phone from here would be tedious and time consuming, and even if you got to it you wouldn't really know who to call, Tom being the biggest lightweight on earth and probably completely comatose while Maya and Helen would lecture your ear off and you didn't want to deal with that.  You could also click your tongue to try and get the attention of the family dog Daisy, but that came with certain risks as well.<br>\r\nIn the end...</span></div></div>",

The man stares down at you in confusion for a moment before reaching into the can and pulling you out. \"What the hell? What the heck is this, some sort of sex toy?\" The ugly man says, scratching his head as he proceeds to look you over, poking and prodding every part of you, a shudder of revulsion running through you as his dirty fingers slip inside your cunt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nForgetting the trash entirely in his excitement, the ugly guy exclaims \"Oh man, this thing's alive! Hey Joe, ya gotta see this!\" hopping into the cab of the truck before shoving you into the face of his coworker, a fat greasy guy who smells of strongly of cigar smoke and garbage residue. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-what the hell is that? Some sort of sex toy?\" The fat man asks, startled by your sudden appearance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yea, that's what I thought too at first, but now... she moved Joe, she done moved on her own!

So, will you help me find my body parts?\" You ask him.<br>\r\nHe thinks for a moment, then answers.  \"Alright, I will.  On one condition though.

You couldn't choke without lungs, right?<br>\r\nEric began spinning you slowly around while pushing you up and down, giving you a taste of every inch of him... shamefully you had to admit it tasted pretty good.  Surprisingly it didn't taste like anyone else had been on it last night, probably why Eric was so horny this morning.  You actually began to put in earnest effort, moving your tongue around more and more to give him a better ride.  It was weird feeling your head spin while you did this, but strangely satisfying.

He jerked you left and right, moving you erratically around and making you giggle delightedly.  He then thrust all the way down and... bleh!  You didn't get much of a taste as he was so far down but it still made you scrunch your nose in disgust.  It was pretty bitter and viscous overall not very pleasant.<br>\r\n\"Thanks for that.\"  Eric said, sliding you off and setting you on a shelf.  He then pulled his pants up and zipped them shut, his junk finally deflating.<br>\r\n\"Don't sweat it, I had fun.

Once we find all of them maybe we cam wait to... never mind, right now we have to get all of you back.

Pretty much both you and your body will be separated for a while. The headmaster stated that a witch will be able to multitask much more better. In the end of the day where heads goes back onto the bodies, both head and body will have some sort of brain sync that will make the head know what the body learned and vice versa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHere's some information about the head master. Ever since she discovered about the headless incident, she was really into it that she did it herself. Some of the other teachers did it for fun. For the record, the headmaster is literally a kid. A prodigy that was offered to be the headmaster. The fact that everything is working well only makes her respected by every school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the record, the headmaster's name is Whitney Crane and she has long wavy blond hair and wears a witch's hat.

So all the body went to their heads and picked them up to make some declarations. Your body held you up and said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Head, I know you care for me so. Its just that other heads are not like you. I only want some independence.\",said your body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I understand body, but how can we make this work?\", you said as you are still unsure about this situation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well we could share control.

It was creepy for a body to be talking telepathy, but the students try to get used to it since its just their teacher's voice coming from her body. Both head and body of the teacher got along well in their lesson and this inspires some bodies to have a similar relationship with their heads.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter class, all the witches left to their next one. This time, the bodies treated their heads like a doll or something like that. The bodies stoke their head's hair or even play with them in such a manner. As the day goes on, the bodies even accessorize their heads by doing their head, giving them accessories like hats or buttons, and rarely some wore make up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and your body are just normal and your body did nothing to you.

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">Originally created by Bangle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are Sam, a high school student celebrating your graduation with a large group of friends.  You have just had a wild night of partying, and wake up in a very odd way... In several pieces!  As it turns out, you accidentally made a bet with a witch, and now all of your body parts have been detached!  You are now seperated into a head, torso, stomach, pelvis, genitals, upper legs, knees, lower legs, upper arms, elbows, lower arms, and hands, NINETEEN pieces in total!  You had a really wild night with your friends, and now your body parts are all scattered god knows where, and worse if you can't reattach them all within 48 hours (monday at 1:17 AM, 48 hours after you made the bet) whatever parts you don't have attached will stay like that FOREVER and can never be put back on!<br>\r\nRules:<br>\r\n1.  This is a fetish work, you can have sex.  It can be straight, lesbian, gay, anything really so long as it isn't with a person under the age of 14 and is not with an animal.<br>\r\n2.  You can end a story line, however it MUST at least be the tenth chapter of a particular path!<br>\r\n3.  If you end the story have the last chapter be at least 1000 characters and have a little epilogue.<br>\r\n4.  More magic can be added, but must be done by the same witch that cursed Sam, I don't want a ton of magic users running around making the story impossible to follow properly! (Except for that one story path where exactly that happens, I guess.)<br>\r\n5.  Sam can NOT feel any of his/her parts until they are reattached, however they can be reattached to any spot of his/her body even spots where they normally would not attach, and can be taken back off simply by popping them off.  Once connection has been reestablished Sam can feel the parts even if they are taken off again.<br>\r\n6.  Add new characters as you see fit, just send me a brief description via message after you post the chapter containing them so I can add them to the list of characters.<br>\r\n7.  At any time I am allowed to add new rules.<br>\r\n8.  I give points for chapters of at least 1000 characters.<br>\r\nCharacters:<br>\r\nSam- you, an eighteen year old highschool graduate.  You are rather popular and have a large circle of friends.  You have a pretty big mouth though and tend to say things that you end up regretting!<br>\r\nElizabeth- an eighteen year old classmate of yours.  She stands at about 5'6\", and has a rather plain build, average features, but sports STUNNING jet black hair down to the small of her back.  Elizabeth is rather reserved and reclusive, prefering to be alone or with one other person.  There were rumors circulating that she dabbled in the occult, but you never believed them until now!<br>\r\nCassidy- your male best friend who's nineteen.  Cassidy is 6' and sport a thick build, with a brisly beard and short brown hair.  Cassidy is a lover of practical jokes and never takes anything seriously.  He has a tendancy to take jokes WAY too far, but never does anythig that would permanently harm someone or really do damage.<br>\r\nClara- your female best friend who's exactly your age.  Clara is a very devoted person and has never broken a promise or told a secret she wasn't supposed to.  Clara is a rather pretty young woman, with sexy hips, perky C cup breasts, and a small round head that complimented her perfectly.  Her blonde hair is cut down to her shoulders.<br>\r\nHelen- a friend of both you, Elizabeth, and pretty much everyone in the school that up until now just thought Elizabeth was telling stories.  Helen is short at around 5'3\", but compensates for this with her unbelievable bust, flawless chocolate brown skin, and face to die for, made only sexier by her thin square glasses.  Helen is loyal to both you and to Elizabeth, so she may feel conflicted in who to help.<br>\r\nDamien- pretty much your sworn enemy who you only invited because Helen made you do it.  Damien stands at 5'8\" and you couldn't lie looked pretty good.  He has a black trimmed goatee and a very angular head mounted onto a muscular body.  Damien is a complete asshole who seems to take pleasure in causing havoc and damage.<br>\r\nGertrude- Damien's 5'5\" red headed sexy girlfriend.  Gertrude was always kind of a bitch but never to the extent that Damien was, she was just genrally rude.  Despite being a huge jerk the one thing Damien actually cares about more than himself was Gertrude.  He does everything she says and treats her like a queen.  She has him by the collar which is why you trusted him (just) enough to invite him.<br>\r\nNatasha- a 5'8\" exhange student from Finland who speaks in flawless english.  Natasha is known to be the school slut, and in her one year in the USA has slept with every male (and many of the girls) at your school, including you!  Despite her beauty and her reputation Natash is actually incredibly smart, with an IQ of 170 and with her favorite topics of discourse being psychology amd philosophy.<br>\r\nMaya- your 16 year old sister.  Maya is developing into a rather pretty young woman and has some very pretty curves.  Maya is like an older sister to you (despite being younger) and loves to tell you what you did wrong.  She'll always lend a hand to help you afterwards and is very caring in general for both you and your bonehead brother.<br>\r\nTom- your twenty two year old brother who lives at home with you guys.  He's actually a rather successful guy, and has made more money in the stock market last year than both of your parents made at their jobs COMBINED that year and could move out if he really wanted to.  Despite his prowess at accounting he seemed to be a complete moron in all other fields and can barely tie his shoes unassisted.  Tom isn't all that handsome but he's rather well muscled as he has a lot of time on his hands so he works out often.<br>\r\nEric- an 18 year old classmate of yours.  He's about five foot ten with short light brown hair and handsome features.  He is a known womanizer and was recently dumpred by his longtime girlfriend for sleeping around 1 (or 8) too many times.  He doesn't think things through and is a rather impulsive prankster.  He reminds you of yourself in that regard, which is probably why the two of you were never really friends.  He's still an allright guy if he felt like being so.</td>",
