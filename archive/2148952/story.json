It looked like any other stone one would find at the side of a road, the only oddity being its location, yet Tai was strangely drawn to it. He picked up the stone to get a better look. In the digi-world you never knew what being drawn to a stone might mean to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt felt like a normal stone. Cold to the touch, kind of rough but it seemed almost as if it was giving of a faint light. It was like one of these optical illusions, the more Tai tried to see the light, the less visible it became , but if he looked at it just right... A sudden \"Did you find something interesting?\" coming from behind, made him flinch and drop the stone. It was just Agumon. Having finished playing in the swallow water the digimon had come to look why his partner had walked of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a relieved sigh Tai bend down to pick the stone up \"Maybe, look at this stone\". After a few seconds of staring intently, tilting his head and making his \"thinking-noise\", the orange dinosaur came to the conclusion that this was in fact a rock. \"What about it?\" Tai was confused: \"Can't you see the light?\". Another few seconds of the noise before Agumon answered: \"Nope, not a thing!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? Oh well I'll just show it to Izzy later.\", looking at the clock of his phone, Tai's mood soured: \"Speak of the devil, I have to get going.\" The corners of his partners mouth dropped as well as the Digimon ran behind him back towards the TV Tai had entered the world through. \"Do you really have to leave already?\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah, there is a math-test tomorrow, but I come back as soon as I can.\" with this promise the two friends reached the half buried screen.</span></div></div>",

It was now dainty with long, elegant fingers. Not only the hand of a woman, but of a <i>lady</i>. It was covered in a skintight layer of black, latexy leather cloth that extended up his arm. Panic began to take over Tai's conscious mind as he took in the rest of his body <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeadly pale skin and hair, a perfect body that just oozed sexuality, clad head-to-toe in a skintight, black suit that left almost nothing to the imagination, chains, heels and two tattered wings emerging from his back.

Pushing the panic to the back of his mind he calmed himself instinctively, like he had done so many time before. After a few seconds of no longer feeling like he would pass out from hyperventilation and fear, Tai managed to look up, cringing at the feelings caused by the movement of his new body. Fortunately he didn't have to move around or even search much to find what he was looking for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few feet from him, at the place where Agumon had been standing when this <i>nightmare</i> started, a small, bat-like Digimon was lying on the ground, a Demidevimon. The first feelings that came to Tai's mind were of disgust and hate.  After all, he and his friends had more then their fair share of negative experiences with DemiDevimons. These however faded quickly. While no one would call him the sharpest tool in the shed, he was by no means an idiot and it did not take a genius to put together that if he had been changed, than Agumon could have been affected as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was also another problem: the Digimon Tai suspected to be his partner wasn't moving. Had Agumon fallen unconscious like he himself almost had? Or was it something serious? He had to check on him! But before the LadyDevimon could even take his first step in his new body, the Digimon on the floor began to groan and move. It struggled to its feet and looked up its yellow eyes meeting Tai's red ones. There was, understandably, confusion and fear in those eyes, but then the DemiDevimon seemed to steel itself and hesitantly asked: <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The fear however remained as it jumped up into the air and flew towards the LadyDevimon. \"I'm so incredibly sorry Mistress! I must have fallen aslee.... NO! I was knocked out by the attack! Please forgive me Mistress! I won't be so weak again!\", from the panicked justifications and pleas he was spouting while circling the other Digimon, it was pretty obvious he expected some kind of punishment from his \"Mistress\". Said Mistress for \"her\" part was silent and unmoving. Not because, as DemiDevimon suspected, \"she\" wanted to let the bat-like Digimon hang himself with his own words, but rather because \"she\" was shocked speechless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a mere moment Tai had lost everything: His <i>body</i>, now a mockery of the human form, a fallen angle clad in fetish-gear. His <i>home</i>, he couldn't return to the human-world like this, the others would attack him on sight. And now he had lost Agumon. Tai <i>knew</i> that the DemiDevimon had been Agumon just a scant few minutes ago. He felt the same unspoken connection that had bound them together since they first meet. There was no doubting it, the Digimon currently flying around his head while apologizing profoundly was his partner, his best friend. The one being Tai could always trust and rely on and now it only recognized him as his current form, as a LadyDevimon and it feared him appropriately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe panic was back. The one rock he subconsciously had held on, had been ripped away without so much as a warning. The sound of rushing blood in his ears drowned out any other sound. His vision began to swim again, as the world seemed to crumble around him.  He knew he had to do something else before it all broke down.<br>\r\nHis red eyes fell upon his partner-digimon. The Demidevimon seemed to have given up on talking his way out of this perceived failure and resigned himself to hovering a few feet infront of his \"Mistress\". Tai could still talk to him, figure out what happened, make sense of the madness. Everything to distract himself from the reality of his current state. Before he could even think clearly about it, the new LadyDevimon had started to speak his first words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn murmured: \"I...\", was all Tai got out before he stopped in horror. The sound of his own voice was to much. Even when speaking with a neutral inflexion, his new voice was feminine. High and breathy with undertones of sexuality and violence pervading... <i>tainting</i> everything he said.<br>\r\nIt was the final nail in the coffin of Tai's psyche. And it all came crashing down.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Wishes are (maybe purposefully) misinterpreted, fulfilled in strange ways or with unintended consequences. Lots of possibilities for transformations and the exploration of their consequences.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>(2) Fitting in:</b><br>\r\nAfter they got separated from their friends while entering the Digital World for the first time, Takato and Guilmon stumple upon a community of digimon. They are (at least superficially) friendly and helpful, offering the duo food and shelter, but things soon take a turn to the bizarre. The longer the two friends seem to stay, the more they find themselfs changing to fit into the community as if they had aways been a part of it. In the End, will they even want to leave?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>(3) Waking Nightmare:</b><br>\r\nOne day Takato wakes up and something has changed: maybe he is older or younger, maybe he is female or a Digimon, maybe his friends and family or the whole world have changed, or maybe its just him. The point is, only he remembers that things used to be different and now he has to find way to deal with and/or reverse the change(s).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>(4) Holy Champions:</b><br>\r\nAfter the Digimon Soveregins witnessed the power of Biomerge Evolution firsthand in the fight against the D-Reaper, they come to the conclusion, that to protect the Digital World in the future they each will have to create and train a champion, by using one of the humens that has shown an affinity for the biomerge and some of their own essence, to act as an independend, not-entirely-digital protector. So they each seek out th human of their choice and offer them this position and of course Takato accepts, but in his transformation from human to part-digimon, he might get more than he bargained for.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Davis finds an object or some kind of Spirit/Digimon that grants his wishes, but things don't go as planned.

The mysterious entity is able to swap anything between two targets, not just physical things like body, gender or hair-color but also more abstract things like taste, habits or relationships and it seems to have taken an interest in Davis. Can the DigiDestined stop this new thread, despite the constant changes and while dealing with everything else currently threatening the digital and real worlds?</span></div></div>",
