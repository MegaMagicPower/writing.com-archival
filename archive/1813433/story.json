You pretty much just wear a black spandex suit and combat boots.<br>\r\nFeet: Size 12, nails unpainted<br>\r\nPersonality: Easily angered, but have quite the submissive nature, but also violent and sadistic tendencies at times<br>\r\nFamily Relations: Leah: Twin Sister, Anna \"Elana\": Younger Sister, Scarlet: Godmother, Valerie: Grandmother (Deceased), Heather: Mother (Deceased), Tom: Older Brother, Steve: Father<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><u>Power Level Overview</u></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin the Z Team Emily has designed a system to rank each and every member by their overall power level. It goes from Class I to Class V with Class I being Apocalypse level, Class II being extremely powerful, Class III being average superpowers IV being slightly above average human being, and Class V being average human being. Horsemen of Apocalypse are automatically Class I or II, with their original powers influencing their placement. Things like immortality give high placement. Raw power and skill level also give high placement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClass I: Demonica, Lexi<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClass II: Leah, Shelby, Jackie, Desdemona, Scarlet, Chelsea, Anna \"Elana\", Tori, Emily, Addy, Jenny, Penance, Rose<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClass III: Hinohana, Alice, Phoebe, 24<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClass IV: Ally, Edy, Petra, Vanessa, Jane<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClass V: Stacy, Nicolette<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><u>Restricted Abilities</u></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou've decided that certain team members have abilities that shouldn't be used all willy nilly. To use these abilities they have to get clearance from you first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnna: Halloween Cannon: Charges up an orange Jack O'lantern shaped hex ball. She launches it and it explodes like a small nuke. Blast Range: 0.1 miles<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily: Tactical Nuke: Launches a small nuclear warhead from the base to her target, nuff said. Blast Range: 10 miles<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScarlet: Blood Sport: Unleashes her inner Vampire, going full on feral on anything unfortunate enough to be in her way...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRose: Not Dead Yet: Allows herself to be killed, only to revive and literally stab her opponents in the back. She has a special knife with the word \"Backstabber\" carved into the handle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStacy: Cheer Squad: Calls in for back up. Stacy uses a device invented by Emily to teleport in a Cheer Squad, who then follow Stacy to literally just beat the shit out of whatever's in their way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDemonica: Armaggeddon: Makes fire rain from the sky. You have to monitor her closely as she sometimes gets way out of hand with this one. Blast Range: Worldwide, has no effect on the team<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdy: Bulletstorm: Fires a bunch of bullets from a 50 cal. machine gun and makes them spin in a tornado-like pattern. She then sends the tornado at her opponent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeah: The Reaper: Uses her scythe to slice open an opponent and harvest their soul. Game over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJane: Mini-nuke: Launches a Snickers bar sized nuke from her wrist gauntlet. Has armor piercing capability. Blast Range: 15 feet<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShelby: Cataclysm: Defies the Richter scale and causes massive rocks to erupt from the ground, crushing, impaling, and otherwise destroying anything caught in it. Range: As far as Shelby can see to control her powers effectively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackie: Meltdown: Disables all the restrictors Emily placed on her and unleashes her full radioactive fury, melting, disintegrating, and killing anything non meta-human. Range: 100 miles<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTori: El Dia de los Muertos: Summons legions of the undead to swarm her opponent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDesdemona: Succubi's Charm: Seduces her opponent and then sucks out all of their life force.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlly: Martyr: Uses her powers to insta-heal anyone wounded and revive anyone recently deceased. Ally falls into a 7 day coma after using this ability.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeveral of these abilities can be used in Tandem to increase the power of both attacks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDemonica + Jackie: Nuclear Armageddon<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDesdemona + Leah: Once Screwed, Twice Damned<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScarlet + Stacy: Blitz Rush<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdy + Jane: Two Woman Army<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRose + Tori: Undead Surprise<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShelby + Anna: All Hallows Eve<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnna + Emily: Science and Majic<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Anyway, this is my story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom, can I tell you something? Yes sweetheart? I- you inhale then exhale. I like girls... especially their feet.... Alexis Henrietta von Reinhouser, you are now disowned! Now get out of my sight you shameless slutty lesbian whore! But mom you... you're supposed to... support... nurture... love... acceptance... You start twitching and spazzing and feel something inside your heart change. DEATH... Leah, I know that you're the Grim Reaper and have powers, hold her down... You go to the kitchen... You come back with a large butcher knife in your hand. Let's see, to slit your throat? Nah, too quick. Stab you in the heart? Ha ha, that's symbolic. Gauge your eyes out? No, I want you to see this. Or just gut you like a pig? Hmm, too messy. Leah gasps, Lexi! Can it Leah! YOU have to collect her soul for the Council. But I- Leah thinks back to all of the times mom has mistreated her. You know what Lexi, you're right! This will be fun, mwahahaha! You decide to go with her heart, because she metaphorically stabbed you in the heart, so you decide to return the favor physically. You kneel over your mother. Time to die bitch! You plunge the knife into your mother's heart, watching her eyes widen. A-alexis, why? Cause you suck at being a mother! Leah! Do the honors. Gladly, tee hee. Leah uses her death touch and ends your mother's life. She then summons her scythe and uses it to slice open your mother's lifeless body. She collects the soul in her soul bag to present to the Council. Nice job Leah, you hi five her. Ouch! Damn girl, you need to cut your fingernails! What the hell? I just cut them yesterday. You concentrate and look at your hand, to your amazement, your nails shorten back to their original length. I wonder... you concentrate and to your astonishment, your boobs grow and your back starts to hurt. Ok, back to normal, not worth it. Now if can just use this power for combat then... Your turn your hand into a sword and slice a lamp clean in half. Oh yeah, I'm totally gonna be a supervillain! Want in Leah? Yeah sure, why not. Wait, what about when Anna gets home? If she wants to join, let her, if not, I'll just kill her...</span></div></div>",

She proceeds to bite everyone finishing with Anna. Anna's wings grow to the size that an angel would have, she can probably fly with those now. Her hair turns from blonde to jet black and her eyes from blue to purple. Anna: Whoa, I've never felt this much energy before- ACCIDENS MENTIS ABSTERGET!

Dracula's daughter... So why are you here child? I um... was thinking about... She shoves her bare feet into your lap. Alexis. I know you too well. She gives you a fanged smile. Sc-scarlet... It's ok honey, just do your thing. You stare at her shiny blood red toenails but notice an odd box behind her. You snap out of your trance for a minute. Scarlet, what's in the box? Is it like a shipment of blood or something? What box? The box starts shaking and out pops a girl dressed like a scarecrow. ???: Ragdoll at your service! She takes a bow. You: Why do they call you Ragdoll? Ragdoll: Why not? She twists her torso 360 degrees and puts her leg behind her head. You: Oh... Ragdoll: How rude of me. Petra Merkelov. She says extending the leg that was previously behind her head. You: Why... Petra: Cmon now. You're obvious, just grab my foot already would ya? You grab her foot and start feeling it up through her slipper thingies. Dont get too frisky now. You shake her foot like it was a hand. I assume I'm in now? You: Sure. She untwists and backflips out of Scarlet's room. Scarlet wiggles her toes, which you immediately shove into you mouth. Ahh... just like the Prussian girl I dated in 1717... You roll your eyes at her. So what if I'm ancient? You love me. You weave your tongue between her toes until you see old Grim behind her... You quickly pull her foot out of your mouth. You: I uh... The Grim Reaper: I've seen many things in my years, this is one of the more normal things I've seen... You: Leah's next door. The Grim Reaper: I'm not here to get a progress report from her. You: I'm 15! I- Grim: I'm not here for that either. Scarlet: Now I am intrigued. Why are you here? Grim: I have a second job you know. Involving my horse and the Apocalypse. You: So the world is ending? Grim: Yes. And as you might know I'm retired and your sister is my replacement. That being said, she is also Death, the second Horsemen of Apocalypse. Thing is my associates are retiring as well. War has told me that you are more than suitable as a replacement for him. You: ME? I get to be War? The first Horsemen of Apocalypse? Grim: Yes. You: That is fucking awesome! Do I get a suit or something? Grim: Armor actually, and a demon horse obviously. And Scarlet. Due to your... nature. Famine has asked you to replace him. Scarlet: Brilliant! She says with a fanged smile. I've always wanted a horse. You: Alright! Horsemen #3. Way to go Scarlet! Grim: And Lexi. Inform your younger sister Anna that she will be Pestilence. You: Hmm... so the Von Reinhouser sisters are the First, Second, and Fourth Horsemen of the Apocalypse. Who'd of thought. Grim: I'm not done. There will be 7 of you total. Scarlet: I've always heard there were only 4 Horsemen of Apocalypse. Grim: There are two teams. You: Strength in numbers I guess. Grim: Inform Shelby that she is to be Fury, Desdemona that she is to be Strife, and will accompany you as you spread war, to get things started, you know how it is. And finally, Jackie is to be Pollution, and will assist Pestilence. One more thing, although all of you have powers already, you will bestowed your respective powers and given your horse by the previous Horsemen, you will also become immortal and indestructable. You: Scarlet! We gotta celebrate! Scarlet grabs you and pulls you in for a quick smooch. Grim only looks at you. Grim: You cant tell but I'm smiling. Gather the people I mentioned and we shall go to the Apocalypse Room. You on the intercom: Leah, Anna, Shelby, Desdemona, and Jackie please report to Scarlet's room. A few minutes later they arrive. Shelby: What's this about? Holy shamoly! Death? The guy before Leah? Grim: Yes. Anyway, my team has gathered you here to start and complete the Apocalypse and wait until the next sentient species becomes corrupted which you will then destroy when the time is right. Now if you'd all follow me...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Death opens a portal and you all walk through it. Similar to the Council of Supernatural Affairs, the Apocalypse Council is all of the previous Horsemen, who except for old Grim, apparently never leave this building. All of them have a nametag thing written in fire above each of their heads. Death: Lexi. You are the first to meet your predecessor. You walk over to the sign labeled \"War\". Before you stands a very large armored man with a badass looking greatsword. War: I heard you were violent. But can you even lift Armageddon little girl? He says as he hands you the sword. You grab the sword by its hilt and effortlessly point it at his throat. You: That answer your question War? War: I like you kid, you've got potential. War: Ruin! A badass looking black horse with flaming red mane and hooves gallops in from thin air. You: Wicked. War: Take good care of Ruin. He says handing you the metaphorical reins. All horses obey their riders without question and never get spooked or anything. You: Yo War. Bones said I get demon armor or something? War: Alexis Henrietta Von Reinhouser, I bestow upon thee the powers of War. War's eyes glow and pieces of armor appear from thin air and magically put themselves on you. You: Fuck yeah! Death: Leah and I have already done this. Next is... Scarlet. Go see Famine. Scarlet walks over to the sign marked \"Famine\". A creature similar to a very skinny vampire steps from the shadows. Famine: Ah. The heir of Dracula. A fine choice indeed. Our newest leader is most wise. Famine hands Scarlet a badass Flail. Scarlett: Thank you Famine. Famine: Scarlet Mina Alucard, I bestow upon thee the powers of Famine. Famine's eyes glow and Scarlet gets some majic armor, although hers is not as... Armory as yours, probably because she wont be on the front lines. Scarlet: Again, thank you Famine. Famine: I almost forgot. Munchers! A starved looking horse gallops in from thin air. Death: Anna. Go see Pestilence. Anna walks over to the sign marked \"Pestilence\" and a very sickly looking zombie-like creature steps out of the shadows. Pestilence hands Anna a Halberd. Pestilence: Anthrax! An equally sickly looking horse gallops in from thin air. Anna: He he. It's kinda cute. Pestilence: Anna Gertrude Von Reinhouser, I bestow upon thee the powers of Pestilence. Again as Anna is not a front liner, her armor is lighter than yours and presumably Leah's? Anna: Cool. Death: Shelby. Report to Fury. Good luck... Shelby cautiously approaches the sign marked \"Fury\". And out of the shadows steps... Damn! A smokin hot woman with long hair made of fire steps out of the shadows. Fury: Pity. I was told this one has fire in her... Shelby: You wanna go bitch! Bring it! Fury whips Shelby and a portion of her armor is sliced clean off, showing part of her underwear and bra. Fury: Even though I am retired I am still your mentor. You'd be wise not to cross me... Shelby grits her teeth. Shelby: Yes ma'am... Ok, now down to business. Here's your whip. Rage! A horse almost completely on fire gallops in from thin air. I Fury, bestow my powers unto you, Shelby Lynn Geoday. Shelby gets a badass suit of armor, she'll be a frontliner with you and Leah. Thanks Fury! I mean... whatever... Death: Next is... Desdemona. Report to Strife. Desdemona walks over to the sign marked \"Strife\", and out of the shadows steps someone who looks like a normal guy, but in battle Armor. Strife hands Desdemona a warhammer. Strife: Brawl! What looks like a horse on steroids gallops in from thin air. Desdemona merely smiles... like an evil psycho... Strife: I Strife bestow upon you, Desdemona Jezebel de Lilith, the power of strife. Dez also gets frontliner worthy armor. Death: Last but not least, Jackie, go see Pollution. Jackie walks over to the sign marked \"Pollution\" and out of the shadows steps a radioactive mutant looking thing. It hands Jackie a spear. Pollution: Uranium! A mutant glowing horse gallops in from thin air. Jackie: I like him. Pollution: I Pollution, bestow upon thee, Jackie Anne Suraju, the powers of Pollution. Jackie: Thank you master. She says as she bows. Death: Everyone mount up, we start soon... You too Leah. Badass looking armor appears on top of Leah's hooded cloak, and she puts her hood up. A veil of shadows covers her face. Leah: Despair! Leah's undead blue flamey horse gallops in from thin air and she summons her scythe. Death: Ok, now we are ready to... Alexis! Where are you going? Almost like you're possessed you find yourself kneeling in front of Fury and kissing her armorclad boots. Fury: What is this? I like this one. War! Your apprentice is my slave from now on! War: She'll snap on you eventually... Death: Alexis! Now is not the time for that! We have a schedule to- Fury: Shut it bones, we can give the humans another hour or so to live before our disciples destroy them. Death: Oh fine... Everyone who is not Lexi please report to your master for training. Shelby, you can train with War...</span></div></div>",

You failed to notice before, but Fury has ever so slightly purple colored skin, she has her nails painted an orange color. You look up at her face and see that she now has long dark purple hair. You're guessing that her hair only flares up when her temper does. You begin to kiss her toes. Fury: I really wish that you were my apprentice... but the leader thinks that you'd be much better suited as War. You: So who is this leader anyway? Fury: We only know her as Bleeding Heart, she wears a mask all of the time, not even bones has seen her face... Of course she showed up only last year... You: Sounds Emo... Fury: Oh no. She's quite polite and proper. You: Hmm... ???: Why aren't you two training... Alexis? You: What the fu- ???: Have some decency Alexis. You: I go by Lexi. And I'm War. Who are you to tell me what to do? Fury: Lexi. That's Bleeding Heart... Bleeding Heart removes her mask, revealing a very familiar face... You: No... You say feeling a wave of fear and guilt pass over you before collapsing to your knees. You're dead... I killed you! Bleeding Heart: Well you didn't do a very good job. My daughter dearest... You: How are you still alive? Bleeding Heart: Oh. You know. I'm a metahuman and all. We're pretty tough to kill, even when our daughters literally plunge knives into our hearts. You: Leah collected your soul... Bleeding Heart: Oh boo hoo. I'm a souless husk. Any more questions? You: Are you mad at me? Bleeding Heart: It's been a year. I got over it. Now go get your lazy lesbian butt into the training hall! You too Fury. You: Yeah yeah mom. I'm getting to it. Fury: This is gonna be the most awkward Apocalypse ever...<br>\r\n<u>The Training Hall</u><br>\r\nDeath: Ok. Now that everyone's here. Masters, you will observe your students and rate their performances accordingly. First match up is Lexi vs Leah. You summon your sword and horse. You: Dont go crying to mom when I hurt you. Leah: Mom's dead. You: Is she? You say pointing a thumb behind you. Leah: Ahhh! Mom I'm so sorry! Bleeding Heart: It's fine honey. With Leah distracted, you take this opportunity to strike, hitting Leah square in the chest, with no effects. Lexi: Well this is pointless... Leah: She has a point. War: Points for being sneaky. Death: Demerit for letting your guard down. You and Leah both sigh at the same time. You: Yo bones. Can we wipe out humanity already? I'm getting bored. Death: That's not my decision. Bleeding Heart: War, Death, Fury, and Strife. Mount up and get out there! The rest of you wait on my signal. You, Leah, Shelby and Dez mount up and ride through the portal and start in a very rural area of the United States. Guess you're up first Dez...</span></div></div>",

My mom can be a bit close minded at times, but she's mom, it's like her job to be a pain in the butt, but I love her all the same. My dad jetted out when I was about 2 years old. I live with my mom, and my 13 year old little sister Anna, but she's at her friend's house for the weekend. Anyway, this is my story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTonight is the Freshman homecoming dance or whatever. You <i>had</i> a date to the dance, but he's suddenly busy all of the sudden. How convenient... Your mother urges that you go anyway and maybe make a new friend. You decide to not show off and go dressed in a turtleneck sweater, sweat pants, and sneakers, with your hair tied in a ponytail. It's not like prom or anything, so you dont <i>have</i> to wear a dress. Thirty minutes in you are still leaning against the wall watching the others do their thing, when you notice that the same Goth chick has been staring at you for the past 20 minutes. You blink and she vanishes. Hello... A voice says from right next to you. Ahh! How the fudge did you get over here so fast? You were on the other side of the gym not even 2 seconds ago. Tell me. Do you believe in Vampires? Yeah, they only exist in movies, sparkle in the sunlight and try to win over the hearts of emotionless and frankly not all that cute girls named Bella. Twilight is an insult to my kind... Oh... You think you're a vampire... Ok... I'm leaving now delusional Goth chick... Not if I have anything to say about it... She grabs your arm. For a woman who looks only in her late teens or early twenties, she's got quite a vice grip. Hey! Let go of me you psycho... Why are your eyes red? I told you... I'm a Vampire... Dracula's own daughter, Scarlet Alucard. Oh... This wont do... Scarlet begins to roll down your turtleneck, exposing your neck to her. This will only hurt for a second. Scarlet bites your for about 15 seconds before pulling away, it's actually kind of erotic... Not that you like girls or anything... It was nice to meet you. May we meet again darling. You blink again and Scarlet is gone in a flash. A couple of hours pass and you return home with your turtleneck up particularly high.<br>\r\n<u>Your House, The Living Room</u><br>\r\nHi mom! Bye mom! I'm going to bed now. Wait just one second young lady. So close... Yes mother? Why is the collar on your turtleneck unrolled? Oh you know... Fashion trends and things... You wouldn't understand. Over here. Come on. Your mother says as she pats the spot next to her. Mom that's really not a good idea... but if you say so... You sit next to your mother and she pulls down your collar and sees Scarlet's bite marks. Alexis Henrietta von Reinhouser! What? I met a vampire. What'd you expect? Oh... Those aren't needle tract marks? What?! No! Why would you think I was doing drugs?! It's just a really wicked hickey is all... Your mother covers her mouth in shock. You had sexual relations! Who is he?! I'll wring his neck! It was a she... and I kinda liked it... Alexis... you know how I feel about that... Mommy... you say hugging her. ...I thought you loved me... I do love you Alexis, it's just that your sexual preferences aren't my cup of tea is all. No matter what I'll always accept you. The doorbell rings. I got it mom! You open the door. Hey Mrs. Huang, mom's right over on the couch if you need... Why are you staring at me like that? Mrs. Huang: How long has that been on your neck? You: Oh that... It's just a hickey, I got it at homecoming, I just got back. Mrs. Huang opens her purse and pulls out a needle. She jabs in the neck with it. You: What the? Why would you do that!? Mrs. Huang: Did you want to be a Vampire instead? You: Right... Err... Thanks then. Mrs. Huang: It's no problem, and you can call me Aunt Kelly. Your mother and I have been best friends since preschool. You: Uh... sure. I can do that. Kelly: So. Has your mother told you yet? You: Told me what? Kelly: Why dont you ask her? You walk into the living room. You: Mom is there something you wanted to tell me? Your mom: Well I suppose you're ready... Tell me. What is it that you think Kelly and I do? You: Uhh... You work as a secretary at a paper company and Mrs.... I mean Aunt Kelly works at an accounting place right? Kelly: To the public yes, that's what we do. Your mom: But secretly... Your mom pulls on one of the wall lamps and the fireplace opens up, revealing a batcave like complex. You: Wait... You're... Your mom: Spectrum. Kelly: And I.Q. Your mom/Kelly: At your service! <span class=\"clred\">(In this arc Lexi follows the path of righteousness because her mother accepted her sexuality rather than broke her heart about it)</span> You: So are powers genetic? Your mom: Of course. They may be similar to mine or be the complete opposite. Kelly: It's random really, for example, by some incalculable coincidence my daughter Emily has the exact same powers that I do. You: So mom... What are your powers exactly? Your mom: You mean what aren't my powers? I can do pretty much anything I can think of. You: Cool. I hope I dont get something lame like stretching... Your mom: Kelly can test you right now if you want. You: Go for it Aunt Kelly. Kelly pulls out what looks like a tablet PC and it scans you. Kelly: Hmm... 100% match but your metagene is a latent double, meaning you'll get your mother's powers in a few years... for now you can look forward to body transformation powers. You: I guess that's kinda cool... So mom. What about Leah and Anna? Your mom: Anna's too young and Leah is a lost cause... You: Lost cause? Your mom: She's the Grim Reaper's apprentice... there's no hope for her now. That's why I sent her to live with my mother... You: Wasn't she in the Nazi high command back in World War II? Your mom: Yep. Stubborn old bat refuses to die... You: Mother! Your mom: Sorry. You: Wait, mom, you aren't even 40 yet so... Your mom: My mother was born in 1925. She joined the Hitler Youth some time in her childhood and worked her way up to SS by the time she was about 15, I was born 1966, so my mother was 41 when I was born. Make sense? You: I hate math. I'll take your word for it. Kelly: Heather. Can I design her costume? Your mom: Go for it. You: Dont I get a say? Kelly's eyes glow white briefly. Kelly whispers in your ear: I'll make it worth your while little niece. I think it's cute that you like girl's feet by the way. And I'll make sure that your mom doesn't find out until you're ready to tell her ok? You: Sure Aunt Kelly. Design my costume however you like! You say smiling at the both of them...</span></div></div>",

Your mom feels up your boobs through your sweater. You: M-mom! Heather: Hmmm... Yeah. She'll be fine. She's actually about the same size I was at her age. You: I feel violated... Heather: I thought you liked girls honey? You: Well kinda yeah but... I'm still... You know... A virgin... So... Kelly: You'll get used to it eventually. I was 21 when I had Emily so my first wasn't until I was in college. You: Right... Can I have my costume now... Heather: He he. Sure honey. Your mom smiles at you. Kelly: If you would follow me please. You: Sure Aunt Kelly. Kelly: Oh. Whenever we're in the Control  Room and out on missions you'd best get in the habit of calling your mother and myself by our codenames. Secret identities and all you know? You: Right erm... I.Q.... Kelly: Oh! You need a codename! I'll sweeten the deal if you let me pick. You: Sure. But can I ask why your so obsessed with picking out everything for me? Kelly: Look. I've been your mom's sidekick since I was your age. It's nice to have someone who's under me. You know? You: Well I am the submissive type... You say blushing. Kelly: Whoa whoa whoa, slow down hormone storm. I never said it would be like that, I'm just gonna let you play with my feet is all. You: I didn't mean it like that! I mean... not that I dont like cougars or anything... and you are very attractive... I mean... Eeep! You blush intensely and partially bury your face into your turtleneck. Kelly: You're fun. Kelly says as she pats you on the back. If you want I can probably whip up something to help you control your hormones. You: That would be helpful... Kelly: C'mon. Show me what you can do so that I can name you. You: I dont know... Whoa! Hey! You say jumping out of the way as a giant robotic T-Rex slams its tail where you were just standing. You: That was a cheap shot! I thought you were a good guy! Kelly: I am. But I'm a naughty girl sometimes. Tee hee. The T-Rex attacks again, which you easily dodge. Kelly: Your reflexes are 97% faster than a normal human's, good, but your mom's are at 500%, so you need some improvement. You easily dodge every time the T-Rex attacks. Kelly: Not good enough my little niecey. You need to fight back. Destroy it if you have to. You: But I... You somehow are able to jump over the T-Rex's head and land on its back. Once there you turn your arms into octopus tentacles and wrap them around this robotic monstrosity's neck. You pull with all of your might until you hear the servos spark and the wires tearing, one more big pull and it's head flies off and lands next to Kelly. You return your arms to normal as the body falls. You continue to sit on it and you wink and stick your tongue out at Kelly, putting up a peace sign with your fingers. Kelly: Well... Very good... I think I'll call you... Roulette. Sound good? You: Sure Aunt Kelly! I mean I.Q.... Kelly: How about only on missions kay? You: Oh. Ok. Kelly's eyes glow white again and a costume and a pair of matching boots flies out of the closet and lands in your arms. Kelly: Put that on. I'll be back in a couple minutes. You quickly get changed into your costume and boots. Kelly walks back in while you're pulling up your second boot. Kelly: Nice. It suits you well. Now. About your face... Kelly says as she pulls a metal box out of the closet. You: Oh. Right. So do I get a mask or... Oooooh! They're soooo cute! Are they mine? Kelly: No. They're for my cat... Ha ha. They're all yours! She tosses you a pair of goggles that match your outfit. You put them on and a bunch of data appears inside the lenses, much like the Heads Up Display in a video game. You look at Kelly and a bunch of data on her pops up, such as known powers, weaknesses, etc. You: Hmmm... You say as a devious idea pops into your head, but then you think of what Kelly said after she read your mind. Kelly: Smart choice Lexi. She says as she winks at you. At about this point your mom walks in. Heather: I.Q. Progress report? Kelly: Your daughter is somewhat proficient in combat already. Heather: What'd you name her? Kelly: Roulette. You smile and look at your mother, two things happen. First, her tight spandex outfit makes her look really hot, and you blush a little at your naughty thought. Bad Lexi! Secondly, as soon as you look at the info. that your goggles are showing you, the number that indicates power level jumps. It's over 9,000! The normally yellow bar at the top flashes red while a large red exclamation mark appears next to the number. You: Mom... You dont expect me to fight you... Do you? Heather: Hmm? Oh. Of course not sweetie. I dont want you to get hurt. You breathe a sigh of relief. Heather: Oh Lexi. You just look so cute in that outfit! Your mom runs over to you in an instant and hugs you. You: Mom... hurting... ribs... cant... breathe... Heather: Whoops. Sorry hun. Kelly: Heather. Do you want to look over Lexi's numbers and tell me what you think later? Heather: Right. Of course. Your mom leaves with Kelly's scanner tablet thing, once again leaving you alone with your annoying neighbor's hot mom... Kelly: So Lexi... Kelly says using a really sexy voice. You get weak in the knees and kneel in front of Kelly. She levitates herself and sits down in midair and crosses her legs. You quickly pull off her boots, admiring her sexy purple polish. Licking your lips, you shove all 5 of her right foot's toes in your mouth. Kelly pets you on the head. Kelly: You're much more fun than your mother... When I was your age she had me rubbing her feet after every single mission... I always hated it, and I still do. But not you. You're such a sweet submissive girl. So tell me, do you like being my little footslave? You nod yes. Kelly: Good. I think you and I will get along famously!</span></div></div>",

Quickly pulling Kelly's toes out of your mouth, you scramble to your feet as Kelly puts her boots back on. Your mom shows up a second later. Heather: Hmmm... It's only a minor disturbance. Alexis dear, how do you feel about a solo mission. You: You're joking right? Heather: I suppose I could go with you... Kelly: I'll take her! I do need leadership experience for when I eventually train Emily. Heather: Very well. Roulette, I.Q. will be your supervisor for this mission. Make haste, this one's particularly nasty... You: You said it was minor! Heather: For me. For you and I.Q.... Not so much. Good luck! You board the jet with Kelly. How did you not notice a jet hangar under your house? Since the jet flies itself to a preprogrammed destination, you're left sitting their awkwardly staring at Kelly through your high tech goggles. About 5 minutes pass until... So Lexi... Yeah? Would you be willing to rub my feet until we get there? I'm starting to feel like you're just taking advantage of me... Foot fetishers aren't always just dying to rub a girl's feet you know. Foot massages are hard work when done properly, and they aren't something that I feel like just giving out all willy nilly. Oh... I just thought that... we were past that. Something deeper... the bond between aunt and niece, even if they aren't related by blood. Kelly takes on slightly more depressed expression. Aunt Kelly I... Fine... Just this once because I'm a nice person... you walk over and sit cross-legged in front of Kelly and remove her boots. You begin to massage her feet... About 15 minutes later something beeps and the bay doors open. Age before beauty. Respect your elders. Uggh. Fine. I'll go first. You walk to the edge of the platform, suddenly you feel a push from behind. You're about 15 feet up, the jet is just hovering there. You grow wings and flap them a couple of times and land gently before retracting them. You turn around and look back up at Kelly. What the heck Aunt Kelly! Consider this extreme combat training. No place to learn like the field! I'm totally getting you back for this later! I'd expect no less my little niecey! You turn back around and begin your search, not knowing what exactly to look for. A few minutes into the search you hear a twig snap behind you. You quickly turn around, only to find nothing. Hmmm... You turn back around, only to look right into the eyes of the girl from prom, now wearing Victorian style clothing. I told you that we would meet again child... You make your neck like an armadillo's shell. Back off! You pull the cross necklace out from under your costume and hold it up in front of Scarlet. She only laughs as she brushes it aside like it's nothing. Were you not listening when I said that I was Dracula's daughter? Did you really think that would work on a royal Vampire such as myself? Kind of... Scarlet walks closer still and... hugs you? Huh? Did I not tell you at your homecoming that I liked you? What? But I dont... Then why are you blushing? How can you know that? You cant even see my face. Blood sense, and by the way, I know for a fact that a lot of your blood is circulating... downstairs... This causes you to blush even more. You know Scarlet, before you do anything, you have to meet my mother and gain her approval. Fair enough. Let us go then. Before we do that, swear to join me in the fight against evil. I can do that, just for you. Oh. And no biting without my permission. Got it? Scarlet sighs. Fine. You can stop hugging me now Scarlet... Right. Of course. You push a few buttons on your wrist communicator and the jet shows up not too long after. It lands in front of you and Scarlet. The door opens and you are greeted by a smiling Kelly. Kelly: Oh... Who's your friend Roulette? You: This is Scarlet, the girl that gave me the wicked hickey at homecoming... Kelly only smiles at you. The ride home is particularly long...<br>\r\n<u>The Control Room</u><br>\r\nYou enter the Control Room with Kelly and Scarlet. Your mom scowls as soon as she sees Scarlet. Heather: Alexis please dont tell me... Scarlet hugs you from behind in a sexual way. You: Sorry mom... I cant help that I like what I like. Heather: I did tell you that I'd kill whoever it was that bit you on the neck but... If you really like her I suppose that I cant help but be kind of proud of you in a way... Just dont... kiss or anything in front of me. Okay? You: I'll give you that much mom. Your mom shivers a bit. Scarlet: I could probably change her mind you know. If you want. You: No Scarlet. It's fine. Heather: Ok. Let's get serious now. I suppose we should train you too Scarlet... Scarlet: No need. I've had 5 centuries to hone my combat abilities. You put your goggles on and look at Scarlet. Her refined power level is about the same as your mom's, but when you look at her raw power... You: Holy sh- *cough* *cough* Erm... Sorry about that mom. I've just never seen a number that big before...</span></div></div>",

I am not your mother-in-law! Scarlet: Yet. Scarlet says as she flashes a fanged grin. Heather clears her throat. Heather: Anyway... Alexis. Take this, Scarlet and Holy Sorceress on your next mission. You: A sword? Kelly: Would you rather use your bare hands against a scythe? You: Leah... Heather: I'm sending you because... I dont have the heart to fight my own daughter... You: I'm not gonna kill her! Heather: Thing is, you might have to. Increasingly I am faced with the fact that the Apocalypse is fast approaching, and Leah's their star player. Anna: I got your back sis! Kelly: Be careful, and keep each other safe. Anna: Why aren't you going Aunt Kelly? Kelly: You two stand a fighting chance, I'm better off supporting you from the jet. Everyone except your mom loads up on the jet. The ride ends faster than you would like. The jet lands and yourself, Scarlet, and Anna step out. You: This is it... you say as you draw the sword. Anna: You think it's the creepy old church? Scarlet: Only one way to find out... As you open the doors, a lone hooded figure stands slightly slumped over, with it's back toward you. Leah: I'm crazy you know... My doctor says so... I killed my doctor after she told me that... Ha ha... ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha! Leah slowly turns around, her hair is a mess and all in her face, her bangs are even cut crooked. Nana says I have to kill you now... You all must die! Leah summons her scythe and lunges at Anna. The sound of metal hitting metal is heard, as you guard Anna with the sword. You: Anna. Make yourself useful or make yourself scarce. Leah: Tee hee. You guys are fun! Leah teleports behind Anna and begins gnawing on her head and slobbering all over it. Anna: RECEDAS! Anna's body glows purple and Leah is sent flying into a wall. Leah: I feel like a roller coaster! Leah says as she rolls on the floor laughing. Scarlet: Perhaps it's best if you let me put her out of her misery. You: Scarlet! Scarlet: Just a suggestion... Anna: Cover me while I gather mana. I have a big spell that I'm going to try on Leah, and I only get one shot. You: Alright then... Let's do this! Anna: Anima purgatio, potestas crimen, potentia pretio... Leah gets up and throws her scythe. There's no way you can block or dodge it at that velocity. In a flash Scarlet is standing in front of you with Leah's scythe embedded in her right shoulder. Anna: Everyone move! You all get out of Anna's way. Anna: ANIMA MUNDA! Anna releases a massive ball of majic. It hits Leah directly. In a flash Leah is seen still standing. You slowly approach Leah, sword still raised, just in case... Two large blue flaming ghostly skeleton arms appear behind you and push you into Leah's arms. Leah: Hey Lexi. How've ya been? Do you know what Nana put me through? You: Ha ha. I can only imagine. I missed you sis. Leah: Me too Lexi, me too... Anna: Am I chopped liver? Another set of arms grab Anna and drop her next to you and Leah, who pulls her in for a hug. Scarlet: So touching... It warms my non-beating heart. Leah: I really need to fix my hair... Everyone starts laughing as you walk back to the jet. On the way there Scarlet pulls Leah's scythe out of her shoulder. Scarlet: I believe this is yours. Leah: I almost forgot. Thanks! Who are you again? Scarlet: Your future sister-in-law. You: Scarlet... Scarlet: Sorry honey... Leah gasps. Leah: Lexi! You're a lesbian? You: Yeah... Mom's... kinda accepted it now... Scarlet isn't exactly helping... Scarlet: I love you Lexi. I makes me stupid sometimes. She says as she smiles at you with her fanged grin. Leah: Either way, I'm proud of you. And you did find a... partner... before I did. You: Leah you're only like 12 minutes older than me... Leah: Hey! Guys dont dig batshi- poo... crazy! You: It's fine Lee, it's fine. All of the sudden Scarlet tackles you and starts making out with you. You: Mmm... Scarlet... Mmmm... Not now... Mmmm... Not here... Mmmm... Scarlet: Please Alexis? Your mom always ruins the mood... You: But my... Mmmm... sisters are here. Scarlet: Show of hands. Who here says I should stop? No one? Ok then! Scarlet continues to make out with you for another 10 minutes before pulling away. Scarlet: Alexis... May I? You: Fine... Scarlet clamps down on your neck and sucks your blood for about a minute. She pulls away and you stab yourself in the neck with one of the vampire anti-venom syringes. Scarlet: You know that you only turn into a vampire if I want you to turn into a vampire. Right? You: Seriously? I've been stabbing myself for nothing? I would be mad at you, but you're just too cute... Anna: Alright, let's go lezbirds. Leah: Lezbirds. Ha ha. I like that. Anna: Yeah, ha ha. Lesbian + Lovebirds = Lezbirds. You: I get it! After a few minutes of walking you finally reach the jet. Kelly: I see you were successful. You all just kind of collectively groan and slump into one of the seats. Scarlet: Oh. Lexi. You: Yeah? Scarlet: When you turn 18 I'm gonna vamp you, so that we can be together forever! You: Sure. Whatever you say honey...<br>\r\n<u>The Control Room</u><br>\r\nHeather: Leah! Your mom runs up and hugs Leah. Leah: Oh. <i>Now</i> you miss me... Heather: I'm sorry that I shipped you off to my mother's house. After seeing Lexi and her girlfriend, I learned to be accepting of all kinds of people... Even those that take souls to the next world... Leah: Oh mother... You gasp. You: So you do like Scarlet! Scarlet: Family hug! Everyone ambushes your mom with hugs before breaking away about 5 minutes later. Heather: Scarlet, I'm sorry I've been so rude to you. I'd be glad to have you as a future daughter. Scarlet: Thank you for your blessing. Scarlet shakes hands with your mom. Scarlet: I would hug you but I'm sure you're hugged out for the day. Tee hee...</span></div></div>",

Someone needs to supervise you while I\u2019m at work, plus you\u2019ll have little Emily to play with you. Mom you know I cant stand her! Your mom points at the door and you begrudgingly walk out of it and over to your next door neighbor\u2019s house, ringing the doorbell. Emily\u2019s mom answers the door. Hi there little Lexi! I\u2019m not a six year old, jeez\u2026 Cmon Lexi. She says gesturing for a hug. Fine\u2026 You hug her for a few seconds. Feel better yet? Yes Aunt Kelly\u2026 Good. Feel free to make yourself at home. Emily is in her room if you want to play with her. No thanks\u2026 I\u2019m good\u2026 Do you dislike Emily? Kind of\u2026 Uh! No offense or anything! Kelly giggles slightly. None taken. Emily can be a bit\u2026 Distant to others. I thought she was a robot or something when I first met her. Kelly giggles at your little joke. That\u2019s cute. Anyways I\u2019ll be in the study if you need me. Ok. I\u2019m just gonna go watch TV. You sit on the couch in the living room and watch cartoons for a while. After some time you get bored and decide to go visit Aunt Kelly in the study. Hey Aunt Kelly? Yes honey? Can I use your computer? Sure Lexi. But can you do me a huge favor and crawl under the desk and tighten the cords first? Sure. You say with a smile. You crawl under the desk and tighten the cords. You turn around and realize that your face is really close to Aunt Kelly\u2019s feet. You\u2019ve always felt a bit weird around girl\u2019s feet. Looking at Aunt Kelly\u2019s, you can see that her toenails are painted pretty cerulean blue color. You gingerly extend your hand and touch her toes, the feeling of them sends shivers down your spine, the good kind. Lexi? Aunt Kelly, can I stay down here a while? I want to play with your feet. Sure Lexi, an odd request but I\u2019ll oblige you. Thank you so much! Loves ya Aunt K! Kelly giggles at your enthusiasm. You scoot into the corner of the desk and pull one of her feet into your lap. You begin to caress it but the smell is quickly making you feel a strange new sensation between your legs\u2026 But it\u2019s a good sensation\u2026 You bring her sole up to your face and bury your nose between her toes, inhaling deeply. Oh my Lexi\u2026 That\u2019s so cute! Can I adopt you? Tee hee. You then shove all five of her toes into your mouth, feeling around with your tongue. You moan in bliss at the sensation. Unknown to you, Kelly uses her powers to implant a desire to masturbate to her feet into your head. Almost involuntarily, your fingers enter your skirt\u2026 Then slip their way into your panties\u2026 Your sucking intensifies, as do your fingers. The pressure builds and\u2026 Extreme bliss, your moan is so loud that it even slips out of your toe filled mouth. You cant see it. But Kelly smiles rather deviously as Phase I of her plan to make you her loyal footslave succeeds brilliantly\u2026</span></div></div>",

She is a horsemen of Apocalypse: Famine. She carries the Flail of Famine an has an ethereal, malnurished and starved looking horse named Munchers.<br>\r\nWeakness: None, due to being Dracula's daughter, thus meaning that she is a pure blooded Vampire. That's why she can walk in broad daylight and such. Also crosses and holy water only work on Vampires of lesser blood, which Scarlet is not one of, Hell, even a stake through the heart wouldn't phase her. Essentially Scarlet is an unstoppable monster if she wants to be.<br>\r\nOther Info: 5'8, silver hair, red eyes, Natural Born Vampire (Pale skin) wears a Victorian style dress and shoes, also she is bi-sexual because feeding is a somewhat sexual activity. Also, she does not need blood to live, however, a few months deprival of it will cause her to lose all higher brain functions and be like a ravenous predator. You keep a supply of various bloods in the fridge though, so Scarlet is set, she goes out for a hunt once in a while too. She always speaks in a sexy Eastern European accent because she was born in, and spent a large portion of her life living in Romania.<br>\r\nFeet: Size 9, blood red toenails of course<br>\r\nPersonality: She's quite friendly actually, somewhat motherly, she's kinda like the Team Mom<br>\r\nFamily Relations: Dracula: Father, One of the three first brides of Dracula (Probably the blonde): Mother, Lexi: Goddaughter, Leah: Goddaughter, Anna \"Elana\": Goddaughter, countless sisters, countless sired individuals</span></div></div>",

She starts dangling her flat from her left foot. Sc-scarlet? Yes dear child? I-I... You cant sleep because something is pre-occupying all of your thoughts no? You lose your ability to speak completely. No words Alexis, only actions. You kneel in front of Scarlet who continues to read her book as if you aren't even there. She continues to play with her footwear, it has you mesmerized. Go ahead Alexis, we have all night to have fun. She puts down her book and smiles at you with her fanged grin. She then bats you a seductive look. You try to speak to tell her that you cant take the teasing anymore, but for some reason you cant talk sometimes when you're around Scarlet... well... seductive women in general... You grab her feet and pull off both of her shoes, exposing her sexy bare feet. You shove 5 of her toes into your mouth and a good bit of her foot. You are so turned on that you feel a ridiculous amount of saliva flowing back down your throat. It tastes strangely sweet... wait... it's blood? Scarlet's blood? You pull her foot out of your mouth. You touch your teeth and are horrified to find out that your top incisors are way longer than they were a few minutes ago, your heart stops pounding... forever. You feel a sudden feral rage and lunge at Scarlet, who easily counters you and pins you to the ground. Stupid bitch! What did you do to me?! Lexi, Lexi, Lexi. It doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out what's happened to you. You told me that Metahumans cant be vamped, and I have a double meta-gene even! Perhaps it is because of the sheer number of times I've bitten you these past 6 years... Huh? It's possible that my vampire genes have completely obliterated your meta-genes. Try out your powers. You try something simple, like a fireball, but nothing happens. You then try your secondary powers, again something simple, like octopus arms. Again, nothing. Now try my powers. That's stupid! You stomp your booted foot into the ground in anger. Lexi, move your foot for a second. Whatever. You move your foot and are shocked to see that that you've left a boot shaped indent in the wood. And that's probably nowhere near your full power. It's official, I'm a Vampire. And my newest daughter. What? I sired you, making me the one who re-birthed you... in a delayed way anyway... Well maybe I liked being able to not burn in sunlight. Please, you're MY daughter. Meaning? Meaning you came from the strongest female vampire ever to have existed, other than my wonderful mother of course. Anyway, because you're mine, you have none of the weaknesses non-royal family vampires have. Royal? The Alucards are the oldest and most powerful vampire family, we might as well be royalty in the vampire community. You roll your eyes at Scarlet. Dont you disrespect me like that! I killed my birth mother because of that kind of thing... well... she broke my heart and ridiculed me, but you know what I mean \"mom\". Scarlet sighs. I'm sorry child, it's just been so long since I sired anyone. I only pick those I deem worthy you know. Dont I feel special now- GAH!!! MY STOMACH IS ON FIRE!!! You fall to the ground clutching your stomach. Calm yourself Alexis, that's normal the first few years. Scarlet tosses you a blood pouch, which you quickly tear open and slurp down. I love you mommy. You say like a little kid. Scarlet only smiles her fanged smile at you and pats you on the head. You look so much like I did when I was your age. You already look my age, you dont age Scarlet. Scarlet hands you a mirror. You look at yourself and see that your skin is pale, your hair is silver and your irises are crimson red. You open your mouth and find that your top two incisors are not as big as you imagined them to be, probably only three times longer than a human's would be. They dont stick out of your mouth, then again, neither do Scarlet's. With her fangs only being seen when she smiles or is about to bite. After a few more seconds your reflection disappears completely. You sigh. Fret not child, I'll be with you all of the way and you'll be learning from the best. So you'll teach me the crazy eyes mind control thing? Only the Alucards... Please? You say as your eyes glow, unknown to you. Egad! Alexis! I think I completely overwrote your DNA with mine! What makes you say that? You have the eyes of the vampire, something only mother, father, my two aunts, my sisters, and myself possess! No way! I'm you?! Basically... yes... Although you seem to have kept your... most charming characteristics. How... Blood sense, all of your blood is flowing toward a certain cavity in you body... Can I... I'll teach you... in time... Scarlet, if I go crazy again I want you to stake me... Alexis. You know I could never kill my first true daughter. You'll learn to control it in time. But my friends... I killed all of my childhood friends in a berserk feeding frenzy in my early years. Does it haunt you to this day? All of the time, even if it was an accident... How did you learn to control it? Virgin's blood, very very potent stuff. It will keep you satisfied for years. Then why did you bite me so much? It also tastes the best... Sorry about that Lexi. It's fine... So what exactly does Virgin's blood taste like? You already know the answer to that Alexis. But the only blood I've ever tasted is yours Scarlet... you're a Virgin?! Aren't you like 500 years old? Yes. I have no kids and I've never had all that strong of a feeling for men. I thought you were bi? Barely, feeding is the only thing that keeps me that way. But you and I... Are both girls... Oh, I guess oral doesn't count then... When has it ever? Now...</span></div></div>",

You feel as if a certain switch inside your head gets flipped, as if Scarlet is subtley manipulating you... Of course mother, but I need a couple of minutes and a mirror... Dammit! Uh Scarlet? Yes child? I uh... Kinda need your help with my makeup... A few minutes later you look as you did only a few moments ago, save for the silver hair, and a wig would only look stupid, so you decide to just say screw it and hope no one notices... One last thing Scarlet. Yes? Leah is the Grim Reaper. Are you sure she can even be turned? We'll just have to see, and if not she'll just have that many more breathing holes, and I'll have more virgin's blood. He he...<br>\r\n<u>Leah's Room</u><br>\r\nKnock knock. You awake sis? Leah's automatic door slides open and and she stands before you in her pajamas, rubbing her eyes. Lexi, it's 3 in the morning. What is so important that you needed to wake me up? I was lonely. Cant I hang out with my twin sister without all this critcism? You can... just not at three in the morning... in fact... you need to make it up to me for waking me up. Leah says as she smiles evilly. Two ghostly blue skeleton hands appear behind you and push you into Leah's arms. Cmon sis. You dont have to restrain me. I'd gladly do it willingly! Fine. I'm a reasonable girl after all. Leah lets go of you and points to her bed. You sit on her bed, eager for what's about to happen next. Leah walks over and lazily falls onto her bed. Help me up would ya? Sure sis. You pull Leah onto the bed easily and she rests her feet on your lap. Just do... whatever... I'm tired. Just be sure to make it... sensual... Leah says as she gets a little closer to your face than you would like, before slumping back on to her pillow. You begin by lightly caressing her feet and gently pulling on her toes, causing Leah to hum lightly, followed by sighing. At this rate you might just put me back to sleep... You then bring her foot closer to your face, it smells divine, but it's not just the foot you're smelling, but the blood that flows within it... As your eyes slowly turn red again, you begin lightly kissing Leah's foot... That's nice Lexi... OWWWW! WHAT THE FUCK LEXI! You just bit my foot... You continue to suck the blood from her foot, savoring the sweet taste of her blood. What the... Leah pulls her foot out of your mouth and summons her scythe. Back it up or your head's comin off! You scramble away from Leah, retreating to the corner of her bed and curling up into a ball and crying. I'm sorry Leah, I couldn't help myself. They're just so pretty, and they smell so good... Start talking! Come closer. What? Come closer... I'm too afraid to talk any louder... Leah lowers her scythe and comes within whispering distance of your face. You lift your head from behind your knees and stare Leah in the eyes as a yellow glow forms around yours. Follow me, tell no one, ask no questions. Yes mistress... Leah says like a zombie as her scythe vanishes.<br>\r\n<u>4 AM, Z Team HQ, The Library</u><br>\r\nI have done as you asked mother. Very good child, here is your reward. Scarlet tosses you a blood pouch which you greedily tear open and slurp down, just like the first one. However Alexis... Do show more... restraint next time... Scarlet says as she looks at the two small holes in Leah's foot. Sorry mommy... You say looking away in shame. It's nothing to be ashamed of, Vampires often bite the part they are most attracted too, for example most of my female victims end up with a couple of holes in their breasts. I only bit you on the neck as a sign of respect... Plus the corotid and the jugular are there... Anyway, as for you my dear sweet Leah... Hey! Dont fret Alexis. You will always be my first daughter. Alexis. I'm going to require your assistance on this one. I'll take the left and you take the right. Scarlet bites Leah. You hesitate for a second before sinking your fangs into your sister's neck flesh. You both remain there for about a minute before Scarlet finishes. A few more seconds and Scarlet has to pull you off of Leah. Alexis dear. We are Vampires, not leeches. Did you not feel her heartbeat beginning to slow? Yeah well I... I couldn't stop! I could've killed her! Calm down Alexis, I'm not letting you out of my sight for at least 50 or so years until you learn some self control. Leah falls over and lies motionless on the floor. Leah! You start to run towards her but Scarlet holds you back. Just watch. Leah's leg begins to twitch and she slowly rises to her feet. Her eyes slowly open. The fire from the fireplace reflected in her crimson eyes. Her lips slowly curl into a smile, as her fangs are slowly revealed. She removes her hood and her hair has turned silver. Leah: Sister! Leah teleports over to you and hugs you. A bit too tight for comfort. You: Leah... Leah: That's for biting my foot! You: Hey wait a minute! Why does she still have her powers and I dont? Scarlet: I honestly dont know... You: So not fair! Leah: Owww! Dammit Lexi! Cool down! You: Huh? As you look yourself over you notice that you are literally on fire... Which must mean that your matter control powers have returned. Scarlet: Jealously... I should have guessed...</span></div></div>",

Come with me Alexis. Scarlet's mom wraps her arms around you, shoving your face into her... ample bosom. If your heart was still beating you might just be having a nosebleed right now. Scarlet: Mother! Mina: Calm yourself child. You should know by now how the women in this family are. Scarlet blushes a bit.  Scarlet: M-mother! Mina: Cmon Scarlet honey.

So anyway, you know how I usually tie you up when I'm playing with you? Yeah... Your point? Well. Check this out! Vanessa pulls what looks like a pen from between her breasts and pushes the button. At first it looks like a lightsaber but as it gets longer it begins to look more like a whip made of energy. Vanessa grabs the end and ties it until it forms a loop. What are planning to do with that? This isn't some kind of twisted hangman fantasy is it? Not at all. I stole this little beauty from Emily. She said it's some kind of Electro-Lasso or something... And you may not know this but... I grew up on a ranch. I'm pretty good with a lasso. She says as she smirks at you and begins twirling the lasso. Run. Vanessa I'm not gonna... Vanessa pulls one of Edy's pistols from her boot and begins shooting at the floor. Is she a klepto? Vanessa! You begin running for all of 3 seconds before the lasso snares you and Vanessa begins reeling you in. Vanessa spins you around so that you face her. Hostage tie or Hog tie? You sigh. Hostage... Vanessa pins your arms to your sides and begins to tie them down. Comfy? Whatever. Cmon Lexi. You love it when I tie you up. I'm sure Leah would jump at a chance like this. Consider yourself lucky that I like you that much more kay? Leah... She always thinks that she's better than me cause mom liked her better... You mumble as your eyes begin to blaze... Bad Lexi! No powers! Vanessa whips you on the ass with her riding crop. Motherfucker! That hurt Vanessa! You yell as your eyes return to normal. It worked didn't it? Would you rather me jab you with one of Ally's meta-inhibitor needles? Jeez Nessa. Are you a Kleptomaniac or something? I wouldn't be surprised if you had Leah's scythe or Anna's spellbook in your possession. I am not a thief! A thief is someone who steals things and never returns them. I fully intend to return this stuff when I'm done with it. Plus I would never borrow something from your sisters. They're crazy... Ha ha! Aint that the truth. Vanessa begins unzipping her thigh high boots... You lick your lips in anticipation. Vanessa notices an unzips her boots even slower than before. Oh cmon! You then remember that Vanessa didn't tie your legs, so you begin to use them to help expedite the process. Vanessa's boots are finally off. Ok ok. I can see that you're growing impatient. Her toes are painted an alternating blood red/jet black color. You've always loved that. Vanessa rests her feet on your boobs, just out of reach of you mouth. Vanessa giggles. You lean forward and attempt to get at her toes with your mouth. It isn't producing results. Lexi you look like a retarded seal right now! I am not responsible for my actions while under the influence of hormones Mistress Spencer. Mistress Spencer? From Rumble Roses? Man you say some weird stuff when you're all fetishy... What goes on in that head of yours? But I guess that's semi-relevant cause of my outfit... Maybe I should go for teacher-dominatrix rather than dominatrix-dominatrix... That would be hot... Lexi you're a genius! Vanessa gives you a quick kiss on the lips with and audible mwah sound. She then rests her feet a little higher so you can easily reach them. You then begin to lick her feet, loving every second of it. Vanessa pats you on the head before...</span></div></div>",

No. All dead. Killed to find the one with the metagene... to find me...

Oh... like 1942... in Germany... Turns out they didn't like anyone who didn't look like you, redheads included... I hope you burn in Hell Valerie... Valerie... That's my grandma's name! That explains the resemblance... Maybe I'll just take it out on you because you look just like her... Rose says as her look turns psycho... Rose? Rose pushes you onto your back and pins your arms down. I'm gonna bite your face off with my teeth now. Ok? ROSE! You say as you make your eyes glow red and turn your arms into octopus tentacles, quickly tying up Rose with them. Let me go you Nazi! You sigh. She's having another PTSD episode... Lexi to Emily, Rose is spazzing again. Can you fix her? Yeah yeah, I got it. Emily walks in and injects Rose with something. That should calm her down, but it might make her a bit loopy. I'll be in my lab if you need me. You let Rose go and she just sits there silently. Um... Rose? Lexi... Did you know that I have boobies? Do you want to see them? Tee hee... he he he... Rose starts giggling. You sigh again. Every time... Rose stumbles over to you. Lexiiiiii... She says shaking you. What Rose? I'm boooooored! Alright Rose just... sit there and chill ok? Okey dokey artichokey! You sit next to Rose and pull off her flip flops. Oooooooh! Foot massage me! Rose shoves her pretty feet into your lap. Her shiny black polish is so sexy. She wiggles her toes. Ruuuub them. Come oooooon! You begin to rub Rose's feet. Rose starts purring like a cat. As you rub her feet, your urge to worship them just grows with every passing second. Roooose... Go on Lexi. Lick them... You want to lick them! My feet control you... He he he... You do as Rose says and give her sole a giant lick, to you it's the best taste in the world...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption #1: Rose's metagene is unstable.

You start spinning, eventually reaching a speed where your whole body is just a blur. You plow through the hordes of undead like an out of control spinning top. You stop spinning and see all of the undead that you've lain waste to. Damn you Lexi! Tori does her thing and a single ghost's hand reaches from the ground... and up Tori's body... until reaching her breast... The rest of the ghost pops out of the ground. Hot Necromancer... Yes! It's not some creepy old guy this time! He shouts as he continually squeezes her boobs. Excuse me! Why are you fondling my boobs! Oh... Terribly sorry. I forgot to introduce myself. I am Tom, but I'm usually known by my nickname, Peeping Tom. Nice to meet you Necromancer. Tom extends his hand to Tori, who reluctantly shakes his hand. Great. Another pervert living here... Excuse me Tori! I can kick you off this team anytime I want! Or maybe I'll just persuede your new friend to grope you into submission. You wouldn't dare! Hey Tom... Tom's ears twitch to your direction, like a dog when it's name is called. You rang pretty lady? Come closer... Yes? You whisper to Tom, I'll give you unlimited access to grope my boobies all you want. <i>If</i> you do me a favor first. Sure. Name it. I want you to harass Tori as much as possible. Come back to me after she zaps you. And she <i>will</i> zap you. Gotcha boss! Tom sinks into the floor and half pops up behind Tori. He begins squeezing her butt cheeks. So round and firm... Did anyone ever tell you that you have killer legs? Tori shivers. That's it you little pervert! I'm about to kill you... again! Instead of beating up Tom, Tori decides to merely sit down and start pulling her boots off. Tori... Calm down Lexi, it's not for you. After her boots are off she reaches around and flips Tom. He lands face first into the floor. As soon as Tom lifts his head, he is met with a faceful of Tori's stockinged feet. He quickly crawls backwards and starts rubbing his face. Feet are so gross... I thought I had killer legs? You do but... Are you implying that my feet are anything less than at least cute? I... Tori points her finger at Tom and it glows black. Hmm... Nah. Too easy Tori motions with her hand and Tom forcibly flies into her lap. Pucker up pervert! Tori grabs Tom and kisses him on the lips. After she pulls away Tom speaks. What was the poi- Yes!!!!! And he's been zapped... Well played Tori. Tom then flies over to you. I believe we had a deal? You're a girl now, play with your own. Pleeeeeeeease. Tom says giving you a sad puppy look. I have a question. Yeah? Are you still gonna call yourself Tom now that you're a girl? Why wouldn't I? Whatever. Fire away perve. Dont act like you wont enjoy it, I know a lesbian when I see one. You blush. I... Well you're no different now! Well I'm dead, so that makes you a Necro. I dont get pleasure from dead people you sicko! But you like girls... and their feet... How did you- Let's just say Tori gave me a little parting gift, you notice Tom's irises slowly  stop glowing yellow. Ah. The old skeletons in the closet stare. Damn her... Have fun you two! I need to shower all this pervert off me. Tori shivers and walks out the room. Tom stares at you with lust filled eyes. This isn't gonna work, you have the same name as my brother... But I like being a girl named Tom. I think it's really cute! Please dont make me change it Lexi! I dont know... will these change your mind? Tom puts her feet on your lap...</span></div></div>",

You turn your arms into octopus arms and teleport behind Desdemona. You wrap her up in your tentacles. Ha! Try breaking these! Desdemona teleports out of your grasp and turns to face you. She smiles and grabs both of your tentacles and ties them into a bow. Have fun getting out of that by yourself Lexi, he he. You fall to your knees defeated. Desdemona looks at you with ALMOST genuine concern. Desdemona sighs, I'm only doing this because I love to dominate others. Get on your back. You get on your back with some difficulty due to being... tied up at the moment. Desdemona sits on your chest, using your tentacles as a back rest. She then rests her feet on your face, and you can only moan. You are so odd Lexi. Over the millenia many men and women have fallen for me, even without me using my power on them. But you are truly the first to have ever lusted only for my feet. I do quite enjoy it though. Maybe it's because I always smell heavily of pheremones that drive humans mad with lust... Or perhaps you're just hopelessly addicted to feet... Why am I even talking? You probably aren't even listening. Probably just thinking \"FEEEEET...\" Just like those wretched Zombies are with brains... Tori... Remind me to insult Tori later...</span></div></div>",

You say blushing a bit. <span class=\"cred\">Thank you Henrietta.</span> You hand her the phone and she dials three digits, well really she just hit the 6 button three times and hit send. <span class=\"cred\">My sister will be here shortly.</span> You have a sister? <span class=\"cred\">Yes, my precious little sister Satanica. I think she'll like you.</span> A flame appears and it materializes into a young blonde woman. <span class=\"cred\">Satanica! Come give your big sis a hug!</span> <span class=\"cborange\">Yeah. Sure Demonica. And could you call me June? That's what I go by now.</span> <span class=\"cred\">Oh... Right... The whole soul thing...</span> Demonica and June hug each other briefly. Then they both look at you. What? Is there something on my face or something? <span class=\"cborange\">This is her? She vaguely reminds me of my old WWII commander... I miss my days as a Nazi General...</span> My grandma was in the S.S. Did you know her? <span class=\"cborange\">Right. Then you must be Valerie von Reinhouser's granddaughter. You look just like her. Nice to meet you!</span> She says as she flame teleports over to you and hugs you. <span class=\"cborange\">Demonica. Anything else I should know?</span> <span class=\"cred\">Foot fetish, she's got it BAD.</span> <span class=\"cborange\">Oooh. Fun. Demonica, can you do that thing to her? That think that I haven't learned yet?</span> <span class=\"cred\">Ah. Limb control, yes.</span> Demonica moves her index finger in a circle and you body moves by itself and kneels in front of her. June is laughing gleefully the whole time. <span class=\"cred\">Ok. Now worship my feet.</span> You pull Demonica's high heels off and begin kissing her sexy foot. Suddenly your left arm moves down to the area between your legs. Your hand slips itself into your pants, then into your panties... Oooh... Demonica... Mmmm... Why? <span class=\"cred\">Because it's fun to watch you squirm. Now go faster!</span> Your fingers pick up the pace making you squirm even more... Good thing you have short fingernails... <span class=\"cborange\">This is so much fun! You simply must teach it to me so I can use it on my hubby DJ.</span> Huh? Oooh... You're married to... ahh... that guy? I thought he was dating that... mmmm... nerdy chick? <span class=\"cborange\">Well in the future he and I are happily married and have two wonderful daughters... I would open time portals and let you meet them, but we can do that later. I think Tessa and Cynthia would love to meet you and their aunt who never visits me...</span> <span class=\"cred\">Well in the future dad retires and I'm very busy running Hell!</span> Ooooh... Catfight! Ooooh... June strips of her boots and walks over to you seductively. <span class=\"cborange\">You wanna play that card then fine... I'm taking your slave. Cmon Blondie. I'm taking you away from this nasty witch.</span> <span class=\"cred\">Dont cross me Satanica... I could extinguish your life in an instant...</span> <span class=\"cborange\">Oh? Are you destined to be the Destroyer then? Didn't think so.</span> <span class=\"cred\">That's it...</span> Demonica stands up and creates a black fireball in each hand. Why are they... ohhh... black? <span class=\"cred\">Hellfire. Nasty stuff.</span> June creates a white fireball in each hand. <span class=\"cred\">No way! Those are...</span> <span class=\"cborange\">Oh. You mean the holy flames? Just a little something I picked up from my best friend... who happens to be an Angel. If you weren't so racist and hateful towards them then you might learn something.</span> <span class=\"cred\">You sicken me...</span> Demonica... oooooh! Can you please tell my hand to st-oooooooop! Demonica taps her bare heel on the ground and your hand finally stops. You quickly hide behind Demonica's throne and peek your head around the corner...<br>\r\n<u>A few minutes later</u><br>\r\nAre you two gonna fight or just stare at each other? I want to be someone's bitch sometime this century... I'm getting bored... <span class=\"cborange\">She's right you know.</span> <span class=\"cred\">DIE!</span> Demonica throws her fireballs which June easily dodges, before throwing hers at Demonica. Demonica tries to move but seems unable. <span class=\"cred\">What the?</span> The fireballs hit Demonica, sending her flying into her throne covered in burns. <span class=\"cred\">*Cough* *Cough* How?</span> <span class=\"cborange\">Shadow possession technique. I watch anime with my hubby. I got the idea from one of the characters on this one about ninjas.</span> <span class=\"cred\">Ha ha... *Cough* Well then... What are you waiting for? Finish me!</span> June walks over to Demonica and forms a ball of white light in her hand and rubs it on Demonica's burns, which then heal instantly. <span class=\"cred\">Why must you always be so nice... It's disgusting...</span> <span class=\"cborange\">It's a soul thing.</span> Demonica sighs. <span class=\"cborange\">Henrietta's yours. Take her before I change my mind.</span> June creates a rope and lassos you with it, dragging you behind her into another portal...<br>\r\n<u>Satanica's Personal Dimension</u><br>\r\n<span class=\"cborange\">Sorry about my sister. She's definitely the Devil's daughter... Well I am too, but you know, the whole having a soul thing. What is your name by the way? I know it isn't Henrietta.</span> It's Alexis, but everyone calls me Lexi... <span class=\"cborange\">Hey. Dont be so shy. I dont bite.</span> I dunno... After meeting your sister and Desdemona... I'm weary of Demons... <span class=\"cborange\">Well I'm not my sister or Lilith's daughter. I swear that I'm nice.</span> Fine... I'm trusting you because I'm kinda stuck in this dimension... <span class=\"cborange\">Dont be like that! We're friends!</span> Fine. Whatever... June creates a throne and sits on it. Her feet are still bare and seem to stare back at you. You decide to sit in front of her. Her feet are at eye level. You grab one of her feet and begin to lick it. <span class=\"cborange\">I like you Lexi.</span> June uses her other foot to pet you on the head...</span></div></div>",

You: Phoebe wait! The whole world around you gets a funky wavy distorted look to it. About a minute later everything returns to normal... Oh hell no! She did not just turn you into a life sized Tinkerbell! You: Phoebe! Phoebe: My bad, let me just reverse it... uh oh... Emily: What's uh oh... Mulan? Really? That's just racist! I'm not even Chinese! I'm Vietnamese! You: Ha ha! Emily: Can it Tinkerbell! You immediately stop laughing. Leah: Why am I the Wicked Witch of the West? You: Are you sure? You're not green or anything. Leah: I guess I'm just a hotter version then... Anna: What am I supposed to be? Edy: I know! The White Witch! Anna: Huh? Edy: Chronicles of Narnia? Nothing? You: At least you're Little Red Riding Hood and not Tinkerbell... Vanessa: But Tinkerbell's cuter. You: Thanks Nessa... Sexy Cinderella! Vanessa: Thank you very much... Tinkerbell. Tee hee... Petra: At least you're all female characters. I'm just a girl version of the scarecrow in the Wizard of Oz... You: You make it look cute. Wait. Phoebe. Who are you? Phoebe: Maleficent. He he. You: Scarlet, you've been awfully quiet. Scarlet: Off with her head! Tee hee. I'm the Queen of Hearts. Ally: Then I must be Alice... You: Yeah yeah. You look cute Scarlet, you too Ally. Anyway, so what is this problem Phoebe and how *Jingle jingle* You try to talk again and only jingles come out of your mouth. You glare angrily at Phoebe. Phoebe: Ha ha ha! Phoebe falls over laughing. Suddenly you feel as if everything else is getting bigger... Oh shit... You continue to shrink until you are about 3 inches tall, which seems correct for Tinkerbell's height. You just sit down and look depressed. Of all people Nessa steps forward and gently picks you up. Want me and Lil' Red over there to cheer you up? You look up at Nessa with a questioning glance. Vanessa: I swear I'll be gentle. I may be domineering, but I dont actually want to hurt you. Plus Edy's gonna babysit me. Ok? You nod at her, jingling as you do... Man that's annoying... Edy: Hi little pixie! She says gently poking you in the stomach with her index finger. You just glare at her. Edy: Hey. Who knows what Cindy here will do with those glass slippers of hers if I didn't monitor her? You sigh. Edy: Glad that you understand. An invisible lightbulb appears above your head. You fly over to Emily and jingle in Morse code. Emily: Oh I get it. Go on. Fix... this... now... Oh... Gotcha Tink. Tee hee... Emily walks off to her lab to do... genius things or something... You fly back over to Nessa, who carries you to her room, once there, she and Edy sit down. Like a moth to a lightbulb, you find yourself at Nessa's glass heels, you can see her toes through her footwear, instead of their normal red/black color, they're painted a sexy light blue color. Vanessa: Whoa. Slow down Tink, let me help you out... Wow... You begin to pull off Nessa's glass heels, which are like 3 to 4 times your own body size, and 2 or 3 times your body weight. Edy: Well... Either she's <i>really</i> horny, or she kept some of her original powers... After her footwear is off, you immediately begin hugging and kissing her foot, wings twitching like crazy. Vanessa: Lexi. You feel a lot softer than before... It's like... majic... This provokes some thought from you... maybe... just maybe... you might have some limited control over the minds of others with of this yellow dusty crap that's constantly falling off of you... Hmm... You fly up to Nessa's face and snap your fingers, she snaps out of her trance. Vanessa: What are doing up here? I thought you were gonna rub my feet? You nod yes, making a jingling sound. You then twirl in place, getting a bunch of pixie dust in Nessa's face. She only blinks at you. You think of something simple, like making her wiggle her toes, to your amazement, it works! Edy: Nessa? Are you ok? You motion for Edy to come closer. Edy: Hmm? What is it Lexi? You turn around and shake your butt in her face, making alot of pixie dust in the process. Edy: Very funny Lexi... Edy also gets a blank look on her face. You think about her bare feet and she begins unlacing her boots... At about this time Leah walks in. Leah: They're all driving me insane out there... How's it goin sis? You fly up to Leah's ear and just talk normally. Leah: Lexi! I can understand you! Huh? You want me to check my shoes? Ok. Leah lifts up her robe and to her surprise, she has on black and white striped stockings and the red ruby slippers. Leah: If I remember correctly, this makes me the Wicked Witch of the East then... Hey. What's up with Nessa and Edy? You mentally will for them to act normal... for now... Edy: Sorry about that Leah. I was just in deep thought about whether or not I should go look for a wolf in the woods and turn it into Swiss cheese. Vanessa: And I was wondering whether I should use Windex on my shoes, or just throw them in the dish washer. We'll catch up with you later. Nessa and Edy walk out, leaving their shoes in the room. You fly up to Leah's face and give her a seductive look. Leah: Lexi... You're a naughty little fairy... You jingle at her. Pixie. My bad. You smile at her. You motion for her to sit. Leah sits on the bed. You fly down to her feet and pull off her ruby slippers. You then fly up her robes and grab the top of her stocking. You fly back down and pull it off, repeating with the other leg. Leah wiggles her bare toes, toenails now painted dark green instead of their usual electric blue. You take Leah's big toe and clamp down on it, it takes up most of your mouth. You continue to happy suck on your twin sister's toe for the next hour or so. Leah: Jeez Lexi. Dont you ever breathe? Ha ha...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption #1: Reality distorts some more and you all end up in your character's respective universe... Guess you're stuck with Peter Pan and Wendy for a while...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption #2: Same as Option #1, but we follow Scarlet and Ally instead...</span></div></div>",

Now you cant say that you didn't learn anything today.), kunai knives (Anime stylized version), naginata, nunchaku, and her personal favorite, the kusarigama (Mostly because she can tie you up with it with ease), as well as several others. Plus the use of several other ninja techniques.<br>\r\nWeaknesses: None<br>\r\nOther Info: 5'6, Black Hair in a short ponytail, Brown Eyes, Asian (Japanese). Ok, so she wears a white fox mask (Only on base, not out on missions. She has a nasty habit of disappearing and killing everything before you can have any fun), and underneath that mask... is another mask! Like the black cloth kind that covers the nose and mouth. Other than that she wears a black kunoichi's outfit. She must have something against underwear, or doesn't know anything else, because instead of a bra she just wraps her boobs up in bandages, and for underwear she wears a fundoshi, which is traditionally a male undergarmet but oh well, she has the ass for it. Also worth noting, she does her practice training in her \"underwear\". During her combat training, as in the sparring matches you all hold, she wears her outfit. On a side note, yes, Deathwatch and Overkill from Super X are from her clan, although they took a more modern approach to the assassin ways whereas Hino follows the more traditional ninja ways.<br>\r\nAs a kunoichi, seduction for the gathering of information is pretty much in her job description, as such, she has to wear normal clothes at times. Since she doesn't have all the hidden pockets that her normal outfit has, or the weapons cache she keeps in the training rooms, her use of weapons is pretty much limited to Shuriken and when she's in traditional Japanese clothing, the Gunsen (Iron war fan, looks harmless... But it isn't in her hands...) Not that she really needs weapons, cause she can kill just fine with her bare hands. Sometimes she'll get creative and do something like use a kunai as a hair accessory or hide nunchaku in her sleeves... She's a lot of fun at parties to say the least... You're trying to get her to be less ninja and more normal 26 year old woman when you guys aren't out supervillaining and shit...<br>\r\nFeet: Size 9, Shiny Black Toenails<br>\r\nPersonality: Cold and distant, serious, stoic. However, she tends to take on a more playful and dominant persona when she's teasing you with her feet.<br>\r\nFamily Relations: Deathwatch: Clan member (Something like a cousin), Overkill: Clan member (Something like a cousin)</span></div></div>",

That's what you get for staying up all night reading foot fetish erotica. You're just talking crazy now. You blush luminescent red. Hi-hinohana! Hino leans in and lightly hugs you. Cmon Lexi. Just messing with you. You know I love you. You sigh. Right... So what's the plan? I can make a scene at any time! No no Alexis. Subtlety. Like just causally walking by a mark a shoving a blade into his heart without anybody even knowing until it's too late. But Hino, the secret service? I can throw 12 knives at once. I've yet to miss in my 26 years as an assassin. Like I'm supposed to believe that you've been killing since you were an infant. Of course not! That'd be ludicrous. I've been doing it since age five. What I meant to say was I raised by my family of assassins since birth. Now that makes more sense. So can I raise hell while you do some Assassin's Creed shit or what? Hmm... Can you clone yourself? Pffffft. Can I clone myself... You know... I've never actually tried to... You control matter correct? Your powers defy the very nature of the laws of physics. Yeah but I dont want a bunch of me's running around... One of me is enough for everyone's sake... Well... Then you'll just have to make a scene the old fashioned way... She says as she hands you glass of punch and pushes you... Causing you to spill it on the President. Oh my gosh! I'm so sorry! No problem little lady- *Gargling* You stop time save for yourself and Hino. Wow... Dead center of the throat... You look around and about 6 secret service guards in the same... Situation... And game, set, and match... With that you teleport yourself and Hino back to base and unfreeze time before anyone can figure out what just happened.<br>\r\n<u>Z Team HQ, Changing Room/Armory</u><br>\r\nHino looks around. I'll never get used to this teleporting thing... Lexi... Where are my sandals? You mean these? You say as you show them to her. Honestly I'm more impressed than upset. Seeing as you teleported both of us back home and my sandals into your hand at the same time... What can I say? My perversion works miracles... You start to crack up laughing. But seriously Hino... You say straightening up. But of course... You sit in front of her as she begins to rub her soft and sexy feet on your face... Making your hands move on their own to your more sensitive spots... Even though I've known you as long as I have... I still cant get over how cute you look when bliss out Lexi...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption #1: Continue being Hino's Footstool<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption #2: Wake up back in the White House?

Hope you have time on your hands... er... tentacles... Tons... Ok then you see, my grandmother May-Lin worked for the Axis in WWII, and they tasked her with making biological weapons. Anyway, she successfully crossbred humans with bees, creating the Bee People. Bea is a third generation Bee Person...<br>\r\n<u>Flash Back, Berlin Germany, April 1940</u><br>\r\nGeneral: What's your progress Huang? May-Lin: Genetic splicing is nearly complete sir. Shouldn't take me more than another 15 minutes before the first one hatches. General: Hatches from what? May-Lin: That... The general looks over and sees an egg about the size of a bowling ball. General: That's it? May-Lin: They aren't going to be born adults, it should take the first born about 3 weeks to become an adult, and a week for eggs to be laid and hatched. General: So we can have them ready for for combat in a month. May-Lin: Essentially. Yes. Fair heads up, they'll all be female. That part of a bee's DNA is impossible to get around. Unless you wanted weakling sterile Drones instead of an army of Queen Bees? General: Continue with your work Huang. The general turns around and walks off. Not 5 seconds later the egg begins to hatch. To your surprise, what emerges is a fully adult humanoid female. She has two large bee wings on her back, two small antennae growing from her hair, and a super compact version of a bee's compound eyes, they sort of look like honeycombed over human eyes with no pupils. May-Lin: Can you understand me? Queen Bee: It feels so wonderful to be out of that egg. She stretches her wings and moves them in circles. Queen Bee: Why are you looking at me like that? May-Lin: You're naked. Let me get you some clothes. Your eyes glow and a cart with bee themed clothing rolls into the tent. Queen Bee: What are clothes for? May-Lin: They cover up your erm... private parts. Valerie: Now why should she do that? I much prefer her like this. May-Lin: Why are you here Valerie? Valerie: Hey. I'm higher ranked than any general on this base! Within the S.S. my nickname is the Valkyrie for my ferocity in battle and- May-Lin: Do they all know your dirty little secrets? Valerie: Cmon May. You know I can get kicked out for that! Why do you always do this to me? May-Lin: Someone's gotta keep you in check. You know, with whole matter/reality altering powers and all. Valerie: I sure hope my descendants dont ever have to put up with this crap... May-Lin: I bet you they will. If we're still around to see our children and grandchildren that is. Valerie: Please. You and I both know the Axis is going to win this war. May-Lin: Dont get your hopes up. Maybe America will join the war and invent some sort of super bomb. Valerie: Yes. Because we totally provoked them to join the war. Seriously May. For someone so smart you can be pretty stupid sometimes. You roll your eyes at Valerie. Queen Bee: I'm done getting dressed. Valerie: You got her yellow and black striped clothes? May-Lin: She is a Bee Person. Valerie: Oh May... So how will these Bee People ensure our victory anyway? May-Lin: You see Val, it's like this. These Bee People can fly, reproduce like lightning, are super strong, and can shoot venomous stingers, so even unarmed, they're armed. Not to mention they look like her. Can you say distraction? Valerie: Huh. Queen Bee: Did anyone think to ask me how I felt about this? Valerie: Irrelevant. You are a weapon of the Axis powers and nothing more. Queen Bee flys out of the tent and off to who knows where...

I guess Germany offered more than Great Britain did. Are you accusing me of being evil? You say taking a slightly darker tone. DJ: Of course not! I was just curious is all. Did I ever mention that you're really cute when you're mad? You use your powers of mind control on Bea to make her want to foot dominate DJ. Princess Bee: DJ. Why dont we go somewhere more private? DJ: Seriously? I was just your loyal foot servant for the past week and you still want more? Princess Bee looks like she's about to cry. DJ: Cmon. Dont do that... Ugg. Fine! Princess Bee: Yay!

This shouldn't be a problem to you, <span class=\"chotpink\">unless you really stuck around just to watch me sleep</span>.\"</span> She pressed her soles against Lexi's stomach, easing her down to the ground with a series of intimately choreographed movements. Lexi was pinned to the floor underneath the overwhelming presence of her partner. Although she was taken aback by this situation, Lexi was more than willing to adjust to Ally's desires. In continuation of her movements, Ally started to move her left foot. She started at Lexi's navel, flowing down the indentation created by her abdominal muscles until she reached the healthy mound that formed Lexi's nether regions. Ally led this entire stroking motion with the tip of her big toe, rendering Lexi's 'protective' spandex suit ineffective.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLexi let out an exasperated gasp, as Ally made another pass as the sensitive area between her legs. It was clear who had this situation under control, and Ally wanted to make sure that everyone knew it. <span class=\"cpink\">\"You've got ulterior motives, sweetie... <span class=\"chotpink\">and I think it's time to take advantage of those pesky feelings,</span> don't you agree?\"</span> Ally's words seemed to fluctuate between two different types of speech. Her overly nice demeanor was the most obvious one, and Lexi knew this side the best. However, it seemed like Ally also had a more suggestive side to her. It wasn't hard to decipher which personality was speaking what.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlly was attempting to convince Lexi that this was an acceptable situation. It was true that Lexi stuck around after Ally had fainted, but she had no reasonable explanation for it. Ally knew all too well what she wanted, and with that, removed her right foot from Lexi's stomach. Lexi closed her eyes for a moment to gather her wits, and upon opening them, was greeted to a shock. Ally's right foot hovered teasingly close to her face, sufficiently blocking enough of her vision to fulfill its purpose. All Lexi could see was the well-proportioned sole of this demented nurse. The thin layer of fabric that encased her foot highlighted the noticeable aroma that now filled Lexi's senses. Alongside the scent, Lexi could feel the very warmth radiating from Ally's foot, and it was mind-blowing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLexi felt her urges growing stronger, but she didn't know how to act in this situation. There was something about this nurse that fundamentally changed the way she thought about pleasure. Ally turned her into a pliable toy through a few sentences and a bit of foreplay. The realization dawned upon her that she wanted more. Lexi pursed her lips in preparation for what she assumed to be a mouth-to-foot kiss, but that opportunity never came. Ally grinned at her captured leader, fanning the toes along her right foot in admiration of her own efforts. <span class=\"cpink\">\"There you go... I'm glad you accepted yourself, <span class=\"chotpink\">or else I would have taken it a step <i>further</i>.</span> For now, though, I'm going to sleep.\"</span> Ally withdrew both of her feet and stood up, letting out a little yawn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cpink\">\"Good playing with you, Alexis.\"</span> Ally said, waving her hand as she walked out of the room. Lexi's eyes were fastened to the pair of stockinged feet that treaded the floor on their way out of the room. A silence infiltrated the room upon Ally's departure. Lexi was mind-boggled. She wasn't expecting Ally to inspire such desire within her, and then just leave without an explanation or release. For such a bizarre woman, Lexi was contemplating chasing after her down the hallways and begging for more. It was insane.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething felt strange about this situation. As she scanned the empty room, Lexi glanced at the pair of loose hospital shoes that Ally had left behind. Whether or not this was intentional, Lexi realized that this was the perfect invitation back into the fray. But then a thought crossed her mind. She was exhausted, having sustained both a bullet wound to her shoulder before arriving and then being subjected to Ally's intimate playtime. Lexi leaned back against the floor, closing her eyes. She was going to rest... for just a little bit longer.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Man's POV<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou have been chosen by the Police Force as a prime candidate for their Supercop Program, this reminds you of your favorite comic book hero, Captain America. And the hilarious thing is that you're on the Riot Control Squad, meaning you carry a riot sheild around. Anyway, you get a report saying that The Valkyrie has been up to her usual tricks with the local police force again.<br>\r\n<u>The Police Station (Destroyed)</u><br>\r\nThat's quite enough of that Valkyrie! Oh, have I finally pissed you guys off enough to send the armored pigs? \"Pig\" is an offensive term to us and- Blah blah blah, authority, blah blah blah, to protect and serve yada yada, all you guys do is sit on your asses eating donuts and drinking coffee talking about how you busted some 19 year old who was doin drugs or something. Give up, we're gonna win in the end cause we have what it takes to do what's necessary... Enough talk, you're going down. You run at her full speed and prepare to taze her, but she teleports behind you and sweep kicks you, flooring you, she teleports on top of you and phases your arms into the ground, effectively immobilizing you. You're not gonna get away with this! My backup will- your backup is dead, look. She pulls out a small computer tablet and to your shock and horror you see the place you just deployed from is smoldering ruins, you worked with some of those guys for 10 years. You'll pay for this! Oh put a sock in it! She makes her boots disappear and shoves her bare foot in you mouth. Or a foot! Tee hee. It's a good thing your suit is mostly Kevlar, cause if she finds out that you're enjoying this, then you're screwed. You heard from one of your buddies that there was a Mind Reader that The Valkyrie works with, her name was um, Hardware? But she appears to be alone, for now... She has gone to using your helmeted face as her personal footrest until...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption #1: Hardware, come in Hardware. I need you mindscan a guy for information. (They discover your secret fetish and make you a footslave to their whole organization)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption #2: She removes your helmet (which has a darkened visor) and threatens to tell the entire world your identity unless you obey her every whim<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The two of you ended up on opposite sides of the law after she killed mom, you had already moved out at the time.) Poo, now I cant expose your identity without jeopardizing mine! She crosses her arms. I guess you have to join us then... Never. You may be my little sister, but I'll never join you... Thought you'd say that. She pushes a button on her communicator. Send in the twins. In seconds two twins that look like the Yin/Yang symbol materialize before you. The one in the black outfit steps forward and her hand glows an evil black color. Care to reconsider Tom? Or do I have to force you? Do your worst. Alright Yin, do your thing. Yin steps closer... Wait! What Lexi? I just remembered something about my brother... use your feet... Your sister smirks at you with a very evil smile. Lexi gets off of you and Yin takes her place. She takes her boots off and her feet now glow an even darker evil black color. She puts them down on your face and you slowly start to feel the urge to do wrong, from asking your sister to go as far as give you a foot-job, to destroying the earth, to wanting to conquer the universe! Ok, that's far enough. Yin gets off of you and leaves with her sister. So? How do you feel? Give me hug! Did I pick the wrong twin? She lets you out of the ground and walks up to you and hugs you. You whisper in her ear: I want that foot-job you promised me eight years ago. Whoa! Tom that's... naughty... I like it. She smiles at you. But, we have business to attend to first. Fair enough.<br>\r\n<u>Z Team HQ</u><br>\r\nWow Lexi, you got Leah and Anna to join too? Yeah- who's Anna? Our little sister, she's right there. You point to the winged girl. That's Angel Witch, her name's Elana. Hmm... You walk up to her. So you go by Elana now huh? Pardon? Let me show you something. You pull the chain that was around your neck revealing a broken pendant. No way! She pulls out the other half of the pendant and they fit together. Who are you? Hmm... You, Lexi, and probably Leah have all lost your memory. If you have any questions just ask your brother Tom. What's my real name? Anna Gertrude von Reinhouser. After an hour you pretty told her the first ten years of her life. Thanks Tom, she smiles at you then flys off to her room. So Elana is really Anna, mine, yours, and Leah's little sister? Yep. Tom! Leah runs up and hugs you. You finally joined the dark side! Yeah. Hmm... I need a break and some much needed foot lovin. Why dont you, me, and Anna get Tommy here to worship all of our feet? Anna? Long story, I'll tell you while Tom worships our feet.</span></div></div>",

You try to break them but nothing happens. You: Cmon guys is this really necessary? We aren't kids anymore. Do you really have to all gang up on me again? Leah: Aww... But Tommy, I thought you loved it when we do this? You: Granted. Yes. But did you really have to tie me up Anna? Anna: Of course. Otherwise you might try to squirm away. You: Lexi? Lexi: Sorry Tom. I'm not taking sides today. It was all their idea, I just need a break from catering to all of these girls. Leah: You should feel special, we're not letting anyone else join in on the fun. You sigh. You: Alright. Let's get to it then. Lexi and Leah remove their boots. Since Anna's already barefoot, she decides to get a head start by standing on your face. She's oddly light as a feather, you then realize that she's flapping her wings. Her feet are very soft. Lexi and Leah pull off your Kevlar vest and pull up your shirt, they begin rubbing their feet on your sides and chest, as if the invisible ropes didn't even exist. Leah: Hey Lexi? Lexi: Yeah? Leah: Didn't you promise Tom something? Lexi: Right! Now is as good a time as ever. Lexi gets up and moves down to a lower part of your body. Lexi pulls down your pants and immediately gets to work on your guy parts, starting out by slowly pumping her feet up and down, then going at a furious pace. You start breathing more heavily. Leah: Hey Lexi, you're really good at that. Something you wanna tell me Ms. Idontlikeboys? Lexi: I uh... It just sorta comes naturally to me. That's all. Anna has lifted off of your face and has dipped her toes into your mouth, only adding to your already unimaginable pleasure. That one act sets you off and you blow your load all over Lexi's toes and soles. Lexi seems oddly pleased and wiggles her toes, letting it ooze between them. She then decides to lick your jizz off her own feet, apparently really enjoying it. Anna and Leah stare at Lexi. Lexi: What? Just cause I like girls doesn't mean I'm terrified of guys, just not sexually attracted to them. Anna and Leah get off of you and Anna releases her majic ropes from you. Able to move again you quickly put your pants and underwear back on. You: That was fun, he he. Leah: Oh, but we aren't done with you yet Tommy... You: Whoa whoa wait! Gimme like at least a half an hour to recharge. I'm pretty much drained right now. Anna: Oh dont worry, with a little black majic that wont be an issue... You: Lexi. What do you say? Lexi: Hey dont put me in the middle of this! Anna: Why do you always ask Lexi anyway? Is she your favorite sister or something! You: I never picked one. I love all of you. Leah: Prove it. Come give me a kiss... on the lips... Lexi: Leah! Leah: Dont give me that holier than thou crap. We're supervillains, and I'm the damned Grim Reaper. We do what we want, when we want, and how we want. Pucker up big brother! Two giant blue flaming hands appear behind you and slowly drag you toward Leah. You: Leah... think about what you're doing... Anna steps in front of you with a hex bolt in each hand, while Lexi teleports behind Leah with a fireball in each hand. Leah smiles evilly and her horse Despair gallops in from thin air, she mounts him while summoning her scythe. Leah: Alright. Let's do this. All of the sudden you all hear machine gun fire. Edy: Alright break it up! Leah: Make me! Edy: Gladly. Iron Maiden flies in and carries Edy over to the pre-fight staredown. Edy: Alright! Next person that moves gets bullets in their head. Am I clear? Leah: Didnt you get the memo? I am Death! You cant kill death. Edy: So are you bulletproof? Leah: Of course... she says sounding alot less confident. Edy: Care to test that? Leah: Bring it! Edy fires her machine gun at Leah who spins her scythe rapidly, literally slicing the bullets in half. That is until a bloody stain starts growing around her left breast area on her robe. Leah: How? I'm... Edy: Dead. Edy smirks as Leah's horse vanishes and her scythe drops to the ground. Leah lies motionless on the floor. About 5 seconds later a blue flaming aura appears around her and she slowly rises to her feet. The bullets dislodges itself from her heart and drops to the floor with an audible clink. Leah is breathing heavily. Leah: That... sucked... Edy: Wanna cool down now? I can do this all day. Leah says nothing. Lexi: That was actually kind of cool. Anna: Were you sure that she'd come back to life? Edy: I had a hunch, I figured she was just like Rose. She's immortal, but she can still be killed. She just doesn't stay dead long. You: Good thing you showed up when you did. Leah was kinda getting a little too friendly with me... Leah: I still want my kiss Tom... Edy: Oh right. Tom, Emily wants to see you in her lab ASAP. You: What for? Edy: Who knows when it comes to those mad scientist types...</span></div></div>",

He he he. You pick up Lexi's left foot and begin painting her big toenail. After 15 minutes of this and a blowdry, you've finished with her toes. Leah, color? Leah: This is my favorite blue nail polish! Use it please! Lexi does a mock gag. Leah: Jeez Lexi, lay off the Haterade! I can just feel the hate coming off you. You: Want some Hater Tots with that? Leah: Tee hee. Good one! You high... tentacle to five her. You grab Leah's feet and start painting her nails. Another 15 minutes go by and you're done painting her nails. You give her soles a quick lick. Leah: You're such a little rascal, I'll have to play with you later though, I got some reaping to do. You lazily float over to Lexi and start rubbing between her toes with your little tentacles. Lexi: Oh! That feels amazing! You move to rubbing her soles, heels, etc. Leaving no part of her big feet unrubbed by your tentacles. Lexi: Thanks- why are you looking at me like that? You: When you're not being a sadistic bitch, you're kinda hot. Lexi: Oh. You dont know. Sorry hun, I'm a lesbian. You: Aww. Oh well. You decide to lickle assault her feet. Lexi: Stuhap!

You: I'm not an alien squid. Emily uses her powers and removes her boots, the sight of her feet already turning you pink. She uses her powers and you are pulled toward her feet. Now you can smell them, effectively locking you in fetish mode. Emily: Your mind should be weak enough now for me to control you, it never works on the twins because their minds are too twisted, but with you... I can have a little fun...  Although, I probably dont even need mind control to control you. Now come along my new pet. You: Anything for you mistress. You lazily float behind Emily as she walks to her room. You arrive at Emily's room. Hmm... While you're distracted I suppose I should scan you... So you think of me as the evil version of your friend Alex? Maybe I'll make it more fun for you and have paint my nails purple like you do for her. Sound fun? I would love that mistress. Alright Pinky, your mind is now free. Emily waves her hand. Wait a second. Emily, your nails are already purple. Well then paint them a different shade of purple, dont act like you wouldn't love to give me a pedicure. I... I'm pedicured out, I just gave one to Lexi and Leah... How'd I get in your room? Your mind was weak, so I controlled it. Of course now that you're in your right mind it wont work. Hmm... That means Alex can do the same thing if she wanted to... But she wont. She's too nice. How- Mind reader. Right. Well, since you're here and you're barefoot... Cmon Emily, sit. Dont order me around! Wow you have a temper on you... I was asking you to sit so that I can play with your feet. Unless you'd rather me take them from under you sending your butt on a one way trip to the floor? I'm sorry... I just... growing up with Shanna, we were always in competition, and she was always better than me... Back up. Shanna? The same Shanna that has nearly identical powers to you? Oops... Wait, you're Asian and Shanna is... My grandmother was married twice, once to a Vietnamese man, and once to a white man, Shanna is my cousin. Oh... I fell in a radioactive pit and dissolved and somehow reformed into this form. Emily looks away. Emily... Hmm, yes? Are you hiding something? Of course not! You grab one of Emily's feet and begin licking her sole quickly and lightly. He he... Ha ha... AHAHAHAHA! Stuhap! That tihickles! I'll duh hu anyt-thing! I'm g-gonna pee myself! Come on! Fine. Tell me what you know. It was all Lexi's doing... Well Shelby and Jackie, but it was Lexi's idea to drop some unsuspecting loser into the pit... I told her that there would be reprecussions, but she's hard headed. So the whole reason I'm like this. Is because of her? A mutant freak, never able to go out in public, never able to be a father... And to think I had a crush on her. She does that to everyone. Come here. Emily grabs you and hugs you, her boobs slightly squishing against your face/body. But not even that is enough to cheer you up. Emily continues to gently pet you until she accidentally touches your antennae, instantly turning you from blue and drippy to bright pink. Oh my. Your antennae appear to be your erogenous zone... Y-yes... I k-know that... So I was thinking DJ, perhaps Shanna and I could colaborate and we could create a female of your species to have fun with. My species doesn't have feet, or legs for that matter. And I have a raging foot fetish remember? Right. My heart may be evil, but somewhere in there is compassion, I really feel bad for you. Thanks Emily. You hug her back. At least you're one of a kind. Yeah. You stare at Emily's feet. How is it that you dont even have eyes and yet I know that you're staring at my feet? I... uh... You grab one of Emily's feet and shove it in your mouth while grabbing the other one and massaging it. Mmmm... Tentacle foot massages are the best, you're even better than Lexi... Ohhh... Emily lays back in relaxation as you switch feet. What feels like hours passes, and someone finally enters the room... Angel Witch: Done yet? Emily: Hmm. What? It's been that long already Anna? Anna: It's been 6 hours! Emily: Oh. You can have him then. We bonded. Emily smiles at Anna. Anna: Yeah yeah, that's great. Cmon uh... Donny? TJ? You: DJ. Anna: Right.

It's not all that great, I'm ashamed to be related to those perverts... Huh? Lexi is a lesbian and both of them have foot fetishes. And to make it worse Leah guilted me into giving myself one. Nobody is perfect Anna, though we may not like our family, we're stuck with them. Or you can just kill them like we did with ours. We're getting nowhere with this. I found out that Nightshade is my late mom's sister... Wait... Nightshade orchestrated the deaths of most of your friends right? Correct, and she's now paid for her crimes and raises me as her own child. So you forgave her? Just like that? Yes. I dont understand this whole love thing. You ever had a boyfriend? No. I was always \"the creepy girl\" or \"the witch\", ever since elementary school. Then when I turned 13 I got these, she says as she gestures to her wings. Well I think you're cute Anna. She slightly smiles. Thanks little guy. She pets you on the head accidentally brushing against your antennae. You instantly turn bright pink and start kissing her already bare feet. Ahhh! Did I break you? Dracula's Daughter: It's his erogenous zone child. Anna: Hey Scarlet. So he's not broken? Scarlet: Of course not, just turned on. Anna: Oh... In my defense I spend my free time in my room with my nose in the spell books. Scarlet: You'll learn in time. You have moved on to sucking on Anna's toes. Anna: Ooooh! That's n-new... Did I p-pee myself? I d-didn't feel my b-bladder... Scarlet: You're sexually aroused. Anna: So my t-toes are my hot s-spot? Oooh! Scarlet: It would appear that way. You leave Anna's feet and float over to Scarlet's. You begin unlacing her boots. She has really sexy rose pattern black stockings on. You begin to sniff her feet. Scarlett: Tee hee. He's like a puppy. Anna: Hello? DJ? Scarlet: I think he's preoccupied... Oh my... Frisky little guy. You've flown up Scarlet's dress and begun pulling down her stockings. A few seconds later you come back out, stockings in tentacle. You float over to Anna and present her the stockings. Anna: But DJ... There are other people here. You sniff the stockings and present them to Anna again. Oh fine... Everyone already knows anyway... Anna begins sniffing Scarlet's stockings. You go to Anna's feet and stare at your reflection in her shiny black toenails. You give her feet a quick kiss then return to Scarlet. You shove her toes into your mouth and suck on them. Scarlet pets you on the head. You massage Scarlet's other foot and stretch your tentacle out and start rubbing Anna's feet. After a while you pull Scarlet's foot out of your mouth and just admire her blood red nail polish. After a while your mind clears. You: Havin fun Anna? Anna: What? Huh? Anna drops the stockings and blushes wildly... You: It's fine Anna... Hot Nurse and French Maid! Scarlet: Oh, that's just Ally and Nicolette. Go to them DJ.

So she's a legit French Maid? Nicolette: Oui. You: That much I can understand. Nicolette giggles. Nicolette: Jour a cute little calmar. Do jou know zat? You: Huh? Ally: Hint. Calamari is Italian for... You sigh. You: Squid... you say turning slightly red. Ally: I think he's starting to get irritated. You: What was your first clue? Nicolette: Pourquoi tant de accrocheur? You: What are you saying! Ally: I got nothing, I only took French I in high school. Nicolette: How jou say... Snappy? You: Oh. Sorry I... Why am I apologizing to you? Nicolette: Because jou think I'm s\u00e9duisant. She says as she slightly smacks her own butt. You turn slighty red, a different shade this time. You: I uh... What are you staring at Nicolette? Nicolette: Jou have antennes. Are jou part punaise? You: I give up... Wait! Dont touch those! Nicolette and Ally both smile evilly. Ally pins you down while you watch Nicolette take her heels off. She moves out of your field of vision and you feel her fishnetted feet brush against your antennae, turning you bright pink. Nicolette then proceeds to use her toes to play with your antennae. You feel pressure building inside of you and then you start muttering jibberish. Ally: Nicolette... I think you should stop now... Nicolette: I vill do vat I vant to my pet. You open your mouth and a bunch of sticky green goo shoots out and you feel exhausted. You return to your normal color. Nicolette: Oh my... Ally: It's worse than when Jackie finishes using the bathroom! Wait a second... Ally runs her finger through a puddle of it and sniffs it. Nicolette, you just made an organism with no genitals ejaculate... You: What? Ally: You just jizzed honey. You: Oh... WHAT! But I thought... Ally: I'll send it in to Emily to run some tests, but first... I know Frenchie here's probably teased your mind into oblivion by now, so... You watch as Ally starts untying her white non-slip nurse shoes and slowly pulls them off, she then reaches up her skirt and starts pulling down her stockings. When all is said and done you finally get to see her bare feet. Her toenails are painted white and have little red crosses painted in the center. As if automatically your mouth finds its way onto Ally's toes. Ally: You are so hopeless. Nicolette sits next to Ally and peels off her fishnets. She not surprisingly has French tips. Ally: That's fine. You can rub my feet now. You take Ally's feet out of your mouth only to have Nicolette's replace them as you begin to massage Ally's feet. Ally only sighs with pleasure, but Nicolette has her head tilted back and is muttering something in French... You take Nicolette's toes out of your mouth. You: Hey Ally? Ally: Hmm? Yes honey? You: What's up with the glowstick and the Pillbug? Ally: Oh, you mean Jackie and Shelby? Wanna meet them? I'm pretty sure Jackie's radiation wont kill you...</span></div></div>",

Rolly Polly: It's Shellshock, Shelby. She extends her hand. You: Uhh... Shelby: Cmon dude, you can still shake my hand. You: But... Shelby: Pussy. You: Hey! Jackie: You're not dead yet, wanna hang out in my room? Shelby: Hey, Lexi said we have to keep an eye on him in pairs. Jackie: True, but I'm sure he doesn't want to sit there and take verbal abuse from you. Shelby: He had it coming, he should've just accepted my friendly gesture. Jackie: Well maybe he's shy. Or maybe he's a little self conscious about looking like a little squid. Shelby: You're one to talk \"Oh, I feel so bad because all those people died from being near me.\" Boo hoo. Jackie's glow is starting to glow brighter. Whoa, Jackie, I was just messing with you. Oh shit... Shelby creates a rock dome and braces for impact. You simply sit there and watch. Jackie directs all of her nuclear fury at Shelby. When the smoke clears you see Shelby on the ground knocked out, and bits of rock all over the floor. You: Jeez. Hell hath no fury like a woman's scorn. Hurricanes are named after women for a reason... Jackie: She'll be fine, this happens more than you might think. But now I'm all stressed... You: Take a seat. Jackie: Sure? You pull her boots off and stare at her glowing feet. You begin to rub Jackie's feet. Jackie: Oh! That's very nice. You know, no matter what color nail polish I put on, it always ends up looking like this. You look at her glowing green polish. You: At least it suits you well. Jackie: Yeah, but this team certainly doesn't. You: What do you mean? Jackie: No one here really likes me, they only like the destructive potential my powers have, that's why I'm always stationed with Shelby. You: Beacuse Shelby makes you have meltdowns? Jackie: Exactly. Oh, and Lexi likes to watch people dissolve in toxic sludge. You: I wish there was something I could do to help... Jackie: Could you maybe... suck my toes? Lexi wont do it because she says they probably taste like toxic sludge. I clean myself everyday. Jackie frowns then sighs. You take this opportunity to shove her toes into your mouth and lick like there's no tomorrow. Jackie: Oh! That's wonderful! You dont mind the taste? You take her toes out of your mouth so you can talk to her. You: They taste like any other girl's feet. Jackie: Thanks. She pets you on the head. Shelby: Uggh... my head... Of course... Shelby says sounding jealous. Jackie: Now who's turning green. Jealous much? Shelby says nothing. You float over to Shelby and pull her armored boots off. You: So why are you armored up like a pillbug? Shelby: It fits my name well. Shelby = Shell + Earthquakes = Shock = Shellshock, that's why my suit has \"shell\" plates. You: And the goggles? You say as you begin rubbing her feet. Shelby: I think they look cute. You: Your personality is all over the place. Shelby: What can I say, I'm complex. She smiles at you. You take a big lick across her soles. He he, that kinda tickles. Has anyone ever told you that your tongue is weird looking... You: There's the Shelby we all know and love! Shelby: You're funny. Pal! She says lightly kicking you in the face. Her nails are painted a basic dark brown color, nothing spectacular, but it works for her. You continue to massage her feet for a few more minutes. You: I haven't slept since I got here. Mind if I call it a night Shelby? Shelby: You can use my bed, I got plenty of Z's from my good friend Jackie. Jackie: You had it coming. Shelby gives you directions to her room and you sleep for a few hours. You wake up and see two short blondes outside Shelby's room... No way! You fly over to them. You: Addy?! Addy: What's up pervert? Brielle: Something I should know Addy? Addy: Didn't I tell you? He likes girls' feet. Brielle: Oh, I remember you now... Central Park, you were with Cindy... Addy suddenly takes on a much more seductive tone. Hey DJ? You: Yes? Addy: You wouldn't mind giving me and my sis here foot massages would you? We've been in these boots all day, and our feet are sooo sweaty... Addy always did know how to make you putty in her hands... You're already slowly turning pink...</span></div></div>",

You pull off Addy's boots and begin to nuzzle them with your face/body. They're so silky soft... Addy: Hey I said... Oh forget it. You always were hopeless... Brielle: Hello? You stretch out your tentacles and remove Bree's boots. You begin to rub her feet while still nuzzling Addy's. Addy: I guess it is kinda cute that you like my feet as much as you do... Brielle: Oh he is good at this... You begin to suck on Addy's toes like you need them to live. Brielle: Oh my... He's like some kind of horny little beast... That's kind of hot... Here little guy! Brielle wiggles her toes on your tentacle to get your attention. Like an arrow in flight you dart over and cling to Brielle's feet while beginning to massage Addy's. You begin sucking on Brielle's toes... Addy: I just remembered something... Addy uses the toes on her other foot to play with your antennae, supercharging your fetish. You begin drooling on Brielle's feet. Brielle: Awwwww. That's so cute! Like a little pet. Addy and Brielle look at each other and simultaneously pull their feet away from you. Your common sense soon returns as you return to your normal green color. You point at Addy. You: You... sadistic, evil, domineering... oh fuck it. I love you Addy! You sort of lasso Addy to you with your tentacles and hug her. Addy: You were never this grateful before. Why the change of heart? You: The evil adds that extra little bit of sexy. That and your outfit is hotter... You say turning a slight red color, your way of blushing... Addy picks you up and pets you continuously. She smiles a slightly wicked smile at you. Brielle: Consider joining us then? Brielle says as she makes her hands glow black. You: I need time to think, I still haven't met all of you yet. Addy: Fair enough. Come see me and Bree if you change your mind. I'll be waiting. She says as she turns you around and kisses you on the mouth. This turns you slightly pink. It's only been a couple of years since she left Super X, but she's gotten astronomically hotter over that period of time. You: Yes mother I'll do the dishes now... You snap yourself out of it. ???: Done yet? You turn around and see... June?! You: June? But I thought you had a soul. How could you just betray us like this? ???: A soul? Eww... No. I'd rather be raped by howler monkeys a thousand times over. Demonica Lucifer at your service. First born of the Prince of Darkness. You: Oh... Wait. June has an older sister?! Demonica: Yeah. Demons too can have multiple children. She says talking very slow. You: Ok. I'm not stupid... Dont make fun of me... ???: Yes Demonica dear. That is my job. Desdemona de Lilith. Sole daughter of the one and only Lilith. You: So I'm getting handed over to the Devil's first daughter and one of the world's oldest succubi? Addy: Pretty much... You: I've officially seen it all...</span></div></div>",
