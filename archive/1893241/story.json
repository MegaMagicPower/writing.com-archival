Of course she get angry and smacks him wake and throws him out of their room. As embarrassed as she was she knew he had a point there was some pudgy on her but being the void wizard require a lot of eating it is called void for a reason and Louise knew this but still she did not want to get fat. So she does what any wizard does and tries to cast a weight loss spell but of course nothing happens but she does feel hungry. and  unbeknownst  to Louise something else did happen it made her a little thicker, slowed down her metabolism, made so all food she eat is twice as fattening as it should be and has also made her jaw able to stretch over any object she wants to eat.... </span></div></div>",

She does this every friday, but this time was different, and her figure was proof.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*huff* \"I shouldn't have eaten all of those...\" Siesta procured a large amount of cupcakes, because Saito is celebrating his birthday soon. They were supposed to be stored in a cold place until then, and she only showed the stash to Louise. \"Big mistake, why would she trust me with such a valuable secret.\" After they finished tea, she sneaked into the hiding place of the cupcakes, deciding to sample some. Saito wouldn't notice some disappearing, she thought. But now, there were none. Each and every one, she ate, and with before unexperienced delight. This in and of itself would pass as a wonder, but her gains were nothing short of a miracle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou see, she wouldn't notice a change if she wouldn't decide to open the window. As she turned away, letting the air in, she felt a chilly breeze on her bottom. She moved her hand to pull down her skirt, except discovering a bulky mass of blubber in place of her otherwise petite butt. Quickly, she dashed to the mirror, and beheld her shape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe put down her skirt, but couldn't do so with the panties. They bore so deep into the chasm that was now her bottom that she would feel extreme arousal if she were to only attempt removing them. Using scissors, she finally broke free. Feeling tired from carrying such heavy baggage, she lay on her bed, belly side of course. She examined the curvaceous flesh, sinking her tiny hands into the excess. They went a good 20 centimetres before reaching anything more solid. This luxurious fat might as well be hefty than her previous weight threefold. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It was too nice out for anything bad to happen! Unfortunately for her, though, she was about 20 yards away from the table, and she decided to walk her way there. These two combined created the perfect scenario for her to get yelled at once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, what\u2019s wrong? Move a little quicker, will ya?\u201d the male teen asked, already fed up with impatience. \u201cThe water\u2019s about to come dripping off the table onto my uniform! Do you want me to report you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSiesta nearly winced at the verbal bombardment, although it was to be expected from the average Noble that attended the Tristainian Academy of Magic. They could use magic; she, being a commoner, could not. As such, a collective mentality had developed over the majority of the ruling class of the Kingdom of Tristain that they were better than the average person, and that those average people lived to serve mages. This wasn\u2019t even the worst type of treatment the maid had to go through on a near-daily basis. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickening her pace to arrive at the table sooner, Siesta was incredibly annoyed herself to see that the Noble flat-out lied to her: the water was only just barely inching its way over to the edge, it was giving the jerk plenty of time to move his chair out of the way if he was that concerned. And looking over at him, a smug satisfaction adorned his visage. He knew he could tell and do whatever he wanted with her as long as he didn\u2019t break any laws; falsely accusing a servant of not tending to you and \u201cbeing lazy\u201d didn\u2019t break any. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, the young woman knew she couldn\u2019t betray any of her emotions. So instead, she merely took on a neutral expression as she proceeded to wipe the table off as fast as possible. By the time she was done, it was as if the surface hadn\u2019t come into contact with moisture for years.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Noble was less than impressed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmph! About time. Now leave, I want to enjoy nature without other people butting in,\u201d he said dismissively. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSiesta was only too happy to comply. She began to make her way back to the batch of towels when she was suddenly stopped by another outburst.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, wait! I almost forgpt...\" the Noble turned around, a patronizing smirk on his laps. \"<i>What</i> do you say?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSiesta would've breathed a sigh of annoyance if she could've gotten away with it. There were certainly plenty of things she wanted to say, but she knew what the right answer was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you for your request, Master.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's better.\" And with that, the young man waved her off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that out of the way, Siesta finally got back to the fresh towels she had been carrying (regretfully noting that she\u2019d have to wash the towel she just used again), when she saw Saito Hiraga walk out of a nearby doorway and let out a large yawn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c*<i>Yaaawn</i>*\u2026 Oh man, that girl is gonna be the death of me.\u201d He sighed. \u201cI mean, geez! She\u2019s treating me like a do- no, worse than a dog! Maybe a dog owned by an abusive jerk, but certainly not like your average human being!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Saito walked off and continued grumbling to himself, Siesta cocked her head to the side. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat was Miss Louise\u2019s Familiar\u2026\u201d she muttered to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other day had certainly been strange: everyone in Louise\u2019s grade had to partake in a mandatory Summoning exercise to see what their prospective Familiars would be. While most students summoned creatures that were fairly standard, like mandragoras, salamanders, small wyverns, Louise somehow managed to summon a commoner who couldn\u2019t speak the same language as everyone else. Now, somehow, he managed to learn the language, but it only helped to emphasize how unhappy he was serving a Noble of Tristain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSiesta decided she\u2019d follow Saito and see what exactly was bothering him. Being a commoner herself, she knew just how abrasive the Nobility could be, but to be the outright slave of one as ill-tempered as Louise? That was a fate the maid wouldn\u2019t wish on anyone.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As Siesta trailed Seito through the courtyard, making sure that it merely looked as if she was heading to a similar destination as him to avoid seeming creepy, she had to ask herself why she was doing this. The maid had chores to do, after all. While she still had plenty of time to get them completed before anyone complained, free time wasn\u2019t exactly a major part of her schedule. Yet here she was, following a random guy she didn\u2019t even know. She supposed that the major reason really was because her empathy was telling her to comfort another commoner, someone who was unwittingly forced into a terrible position. While he seemed to be mainly mad now, Siesta had been nearby at the time of his summoning, and the major emotion he was displaying there was genuine fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore the maid knew it, Saito had come to a stop and was merely staring at a wall, lost in thought. She realized she couldn\u2019t keep up the fa\u00e7ade of just going on the same general path anymore, so she took a deep breath and approached the young man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello there!\u201d she greeted amicably. \u201cHow\u2019re you today?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaito looked like he nearly had a heart attack upon hearing the sudden introduction coming from behind him, which made Siesta instantly regret her approach. She was trying to make small talk, but she already rattled the poor guy. Figured. Thankfully, it didn\u2019t take long for him to re-compose himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, hey! I\u2019m doing\u2026well, I guess saying okay would just be a lie, huh?\u201d the young man said ruefully. \u201cBut, um, anyways, who\u2019re you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry, I didn\u2019t introduce myself first,\u201d Siesta said, mentally slapping herself. \u201cI\u2019m Siesta. And your name is\u2026?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSaito Hiraga!\u201d the Familiar said proudly, before muttering, \u201cA.K.A., new servant of some bratty pink-haired girl.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSiesta shook her head. \u201cIt really is unpleasant to hear that. You\u2019ve had the misfortune of becoming Miss Louise\u2019s Familiar, and she\u2019s well-known for having quite the hot-head.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHa! Hot-head is an understatement!\u201d It seemed as though Saito was using this as a springboard for a rant. \u201cShe\u2019s been treating me horribly. I\u2019ve only gotten stale bread eat and water to drink, I haven\u2019t been given a new change of clothes yet, tonight I\u2019m going to have to wash her clothes, and I have to sleep on a straw mat on the floor, in the draftiest part of the room! Seriously, how is any of that even legal around here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe raven-haired girl was honestly appalled to be hearing of such conditions flowing out of her new acquaintance\u2019s mouth. She knew Louise wasn\u2019t the most pleasant of individuals, but to treat someone like that? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTh-that\u2019s awful!\u201d she blurted out. \u201cI had no idea\u2026 she\u2019s truly that cruel?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you think I\u2019m making any of this up?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, of course not! You\u2019d have no reason to. And I mean, it\u2019s not as though the idea of a Noble acting poorly is a foreign idea to me...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaito cocked his head at this. \u201cHm?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, you know of the relations between commoners and Nobles, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young man scratched his head, looking at her as if she had grown a second head.  \u201cNo, don\u2019t have any real idea about that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou see, commoners are people that can\u2019t use magic and haven\u2019t been given privilege by the Royal Family. But Nobles are people whose families have not only done impressive enough things to gain the Crown\u2019s support, but are also skilled magic users. They not only hold the highest political influence, but they\u2019re also physically the most powerful, as well.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWoah, really?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMm-hm. Granted, not every mage is a noble; there are a few commoners that can practice magic, although they usually come from families that used to be part of Nobility, before they fell from grace for whatever reason. But everyone who attends this Academy is definitely one, and so they think they\u2019re a lot better than us commoners. It\u2019s just a fact of life.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?! But that isn\u2019t fair!\u201d Saito shouted out indignantly. Upon realizing his only audience was siesta, though, he immediately lowered his volume. \u201cI mean, no one\u2019s better than anyone else, or at least not like that. What right do they have to treat people like slaves, anyways? I don\u2019t care how powerful they are, that\u2019s still no excuse trample over those weaker than you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSiesta nodded her head furtively. She couldn\u2019t agree more with what was just said. Of course, she and Saito could talk about this all day, but she knew none of it would actually make a difference. It was nice to talk about, at least. She had been expecting this, and was perfectly fine with the route the conversation was going.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, that\u2019s why we need to rebel.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis statement, on the other hand, could\u2019ve knocked Siesta flat on her ass if it was a physical force, it was so unexpected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh? What do you mean?\u201d the maid asked, blinking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExactly what I just said,\u201d Saito said, a new form of confidence gracing his visage. \u201cYou and I need to show those stuck-up Nobles what we\u2019re made of!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe put his hand up to his chin, seemingly pondering over something before snapping his fingers, startling Siesta a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, I got an idea. You\u2019re a maid, so you work in the kitchen and dining hall, right?\u201d he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm, yes, I do,\u201d Siesta said uncertainly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you usually eat?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, usually some bread, rice, a bit of porridge\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you kidding? That\u2019s barely any better than what I get! Have you seen what those Nobles eat? The dishes that\u2019re put out for them wouldn\u2019t be out of place in front of Kings and Queens!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c*Sigh* Don\u2019t remind me\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy not? You\u2019re going to be getting some of that delicious grub, too,\u201d Saito said with a wink. \u201cAnd you\u2019re going to be using your position as a \u2018commoner\u2019 to do it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSiesta blinked as she tried to process this statement. After what seemed like a dozen statements rushed through her mind, she said the most complex thing she had ever uttered in her entire life: \u201cWhat?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on, Siesta! You have to help serve and clean up after all those Nobles. Don\u2019t tell me the idea of trying just a little bit of one of those pies, or those cakes, or heck, anything, never crossed your mind?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm, I\u2019d be lying if it hasn\u2019t, but wouldn\u2019t I get in trouble?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, you would\u2026 if you got caught. But anything worth doing has some sorta risk involved, don\u2019t you think? I\u2019m just saying, try one of those pies, for example. That\u2019s your challenge. I\u2019m still gonna think of mine, but considering how some of these jerks act, I don\u2019t think it\u2019ll be too long before I decide on something.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young man gave Siesta one of the warmest smiles she had ever seen, and looked at her expectantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, whaddya say?\u201d</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Siesta thought hard about it for a minute. Little thoughts of rebellion have popped into her head more times then she can count since she started working here. But that's all they've ever been thoughts, she never found the courage to actually do any of them. But as she looked at the warm confident smile on Saito's face a spark of courage filled her heart. She had dinner clean up duty soon and the students no doubt wasted most of the food the cooks put all hearts and souls into making. That caused her to clench a tight fist. Surely no one would notice a few things missing from the trash right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll do you one better Saito.\" she said with a look of determination. She motioned him to get closer to whisper in his ear \"Meet me at the courtyard in an hour and we will have ourselves a little feast.\" Saito blinked in surprise before a wide smile beamed across his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's the spirit!\" As they went their separate ways Saito gave her a thumbs up which she returned. \"Good luck.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer plan went off without a hitch. Two apples, a plate of grapes, a loaf of bread, two chicken legs, a big bowl of uneaten beef stew and two glasses of water was what she managed to smuggle from the kitchen. As she stored the food in the basket her heart pounded in a mixture of fear and excitement as she did what she always thought of doing many times before, rebelling against the nobles!(in small innocent way mind you) She hurried back to the courtyard as fast as could without spilling the food or arousing suspicion. She found Saito washing clothes as he said he would be and after she helped him finish they then enjoyed the spoils of their little \"rebellion\". The food was delicious and the company was great. Even after they finished eating the two new friends spent hours talking, getting to know each other. Siesta told Saito all she knew about magic, the relations between nobles and commoners, the other kingdoms etc. While Saito would regal her with tales of his home.<br>\r\nWell more like he told her of everyday things and common knowledge, but he told it in dramatic fashion. Tomes that hold all the worlds knowledge(laptops), devices that aloud you talk to someone hundreds of miles away as if they were right next to you(phones) and some history that everybody on earth at least knew the basics about like the moon landing. He even added the famous quote for good measure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's one small step for Man. One giant leap for Mankind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSiesta was in awe at the stories he told of his world. When she asked what kind of magic they had on earth that made all of these wonders possible the answer he gave rattled her soul to the core. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"None.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe couldn't believe it. NO MAGIC?!?! Magic was a MYTH on Earth?!?! Impossible! It had to be! He had to be joking right?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hahahaha!! Ohh..that's a good one Saito. You actually had me fooled for a second.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not joking.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"..Ok it was funny at first but now you're just insulting my intelligence.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not. It's all true! Everything we have achieved on Earth was though ingenuity and hard work.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Saito I'm serious. Stop it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm serious too!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"ENOUGH!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAngry tears poured down her face as she started to clean up.\"I have entertained this nonsense long enough. I have risked my job and what dignity I have for this little \"rebellion\" and you repay me by spewing all that garbage of fantasy world as if it were real?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n..You know..in any other situation Saito would be laughing at the MASSIVE irony, but he had to reassure his only friend in this world that he was telling the truth. \"But Siesta! It is re-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Finish that sentence and I will NEVER speak to you again Saito!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilence filled the courtyard as Siesta wiped the tears from her eyes and finished cleaning up. She picked up the basket full of dirty dishes and took a deep breath to regain her composure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thank you for giving me the courage to do what I did tonight and your stories were wonderful but..Saito all those things you told me about could only do want you said through magic. I'm sorry, but it's impossible any other way. I mean landing on the moon? Even Brimir couldn't do that and you expect me to believe that people without magic could?! Honestly do you take me for an idiot?!..*Sigh* It's late and I have a long day tomorrow so..\" she turned way from him \"..good night Saito.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she walked away all Saito could do was sit there thinking about what she said, and now that he thought about it he didn't blame her for reacting the way she did. If the situation were reversed and she told him she came from a world were magic is real and there were two moons(one blue, one pink) he would think she was ether lying or crazy too. This was the world she was born and raised in. A world with it's own history and natural laws that govern it. A world were people could shoot fire and ice and ride dragons. The only reason he knew it was real was because he saw all those things happen and he still barely believed it. And he just expected her to believe him?! He really is an idiot..but still. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is real.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSiesta stopped in her tracks but other than that did and said nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everything I said was true Siesta. I don't how I can prove it to you yet, but I will. I promise.\" he said with every bit of determination he had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Hehehe okay. I'll tell you what.\" she turned back to look at him with a playful smile.\"If you can do one thing that is impossible for a commoner to do then I will be willing to believe that one thing you said about Earth, OTHER THAN THE MOON LANDING, is actually possible. Deal?\" she brought up her hand for a handshake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Deal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

That idiot couldn't have started with something easier, like I don't know, learning to how fly?!} was what Siesta frantically thought to herself as she stood with other students in Vestri Field. They formed a big circle around the duelists eager to see what was no doubt going to be an entertaining ass kicking.(just not in the way they think) Siesta tried to stop Saito from going through with this stupidity, but all he said was \"I was raised to always keep my promises. And don't worry I have a plan.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n{Well whatever this \"plan\" of yours is better be a damn good one Saito. Because it's going to take a bloody miracle for you to get out of this in one piece.} she had her hands clapped together in prayer for said miracle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Before we start how about we make this more interesting.\" Saito said as Guiche finished \"applauding\" him for actually showing up. Guiche stops his show boating as a thoughtful look crossed his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Interesting you say? How so?\" Good got his attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look it's painfully obvious that I have little to no hope of winning. You could crush my bones to dust with no effort at all.\" Stroke his ego. Make an opening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hahaha! Good to see that you know your place after all commoner.\" Opening made.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And everyone here is hoping for a good show. It would be in poor sport of you to bore them with a one sided slaughter.\" Appeal to his \"pride and honor\". Get some leverage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm very true..what do you purpose?\" Leverage gained. Now to make the deal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I humbly request that I am aloud to wield a weapon of my choosing. If only to give me some hope of lasting more then a minute.\" he bowed to sale the scene. Come on..take the bait.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm..very well I'll allow you this small mercy.\" Hook, line and sinker. \"And since I'm such a good sport I'll even craft a weapon for you\" This just gets better and better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your generosity humbles me Lord Guiche.\" he bowed lower so no one could see his smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As it should.(idiot) Now what kind of weapon would you like? A sword, axe, spear, a bow perhaps?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaito stood up straight and smiled \"A shield.\" A silence fell over the field at Saito's odd choice. Guiche was especially surprised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A shield?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"..Do you perhaps want a sword to go with it? A dagger perhaps?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope. Just a shield.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Guiche processed all this, all he could think was {This commoners completely mad!} But he saw no reason to not indulge his supposed madness. It would make him look better for taking pity on this poor delusional commoner. \"Very well.\" he flicked his rose wand to make one of it's peddles fall to the ground and in a flash of light a small round shield appeared in it's place. \"I trust it's to your liking?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaito picked up the shield to examine it further. Light weight, sturdy material, big enough to cover his forearm, comfortable fit. \"It's perfect.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good. Then let us begin!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happen next could only be described as a bloody miracle as Saito completely dominated the duel with strength, speed and agility that seemed superhuman.<br>\r\n(think of Captain America and you get a good idea as to how Saito fights) In less then 30 seconds Saito had Guiche pinned under him with his shield poised to bash the playboys face in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I YIELD!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter overcoming their shock at the supposed impossible sight of a noble mage being defeated by a commoner the students broke out into loud cheers in applause for Saito's victory, but none of them cheered louder then Siesta as she ran up to the young hero and tackled him to the ground in a warm embrace that he happily returned<br>\r\n\"Told you I had a plan.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater that night we find Saito enjoying the spoils of his victory in his new room as Siesta fed him some more of the beef stew. After proving to Louise that he was a strong familiar she was willing to let him sleep in a real bed from now on. She even made a request to the Headmaster to let him have his own room, so long as it was close by. And seeing as there were plenty of empty rooms available he saw no problem with it. Besides he saw the duel himself for his window so he knew the young man earned it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Give my compliments to the chef Siesta! This is the best stew I've ever had!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*Giggle* Don't worry. I will.\" Siesta had a warm smile on her pretty face as she watched her new hero enjoy his food. Saito wasn't to comfortable being called a hero, but after having all the servants, Siesta included, remind him that he accomplished something that everyone thought was impossible he decided to just accept it. But as Siesta thought back to the duel something puzzled her. \"Hey Saito?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where did you learn to fight like that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaito knew what she was referring to.\"Well to be completely honest it wasn't all me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe thought to himself for a minute on how best explain.\"Well I have been learning martial arts, or in other words how to fight, since I was little but that's not what you're talking about is it?\" She nodded glad to see that they were on the same page. He then showed her the runes on his left hand \"It's these things.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your familiar runes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. I didn't know what they were at first. Louise said it was proof that I was her familiar but that didn't help much. She then told me that such runes granted familiar special powers that helped them better protect and serve their master. After you left to bed I trained a little to take my mind off things and as I started to work up a sweat the runes began glowing and I felt like my body was as light as a feather.\" He went through some katas as he explained. Siesta was in awe as she saw him preform movements similar to his duel. She didn't know was possible for a human to move like he did. It looked more like he was dancing the practicing how to fight. Then she saw the runes glow and his movements became faster, more complex and even more graceful and fluid. He finished with a punch that stopped a centimeter short of hitting her nose that carried so much speed it made a small but powerful gust of wind that pushed her on to the bed.\"Oh I'm Sorry Siesta! I got carried away.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSiesta didn't mind in the slightest. In fact she could say and think of was \"Wow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehe yeah it is pretty cool, but still sorry about that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay no harm done. So the runes enhance your fighting skills?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pretty much. I'm a good fighter on my own but a little boost doesn't hurt right?\" he said with a playful wink. Siesta had a teasing smile of her own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know..it hurt Guiche didn't it? *Giggle*\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hahahaha!! Yeah I suppose it did.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mood was pleasant, fun and helped calm Siesta's nerves as she built up the courage to do what she had been wanting to do ever since Saito won the duel. She pulled him onto the bed with her and gave him a passion filled kiss. Saito was in shock at her bold action but quickly melted into it and returned her passion with his own. And it wasn't long before clothes went off and moans of pleasure filled the room as they made love all night long. As the young lovers greeted the day with a final shared climax Siesta looked at her hero with eyes full of love.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm now yours Saito. Now and forever.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Siesta was humming blissfully to herself with the most radiant smile on her face as she preformed her daily chores. She was spinning and skipping in glee as she went from one duty to another. The reason for her great mood was obvious to just about everyone. She was in love with Saito and he loved her back. A fact they proved to each other form dusk till dawn the other day. Saito was an awkward lover at first, not sure of what to do and very nervous, but she was too, so they took comfort in that as they explored what made each other feel good. Luckily they were both quick learners and were VERY eager to learn so things quickly went from awkward to hot and steamy. One thing in particular that Siesta learned was that Saito was a hardcore breast man. In fact he loved them so much that he could hardily keep his hands off them once he had her permission to touch them, which she didn't mind in the slightest. And since she was the proud owner of the biggest breasts among the servants, in fact she was second in size only to Kirche, Saito was a very happy man to say the least and Siesta was more then happy to please him. Oddly enough though when Siesta put on her uniform this morning it felt tighter around the chest area, but she didn't think too much of it. After all she was still a growing girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Tabitha I'm in love! Do you hear me I'M IN LOVE!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis what Siesta walked into as she was going from room to room serving tea and tiny cakes to the students. Kirche von Zerbst \"confessing her love\" to her best friend Tabitha, a rather common sight as Kirche was famous around school for \"falling in love\" with another man every other week. So Siesta tuned it out as she placed the treats on the table..at least at first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh the speed! The strength! The grace! The ferocity! It makes my heart burst and lights a fire in my soul just thinking about! Oh what I wouldn't give to feel those powerful arms around me MMM!!\" she squirmed and shook in esctacy with her arms wrapped around herself. Tabitha just kept on reading as always. See as her best friend was ignoring her again she looked to the maid setting the table, the same maid rumor has it that has been intimate with Saito already. \"Oh Siesta was it? Tell me what is the best way to please Saito? I mean it's fun figuring it out myself but some tips would be appreciated.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*BAM/CRACK/SPLAT*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSiesta slammed a plate with a cake on the table so hard it split the plate in half and sent the cake flying up in the air before falling onto the table. The room went silent as Siesta stood there with her bangs shadowing her eye before glaring straight into Kirche's stunned amber colored eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"STAY. AWAY. FROM. SAITO.\" was all she could growl out from clenched teeth before stomping out of the room slamming the door behind her, her good mood ruined.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Too far..\" said Tabitha snapping Kirche out of shock at what just happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? You think so?\" Kirche asked her best friend genuinely curious. Tabitha simply nodded. *Sigh* Yeah your right..as usual.\" she pouted a little. She couldn't help it, it was how she was raised. As a noble she was used to getting what she wanted. And as a beautiful women she was used to getting any man she wanted. But despite her flirtatious persona and sinful body she was actually still a virgin.(I know hard to believe) And she wasn't a bad person, especially compared to a lot of nobles. Treating commoners like garbage, always thinking they were better than everybody else around them, frankly she couldn't stand it. Now she was a little arrogant she will admit, but she held no ill will towards commoners. Even with the maid openly defying her Kirche wasn't insulted or angry in the slightest. If anything she was impressed. Normally Siesta was calm, polite and obedient like a good maid should be. But when some other hussy was trying to steal her man the claws came out. But instead of discouraging her from pursuing Saito it only made her want him more. Any man that could inspire a meek maiden like Siesta to grow a backbone like that was worth the risk. Plus her pride as a noble and as a woman wouldn't allow her to ignore the challenge. So against her better judgement and her best friends advice she continued making plans on how to win Saito's heart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut despite wearing her best lingerie, lighting candles to set the mood and giving him the dreaded puppy dog eyes Saito resisted her charms and simply said \"If you had come on to me like this when I first got here I would've accepted your advances in a heartbeat. But I am already with Siesta, so I'm sorry. I can't. You are a very beautiful woman though and I can tell that your good person. So I'm certain that you will find the right man for you in no time.\" No man had ever rejected her before. And what's worse is that he did so with such sincerity that it both broke her heart and made it sing. \"*Sigh* Siesta is such a lucky girl..\" she said sadly to herself curled up in ball on her bed. Even when five boys showed up at her window for some \"fun\" did nothing to amuse her like it normally would. \"Not now boys okay? I'm not in the mood.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm afraid we must insist Kirche.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaito was on his butt leaning against the wall across Kirche's room trying to calm down. It had taken all his willpower to resist her, seriously that woman is so sexy it should be illegal. As he was regaining his composure Siesta was coming in hot down the hallway like she was on a mission, which she was, a mission to make sure Kirche didn't steal Saito from her. She was really surprised at herself when she made her claim on Saito like she did to Kirche earlier, so much so she was afraid she going to be fired or worse. When commoners stood up to nobles in anyway it was almost a guaranteed death sentence. But Kirche was much kinder to commoners then most nobles and even bothered to remember some of their names, including hers, so her worries faded quickly. But then she heard one of her coworkers say that they saw Saito being dragged off by Kirche's salamander so now she was ready to smack a bitch, but then she saw boyfriend leaning against the wall, right across the said bitches room, so she loomed over him with a steely glare. \"*Ahem*\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaito quickly stood up and looked her dead in the eye \"Nothing happened. Her familiar kidnapped me and she tried to seduce me and I'll admit I was tempted, oh so tempted, but nothing happened I swear.\" She stared deep into his eyes looking for any deceit..when she found none she smiled and kissed him on the cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I believe you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaito breathed a sigh of relief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey then jumped in surprise when they heard a muffled scream from Kirche's room. They rushed in to see five male students had her pinned on her bed, four had an arm and leg each and one was about to pull his pants down.(Flame was put under a sleep spell by the way) Filled with righteous fury at the disgusting sight Saito quickly and brutally \"escorted\" the perverts out the window. Siesta made a note to tell the Headmaster about this as she recognized those boys as regular problem students with a history of this kind of behavior(especially with her) and this was the last straw. And the Headmaster trusted her word so expulsion will be the least of their worries once she was done, but for now Kirche needed comfort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*Sob* T-they almost..*sob*..and I couldn't-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sshh. It's okay.\" Saito said in a soothing voice as he held her close caressing her hair and rubbing her back softly as she cried into his chest, soaking his sweatshirt in tears. It broke Siesta's heart to see such a confident woman reduced to such a state all because some boys just can't take no for an answer. It won't be easy and it will take time but she knew Kirche will recover from this. And she knew one of the best ways to help, she didn't like it but it had to be done. Some of Siesta's friends and family went through this too so she knew it had to be done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Saito I want you to help Kirche feel like a woman again.\" You could hear a pin drop it got so quiet. \"Now don't get the wrong idea I don't mean have sex with her, but touch her, make her feel good, reminder her that a mans touch can be gentle, loving and pleasurable. It will help her heal trust me. I trust you.\" With her reassurance and permission granted he proceeded to do just that. For 5 hours Saito pleasured Kirche in every way he could without going all the way bringing her to a climax at least a dozen times before exhaustion overcame her a she pass out into a dreamless but peaceful sleep. After tucking her in properly they left the room to head to bed themselves, but before that Siesta had one more surprise for Saito.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Saito I want you to teach me how to fight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Well I say training but it was actually her just putting on Saito's sweatshirt, taking it off, throwing it to the ground, picking it up, hanging it up and then doing it all over again. Guiche was in the middle of taking a walk with his \"real girlfriend\" Montmorency when they spotted the odd sight of the young maid just repeating the same task over and over for seemingly no reason. What was stranger was that Kirche, Tabitha and Louise were all sitting there watching it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"4 hours..everyday..for the last 4 days.\" said Kirche bored out of her mind. When she heard her darling was teaching her new friend(they really started to bond after that night)how to fight she was hoping to see something more exciting then this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why?\" said an equally curious Montmo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Apparently it's fighting training.\" answered an equally bored Louise. The only reason she was here too was cause she literally had nothing better to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? It looks more like maid training to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's what I said!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSiesta could hear the comments from the peanut gallery and they only added to her growing frustration in this pointless exercise. All the while Saito watched her \"progress\" sitting on the fountain drinking a cup of water. Finally Siesta just couldn't take it anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know Saito..when I asked you to teach me \"Martial Arts\" as you like to call it I didn't know what I was in for. I'll admit I was even scared, I didn't think I was ready for it. But apparently I've been a \"Martial Artist\" this whole time and didn't even know it since I do this for a living. I'm a Maid for crying out loud!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLouise/Kirche:Thank You!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've put on the jacket 1000 times. I've taken it off 1000 times!\" she threw the jacket on the ground to emphasize her frustration, all the while Saito looked unfazed \"I'm done.\" she picked up the jacket, mostly out of habit, and began to walk away. She then turned to look at him with a mixture of sadness and anger \"You know if you didn't want to teach me you could've just said so instead of wasting my time.\" she started to walk again, with everyone else doing the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Siesta!\" his call stopped them in their tracks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*Sigh*..What?\" she still had her back turned to him. He put his cup down, stood up and took a couple steps forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come here.\" she reluctantly obeyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGuiche:What's he doing?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKirche:I don't know this is new.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSiesta stood 1 foot in front of him waiting for what he had to say next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jacket on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeanut gallery:*Facepalm* Seriously!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Saito I just told-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jacket. On.\" Siesta sighed in annoyance, but did as he said, only for him to swipe the jacket out of her hands much to her confusion.\"Jacket on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I don't have the-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jacket on!\" he was just about on her last nerve at this point, but she went through the motions anyway just wanting to get this over with, when suddenly he stop her arm mid-motion and made a slight adjustment to her form \"Be strong. Jacket on.\" she moved again, he stopped her again, another adjustment \"Firm. Jacket off.\" again \"Remember. Always Strong.\" And that is when it clicked, all these movement were blocking techniques. All this taught to her by putting on a jacket. Incredible.\"Jacket off.\" again \"Strong. Left foot back, right foot back, left foot back, pick up your jacket!\" she dodged a high kick unconsciously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah did you-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Focus!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right right\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Always concentrate. Right foot back, left feet back, right feet back, pick up your jacket!\" another kick dodged \"Stay!\" she obey on instinct as Saito picked up his jacket and threw it on the ground a few feet from her. \"Pick up your jacket.\" But when she reached out her hands to that he kick them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oww! Why did-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe grabbed her hands again and made the adjustments \"Strong. Now hang it up.\" again more adjustments \" And attitude!\" she push her hands forward a little. Saito raised his own hands up \"Strike\" she smacked her hands into his like she was giving him a double high five. \"Now hang it up and attitude!\" she double palm strike his chest \"Harder!\" again \"Harder!\" again and again until she was out of breath. \"Good. Lose the face.\" he said playfully as a rather goofy smile was on Siesta's face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jacket on!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvery attack he threw at her, she blocked, dodged and countered with practiced ease. Both of their movements flowed into one another so seamlessly it was like a dance. Block, Parry, Dodge, Strike, Repeat! Until..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA silence went over the courtyard as Saito and Siesta breathed heavily staring deep into each others eyes. Siesta's were filled with amazement at what just happened, while Saito's were filled with pride in his girlfriend. All the while the peanut gallery looked at the two commoners in awe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Martial Arts lives in everything we do Siesta. It lives in how we put on a jacket, how we take off the jacket. It lives in how we treat people. It lives in how we breath. Martial Arts isn't about becoming a better fighter, that is just a side benefit, it's about working hard everyday to better then you were yesterday. Patience, Discipline, Confidence, Courage, Compassion. These are the founding principles of Martial Arts. It is not the way of war. It is the way of life. Now are you ready to continue?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was more then ready \"Hai Sensei!\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Siesta wanted to vomit. Her she was dressing up in her new \"uniform\" that looked like it belonged in a whore house rather than a nobles mansion, to get ready for her first night working for Count Mott, her new \"employer\". She wasn't stupid, she knew exactly what her new \"duties\" were going to be from now on. She was purchased like a piece of property and was now going live as The Count's new mistress, tending to his every whim, no matter how degrading or perverse. And the worst thing was she couldn't do a damn thing about it. On top of being very wealthy with 100 guards patrolling his estate and being a Triangle Mage, he was the Royal Messenger. His was as close to being untouchable as you could get. Which meant he could do almost anything he wanted with little fear of consequences. So all the training she did with Saito the last 2 weeks was for nothing, even if she had a lifetime of training it wouldn't matter. All the confidence she gained was gone. This was her life now. And not even Saito can save her now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"SIESTA!!\" she jumped in surprise at the familiar voice coming from outside. She looked out the window to see that her hero Saito was fighting his way valiantly through the estate courtyard. Even with guards coming at him from all sides he bobbed and weaved through them effortlessly, making them run into each other or hit themselves instead of him. He never threw a punch or kick himself. It was awe inspiring, but instead of relief all Siesta felt was fear for her boyfriends safety. He was surrounded, outnumbered, he had only his shield to protect himself and Count Mott, who was much more powerful then Guiche, was no doubt going to be very angry when he sees a commoner making such a mess of his home. So she quickly ran out of the room, not caring that she was only in her underwear to try and stop her brave, but stupid lover from getting himself killed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"SAITO!\" he turned his head to see, much to his relief, Siesta safe and sound..and in her underwear.. with her bra in particular looking like it was about to burst with how small it was on her and all the bouncing from her running. The sexy sight was enough to give him a nose bleed and stop him in his tracks long enough for the guards to tackle him to the ground. \"No don't hurt him please!!\" Siesta pleaded as one guard stop her by catching her in a gentle but firm grip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT IS GOING ON OUT HERE?!?!\" A powerful and angry voice shouted. Everyone turned to see Count Mott power walking on to the scene. He looked at the state of his courtyard and was displeased to say the least. Almost half of his guards were on the ground in pain and 16 more had the cause of all this pinned with weapons at the ready. Normally seeing his guards do their job pleased him, but to see all this chaos caused by one boy, a commoner at that, made him wonder why he hired any of them in the first place. He glared down at Saito with contempt \" Tell me, why have you come here boy? And tell me why I shouldn't kill you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" I came to escort Siesta home.\" Saito said with certainty. Mott blinked in surprise at his answer, but when he thought about it, it made perfect sense.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" HAHAHAHAA!!! Oh that is just precious! The commoner boy, who has no doubt grown up hearing tales of adventure from his parents, has come to rescue his fair maiden from the clutches of the \"Evil\" mage.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" You misunderstand me Count. I didn't come to rescue her.\" Everyone looked at him like he had grown a second head.\" It's dark out and it's only right that a gentleman walks his lady home. But said lady is going to rescue herself.\" Now they looked at him like his second head started breathing fire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HAHAHAHAHAHAA!!!\" It was like Mott had heard the funniest joke of his life he was laughing so hard. He wiped a tear from his eye \"Oh that's a good one. Just for that I'll be merciful and make sure your death is quick and painless.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NO PLEASE STOP!!\" Siesta had managed to break free and fell to her knees at The Counts feet. \"My lord I beg you! I'll do anything you ask me and more just please let him go!!\" she pleaded with tears in her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't have to do anything for him Siesta.\" she turned to look at him like he had completely lost his mind. But he just smiled the same warm confident smile from the night they first met, the same smile that even now lit a spark of courage in her heart. \" You're so much stronger then you realize. You can break free. You just have to remember everything I've taught you.\" She really wanted to believe him, but she had been taught her whole life that nobles were almighty and the commoners were powerless, that kind of conditioning was hard to break.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enough of this nonsense.\" Mott started to make an ice spear \" The reality is that Mages are the strong. The commoners are weak. And the strong can do anything they want to the weak, which I plan to do with my new property.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nProperty. That is she is to him, a thing, a piece of meat, something he will use until he's bored with and just toss aside like garbage. And now the love of her was about to die. In that moment a lifetime of built up anger had finally reached it's limit. \"I'm not your property.\" she said quietly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I said I'm. NOT. YOUR. PROPERTY!!\" she bellowed out as she punched him in the groin, followed with a jab to the adam's apple, clapped her hands hard on his ears, palm strike to the nose, kick to the groin for good measure and finished with a roundhouse kick to the jaw. Need less to say Mott was out for the Count.(hehe puns) Siesta couldn't believe what she just did, but as Saito place his sweatshirt on her shoulders(the guards let him go when Siesta knock out their boss(they never liked him anyway)) she knew she had just did what she had always want to do. Rebel against the nobles. She then looked at the man who had made all this possible. The man from another world, a world with no magic, the love of her life who still had that same wonderful smile on his face that made her believe anything is possible. He then said 3 simple words that made her soul fly into the stars and made her fall so deeply in love with him that NOTHING could come between them ever again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are free.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

If that wasn't enough then all of Mott's guards, who were inspired by Saito and Siesta, were more then happy to let them know of all the Count's dirty little secrets. It turns out that Mott had an habit of buying commoner girls for his own personal harem. Girls from struggling families and then extorting those families of what little money they have. If that wasn't bad enough all those girls were similar to Siesta in looks,(slim, fit, dark hair, busty) so that meant he always planned to add Siesta to his \"collection\". So with all the evidence and political power staked against him Count Mott found himself strip of his noble status, wealth and was tossed into the street. And with the help of the Queen all the money that the Count had extorted from those families and so much more was repaid. So it's fair to say that justice was served.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe now find our young lovebirds cuddling on Saito's bed just enjoying the others warmth. Siesta couldn't be happier then she was right now, in the arms of the man she loves with all her heart. And Saito felt like he was in heaven with his girlfriend snuggling in his chest, she felt so soft and warm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Saito?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell me more about Earth.\" Saito blinked in surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?

Both of these things I believed were impossible 3 weeks ago. Now,\" she stared into Saito eyes with her own eyes full of wonder, hope and faith\"I find myself willing to believe in many things I once thought were impossible.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Even the moon landing?\" Siesta thought about it for a minute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well maybe not that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehehe it's okay a lot of people on Earth don't believe it happened either.\" he said in good humor \"There are people who still think Earth is flat too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait you mean Earth ISN'T flat?!\" she asked in disbelief. Saito looked at her in shock did that mean- \"Gotcha.\" she said with a sly grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter sharing a good laugh Saito began to tell Siesta more about Earth. Even a lot of his family's history as it turns out his father and his grandfather played big parts in some of the biggest events in modern history. His Grandfather along with his Grandmother and children were immigrants from Japan who came to America seeking a better life in the 1930's. It was difficult to for them to become accustomed to American culture and learn the language, but after 7 years of hard work and education they became proud legal citizens of the USA. But then World War 2 happened. His Grandparents were on vacation to Pearl Harbor when his Grandfather's former countrymen attacked so he saw first hand how much Japan had lost there way. So in respect for his new home and hopping to help stop the madness that plagued his old one he enlisted into the USA Army. Despite facing some discrimination he fought proudly with his brothers in arms against the evils of Nazi Germany. He was even one of the many soldiers who stormed the beach of Normandy and even though he lost an arm and most of his face he managed to return to America alive. He was even awarded the Metal of Honor, the highest reward an American soldier can obtain. He was a hero to his country and his family, though he did die of his injuries 3 years later. His name was Hiraga Touma.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaito's father (named Hiraga Yosuke)wanted to follow in his father's footsteps, while his brothers and sister(2 brothers,1 sister) went off to serve their country in other ways, like becoming firefighters or police officers, when he was old enough Youske enlisted into the US Marines where he served for 30 years of his life. He fought in the Korean and Vietnam war and even joined The Navy Seals, America's most elite armed forces. He won many promotions(his highest being Lieutenant Colonel) and metals, even the Metal of Honor like his father before him. But in his final campaign he was hit with shrapnel from a grenade to the thigh, he almost lost his whole leg, and was forced to retire. It nearly broke him, his whole life was the military, how was he going to go back to safe civilian life when all he knew was war? Well that would be in large part thanks to his mother Jane Brown. She was a psychiatrist that specialized in helping veterans adjust back to civilian life. In the long process of healing and returning home they got to know each other very well and fell in love, even though his father was 15 years older than his mother it didn't matter to them. So after 6 years of dating and getting used to being back in America his parents married and started a small, but successful diner together. 3 years later Saito was born. He grew up in a strict but loving home. Youske had him do chores around the house and the diner to make sure he learned the value of responsibility and hard work. But after every shift they would head down to the park to play catch or tag or any other game they could think of together like any father and son should. In fact almost everything that Saito knew about combat was taught to him by his father, so it's no wonder why he was such a badass. Jane home schooled him, because she knew that public schools now in days were lacking in many ways, mostly in teaching kids how to use logic, reason and common sense. And Jane didn't want her son to grow up to be a naive, easily manipulated simpleton.(her exact words) His Uncles(who are both firefighters) and Aunt(who is now a detective) visited them often and would always tell Saito stories of their most exciting days at work. So it's fair to say Saito grew up with a lot of great role models in his life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSiesta now understood why her boyfriend was such an amazing person, it was because he was raised by an amazing family. And his beliefs on freedom and justice now made sense too. His country was founded on the idea that all men are created equal. And in spite of it's flaws and checkered past(because what country that has ever existed not had any) it was still the country that lead the modern world into a new age of equality and prosperity. A country that started as colonies of the most powerful empire at the time, but broke free, declared their independence and though many years of trails and struggle, even a civil war, became the greatest country on Earth. It was awe inspiring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaito noticed that Siesta was silent for a long time and wondered if this was too much for her to take in.\"Siesta is everything alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. It's just it all makes sense now.\" Saito tilted his head in puzzlement, while she looked at him with eyes full understanding. \"Being a hero is in your blood.\" she said with certainty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh..I suppose it is.\" he said thoughtfully. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh it's true darling.\" said a familiar sultry voice coming from the doorway. They looked to see that Kirche entering the room with a certain gleam in her eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How long have you been outside the door?\" asked Siesta.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ever since darling started talking about his Grandfather Touma.\" she answered. So pretty much the whole time then. \"I couldn't help it. Ever since that night darling saved my purity and made me feel more alive then I thought was possible I haven't been to get him out of my head.\" she said in a surprisingly soft voice.\"I know you two are in love and I don't want to get in the way of that. All I want is to lose my purity to the ma I know, with certainty, that I love. I won't ask for anything more.\" tears started to fall down on her lovely face as she looked at Siesta in desperation.\"Please Siesta..let me make love with Saito just this once!\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",
