She got to have her own bathroom and delicious food unlike the others. Everyone else was jealous of her, but Courtney didn't care about them. She enjoyed spiting Duncan by eating a four-star meal while Duncan ate Chef's crappy food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever she didn't take into account how her luxurious lifestyle would affect her. Courtney often ate large meals to mock the other contestants that ended up fattening her up. Not to mention that she spent her time between challenges being lazy and playing with her PDA. Plus, with her private bathroom, she didn't have to hold in her farts until everyone fell asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the first night there, she managed to gain 3 pounds, which was very fast.</span></div></div>",

She was never one to eat much. Although, looking at the others indulging for a few seconds, she thought, \"Maybe it won't hurt, everyone else is doing it, and after a week of Chef's disgusting meals, I'd be a fool to pass this up.\"<br>\r\n She gives in and starts eating. \"This food is amazing.\" She thought, \"I never get to enjoy this food at home.\" Courtney's parents are strict, they only let her eat healthy foods, and in a certain quantity.<br>\r\nThere was no food left. Courtney had a big belly. Two of the girls on the other team are also a bit bloated, but neither of their bellies compare to Courtney's, which looks pregnant.<br>\r\n She and the rest of the contestants are shocked to find out, once again, the challenge was fake. The real challenge, is to stay awake as long as possible. Can Courtney really stay up for a long period of time? She's already exhausted from the run, and stuffing herself didn't help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwelve hours in, and somehow, everyone is still awake. Courtney is not feeling good, she's exhausted, her stomachache from overeating earlier has not gone away. <br>\r\nNot being able to hold it anymore, Courtney rips out a fart. The fart has attracted a lot of attention, contestants from both teams are making comments. Courtney chuckles, \"Uh... Excuse me.\" She was embarrassed, but at least her stomachache lessened.</span></div></div>",

Thankfully everyone seemed to have moved on from her little gas attack and just focusing on staying awake. Courtney tried to keep moving in hopes that it would help. She eyed the other campers to see who would be the next to fall. Gwen and Trent were laying side by side, Heather was talking to Beth and Lindsay. She couldn't hear either conversation but she also didn't really care. All that mattered was that her team won. Even if she passed out, all they needed was to stay awake longer than the Screaming Gophers. She needed a way to keep them up but how?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPPPPBBBBBBRRRLLLLTTTT!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer train of thought was interrupted by the slumbering oaf Owen who let one rip as he slept. The contestants closest to Owen stirred and groaned from the smell. Seeing this, Courtney had an idea. One that she was hesitant to enact but she had no choice. There was no way she could lug Owen to her team's side and all her side stepping was not doing wonders for her stomach. Her meal from before sloshed in her gut and gurgled as it was being digested, spurring a small burp from the CIT. She could feel the pressure building in her backside and wasn't going to wait around. With trepidation, she shut her eyes and let it rip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPPPPPPPPPPBBBBBBBBLLLLRRRRRRRPPPPPPPPTTTTTTT!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo the disgust and surprise of many of the teens, Courtney actually managed to top Owen's previous fart in loudness and stink. She was met with groans and childish laughter from the others, and one cry of approval from Izzy. It was humiliating but her team did look livelier. Plus she imagined they would have trouble sleeping with the smell of baked beans wafting in the air. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so, for the next several hours, Courtney was startle her team was random bouts of butt burps throughout the challenge, letting the pressure build until it was just right. Yes she looked foolish but she reasoned that the others would do something far worse eventually. That prediction came true as a naked, sleep walking Owen wandered into the woods. And she figured her team would cheer and praise her ingenuity once they won the contest. Plus, it felt so good letting all that gas out in one big push and the satisfaction that came after. It was getting harder for her to hide the relief on her face after every release. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the hours ticked away, everyone did succumb to sleep one after another. Despite her efforts, Courtney too fell into a deep sleep. When she came to, Chris was waking the others up with a air horn pointed into a mega phone and was ready to announce the winning team.</span></div></div>",

As a result Chris was forced to come up with an impromptu tie breaker challenge: a hot chocolate chug; there were gallons of hot chocolate stowed away in the kitchen after it was deemed too much of a giveaway to include in the contestant's prior feast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So it looks like two lucky campers get to compete in a tie break challenge! Courtney, Heather, you two have been 'randomly' selected to play on behalf of your teams. They may not be very happy if you lose...\" Chris chuckled as the two girls began to chug down the rich beverage. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCourtney had clearly taken an early lead but she suddenly felt a pain in her lower belly.

She was reading a book, when her stomach rumbled loudly through the cabin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*GRRRRMMMBLLRRRGG!*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other girls stared at Beth, clutching her tummy. \"Oops...\" She giggled sheepishly, \"Guess I'm a little hungry! Be right back!\" She gave her tiki idol souvenir a kiss and picked it up. \"You can come with me, pretty idol thingy!\" She put the statue in her pocket, never once noticing its glowing red eyes as she climbed off her bunk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeth hummed to herself as she walked to the mess hall, her belly growling, echoing through the camp. \"Euurgh.... that's strange, I'm usually NEVER hungry this late at night... Oh well!\" She shrugged it off, her mind wandering to visions of roast chicken, entire pizzas with everything on it, hamburgers with layers of melted cheese and grease rolling down the sides... THUNK! Beth walked right into the side of the mess hall! She shook it off and stepped into the tent, but was disappointed at what she saw. Chef had already left! \"AWwww man...\" She sighed, clutching her gurgling gut. Her disappointment washed away seconds later, when she had an idea. \"Hmmmm... Chef won't mind if I help myself...\" She looked from side to side, making sure nobody was watching. She took small, quiet tip-toe steps over to the backroom, making sure that nobody would catch her in the act. About halfway there, she darted to the door and slammed it behind her. Beth clutched her side, huffing and puffing, trying to catch her breath. \"Whew... THAT was close...\" she sighed to herself. Her eyes lit up. Right there in the back room, right on the table, was a buffet of delicious foods, already cooked and prepared, as if someone KNEW she was coming. It... was slightly unsettling, but Beth wasn't going to argue. \"Woooow... it all looks so TASTY!\" She licked her lips. All her favorites were there: Roast chicken, entire pizzas with everything on it, hamburgers with layers of melted cheese and grease rolling down the sides... along with a smorgasbord of other delicious dishes! She pulled out the statue. \"Where to start, huh, little guy?\" She giggled, placing it on the table. Beth pulled a leg of the warm, roast chicken off and took a deep whiff. \"Mmmmmm... Chef REALLY outdid himself this time!\" She took a bite... as soon as her teeth dug into the juicy drumstick, the tiki's eyes started to glow. Beth's eyes shot open. \"Mmmmmmmm, this is DELICIOUS!\" within minutes she had stripped it to the bone! \"*URP!* Hehee! Excuse me!\" she giggled, savoring the wonderful flavor still in her throat and mouth. She sucked the delicious chicken-y taste off of her fingers. It was just too much to bare! She needed more... She started taking big, wild bites out of the entire chicken, bits of meat and saliva flying every which way! After about... five minutes, the chicken was nothing but bones. Beth's bulging tummy was threatening to blast the button off her pants right there! \"Ahhhh.... * BUURROOOARRPPT!* Mmmm, that was GREAT!\" Her stomach growled and gurgled. \"Hmmm, I'm still kinda hungry though...\" she lamented, patting her stuffed gut... Lucky for her, she had an entire kitchen full of delicious foods to choose from! She stood herself up and walked along the edge of the table, bringing a big spoon of mashed potatoes and gravy to her mouth, swallowing down the whole thing. \"Mmmm!\" She licked her lips before pressing her face right into the bowl, eating up all she could! The whole time, her little tiki friend staring at her with those evil, glowing red eyes...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

And how we are going to do it well Heather already asked us to get her chips so I thought that when we go to the kitchen we see how much food they have I'm sure cook has plenty of food in there especial candy so we bring loads of it back to Heather and let her own greedy nature take effect so you in.\" Beth explained then asked Lindsay<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just so I can understand your plan well you want to stay secret friends with Heather just so we can fatten her up to be a big blob of fat for how she treats us and others.\" Lindsay asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep\" Beth answered with a smile and nod<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok then I'm in anything to finally shut Heather up.\" Lindsay said smiling<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok now lets gather as many berries as we can and take them with us.\" Beth said starting to pick as many blue berries taking off her vest and putting the berries in it<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why\" Lindsay asked using her banadna to put berries in it<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have a idea.\" The girl said smirking<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce they got enough to be held by the vest and banadna the girls headed to the kitchen hidding just as cook left the mess hall once they where sure he was gone they sneaked in and started to look for treats. Which didn't take long all the cabints and fridge where full of chips, twinkee's, cupcakes, candy bars, and all types of other goodies that made the two girls drool a bit when you had to eat the crap they did just about anything looked better even crums so this was like paradise to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow look at all this why do they serve us that grule if they have this.\" Lindsay said as she started to grab all kinds of treats to give to Heather<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Probably some part of the game to torture us. Ah found it.\" Beth said with a shrug before saying that the blond looked at the girl and saw her going over to the stove<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did you find\" Lindsay asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Some cooking grease and cooking lard.\" Beth said smirking<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Lindsay could even ask what the girl was going to do she grabbed a pan out of a cabint and mix the two things in it and then grabbed a bottle that read blueberry extract and some blue food dye and mix them in the mixture until it was a semi-blue liquid. The girl then pulled out a small syringe and fulled the syringe with the goop and started to poke a blueberry and fill the berry with some of the mixture making it slightly bigger. Lindsay smiled and got the girls idea nodding there head with that Beth had Lindsay get more treats while she filled the berries until the goo was completely gone and in each berry. And Lindsay had found some bags and packed them with the food also found a bucket so to put the now slightly larger berries in it and don't have to use there stuff to carry them anymore. Once set the girls left the mess tent out the backway just so they didn't take the chance to run into the large crazy cook within a few minutes they finally got back the the bossy girl who glared at the two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell took you two so long and what is with all the food I asked for berries and chips that was all.\" Heather said angrily at the two<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I was off to get the chips but I thought we would get you more since I knew you would be hungry from only eating that stuff we get for breakfest, lunch, and dinner so I thought get you more but I was going to need help to bring it so I got Lindsay. We found all kinds of goodies we thought you like and where heading back when we found some berries and remembered you want those two so we got what you wanted and more. But if you don't want it all I guess we can share it with the others.\" Beth lied to mean girl with Lindsay nodding at the end she smirked at herself knowing Heather won't share anything with any of the others especial people of her team.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No I didn't say I won't take it I just surprise that is really good of the Beth keep thinking like that you will move in this world now give me the food am starving.\" Heather said as her greedy nature took ahold and took the bags and bucket from the two girls<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon Heather took a handful of berries and shoved them into her mouth and started to chew not noticing anything wrong with the berries as the blueberry extract made the goo taste like the blueberry. So she just thought the berries where extra juicy which Heathered liked and made her moan a bit after two more handfuls she opened one of the bag of chips glad that Beth remembered not to get any BBQ. And took two handfuls of chips and shoved them into her mouth the two girls just smiled to themselves as they watch the evil woman pig out shoving all kinds of things into her mouth eating. She kept stuffing herself until she there was only five minutes left of the challenge Heather sitting on the ground with a stuff stomach which was now bulging into a good size potbelly causing her shorts to unbutton to let her stomach stretch out a bit. Heather had a smile of satisfaction on her face rubbing her stomach not even seeming to notice increase girth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow Heather you where sure hungry weren't you.\" Lindsay asked Heather just nodded<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But there still some goodies and berries left maybe we should share this with the others.\" Beth said as it was true still a two bags and a third of the bucket still full of berries saying that seemed to snap Heather out of her stupior<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What no...urrp...that stuff is mine just...urrrppp...hide it I will have the rest later.\" Heather said burping twice<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course probably best to as you can't always eat like that.\" Beth said smirking as she grabbed the stuff and decided to hide it in some bushes for now when she said that Heather started to think why can't she eat like that she deserved to and she already ahd the girls get her stuff why not have them do again all the type<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who says I an't you know new rule from now one you two will always get me plentuy of food so I can always eat like this got it.\" Heather demended<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well ok.\" The two said smiling there plan working </span></div></div>",

Her arm had good two and half inches thick of fat around her, she defeatly had two chins with a third starting to form and cheeks where very puffy to look like a golf ball was stuffed in each cheek. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince her new size Heather found all her clothes a bit to small and forced the girl to wear sweats though Heather through a fit of why her clothes weren't fitting which Beth and Lindsay assured her that it was the wash that strank her clothes. (I believe there is a little place they can do laundry other wise all there clothes would stink to high heaven)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeather of course believed it and no one was willing to point out it might be the fact she is getting so fat why her clothes don't fit mostly cause she was mean to them and they didn't feel like been nice to her. What really surprised everyone especial Beth and Lindsay that Heather didn't seem to notice that she was getting fat but Beth figured and after explaining it to Lindsay thought it was probably because Heather thought so highly of herself. That nothing can ruin her figure or look so when she looked in the mirror she still was thinking she was seeing her thin form while it really wasn't; like a anorexia chick who would see herself as been hug and fat while she was probably no more then skin and bones. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough after this Beth had to assure Lindsay that the person in the mirror was her real figure and that she wasn't fat or to skinny. Though Beth was surprise the host Chris didn't say anything to Heather though he would make a few jokes that seemed to go over the evil girls head but other then that he wasn't making it any sure point to tell the girl. It was probably good for rating which would explain why it was getting easier to find the junk food and get in and out of Chiefs kitchen without any worry which speaking of the kitchen was where Beth and Lindsay where making Heathers next fattening meal. But then suddenly? </span></div></div>",

The girls could see that Heather's large stomach was once more growing as she gorged herself the best part of the girls plan was that as Heather stuffed herself she got larger and as she got larger she had to eat more. And eating so much seemed to make the girl loose some of her manners as crumbs and juices of food landed on her clothes and formed chocolate, grease and other juices covered around mouth. The girl was really letting herself go but with her thinking so highly of herself really was part of her own downfall that and picking on the girls was another. Soon enough Heather was finished with all or well most of the food there was still some things left but they would be put away for later. Heathers stomach was pushing out more looking a few inches bigger then a basketball it was even pushing her shirt up and showing the girls belly button off. Even her ass was looking a bit more snug in her sweat pants and breasted seemed a bit bigger but hard to tell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow that was really good.\" Heather said smiling and rubbing her large stomach<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well glad to make you happy Heather.\" Beth said with her own smile those Heather was to busy in her slight food coma to notice the evil behind the smile<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOk what should happen next? </span></div></div>",

After opening the door just a crack, the smell of Heather's farts made them sick. They held their breath and ventured in as Heather made up a lie to explain why all the toilets were clogged. Gwen and Leshawna were both worried about Heather at this point. They didn't care about Heather's health, and secretly they were hoping she would eventually have a heart attack, but they were worried about how the new fat Heather was making them miserable by clogging the toilets almost everyday and eating better food then them. However, they decided along with Beth and Lindsay to keep going until Heather was voted off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Heather began to blame... </span></div></div>",

Who went to Heather helping her get to her feet and taking her to her room to sleep now while everyone else cleaned the table off. The next morning Heather woke to find her belly was still bulging but most of it defeated she had the girls come back and take her to the dining room that once more had a table of food covering it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh come on you can't expect me to eat all that again I almost exploded last time.\" Heather said grabbing her slightly larger stomach as she looked at the leader like he was crazy but the Leader came up and handed her a cup that seemed to have some weird brownish grey liquid in it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh you want me to drink that looks like it's mud.\" Heather said acting like she would throw up as she pushed the glass away the leader glared at her and push the cup to her while saying something she looked to see the men once more tighten there hold on there weapons and not wanting to be a pin cushion she took the drink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine but if I get sick your to blame.\" She said and start to take a ship fo the drink strangely it didn't taste bad it was actually kinda sweet she chugged the rest of the drink down and empty the cup but she didn't know that the drink had special properties that would cause her to...? </span></div></div>",

She leaned forward and started stuffing her mouth with food. She had no idea what she was eating, but she didnt care because she was so hungry shed eat anything and also she was starting to like it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHmmm, this is pretty good. Heather said swallowing some food. As the food slowly filled her stomach, the rest of her was growing. Her butt cheeks were beginning to look like bean bag chairs, her hips were as wide as Owens and a stomach just as big with boobs that were bigger than Leshawna or Lindsays. She ate faster and savored the food more, and started to actually like gorging herself. She took sips from the cup, but that only made her hungrier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOhhhh this is so good. She moaned. She reached farther across the table, but her gut was blocking the way. She strained herself trying to feed herself. Finally, Heather just said Oh the heck with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeather stopped caring about everyone else and crawled on the table just to reach the food. She started crawling across table and grabbing food and eating it while moaning ecstatically. As she moved across the table, she was becoming filthy as she got covered in stains, grease, and coated in food that she passed. The natives watched in awe as she swallowed everything on the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she had eaten every last crumb and licked all her hands clean, Heather laid on the table and sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBBBBBBBBBBBBRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR RRPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPP!!!!! she belched.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, her pants button popped off like a bottle rocket as her ginourmous gut was released.

She rubbed herself licking the stains on her clothes and said I wonder what my loser team is doing now? </span></div></div>",

If they thought she was a goddess, who was she to break the illusion? Instead, she embraced her title and quickly took control. While neither parties understood each other, they quickly got the gist of what they were saying. When they wanted her to go somewhere, she followed. If they had food or drink, she consumed it and delighted in the tastes. As long as they didn't touch her crotch they were free to pour special oils on her and paint her with ceremomial colors. And in return, they quickly learned when she wanted to eat and when she needed privacy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they developed a mutual understanding, Heather developed quite the appetite and a hefty buils to go with it. Everyday, her hunger increased and so did her waistline. Between meals she worried about her figure but the constant worshipping from the natives boosted her ego and convinced her that she was a beauty, even as her belly bloated outwards and her farts became more frequent. She even learned to love the feel of her doughy exterior and feeling her fingers caress her fat folds. It didn't take long for her to teach them how she wanted to be treated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeeks passed and she ascended into a position of power. No longer was she blindly following her orders but they were following hers. Their lives revolved around tending to her needs and satisfying her hunger. She guzzled the brown liquid they gave her like it was water making her even gassier and fatter as a result.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the end of her first month's stay, she was gargantuan. Just short of 2,000 pounds, Heather had outgrown her old clothing and was adorned in tribal paint and a golden headdress. Sporting multiple chins, her followers had to prop her up and construct a stepladder to reach her ravenous maw. Her breasts have grown larger than a full grown boar and rested on top of a stretched out paunch that was large enough to be used as a water bed. It sloshed and gurgled with her digested food and coated with grease and remnants of her former meals that she belched up. She no longer walked anywhere nor could she see her legs but if she could look past her gut Heather would find them swollen with adipose and near useless. The one part of her the natives avoided was her collasal, boulder buns. Her butt burps were so powerful that lately they made the temple tremble from the intensity. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA month ago she would have been horrified and repulsed by her fattened form. Now, she found it hard to believe she took this long to get this big. And as for her former teammates.....</span></div></div>",

She experienced great pleasure when she released the gas from her body. She would chuckle at the sounds she made. Heather noticed how tense she was getting and began to relax more. She stretched her flabby arms and laid back on the soft pillows placed behind her. She felt better lying down and was able to fart better this way. She coudl smell the farts she had released earlier and actually liked the smell of it. Not to mention the sheets and pillows felt so nice Heather didn't want to move at all.

Smiling, Lindsey put down several different pies that were in the fridge. They were supposed to be used in a pie fighting challenge later on, but Lindsay was sure no one would miss one or four.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOpen up, Lindsay asked as she scooped up a nice big chunk of cheery pie on a spoon and brought it to Gwens mouth. It was a little embarrassing to be spoon fed like a baby, but Gwen went along with it, figuring it couldnt hurt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAaaahhh. Opening wide, Lindsey stuffed the pie into her mouth and pulled it out just as quickly. Before she could close her mouth, Lindsay got another spoonful and shoved it in. It wasnt until the third helping was crammed in that Gwent turned away from Lindsay and lifted up her hands. With her cheeks bulging and a bit of filling dripping down her chin, she chewed quickly and took small swallows until her mouth was empty. Gasping for air, she turned back to Lindsay who had another spoonful ready to go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlow down Lindsay, this isnt a pie eating contest, Gwen said with a chuckle, finding Lindsays antics a little funny. The girl was really trying to help, but she lacked common sense about a lot of things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSorry, Lindsay sighed, lowering the spoon as a smile marred her usually chipper face. As quickly as she got sad she brightened back up, smiling happily at Gwen. Hey, I made you laugh. Thats good right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYeah, I guess, Gwen admitted, releasing that Lindsays antics had made her forget about Trent for the moment. That and the big helping of pie helped. Feeling a little hungrier, she opened wide and Lindsay returned to feeding her with great delight. More cheery pie was crammed in, but Lindsay stopped after the second feeding, letting Gwen chew the food and swallow before getting more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Gwen kept eating she started finishing her bites faster. She stopped chewing as much and swallowed down more. She finished the first pie after a few more minutes and then quickly moved on to number two. Lindsay leaned in as she started feeding Gwen, keeping the Pie close to her as she moved faster to match Gwens speed. Pretty soon Lindsay was shovelling the food into Gwens mouth as she nearly swallowed each portion whole so she could get more. The more she seemed to eat the hungrier she felt. It was weird, but she wasnt complaining, as each bite seemed to make her feel better then the last.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReady for some blueberry pie? Lindsay asked as she grabbed the next dish. Gwen nodded quickly, her stomach groaning not from being full but a growing need for more. Lindsay started spoon-feeding her again, but Gwen was even faster, almost inhaling the food as soon as it got near. Seeing she wasnt fast enough, Lindsay decided to try something different.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDont worry, I washed my hands, Lindsay assured Gwen as she sank her fingers into the blueberry pie and grabbed a handful of the sweet dessert. Before Gwen could utter a word, Lindsay shoved her hand towards her mouth, stuffing the pie in until Gwens cheeks bulged and she had to swallow. Figuring shed found the best way to feed her teammate, Lindsay started grabbed handfuls of pie and shoving them into Gwens mouth one hand at a time. Quickly adapting to Lindsays force-feeding, Gwen finished the third pie in record time and Lindsay grabbed a fourth right away. She started shoving more into Gwens mouth, practically pushing it in with her palm as she heaped more and more into Gwens already overstuffed mouth. By the time she had gotten done with the fourth pie, A ring of filling and crust surrounded Gwens mouth along with a few crumbs littered over her top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeel better? Lindsay asked as she put down the last pie pan, oblivious to the mess on Gwens face and top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYeah, I actually do. Gwen said as she licked her lips, trying to get the pie stuck to her face. As she got what she could from around her mouth, she slid a finger along her dirty face, collecting the rest of it and licking it off her finger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was a great idea Lindsay, thanks for suggesting it. Gwen was now looking for crumbs on her shirt to devour. She only found tiny crumbs, until she checked her cleavage, finding a nice chunk lodged up there. She popped it into her mouth uncaring about where it had been, the sweet taste making her feel so good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're so welcome! Im happy to help, Lindsay exclaimed happily. Gwen nodded to her and thee noticed her hands were covered in pie. Without thinking twice, she took the blondes hand and started to suck on her fingers, cleaning them with her tongue. She nearly swallowed Lindsays fingers as she inhaled everything she could find. When she was done, she popped them out of her mouth and ran her tongue from knuckle to fingertip, seeking even the tiniest crumb. It wasnt until Lindsays hand was spotless that she fully realized what she was doing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSorry! Gwen gulped, backing away and looking down shamefully. She couldnt believe she had done that, but she was just so hungry and when she had seen the pie on her fingers she reacted without thinking.

Those pies must have been really good to make you do that.\" Gwen was relieved and surprised that Lindsay didn't seem to care what Gwen just did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh yeah. Don't you think it was weird?\" Gwen asked curiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLindsay just shrugged and said, \"It's not the first time someone has done it. I have a dog at home that always loves to eat out of my hand. His tongue always tickles and makes me laugh.\" She looked at her other hand that was covered in pie as well. \"Do you want to clean my other hand? It takes forever to clean the gunk from under my nails and you did a really good job with the other one.\" Lindsay held her hand up and admired how spotless they were. Gwen couldn't believe that Lindsay was asking her to do something so bizarre. Yet she couldn't resist getting the pie off of the blonde's hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure thing, just don't tell anyone about this. Not even Heather.\" Gwen warned her. She got down and put Lindsay's hand in her mouth and started cleaning. She licked off every speck of filling and crumb off of Lindsay's fingers and took in the aroma of her fruity hand lotion. She licked under her nails and sucked off the rest around her knuckle. Lindsay started laughing like crazy as Gwen was tickling her with her licks that seemed to pleasure her. As she watched Gwen, she realized that while she wasn't very fashionable Gwen was still a nice girl. Lindsay wondered when Gwen was going to finish. Eventually the goth stopped when.... </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>By: fearboy<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow long have we been in here? Gwen asked when she noticed the sun had gone down so the challenge was over. She was a little surprised that the game had turned out so easily. She expected at least one person to check the huge, empty kitchen for anyone hiding, but it seemed that she had over estimated the other contestants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooks like we won, Lindsay, Gwen said with a shake of her head, hoping that the next contest would be this easy. Lindsay just stood there with her hand still out and dripping with saliva. Lindsay had not expected to win at all. Heather told her before the game started that her big jugs and ass would be spotted quickly and she was too dumb to find any good hiding spots. Heather was so smart; she thought she had to be right. As the less then bright blonde wrapped her brain around it, a big smile formed on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe did it! Yeah for us! Before Gwen could stop her, the other teen grabbed her and pulled her into a big hug. Gwen smiled uneasily as Lindsay tightly squeezed her. She felt a bit odd to have the pretty girl pressing into her, her big chest rubbing against hers. Gwen was not big on touching, licking pie off someone was fine, but public displays of affection made her feel uncomfortable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nURP!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wasnt crazy about belching in someones face either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll that squeezing forced gas from her stomach, making the teen a little gassy. She pushed away from Lindsay before anything else came out of her. Covering her mouth, she tried to give a hasty apology to Lindsay who had gotten a face full of her smelly belch. She seemed a little dazed and then started to wrinkle her nose at the scent. Gwen was caught totally off guard when Lindsay started to giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was so cute! You burp like a guy, that is just the most adorable thing, Lindsay continued to giggle as Gwen just lifted her brow at the girl. Maybe Lizzy wasnt the only crazy one on the island.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI wish I could burp like that. My burps have been like little hiccups since I was little and my mom tells me I cant do that. I just want to have a little bit of fun and look pretty doing it, like you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt clicked for Gwen a second later why Lindsay was acting like this. For all her spoiled and valley girl antics, Lindsay was a big kid at heart, enjoying simple, weird stuff like any immature child. In a way, it was kind of heart warming to see how far Lindsays childlike attitude could go. Something else occurred to her about what Lindsay said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou think I looked pretty burping?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh yeah, Lindsay said with an enthusiastic nod of her head. You look really cute doing lots of things like gobbling down food, licking my fingers, burping, I bet youd even look good farting. Theres just something about you that makes all those messy, tomboy stuff look so nice. I could watch you eat all day, Lindsay sighed, looking deep into Gwens eyes. Blushing, the goth had to look away as she felt Lindsays stare was a little too intimate. She had seemed to be really opening up to her all afternoon and Gwen was starting to wonder if Lindsay was looking for more then a female BFF on the island.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLindsayare you interested in girls?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIm interested in a lot of stuff, she chirped happily, not giving Gwen any answer. Either she was being coy or she had no clue what Gwen was hinting at. Judging by the vacant look in her eyes, it was the latter. Lindsay was just acting her usually overly friendly self. Gwen might have licked her fingers like a dog, but Lindsay was the real friendly puppy in the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nForget it, Gwen said and looked down at her stomach, trying to avoid this awkward conversation. She then found something else to stare at when she finally noticed the slight bulge in her stomach. She had eaten four pies and was stuffed, her gut showed it with a small potbelly sticking out over her dress. The sight of the new pudgy midsection didnt bother her as getting it had felt so good and according to Lindsay, she was cute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow why did the thought of Lindsay finding her cute make her stomach flutter a little. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Later that night Gwen couldn't wait to get some sleep. Once she and Lindsay reconvened with the rest of the cast, Gwen was met with gasps and bulging eyes once they saw her prominent pot belly. The only one he didn't give a crap about her figure was Chef, and he was glaring hard at the two girls as if he was planning to murder them that night. At first Gwen thought it was because she outlasted him but then she remembered that she ate all his food! In her grief, neither girls considered that they would get in trouble or that her weight would be so noticeable. Judging by the vacant look on Lindsay's face, she still wasn't aware.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice of you to join us, ladies.\" Chris greeted, his tone condescending as usual. \"While I WOULD congratulate on dodging Chef, it appears you helped yourself to the kitchen. Not the best time to have a crop top.\" Gwen covered up her belly in shame as Chris mocked her, earning some sneers from Leshawna.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooh, maybe you should get a gurdle. I'm sure Chris can tell you where he gets his,\" Lindsay suggested. The group went silent and even McClean stopped laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh well ahem anywho, ignoring that flagrant lie,\" he said trying to brush off the blonde, \"Since you technically won, you do get immunity for this challenge. BUT, you two will receive a penalty for the next challenge. And no dinner.\" Lindsay groaned but didn't argue at all, while Gwen gave Chris the stink eye. Punishing her was fine but why Lindsay? She didn't deserve it but Gwen wasn't knew negotiating was out of the question. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that, the contestants returned to their cabins. Gwen decided to take a nap since she wasn't getting anything to eat. She crawled into her bunk and fell asleep right away, even with Bridgette smelling as awful as she did after getting sprayed by skunks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she slept, a soothing, perky voice came from the ether and told her to, \"Open wide.\" Gwen obeyed and had a spoon stuff ice cream into her mouth. It was the best thing she had ever eaten. As the world suddenly came into view, seemingly manifesting around her, she discovered that surrounding her were slim, disembodied hands holding various types of food. The one that just fed her vanished as anither took its place and Gwen opened her mouth again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe happily accepted the offerings with gusto, moaning from the taste that came with each bite. Everytime she swallowed, her stomach would inflate with fat, her hips widened, her ass got juicier, and even her breasts filled out too. As she grew, the hands descended and helped remove her clothing. Her clothes tore away like tissue paper, leaving the hands to rub and massage Gwen's expanding form. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time she reached Owen's size, her pace sped up and she was loving every moment of it. She failed to even notice her growth or that the arms were accompanied by a set of ample breasts. Breasts that seemed familiar. Breasts that rubbed and grinded into her doughy figure, making her whole body tingle. Something felt off about this but also so right. She wanted this but also felt powerless to stop it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have such a cute belly~\" the voice said, causing Gwen to look down at her growing paunch. Withiut even realizing it, she was huge! A massive blob of fat weighing two tons and larger than her team's cabin and gaining exponentially. Still eating and accepting the rubdown, she saw a figure climbing her bulk with the skill of a pro rock climber. As they came closer, Gwen realized who it was. It was Lindsay, and she was naked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hands stopped feeding and parted as Lindsay made her way to Gwen's face, her body almost as large as the island. Gwen was growing frantic and tried to move but she was too fat. She couldn't move. All she could do was watch as Lindsay came closer and closer until their faces were inches apart. And then, she asked Gwen one single question. \"Do you want me to kiss you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that point, Gwen lurched up in bed drenched in a cold sweat. She gasped for air and felt herself. Her muffin top remained but she wasn't a blob nor naked. She sighed in relied, and yet, somehow was a bit disappointed. Her mind was flooded with questions about that bizarrely erotic dream. Why was she dreaming of being a fat blob? Why was Lindsay there? Why did she ask her such a weird question? And most importantly, did Gwen want to kiss her?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore she could figure it out, there was a banging at the door. \"C'mon girl! Time for the Campfire Ceremony!\" It was Leshawna, and it was also getting dark outside. Her stomach gurgled loudly and demanded food. Gwen groaned and climbed out of bed, looking forward to her marshmallow. She'd deal with the dream later, it was time to find out who got voted off. Heather found an invincibility idol so she was safe, which left Duncan, Owen, DJ, Geoff, Bridgette, and Izzy on the chopping block. Who would be voted off?</span></div></div>",

So she ran off deep into the forest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout half an hour later, Gwen stopped. GRRRRRRRLL. Her stomach growled loudly. She missed breakfast, so she was starving. Then, she smelled something. Something delicious. She followed the scent to a huge secluded tent with a trailer and fridge. Food was stacked on the table with food she hadn't had in weeks. Submarine sandwiches, a 3 layer cake, a big bowl of punch, hamburgers on a grill, pizza pies, and a turkey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust looking at it made Gwen drool. She snuck over to the table, and grabbed a slice of pizza. She took a bite and she moaned with pleasure as she swallowed it.She even started to forget about Trent. Suddenly, she heard footsteps.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Gwen laid in her bed passed out, snoring loudly and covered bits of dried ice cream that had scattered across her bedsheets and pajamas. She turned a little in her sleep unknowingly making her leg move the curtain enough to let in A streak of light that shines in Gwen\u2019s eyes, waking her up. She groaned and stretched her arms out as she sat up, gave a big yawn, then leaned over to let out a small poot, \u201cFfffttt.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked around forgetting where she was for a moment until she noticed the empty ice cream carton coddled in her arm and the tv that was at the end of her bed still on. \u201cOh yeah, I had another late night binge... could go for some breakfast actually.\u201d Gwen tossed the carton, adding yet more liter to her floor along side various pizza boxes and cans of soda.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned to the mini fridge at the side of her bed and grabbed a box of cold pizza. She began noisily scarfing it down, shoving as much as she could into her mouth at once. Pizza sauce covers the edges of her mouth in her need to get as much into her mouth as possible. \u201cBrrraaaap! Ugh, so good.\u201d Gwen said in satisfaction as she wiped her fingers on her pants like a napkin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking back at the tv she saw a familiar advert. Famous reality tv host Chris McLain boated on about about how \u201cany one of you lucky kids\u201d could get the audition and win the cash prize of one hundred thousand dollars.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen scoffs at the tv \u201cugh, what a load of crap!\u201d It wasn\u2019t hard to tell how she felt about reality tv, or rather the lack of reality in it. For years society insists that people need perfect flawless body\u2019s and cheerful attitudes in order to accept themselves, and as a goth Gwen had much destain for that mentality. But when it came to the mind numbing side of television people wanted the opposite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe couldn\u2019t keep track of all the gross and ill mannered jackass\u2019s who had become celebrities by being what the world normally looks down upon. It was usually fat people being gluttonous and gross on a daily basis. They ate excessively, sloppily and passed gas at an alarming rate. Here these people where making complete slobs of themselves yet people where eager to watch it. But if they where to meet someone like that in real life they would be despised. It\u2019s the same with goths. Preppy girls think of Gwen as a freak but when someone wears dark clothing on a screen suddenly their bad ass. The more Gwen thought about it the more she realized how similar these two where. And that\u2019s when it hit her, if reality tv wants a slob so badly then she was going to show them one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she walked in bathroom she took a moment to look at herself in the mirror to analyze how much her bad habits had changed her. Gwen looked at her face which had gotten much puffier with fuller cheeks and a double chin. She noticed there was some sauce still on her face so she tried to lick off as much as her tongue could reach. Her shirt road up where her distinctly large pot belly was exposed. Just looking at it jut out gave her the impression that she must be somewhere between 25 to 35 lbs overweight. Her black pajamas, once baggy, where now far more form fitting these days. They hugged her wide hips and thick thighs and where covered in finger sized smear marks due to the frequent amount of times Gwen had wiped her fingers off on her pant leg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving finished looking at herself in the mirror Gwen went to the sink to do the bare minimum of freshening up. After brushing her teeth she took her \u201cshower\u201d which was just her wetting her hair and face in the sink. She figured she had taken a shower last week so it wouldn\u2019t be too much of a problem for her if she smelled a little musky. The next part was the only thing she took seriously as she was very adamant about her goth identity. First she carefully applied her teal lipstick, then applied her eyeliner and eyeshadow, and finally walk over to her closet to dressed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen slid her skirt on with some slight trouble. Unlike her pajama bottoms her regular clothes weren\u2019t as elastic around the waistband, leaving her with quite the noticeable muffin top with her belly and love handles hanging out. Her corset wasn\u2019t fitting too well either as the laces on the back couldn\u2019t be tied as tightly as they used to be and like her pajama shirt her corset road up around the belly area. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that she was finally dressed she left her bathroom, got out her tripod and set it beside her bed. She pulled out her phone and ordered a lot of fast food for her prank audition tape. She didn\u2019t intended on actually getting on the show but rather wanted to really repulse the guy running it. Though she had become a lazy couch potato she never intended to be as bad as the people who on reality tv. But just this once she would have to kick things up a notch. \u201cPrepare to eat your heart out McLain.\u201d</span></div></div>",

Yesterday had been one of the best days of his life. He had gotten a kiss from Gwen and she had really opened up to him. He had been thinking about her round face constantly and now had her belching and farting going through his brain as well. He couldnt explain it, but there was just something sexy about seeing Gwen act so crude and natural, like she was completely relaxed around him and not holding back anything. He found himself welcoming her gas and hoping to hear and smell more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOkay, I brought two dozen donuts. I made sure that none of them are coconut just like you Cody began to say as he entered the dressing room, but stopped dead when he saw Gwen. The goth girl was currently lounging on the couch in only her bra and panties. Her undergarments were strained by her new bulk. The sides of her nipples were exposed as they nearly poured out of her bra and her panties had become a thong as her hindquarters stretched them out. Cody nearly dropped the plate of donuts before regaining some semblance of control.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSorry, didnt know you were indecent. Ill leave, he squeaked as he took several steps back, but halted when Gwen looked directly at him with a mischievous smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIts okay, come on in. She waved for him to return and slowly he did. Cody never took his eyes off Gwen, trying to keep his eyes focused on her face, but finding them moving down on their own accord. There was so much of Gwen to see, bulging and wobbling as she sat back up. Her belly stood firm and proudly, although it was all made of fat it didnt sag. He wondered how soft it really was, until he heard Gwen speak and his yes shot back up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhy dont you sit next to me?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nO-ok, Cody nervously stuttered out. Stiffly, he walked over to the couch, sitting as far away from Gwen as possible, but finding her scooting over until her thick, milky thigh was pressed up against his. Swallowing nervously, he weakly smiled at her as she dazzled him with a bright, happy smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI hope you dont mind. My clothes have been getting so tight and all this extra fat is making me so warm. I thought Id try sticking to just my bra and panties. After all the only one that sees me is you and you dont mind, do you?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot at all, Cody lied, trying not to look too uncomfortable about sitting beside the plus sized goth. All that creamy flesh being exposed was making him a little hot under the collar, he wanted to be a gentleman, be polite, but all he wanted to do was ogle Gwen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYoure a sweet guy Cody, but theres something I want to ask you and I want you to be honest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNodding his head, Cody once more tried to focus on Gwens face, but this time was able to as she gave him the sweatiest, most loving smile he had ever seen. She placed her chubby hand on his shoulder and leaned in, her breasts brushing against the side of his arm. Then she asked him a question he was not ready for.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>By: sbbw-lover<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCody was more than happy to feel this request and went out to get her more food he left for about half hour annoying Gwen a bit as she was so hungry but when Cody came back he had dozen carts or more of food and what appeared to be several large barrel kegs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow where did you get all the food and what is with the kegs?\" Gwen asked happy to have food but surprised by how Cody got it all so fast plus was interested in the kegs he brought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah well I know your appetite has been getting bigger so I thought I would have some more food ready as for the kegs they are full of milkshakes long with your appetite you been needing more to drink so got these for you.\" Cody answered only telling half the truth, the whole truth was that since he started feeding Gwen and notice her weight gain he had become very turned on by it. Luckily his parents where scientist and worked on lot of stuff using some of their notes and his own know how he made a special chemical that would help increase her appetite and used it to coat her food in it. The milkshakes where also not really milkshakes but weight gain shakes mixed with a bit of a formula that would make it easier and faster for her body to turn what she eats into fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow thanks Cody your the best. But how could you afford all this?\" She said smiling before asking curious how he could keep bring all this food and stuff<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my parts are scientist and really rich. I only came on the show to meet people and hot chicks as you probably can tell I don't make friends so well.\" Cody answered her first question and seeing her confused look explained more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah I see well Cody just so you know you have made one friend today thanks so much for everything you've done for me even though in the past I wasn't so friendly to you, you still treat me well I don't know if I deserve it but thanks.\" She said smiling so happy to have Cody's help and all even though not nice to him, he was always their for her and he made her really happy she was even started to fall for him<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Always Gwen your my friend and someone I care for dearly I will always be their for you. Anyway lets not let the food get to waste right.\" He said smiling back and than added that<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen nodding before digging into the first cart of food shoving a large burrito into her mouth getting sauce and beans all over her face and some dripping on to her shirt but she didn't seem to mind as she shoved more into her mouth. Once done with the burrito she grabbed a burger and shoved that into her mouth biting half of that off and barely chewed on it before shoving a slice of pie into her mouth. She continued to shove more food into her mouth for another ten minutes before grabbing the first keg of weight gain shake she took the little hose attached to it a bit different than normal ones you would see as it was much bigger and wider since design to release something thicker than beer. She put the hose in her mouth before pressing the button to release the milkshake which she was more than happy to chug on. As she chugged Cody watched and saw his special shake was doing it's job and much better than he though as she could see that her body was actually starting to grow before him not fast but a nice pace she saw her stomach getting slightly larger, her arms and legs thickening and making the fabric she wore get titter even her breast where starting to grow. He smiled so much as he watched her pig out of the next three hours eating and drinking the shake by the time she was finished all the carts where cleaned off of all food even crumbles and the kegs laid on their sides empty as on the couch that seemed to have gotten small was a now much larger Gwen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom all the eating and the weight gain shakes her body had gotten much larger than it was her stomach was now half the size bigger than a beach ball and stood about three feet in front of her. Her ass would put LeShawna to shame now as it almost was the size of a beach ball it had ripped her skirt right off and her panties where more a thong compared to the large rear and even they didn't look like the would hold much longer, even her pussy was fatter now as body could see the lips of it which seemed to be slightly wet and soaking the front of her panties. Her hips pushed to about two feet on each side and her thighs touched and rubbed against each other, her beast where about at least a cup size or two large than Lindsay now which was saying something. Her hand was much chubby and her fingers looked like fatten up sausages, her arms where at least a foot think of fat which jiggled every time moved and she now sported three and half chins and chubby cheeks that looked to have two or three golf balls in them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow Gwen you where really hungry huh.\" Cody said rubbing her belly for her, and a bit for himself as he was getting very turned on as he could feel his pants getting tighter<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...ppptttt....yeah can't believe....ffppptt....I finished it all....fffftttt....but I feel so good now....pppffff...and stuffed.\" She said happily moaning and farting as Cody rubs her stomach<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked at him smiling a bit happy with all the help and support he has given her the last few weeks she than looked down she notice the bulge in his pants making her smirk a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I see Cody seems to be turned on by my fat body well can't blame him I kinda am too and from stuffing myself silly who knew that could be such a turn on' Gwen thought to herself smirking before looking at her large gut<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was true to over the week she wasn't just eating because of hunger and cause of guilt and all, ok well it started out like that but after few days she was slowly liking the feelings of stuffing herself and that soon turned to be a turn on. Over the weeks she found she loved it and getting bigger and now she could see that Cody loved it to and thinking about all the time of him helping her and plus realizing he wasn't bad looking that she should give him a nice reward for all his help and finding her fat gassy body attractive when other men wouldn't.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Cody.\" Gwen said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah Gwen\" Cody drawing his attention from the large stomach to the goth girls face and...? </span></div></div>",

She pulled back happy to finally do that after so long. It was a lot better than she expected as well. For Cody this was a dream come and made his bulge bigger. He blushed and asked, \"Not that I hated that but why did you kiss me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen smiled and said, \"Because I wanted to do that for so long. I appreciate all the work you've done for me Cody and I can't thank you enough for saving me weeks ago and making me so fat. I'm sure it hasn't been easy taking care of a fat ass like me but I do appreciate. I used to think you were just into me because of my looks but now I see you really do care and are the sweetest guy I've ever met. It makes me kinda glad that Trent and I broke up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCody rubbed the back of his neck and smiled, a little shy having the girl of his dreams tell him that. \"Thanks Gwen. Though to be fair, part of is still doing this for your body no matter how big it gets but whatever size you are I'll always be there for you.\" He said flashing his usual toothy grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe loved seeing him smile like that. It just seemed so natural. It was just another part of him that she loved. He was caring, sweet, considerate, handsome, and....and....and.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Cody. Come here you.\" She said before pulling him onto her belly and kissing him again. This time she slipped her tongue into his mouth and started frenching him like crazy. She had been sexually pent up for weeks and with Cody being the only boy interested in her Gwen wanted him so bad. His body was pressed against her as she wrapped her arms around him. At first he was in shock and did nothing but he adjusted and put his arms around her flabby neck. Giving in he met his tongue with hers and the two wrestled with their mouths. His bulge was pressing against her belly fat as Cody grabbed as much of her fat as he could while kissing her. He pulled away and gasped for air. At first Gwen worried something was wrong but then Cody said, \"Gwen....I want you so bad....\". The goth grinned and said, \"Then go for it stud.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was music to Cody's ears. He slid off momentarily to strip down while she did the same. He kicked away the shakes littered on the ground, threw his shirt to the ground, and kicked off his underwear and pants. Gwen had trouble getting her tiny top over her massive boobs. Cody helped her take it off and let her view his manhood. She gasped at the sight of his seven inch rod and how big it was. She had honestly expected it to be smaller but this was perfect. It stood erect as her breasts hung low in front of her. Cody wasn't sure if it was big enough and a little nervous. \"I have to admit Gwen, this is my first time doing this so...\" She put her finger against his lips to silence him. \"Me too. Just do what comes naturally.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time Cody kissed her and the two started to passionately kiss as his rock hard dick prodded her gut. She fell backwards and he landed on top with his head landing on her right breast. He took a second before raising it and staring at how beautiful Gwen was. He still couldn't believe he was about to have his first time with the girl of his dreams. Cody lifted up Gwen's belly and found her cunt under several rolls of fat. Cody gazed into her eyes as he slid his rod into her slit, both of them groaning in pleasure and pain. She was very tight and her belly fat was pressing down on his member. However neither planned on quitting now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe forced his member in deeper as Gwen moaned with passion. He slid back and got into the rhythm as he pounded his penis into her. He grunted as he forced himself in while trying to deal with the amount of pressure her belly was putting on him. It didn't derail his pleasure. Cody grabbed her boobs not only for support but also he could grope them during this experience and make it even better. Both parties enjoyed it and were moaning with delight. His dick throbbed as he was now balls deep in her tight slit. His tip had reached her G-spot and by now Gwen's eyes were rolling into the back of her head. She couldn't handle much more of this. Her pussy was already starting to drip. At the same time beads of precum were forming at his bulb ready to unload.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally she climaxed and cried out as she coated his dick with her juices. Cody kept thrusting a good ten seconds after she came before climaxing as well, filling her with his seed and doing his best to keep going. When he stopped filling her he paused and slowly slid is dick out which was now flacid. He collapsed onto her belly and rested his head on her breasts. They had made a small mess on the floor but neither worried about it. \"Oh Cody.....that was amazing.\" He could feel her chest rise and fall as he looked up at her and smiled. \"Gwen....I love you....\" Hearing him said that left her speechless for a moment. Finally she said, \"I love you too.\" He had longed to hear those words for so long and hearing them was like music to his ears. The two laid there for sometime before Cody got up and got redressed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen Gwen....I've been thinking. About us...\" Cody started. Gwen had a feeling she knew where this was going. \"I think I know where this is going and yes I do want to date you. I didn't just fuck you for laughs.\" Cody chuckled but was thrilled to hear that. \"Actually I was thinking....maybe you should come out of this room and show the world how big you've gotten.\" Hearing this made Gwen not so good. She was a little worried actually. \"Look I know you're nervous but you can't stay in here forever. Plus if you get bigger you'll outgrow this entire room. While seeing you that big is extremely hot, people are going to find out.\" Gwen had almost forgotten about why she was hiding in the first place and scared about how people would react. Especially her friends. \"I don't know Cody. I'm not sure I can handle it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCody had a feeling she would say this. \"Alright, but would you consider at least showing a couple of your friends? I'm sure they won't mind once they see how happy it makes you. Plus, it would mean more people to feed and care for you.\" He added. Even though Cody was a caring helper, he could only do so much work. A couple more friends could help but still. Gwen sighed and made her decision. </span></div></div>",

She also noticed the dweeb Cody wasn't around much she would see him from time to time but not for long as he seemed to rush off some where. It took some time (i.e. torturing Harold) to find out that Gwen hadn't left her room for days and seemed Cody was taking care of her. That it self put a huge smile on her face she figured and learned from Harold that Gwen felt guilty about how she treated Trent and didn't want to see anyone and after time Cody started to check up and take care of her. Even though already feeling great with what she learned she wanted to feel even better and roll in Gwen's sorrow even more so decided to go see the goth queen, she was excepting maybe red eyes and mascara running down her face from crying while to week to get out of bed while Cody picked up the place.

It took her a few moments to realize she fall on Gwen and her mouth that was wide open was now on the goth girls right breast with the nipple in her mouth as she could feel it with her tongue as it unconsciously started to lick it making the girl moan. Slowly getting out of her shock and stupor she tried to herself off the goth body but Heathers body was partly already been sucked into the goth fat, not just able to lift off she used her hands to grab on to something to help push her off. The only thing though was that obese body she was on so she placed her left hand on Gwen's large rear and the other hand on Gwen's left breast not really paying attention where her hands went. She also didn't seem to lift her head off or have her mouth let go of Gwen's breast while her tongue seemed to still be licking the nipple without her knowledge or awareness. Once her hands where placed she gripped the fat her hands where on and tried to push off, but by doing this just pleased Gwen's body making her moan more, Heather seemed not to notice the moans just focus on trying to get off the fat girl moving her body a lot against Gwen's while keeping her grip strong, while also struggling Heather started to breath out since not through her mouth but her nose this caused her mouth to stuck on Gwen's large tit adding to the girls pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh god Heather stop...oooh you have to stop....I....ooooh...I...I'm....uuuaaahhhh.\" Gwen tries to say while moaning but couldn't as she hit her climax but instead of cumming her right breast released shoots of milk into Heathers mouth this shocked the girl as milk was starting to feel her mouth this shock seemed to give her what she need to push herself off Gwen's body. But she pushed herself so hard she stumbled backwards until she fall on her ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ppllttt...What the hell you disgusting freak are you lactating god and you got it all in my mouth what is wrong with you that stuff is just so...so...so wonderful.\" Heather started to spit some of the milk that collected in her mouth while whipping her lips and smacking her lips together as if to get the taste out. But after a bit her taste buds started to have a strange tingling sensation before the taste hit her, and all her life Heather has always had the best everything including food and she had tasting many amazing foods from all over the world but for some odd reason those things where beat by what she was tasting now, and strange enough that great taste came from the milk that she got from Gwen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCody and Gwen where looking at Heather strange well more Cody was curious about everything as to way Gwen was lactating as he knew usually only pregnant women did that and he was sure Gwen wasn't pregnant. This lead him to think that this might be a effect from the stuff he put in the weight gain shake which he would have to look into later, Gwen was also curious by her lactating as well but would think on that later her mind was still on a slight pleasure high from what happened. Now both weren't to surprise by Heather been upset but where surprise what she said at the end and more when Heather who seemed to want more of the milk jump back on Gwen and started to suck on Gwen's right nipple this time harder to get the milk out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOoooaahh....Heather....w.....w....what are you dooooooing\" Gwen moans out in pleasure as more milk released from her nipple into the queen bee's mouth who was sucking it down as if nectar from the gods, which at the moment to her was<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCody was just so shocked by this all first Gwen lactating and Heather who seemed to love it and was on the goth girl groping her fat body while sucking down the milk if it was possible his pants where becoming much tighter now seeing this. He got a bigger surprise when he notice that Heather was starting to grow fatter, at first he thought his eyes where playing tricks on him but he soon realized they weren't and that Heather was in fact growing fatter. It was hard to tell as it was going slowly but after a bit it was easy to tell as her stomach was starting to go over her waist bands, her legs seemed thicker, and even her face was filling in more. But as she grew it seemed to be picking up as he could see the grew more easier like dough starting to rise, her tight short shorts where growing even tighter as he seen that small rips where starting to happen, and her shirt was growing tighter around her breast stomach as they grew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she gained a hundred pounds her shorts and shirt reach their limit and ripped off her body and went to the ground the parts that could the others where stuck between her and Gwen's fat body. Cody was only more turned on by this and just kept watching amazed by this and figured the fattening milk was another another side effect a nice one he liked. After another fifty pounds her bra and panties snapped off and her body was still going larger as she drank the milk after she finished with the right she immediately switched to Gwen's left breast and started to drink that milk. This continued for hour and half before Heather had drained both of Gwen's breast of all milk when she was done Heather was...? </span></div></div>",

As both her breast and ass seemed to be about beach ball size with her stomach half that size sticking out only about two feet, her hips where also much wider looking to be about three maybe four feet out. her arms where just as fat as Gwen's and her cheeks and chin where about the same as goth girls as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Wow who knew that the formula I develop for the weight gain shakes would not only work so well would also make the user produce milk that is also just as fattening if not better' Cody said smirking as he looked down at the heavy Asian girl who after drinking all Gwen's milk was laying down on her back on the ground, actually she was laying on a table but the table not able to support her had broken and was now nothing more than kindling under her bulk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh that was so good I want more...I want lots more please give me more\" Heather begged out with a pleading look<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Hmmm it seems to also be very addicting as well I think I can use this to my advantage' Cody thought smirking more<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh we will Heather but right now you drained Gwen it will take some time before she has more for you in the meantime I can give you plenty of food if you like.\" Cody said smiling as he got closer to the queen bee rubbing her stomach with one of his hands while groping her breast a bit. To feel how fat and to see if she had any milk herself and from the feeling he got, he also got to see Heather didn't care that he was touching her as she let out small moans from his touch instead of yelling at him to let go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooh...that sounds good I am very hungry.\" She moaned out, Gwen you come to out of her pleasure high was a bit confused and jealous of the scene she was seeing of Cody groping Heather's body feeling that he should be doing that to her or that she could at least get to grope Heathers fat body as well<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok I will give you food and even more milk later but you have to promise and swear to me mine and Gwen's slave girl that you will do anything that we tell you and we get to do anything we want with you understood.\" Cody said smirking like a business man who was making the deal of a life time, Gwen hearing this couldn't help be shocked and impress by what Cody was doing he was taking a woman who seemed now addicting to the milk Gwen was producing to make into their slave to have sex with or do what ever either of them wanted her to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Wow who thought Cody would have it in him to do such a thing. I deftly see him in a whole new light a very attractive light oh I can't wait to show him how turned on I am and can't wait to start having Heather as my little....while my fat little bitch.' Gwen thought smirking as she licked her lips as she looked at Cody and Heather thinking of all the fun she was going to have especial Heather who had made her life hell in first session was now going to pay for it in so many ways.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes I will do anything, anything you two want I swear to be your slave from now on as long as you feed me and give me delicious milk\" Heather nodded out sounding more needy<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good to hear Heather are fat piggy.\" Cody said smirking as he looked at a as pleasing and smirking Gwen<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two than decided to...? </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>By: sbbw-lover<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly a new idea popped into Cody's head why stop at fattening just Heather their many other girls on the show plenty of them very good looking and would be even better looking with some fat themselves and best of all with how addicting the milk was he could make them all his and Gwen's slaves for plenty of fun. It would also be easier to make them fatter as well now that not only did he have Gwen but Heather who breast where even bigger so would probably produce more milk to help with the fattening of the other girls. But he first needed to see if Gwen would be ok with this he knew she was fine with Heather as Heather and her had rivalry and didn't care much for the other so making Heather like this was more than fine but he knew Gwen was friends with some of the other girls so she might not want to fatten them up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Gwen may I propose a idea to you.\" Cody said smiling, Gwen could see the gears turning in his mind to a plan curious she nodded to him to go on<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now that we know you produce a fattening milk and I'm sure Heather does as now from what I felt. Why don't we share this with the other girls here on the show.\" Cody said smirking once more<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean use mine and Heather's milk to make the girls as fat as us.\" Gwen asked while Cody nodded<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen thought about the suggestions, looking at Heather as she did, she had to admit seeing Heather all fatten up into a huge obese woman did turn her on a bit Gwen had always been experimental type and been with a few women in her past not that anyone really knew that. Now she never been with a fat one but seeing Heather's fat body turned her on more than anything she wanted to just go and play with the queen bee's fat touching and groping, and even rubbing against it just made her wet, and the idea of Cody even joining in that fun made her wet more. Than she thought of the other girls like Lindsay, Izzy, even Eva as big obese women like her and Heather or even bigger than them, all those girls as big fat blobs of fat, her was really starting to get horny from that though she could already feel her womanhood been soaked by her juices she would need Cody or Heather or both to take care of her needs soon. But she pushed that away as she thought more about Cody's idea it was good but her mind went to some of the other girls namely Bridgette and Leshawna her two best friends on the show. Could she really fatten them up as well they where always so nice and good to her, but than she remembered how they where when she got voted off the second season they gave her the cold shoulder and glares for what she did to Trent, she knew she was wrong with what she did but they didn't have to be so cold. It was because of those looks that made her hide out here and made her almost starve herself to death if not for Cody and even though from that she found something so new and great she wanted to make them pay for treating her poorly and decided they would get fatten up as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah Cody lets do that lets fatten them all up. But how should we do it are we going to fatten them up one by one or all together?\" Gwen said smirking before asking a very important and good question<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCody though about it now the one on one was good it would let him fat up each girl up to Gwen in Heather size easily but he would have to wait in between to let Gwen and Heather to replenish their milk. But than again with each new fat girl he would get more milk to speed it up but still he would have to think up new lies to get each girl to the room plus would need a bigger room eventually and was sure someone would notice the girls missing and find out what he was up to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile fattening them all up at the same time would take much longer before they where to Gwen and Heather's size and didn't know how long it would take before any of them where producing their own milk. But fattening them all up at the same time would make it impossible for anyone to stop it after all Heather just having a small amount made her addicted so it would make the same and he was sure the milk would also help increase their appetite and eat more and convert it to fat quicker than normal. It would also give him the time to find a bigger room and make them his.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter weighting each option and figuring which would be best he went with? </span></div></div>",

First, he would have to get each girl to drink some of Gwen's milk. Cody hadn't figured yet how he would do it but right now he was focused on getting the milk. He left Gwen and Heather alone to find the janitor's closet and steal some buckets. He returned quickly and found Heather playing with her fat and Gwen rubbing her nipples because they were a little sore from Heather sucking on them and also to pleasure herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh Gwen? Not to spoil your moment, but mind if I get some milk?\" Cody asked awekwardly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go ahead.\" Gwen said. \"Milk away.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCody never thought he'd ever hear those words but was glad to hear it. Gwen managed to roll onto her side and let her gigantic breasts dangle over the side of the couch. Cody was entranced by them and wanted to play with them but restrained himself and focused on the objective. He carefully clutched his hands around Gwen's nipple and squeezed. Milk squirted out into one of the buckets as Cody and Gwen both groaned in pleasure. Cody continued to tug and milk Gwen to fill up the buckets he had as if she were a cow. The two fought the urge to moan passionately. Cody enjoyed having his hands on Gwen's mammaries and Gwen savored the sensation of having her breasts squeezed and the milk spraying out. Cody made sure to switch between each breast and to change the buckets before they overfilled Heather watched this and wanted to gulp down the buckets of milk. In fact a part of her wanted to see if she could produce milk as well. The three were getting turned on by the milking and couldn't get enough. Eventually, Cody managed to fill 8 buckets with Gwen's milk before Cody milked her dry. He couldn't believe how fast Gwen was able to make milk and how much he enjoyed it. By the look on Gwen'sface, he could tell she enjoyed it much more than he did. He rubbed her boobs gracefully that made Gwen sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How was it Gwen?\" Cody asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wonderful. You're hands were so gentle.\" Gwen moaned. \"Definitely better than when Heather was sucking me dry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!\" Heather said defensively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Glad to hear you enjoyed it.\" Cody said. \"I'll go get you and Heather some food before I try and get the other girls to drink this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks.\" Gwen said. She pulled Cody in for a long kiss and then released him. Heather felt a little jealous and left out as she watched the two kiss. Cody left and returned with another cart of food for the two girls. He noticed that the room was also getting too small for them and made a note to try and find a new place for them to stay. Cody retrieved the buckets and went to go find some girls to drink Gwen's milk. Since all the girls there were all apart of the Aftermath show, he decided that he would start with some girls that he could fatten and no one would notice. He decided to start with.... </span></div></div>",

However there was just one problem: she was starving. Lately she had been trying to get a job, but she kept messing up and getting fired. Plus, she had been going on a diet and trying to get thinner, and would kill for a hamburger. She clutched her stomach as it growled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGRGRGRGRGRGRLLLL!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOwww, my tummy hurts.\u201d She moaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, she saw a bright flashes coming from a building. Curious, she went into the building and saw a bunch of beautiful models and a photographer taking pictures of one. Lindsay entered and asked one of the models, \u201cUm, excuse me? What\u2019s this line for?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c*Scoff* This is a line to audition for a new modeling agency.

Before Lindsay could say a word, she smelled something. She followed it to the crafts table, which had tons of food. It had pizza, chips, salsa, hot dogs, punch, cocktail weenies, etc. Lindsay noticed no one had even tried to eat anything, and decided it wouldn\u2019t hurt to have a chip. As soon as it entered her mouth, Lindsay\u2019s eyes bulged out in surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh my gosh, this is delicious!\u201d she said. \u201cOh wait! My diet.

She loved stuffing her face after dieting for so long. She started grabbing cups of punch and chugging it down while grabbing a hot dog. While she ate, the other models looked away in disgust, as they each got called in to audition. After about an hour<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNEXT!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLindsay rubbed some grease from her face and looked up. Most of the models had left, and she figured she was next. But then, she looked down at herself and gasps when she realizes that she had gained some weight. It wasnt much, but Lindsay had managed to regain the weight from TDI and more. Her hips had grown a little, her butt was bigger, and she had gotten a baby bump.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh no! Im ruined. She moaned. Now what do I- wait!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLindsay took a deep breath and sucked in her gut, hoping that she could still pass the audition. Lindsay strutted into a room where two women were judging the models. One had a French accent, black hair, a slim build, big boobs, and black and white dress, and stunning looks. The other was blonde, was very fat, a huge gut, flabby arms, a pink dress, and a cheese burger. Lindsay tried not to show her new gut and waited for their approval.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHello, Im Helen, and this is my associate Lyla. Said the French women. Are you ready to audition?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLindsay nodded and tried not breathe out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGood, now just go into the next room and youll find a new outfit were making. If you can look good in it, then well hire you. Said Lyla.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLindsay quickly rushed into the room and exhaled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Gasp* Much better. She sighed. She looked around the room and found a cute purple bathing suit and bra and put them on. The bra fit her perfectly, unlike her other bras which were too small, but the bathing suit was a little big. She shrugged and just put them on. When she got out, she sucked in her gut and went back outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLets see what we got. Said Lyla. The two watched Lindsay pose for a little, and after awhile finally responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was very nice, but youre just not what were looking for. Said Lyla.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWHAT!? exclaimed Lindsay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she said that, she accidentally exposed her gut and blushed in embarrassment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhoops. I might have overdone it at the craft-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPFFFFFFFRRRRRRTT!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe blushed harder as she let out a ripe fart. Lindsay thought she would die of embarrassment when suddenly<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn second thought, we might have a place for you after all. Said Lyla.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReally? Lindsay asked hopefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI agree. All we need you to do before we make you into a famous model is one thing. Said Helen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat is it?

Her stomach rose as she inhaled and slept peacefully. She had stayed up very late the other night and really needed to get some much needed sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPRRFFFFFFFFFFFFRRRRTT!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBridgette farted in her sleep, a habit she had started ever since she and Geoff moved in together. When the two finished high school and discovered that their colleges weren't far apart, the two decided to live together in an apartment. They were pleased to find out that the apartment was very big and roomy and very cheap. probably because the landlord was a huge fan of TDI. At first Bridgette thought it would be like seeing what being married to Geoff would be like and at first, it was perfect. Then Geoff started having parties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhenever the two weren't hosting the Aftermath show or doing homework, Geoff would throw wild parties. He'd call as many people as he knew from college or from Total Drama, order a ton of junk food, and blast loud music and start to party. Bridgette didn't mind the parties because she knew Geoff liked to party, and so did she. During the parties, she'd meet other surfers, practice her dance moves, catch up with the cast mates, or have make-out sessions with Geoff. However most of the time, she would go on a feeding frenzy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeoff always bought the unhealthiest, fattening, carb-filled junk food he could find that no one could resist. Although Geoff could make amazing pasta, he usually spent their grocery money and junk food for parties, whether he had one planned or not so Bridgette had no choice but to have junk food for almost every meal. Not to mention that with the free time that would have been used to cook healthy meals, they had more time to do homework, plan new parties, but mostly make out. Bridgette usually had some self-control when it came to eating junk food and sometimes would go out just to have a salad or something, but during Geoff's parties she lost it. Bridgette was usually forced to eat a lot during the parties because the food usually ran out pretty quickly. As a result, people knew her as a party glutton.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMost of the time at the parties, people would start chanting \"chug, chug, chug\" or \"eat, eat, eat\" or spout other encouraging phrases that turned Bridgette's light snack into a buffet. Plus, she was always encouraged to participate in eating challenges whenever there was one. Bridgette couldn't help herself because she liked it when people started to cheer her on when she stuffed her face or let out some loud gas, be it from the mouth or butt. Either way, when she woke up the next morning she felt some regret.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy now it was 10:30 in the morning and the smell of her gas irritated Bridgette as she slept. She rolled over in her sleep and accidentally fell off the couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBOOF!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBridgette hit the floor hard and woke up instantly. She moaned as she rubbed her head and gradually got up. \"Oohhhhh, my head.\" she muttered as her eyes adjusted to the light and her headache got better. Her stomach gurgled as it digested the enormous amount of food she ate last night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPFFFFFFFFRRRRRRRRRRRTTTTTTT!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer ass spewed more of her fumes loudly. She rubbed her upset stomach and noticed that it grew recently. She went into the bathroom and saw herself in the mirror. From partying so much, Bridgette was over 200 pounds. Her B-cups were now C-cups, her hips were twice as large and her ass half as big as Owen's. She poked her stomach and watched it wobble and make her look like a nine-month pregnant woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBridgette had noticed her recent rise in size and had a feeling they were caused by Geoff's parties, but now she was convinced. She realized that if she kept this up she'd be bigger than Owen eventually. She pulled her shirt down, or tried to so she could cover her belly, and decided....<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You could plan an epic party all by yourself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah but I need my party queen.\" He said sitting down next to herself and placing his arm around her shoulder.

Bridgette was tempted to take him right there and go on a major make-out session but resisted her urges.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know but this isn't about looks. I'm just concerned that this isn't healthy. I don't want to be some diabetic blob that could have a heart attack when we kiss.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeoff hated partying without his girl but he understood. \"Alright, but until then we get to make out twice as much.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe giggled and said, \"Deal.\" The two kissed and started cleaning up the place. When it was time for Geoff to go to his next party, Bridgette stayed behind and tried to take it easy. It wasn't going to be easy since the house was stocked with junk food so she needed to go out and get some exercise by going to the beach or maybe hook up with some of her friends from Total Drama. She hadn't seen Gwen and Leshawna for a while; the two could help her diet. In the end, she decided on what to do.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She was skeptical about going to the home of the biggest Total Drama fan, but if anyone knew what fans liked it was her. She knocked on the door and Sierra answered. Shortly after, she screamed and fainted at the sight of Leshawna. Leshawna groaned and went inside Sierra's house and dragged the fan girl to her room and waited for her to wake up. Leshawna felt uneasy seeing a shrine of Cody in Sierra's room and was tempted to leave now but she stayed strong and waited until Sierra came to her senses. After half an hour, Sierra came to but still light headed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whu-huh? I had the stranggest dream. Leshawna was at my house and I-\" Sierra muttered. She then saw Leshawna in front of her and was about to faint again but Leshawna caught her and covered her mouth before she screamed again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold on there, fan girl. I'm not waiting for you to wake up again.\" Leshawna stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSierra recomposed herself and said, \"Sorry, it's just you're the first Total Drama contestant to come to my house. This is the greatest day of my life.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, well I actually came here to talk to you about something. You see, I've found out that a lot of my fans want me to get fatter and I'm not sure whether or not I should.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're asking me for advice?\" Sierra asked in disbelief. \"If only Cody were here this would be perfect.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, I just want to know what you think. Since you know what the fans of the show like, I want to know if people really want me to pack on the pounds.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course they do. A lot of your fans want to see you bigger. You're an inspiration to people who are self-conscious about their weight and goddess to people attracted to your 'bigger' body parts. Naturally, they'd love to see you gain some weight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? Well then maybe I should. It wouldn't hurt to expand myself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you want, I could help you gain weight and track the responses from your fans so that you'll know how they feel.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh wow, thanks.

I've been dying to show my cooking skills.\" Sierra begged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you insist. Mind if I watch TV while I wait.\" Leshawna asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Be my guest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeshawna found something to watch while Sierra got to work on the food. For the next two hours she cooked a feast that would normally serve more than one person. For Leshawna it was worth it. Leshawna didn't bother checking on Sierra because she thought it was just a simple dinner like spaghetti or something but it was much more than that. When it finally came time to eat, Leshawna glanced at the table and was shocked to see the amount of food Sierra made. It was a four-course meal with lasagna, a tray of hamburgers, ribs, chili, and three tubs of ice cream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dang girl, you made all of this?\" Leshawna said with astonishment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep. I took some cooking classes hoping to lure Cody with my cooking so that he would fall in love with me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeshawna tried not to look too freaked out and took a seat. She piled the food onto her plate and started chowing down. From the first mouthful of lasagna the bootylicious girl was overwhelmed by flavors. If Sierra planned to use this food to make Cody fall for her, she would actually have a chance of doing it. She stuffed her maw with cheesy, meaty goodness while tearing into the greasy burgers that tasted even better. She hurried through the lasagna quickly so she could get her hands on the ribs and burgers. Her hands were getting sticky with barbecue sauce but she easily licked it off. She drank some soda and continued her meal while Sierra watched and secretly taped it for her blog. Of course Sierra would ask Leshawna later on if it was okay but for now just sat back and took in the spectacle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeshawna had seemed to lose all control of herself. For some reason she couldn't stop eating. The food was just so good that she didn't want the taste to leave her mouth so she had to constantly fill it. She tossed some rib bones that were removed of meat and squirted ketchup on her burgers before moving onto the chili. Not bothering with a spoon she tipped the bowl over and let the brown goop pour into her mouth as she gulped down gallon after gallon and munched on the beans. By the time she finished she was getting pretty full and rather gassy as shown by a rather loud fart that made her blush. Finally she moved onto the ice cream. She grabbed an ice cream scoop and emptied the contents into her maw. She would let out a fart now and then though Sierra didn't mind. As long as it came from a Total Drama contestant she was okay with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time she finished her stomach had grown largely and she couldn't cover her belly button up with her shirt as a result. Leshawna liked the results so far still expelled some pent up gas via burping or farting. She didn't give a damn about how this would affect her health, she was loving this more than she thought and could see why people wanted her to be fat. Leshawna couldn't wait to get bigger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enjoy your meal?\" Sierra asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeshawna nearly forgot Sierra and took her hand off of her belly.. \"Yeah girl, you are a fine cook. You're giving DJ a run for his money.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSierra blushed and said, \"Oh stop, I'm not that good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's true.\" She said. Before she could say more another fart blasted out of her that embarrassed her. \"I uh better get going before I stink up your place.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure? You seem pretty out of it.\" It was true, Leshawna was exhausted from eating so much and still full. \"If you want you could spend the night here with me. I'll make you breakfast too.\" Leshawna was tempted to see how good Sierra was at making waffles but it felt weird staying in the home of an uber fan like Sierra's. Leshawna decided to.... </span></div></div>",

They went wide-mouthed when they saw the inside. The lobby had brown walls, a blue rug, and a reception table with a woman near the front desk. She was about 6 feet tall, very skinny, had a white dress on, black hair in a bun, and seemed very nice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAh, you must be the Total Drama girls.

Next, we have an all-you-can eat buffet, made by our best chefs to provide 5-star rating food. Finally, we have aromatherapy, which is whereyou will be exposed to the most exotic aromas as you listen to calm music. Said Melanie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWow! That sounds to good to be true.

Melanie asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNormally Chris doesnt give something this good unless theres some sort of unwanted side effect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, the only thing I can think of is that the spa does tend to make the guest lazy, the food is a bit addictive and possibly fattening, and the aromatherapy can cause the body to expunge other scents and gases from the body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter rethinking, Leshawna chose the.</span></div></div>",

Leshana found herself looking in a dark cave. As she wandered through it, she saw a figure moving. Walking closer, she realized it was... </span></div></div>",

This comment pierced Leshana's thick skin, striking a nerve.\" So what if I have a big butt.\" She said,\" At least I'm not some spoiled, bossy pain in the butt like you.\"<br>\r\n\"What? How dare you. You may act tough now, but we both know how humiliated you were when I took your clothes. You know as well as I do that your ashamed of that disgusting, flabby body.\" Heather said. This comment hit Leshana even harder than the last. Rather then feeling angry, she began to feel depressed. Her stomach growled loudly which made her feel even worse because she knew that's what got her into this mess. \"Aww, is the fat piggy hungry. Does she need to fill her greedy gut.\" Heather said mocking Leshana. The poor woman clutched her stomach. She needed to eat something to calm herself down but there was nothing around. As her hunger got the better of her, everything started to look edible to Leshana. \"Tasty sausage.\"the plump woman groaned as she looked at heather. With a surprising burst of speed, she talked the mean girl to the ground. She took a large bite out of the costume and swallowed the fabric. With her stomach demanding more, Leshana opened wide, stuffing the top of the costume into her mouth. With a powerful swallow, she managed to pull Heather's head into her open maw. Surprisingly, her jaw stretched, allowing her to swallow more of the skinny girl. Leshana was in a trance like state as she spent the next ten minutes gulping down Heather. As more and more of the girl was consumed, Leshana's belly grew larger. Her shirt was strained as it tried to contain her ever expanding stomach. With the last swallow, it tore, splitting down the middle. Laying atop her enormous belly, Leshana finally felt satisfied. As she came out of the trance, she looked down at her stomach. \"What on Earth!?!\" She screamed as she that her belly was now as large as she was. She could hear muffled cries for help coming from her belly and could see the outline of heather's body through her taught tummy. \"Oh my word. I I didn't mean to.\" She stammered as the realization that she just ate someone sunk in. \"How is this even possible?\" She thought. Suddenly she heard a something.

Her belly had turned heather into nothing but a soupy mix in her belly an another layer of fat on her already thick figure. Her clothes felt snug and she looked as if she gained 50lbs. Her belly was large, round and sloshed loudly with what was still waiting to be absorbed. It stuck out a foot an a half and hung over the waist of her extremely tight jeans. Her butt and hips had always been large, but now it looked like she was trying to keep two basketballs in the back of her jeans. There were small tears in them as her now super tight pants struggled to stay on. They clung to her fat thighs like a second skin. Her breasts finished tearing her shirt, which had fallen off while she slept. Only her bra was left to cover her breasts. It dug in deeply as it tried to support her huge boobs. Each one was as big as her head if not a bit larger. She groggily got up and rubbed her belly. \" Looks like Heather finally got what she deserved. \" She thought to herself,\" Serves her right. She should be glad I put her to better use making my body even sexier. Hmm, I bet I could win the money by eating the others. It will also make me even sexier as each one of those pathetic losers adds to my beauty.\" As the plump girl returned to camp, she didn't realize that when she ate Heather, she also got part of her personality. A large part to be exact. When she finally made it to the cabins, Lewshana noticed everyone was asleep. She snuck into the girls' cabin and looked at her fellow competitors. \"Hmm, should I eat one of these weaklings now or later?\" She thought to herself. </span></div></div>",

Laying there, she looked at some of the girls in the cabin, trying to decide who to eat next. Soon she fell asleep.

As the gassy girl was recovering from her belch, Gwen froze as she saw what looked like Heather's top. It was covered in spit and seemed to be partially digested.\"Leshawna, please tell me that didn't come out of you.\" Gwen said as she was filled with fear. Knowing that Gwen knew too much, Leshawna pounced on her, knocking her to the floor. \"Oh I'm going to enjoy this.\"Leshawna said as she shoved Gwen's head into her mouth. Gwen started to struggle, but Leshawna grabbed her flaying arms and quickly began gulping her down. Lindsey stood there watching, trying to figure out what was going on. By the time Leshawna was slurping down Gwen's feet, Lindsey figured out that Leshawna had eaten Gwen. She stared at Leshawna, watching as she sat up and stroked her massive belly.\"Mmm, serves you right goth girl.\"Leshawna said as she enjoyed the feeling of Gwen struggling in her stomach.

Beth seemed to be eating the least and had \"grown\" less than the others, Leshawna and Lindsay had the biggest boobs, Leshawna had the biggest butt, and Gwen had the biggest belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNormally, the girls would have noticed their abnormal weight gains, but none of them did. Beth never really noticed, Lindsay was too dumb too notice, Izzy was crazy, Leshawna was used to having extra weight, and Beth was still felt gulty about breaking up with Trent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey had just finished the War movie challenge and were getting their Breakfast. The girls chowed down like they haven't eaten in days. except for Gwen who ate to help her depression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey guys *urrrrrrrrpp* where's Heather?\" Izzy asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She slept in. WHich is good because more food for us.\" Leshawna said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if on cue, Heather walked in to get Breakfast<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

So once she was addicted to the food she need lots of it always trying to get more then the other girls and because of this she became by far the biggest girl of them all with pair of basketball size asscheeks like Leshawna's with huge hips to make her shorts look like thongs. Her beast where as large as Lindsay making her shirt more of a bra though didn't help that her belly was slightly bigger then Gwens making it almost the size of a beachball so it pushed her shirt up. She out of the girls had three chins instead of two and cheeks looked to be holding three golfballs in each one. She out of all the girls was also the gassies as the food not only made the girls big but slightly gassy but not as bad as Heather who was gaven her own trailer as the other girls couldn't stand her gas. That and she took up alot of room in the trailer by herself actually just about all the girls been given a trailer of their own for their growing size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh...pttfff...Chris the toilet...pffftt...is clogged again.\" Heather said releasing a few stinky farts which didn't seem to bugt the other girls that bad as she scratched her ass before going to the food table<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great here comes gluttonsaurs you all better hurry if you want fifth before she eats it all.\" Leshawna said as her and some of the others went to get some more food even though most still had quite alot of food on it<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough her reasoning wasn't unjusticfied as when Heather got to the food table she got three plates all with a foot and half pile of food on them she took a plate in each hand and used the other two plates to pick up and hold the third plate with as she went to a table. She licked her lips as she looked at the food it was hard for her not to just start digging into the food now, but the moment she got to her table and she sat the plates on it she dug into the food stuffing her mouth with a burger chopping off a good large chunk and started to chew before taking a handful of bacon and stuffing it with the burger. She gorged stuffing her mouth getting grease, sauce, and other condiments all over her face and clothes not even caring. But as she was gorging so where the other girls even the depress Gwen was stuffing her face though it was (mostly cause she found her comfort in gorging her self when depress) all so they could get more food before Heather could. For the next hour it seemed as if it was a race to see who could eat the most food and at this point it would be hard to tell who was winning. But once the hour was up all the girls where leaning back resting hands on their full bellys rubbing them to comfort them all with grins on their face some where even letting out some farts to help sooth their full stomachs. The host of the show came in soon waving his hand in his face to try and get some of the toxic air away from him but wasn't having much luck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn we need to really put some air fresheners in here or something.\" Chris said covering his face from the stink the girls where releasing<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cram it...ppffttt...Chris not in...pppffttttt...the mood for you.\" Gwen grunts out releasing a few powerful farts that made her skirt flap about<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...pptttfff...can't you give...ppffttt...a few moments...uurrrpp...we just finished...urrrppp..eating.\" Leshawna said farting and burping which made her body jiggle a bit<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh...ppfffttt..What do you want...urrrppp...\" Heather said growls out while farting and burping too<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well....?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you girls would stop gassing up my craft tent I'd tell you. It's like having a gang of Owen's in here. Lucky for me this challenge should keep you occupied long enough for us to air out the place.
