            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Chaos ensued the city of Metropolis. In the small period of peace that the hometown maintained, a terrifying menace grew in the very core of the municipality, right under their very eyes. However, citizens were too ignorant to notice its development and the Justice League were too busy with other professional business. Eventually, the menace grew into a danger, and then into a disaster. No one knew exactly how it happened but eventually, the menace struck when everyone least expected. Houses were ravaged, statues were destroyed and worst of all, innocent people were killed in the tragedy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe menace in question was none other than Nail Stryker, a fearsome and merciless foe that was thought to have been defeated and imprisoned for centuries. Evidently not as she was back in heat after her appearance at the mayor's mansion. The woman had a rather revealing two-piece outfit which consisted of a black corset, followed by a carnal thong. Her long black hair, scars and incredibly long fingernails - which was why they attributed her nickname - were what she was recognized for and the criminal had legions of other villains at her command. With their terrifying alliance, they attacked with all their might against the forces of the brave heroes that confronted them and yet, they were severely outnumbered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the end, even the Justice League was no match for them; every single superhero fell against their mighty expertise. Stryker now imposed a reign of dictatorship over Metropolis and her dominion was given an example as she enslaved all the superheroes that dared to oppose her, stripping them of their former glory. She isolated them in different sectors to interrupt their communication with each other as well as assembling personal bodyguards to 'take care of them'. Nail had a specific plan to make each one of them suffer for their opposition and that involved a very horrendous torture tactic. Acutely cruel indeed...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guh...What happened to me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSupergirl awakened after a hair-raising battle that took place in the outskirts of her city. She was fighting Doomsday, one of the most menacing creatures to have ever been created to simply obliterate her species and Superman's arch-nemesis who once almost killed him in combat. By the looks of things, it seemed that she had lost the fight which wasn't really surprising since the hellspawn monster almost decimated her cousin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnlike her original thoughts, Doomsday did not appear to have killed her on the spot, which was perplexing seeing as it was a mass of destruction. Instead of emerging in heaven, Supergirl was greeted with the sight of an unfamiliar environment. She was situated in some sort of sewer but it wasn't technically a sewer since there was no fluid nor rat, although the place reeked. It was simply a dark room with nothing at the proximity safe for a tiny lamp secluded at her border. Glimpsing upwards, she noted that her forearms were sealed in strange shackles that she never seen before, despite her planet having a lot of advanced technology. The thingamajigs had green beams radiating from them and then she came to a single realization; kryptonite. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSupergirl was on her bruised knees, her skin coming into contact with the soiled ground. Her costume was completely tarnished; her midriff top was ripped and had a couple of holes in it. The traditional 'S' on her chest was partially affected as well, and her cleavage stuck out resultantly. Her skirt was in a similar state as the latter, looking like it was torn apart by a shredder. Her belt didn't seem like it saved it from being destroyed and her red undies came into view. Her boots were ruined as well and her body was covered in wounds, not to mention extremely sore. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man...can this day get any worse?\" she asked out loud, not expecting for anyone to answer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Indeed it can, sweetheart.\" A voice directed the teenage alien from behind. The sound immediately activated Supergirl's reflexes seeing as she had super hearing, much like her cousin. \"Oh, I didn't mean to startle you. I just wanted to say hello.\" The silhouette revealed itself to be none other than Nail Stryker. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You...\" Supergirl sneered and growled as the individual that started all of this mayhem stood in front of her. \"If I were out of this, I would beat you to a pulp after what you did to Metropolis! I would kill you where you stand, you monster!\" Despite her claims, her threats did not affect the new ruler. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that so, Kara?\" The criminal honed her sharp fingernails and kept a sinister smirk that gave Supergirl the creeps. Her two scars on her face were quite distinguishable in her position and she also detected the presence of two other personages in the room. Nail did not come alone, it seemed. \"I believe that you forget where you are, <i>Supergirl.</i> I have an entire army of pissed off villains that you so kindly arrested and what do you have left? Every single one of you have been defeated and you think a teenager could stop us? Think again.\" She dragged her finger on Supergirl's armpit and lightly tickled the sensitive pit. The girl flinched and tried to elude from her touch but her fruitless endeavours did not get her far. \"Ticklish, are we? Then this shall be entertaining...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",
