This contest is as good as over.\" Ino thought. Starting a timer she brought along, she scribbled her fingers along the middle of her feet. *Snort* haahahahahahahahhahahahahaha thahahahat ihihihihit hahahahaha Sakura threw her head back laughing loudly. Her arches weren't the worst but they got her laughing quickly. Ino made good use of her nails to scratch at sakura's soles, making the pink haired shinobi laugh like a little girl. Minutes later and sakura was starting to tear up from laughing so much. Her hands were curled into tight fists as she tried not to pull away. Ino on the other hand decided to end this. On one foot she scratched the ball of her foot and on the other she sawed her fingers in between her toes. \"PFFTHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAHAHAHAAHAHAHAHA NOHOHOHOHOHOHOHO HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA Sakura finally couldn't handle it and pulled away with a shriek.

She was still grateful that she still got ino laughing but no nearly as hard as she was. hahahahahahahahahahahaha-pfft-hehehehehehehe thihihihis is nohohohthing hahahahahahahahaha Sakura started getting desperate. Even using ino's tactics and sawing in between her toes. While ino's laughter grew, she wasn't pulling away.

It wasn't until ino let out an uncontrollable shriek that sakura stopped in her tracks and was starting to figure something out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura noticed she didn't until she tickled...\"Don't tell me\" sakura though and she lightly scratched the top of ino's foot getting another squeal. Ino's cocky demeanor went away and sakura grew an evil smirk.  \"Gotcha\". Sakura then went to town on her new target and ino well...HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH NOHOHOHOHOT NOHOHOHOT THEHEHEHEHEHEHERE Ino was going crazy and sakura had barely started. As much as she tried to resist, she couldn't take it and she pulled away shrieking with laughter. She had lasted 6 minutes.

Nearly 5 minutes later, sakura was crying with laughter. Meanwhile ino's frustration was starting to get to her as she increased the pressure on her hysterical friend. She noticed that she had barely said anything and and wasn't squirming at all. She was trying to figure out why but nothing was clicking.

Similar to most other portal based areas, in this lovely building, you get to pick a dimension to travel to. What do you do from there? Well being as we are in Tickleton, you find someone to tickle! Some are easier to obtain than others. And some might even get revenge!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHere in Tickleton's Dimension Room, we have a few rules.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. The portals are for tickling, and sock/foot related activities only! Size change is only allowed if the character can normally size change.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. No area of the body is off limits. Just be careful what you wish for!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. No blood, gore, vore, or extreme violence allowed. Obviously some characters might get a tad agitated. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n4. No toilet fetishes allowed. That includes pee, poo, and vomit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n5. Full on sex needs to be kept to a minimum. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n6. Have fun!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow then! Line on up and get to hunting! Those guys and gals aren't gonna tickle themselves....usually.</td>",
