He always had a small pot belly and the rest of him was flabby.  When Matt was born, he wasn't a big baby.  He was thin as a kid too.  But, after the third grade, he started gaining weight.  His dad was not happy.  He refused to accept that his son had his genes. Matt's mom was one of those people who could eat tons of food, and not gain an ounce.  So with his father's body type, and his mother's appetite, Matt was a 5'6\", 250 lb. growing boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0When Matt turned 14, Matt's dad got transfered to New York City.  Since they were currently living in Oklahoma, Matt's dad left Matt at a boarding school in the middle of nowhere on the Oklahoma prairie, saying that he didn't want to upset Matt's life by moving him to another state.  Thanks, dad.  He left Matt standing outside the school, clutching his suitcases; staring up at the sign over the door, which read \"Obesity School For Boys\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt walked up to the dark wooden doors that sat in the middle of the old three story brick build.  He leaned his weight into the door and walked into a musty smelling entrance hall.  following the signs, Matt found his way to the main office, where he met...</span></div></div>",

He looked around the room, and found that the only person there was a boy, about Matt's age, but a lot fatter than him, sitting in a chair against the wall.  He looked to weigh 300+ pounds.  He was wearing a white dress shirt that clung to his belly, showing every fold of his fat.  In fact, the shirt seemed too small for the boy, because Matt could see the bottom of they boy's belly beneath the tails of the shirt.  the boy was also wearing a pair or very tight pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy looked up at mat and said, \"Ms. peach will be back in a minute.  She's the receptionist.\"  The boy tried to stand up, but his belly seemed to be caught in the arms of the chair.  After some struggle, he managed to wriggle himself free.  \"I'm Joey,\" he said, reaching out his hand, \"Joey Alfredo.  But everyone calls me 'Joey Junkfood'.\"  Matt didn't hear a word.  he was too enthralled with this kid's belly.  It was so soft.  The look of it reminded him of one time when he had made pudding bombs to throw at a teacher on the last day of school.  he couldn't take his eyes off it.  \"Hello!\" Joey said, \"Hey, buddy!\"  Matt snapped out of his daze and shook Joey's hand.  \"Sorry,\" he said, \"I'm Matt.  What's your name again?\"  \"Joey,\" Joey replied.  He moved his hand to scratch his belly, making it jiggle; Matt began to stare again.  Seeing Matt's interest in his belly, Joey asked Matt, \"Wanna touch it?\"  \"What?\" asked Matt, coming back out of another daze.  \"Do you want to touch my belly?\" Joey asked again, \"Here.\"  Joey grabbed Matt's  hand and pressed it to his belly.  Matt moved his hand around Joey's gut, feeling it's softness.  With both his hands, Matt gently lifted Joey's belly to gage it's size.  He loved it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter several minutes of belly worship, Matt was snapped out of his third daze, by...</span></div></div>",

Even though he heard her he was too busy looking at Joey. Joey looks away as to tell matt to respond but matt didn't he just stood there looking at nothing.

He turns toward the counsellor and says \"Hi, I\u2019m Matt.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come into my office,\" replies Ms. LaPlant.  She shows Matt into an office furnished very simply, with a wooden desk with a good office chair behind it, and two very broad, strong armless chairs in front.  \"Have a seat, Matt, and we'll get you started here,\" she says kindly, then shuts the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not used to being around other fat boys,\" she says gently once the door was closed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No ma'am,\" replies Matt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can tell by the way Joey's belly fascinated you - new boys often find the fatter of their classmates irresistible to watch, and of course, once you've been here a while, you'll be so proud of your girth you'll want to show it off,\" Ms. Laplant observed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How..how long has Joey been here?\" Matt asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is his fifth year, he started here in grade five.  He's in your class, you know - grade nine.  He's a bit bigger than you are,\" she added, grinning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just a bit!\" Matt replied in a like tone.  \"A bit like, a hundred pounds maybe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" replied Ms. Laplant.  \"But, since you're here, clearly getting bigger like Joey is in your future too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" Matt asked in disbelief.  \"You mean...kids aren't here to lose weight?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no,\" chuckled Ms. Laplant.  \"That's a common misconception among new students.  No, we're fat-friendly and growth-positive here at OSB.  Were you teased about your size at your old school?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah,\" replied Matt instantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, the only teasing you may take here is about being too small. Tell me, Matt, do you like to eat?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah, except my Dad always has me on diets.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?  We'll have to check that.  But, in the meantime, the rule here is, no diets.  Eat as much as you like!  We only ask that you get some veggies and fruit everyday, and report to the school nurse and doctor for check-ups as scheduled.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No diets?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No diets.  In fact, many of our students take pride in how much they gain here at OSB.  Joey's one of those - ask him, he'll tell you all about it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm going to like this place!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sure you will.  Now, here's a class schedule, and a room key, and a map of the school.  I'll just take you out and find someone to take you to your new room.\"  Ms. Laplant opened the door again.  \"And, if there's anything we can do to make your stay here better, just let me know.  Now, who can I ask....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMs. Laplant asks....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Joey made Matt shed the shirt and his jeans.  Joey grabbed a tape measure and a notebook, carefully measuring Matt from top to bottom, recording each in the notebook.  We are required to measure each other monthly and periodically take pics of our gaining progress.<br>\r\nI have three years left here, and have set a lofty goal to reach by graduation..........I have told my counsellor that I am determined to reach 500#, with an 80 inch gut above a 55 inch waist.  I want my huge mantits to lay out onto the top of my gut, big and suckable.  My counselor says I can do it if I am determined.  Do you think you'd be willing to help me get that big, he asked me.  I answered without doubt that I would be honored....as long as he promised to make sure that I ate plenty along with him.  Joey promised.  We reached our dorm room and I noticed the heavy duty iron beds, and reinforced desk chairs for us big guys.  Joey pulled a hose from the ceiling to demonstrate for me.  this was another feeding tube.  Each room was connected to giant vats of gainer shakes in the attic.  We could drink our fill any time we chose.  There were 5 meals served daily.  The snack bar in the basement keep us satisfied between meals.  I took the hose from Joey and shoved it deep into the top of my throat.  I opened the valve and cold liquid began flowing into my belly.  I drank until I could not hold any more.  My gut had grown big and hard.  I measured my distended belly and had stretched it almost 3 inches.  Joey told me the shakes didn't keep you full for long, but were great for slowly stretching our guts so we can fill them with even more food later.</span></div></div>",

The little guy declared that one day he would be as big as his new roommate, getting a pat on the back from the fat man.  Joey reminded all the guys to take the measurements before first dinner.  About half had forgotten and left to do it.  Joey and I went back to our room.  We had another hour before first dinner.  Joey checked himself in the mirror, turned to me and asked me to do him a favor.......He handed me a set of electric barber shears, and asked me to cut off all the hair from his head.  I hesitated, and he told me to get rid of all of it.  I hit the switch and set to work mowing off his hair, leaving nothing but 1/8\" stubble behind.  When I'd finished, Joey covered his head with shaving gel, grabbed his razor and began shaving his head BALD.As he finished the shave, Joey shoved the hose into his throat and filled his expanding gut with gainer shake until he said he couldn't hold any more.  I massaged his swollen belly for several minutes, then told his to swallow more shake.  and he did.  His gut grew another inch or so. Joey dropped his tight levis,turned sideways, so he could see his belly protruding out from his midsection.  I reached up to Joey's freshly shaved pate, and foldled it all over.  I realized my hardening prick would jerk/throb with each stroke across his bald head.  Without thinking, I told Joey that I wanted to be bald like he is, and he just grinned.

I could not believe that there were over 200 young men in the dining hall and the smallest guy there weighed 200lbs.  Joey introduced me to Big AL, the fattest boy at the school.  He was huge......must have weighed close to 600 lbs.  Al was a fourth year student and had another one last year of gaining ahead of him.  The school had promised him permanent residence there IF he agreed to keep gaining weight with no limit.  Al hoped to reach 725 lbs by graduation.  All the other boys had sworn to help keep him eating.  a bell rang and we all sat down together.  Twenty pairs of servers began bringing tray after tray of fried chicken, pizza, mashed potatoes, and pitchers of shake.  I began to eat like it would be my last time.  with Joey's encouragement, I ate until I douldn't, then managed to eat more.  We finished this off with quarts of pure cream ice cream.  We all began to stop around 6:00.  Waddling from the tables, all us stuffed boys waddled from the dining hall to the quad.  There were quite a few of the guys showing off their engorged bellies to other guys, especially us newbies.  I opened my shirt and stroked my gut.  I knew one day, I would have a huge belly any boy would be envious of and want himself.  I worked my hands all over my stuffed belly, as I walked off some of the food.

Coach is gonna have you and me working our with weights on our arms, shoulders, and upper back/chest.  This will help us keep our ballbellies in place, instead of sagging into aprons.  It will also help us support our big guts the bigger they grow.  Matt, Coach is so freakin' cool.  You're really gonna like him a lot.  Wait until you see him.......ex-football player that's developed a huge ballbelly.  Coach grew his belly to 72 inches, and was satisfied.  He weighed in at<br>\r\n375 lbs, a lot for a man who's only 5'8\".  Now he tips the scales at about 350 lbs and lets his<br>\r\ngirth fluctuate between 65-70 inches tops.  He is able to get any of us through any problem we have about our looks, big guts, anything.\"<br>\r\n   While Joey had talked, I had shoved down my gullet the entire half gallon on ice cream.  I fell back on the bed, moaning from the pressure in my belly.  Joey began to massage my stuffed belly in circular strokes all over it.  It wasn't long until the pain in my gut was gone and the packed full feeling disappeared.  As Joey set to finishing how own carton of ice cream, I went to work on his stuffed ballbelly, keeping the big ball relaxed and loose as Joey shoved down the ice cream.<br>\r\n   Joey had just dropped the enpty carton when there was a knock at the door.  We shouted to come inside.........totally surprised......</span></div></div>",

He displayed his huge gut proudly by not wearing a shirt, just a pair of workout shorts, and his New Balance Cross Trainers.  Coach and I shook hands and he fondled my freshly shaved dome.  \"Joe, make you a proposition......I am liking you boys BALD heads.  I'm liking it a lot.<br>\r\nIn fact, how about you shaving my head right now.<br>\r\nJoey excitedly agreed.  Coach kneeled by the sink, and said, \"Joe....let's get it done, son.\"<br>\r\nJoey replied \"Yes, Sir,Coach.!\" and picked up his electric clippers.  Coach interrupted by offering both Joey and me one of his long, fat cigars that he'd stored in his socks.  Joey took the stogie right away, but Coach saw my hesitation.  I admitted to them that I'd never really smoked a cigar before.  Coach winked and told Joey that the two of them would be introducing me to all kinds of new experiences.<br>\r\n\"I told the coach and Joey that I was ready for anything and all they could throw at me.\"  Coach trimmed the butt of the cigars, then carefully lighted each one himself, then handing to us.  Coach again kneeled at the sink puffing slow and deep on his large, dark smoke.  Joey hit the switch, and the clippers hummed.  Setting the blades in the center of Coach's forehead hairline, Joey mowed off a row of his hair all the way back and down Coach's neck.  In little time, only stubble remained on Coach's scalp. The 3/8\" crewcut was history.  Joey covered the newly exposed skin with a hot towell,let it sit for a while, then replaced the towel with a thick covering of Shave Gel, followed by the towel once more.  Joey removed the towel, and set the Mach 3 to work shaving Coach's head smooth and clean.  After about 15 minutes of careful shaving and reshaving, it was done.  Joey cleaned off the excess gel/foam, then splashed witch hazel all over the BALD dome.<br>\r\nHe them finished with a large dollop of Neutragena hypo-allergenic, extra sensitive moisturizer lotion. Coach checked himself out in the mirror, then turned to us and declared us<br>\r\n\"the New Three Musketeers\"  He let both of us boys cop a good feel of his freshly shaved dome, and I also got a brief encounter with Coach's huge ballbelly.  He just grinned at me, and told Joey and me to be at his office the next morning at 7:30 AM.  We could make 1st feeding at 6:00, and go directly to his office.  Joey winked at me and said, \"Matt, something is up! Tomorrow is Saturday.  Coach has got something planned for a very small group of his students.  We decided to hit the bed early, but Joey wanted to show me one of the benefits of eating like we began this afternoon.  He wrapped the tape around my stuffed belly, and declared a reading of 43 inches....three inches above the previous one of 40\".  Eventually, we'll be steadily seeing and feeling increases in our girths.  Gorging like we did tonight, stretches our gut/stomach muscles and helps keep them able to swell up a good bit when we are ready to stuff.\"  We fell into the beds a bit frustrated, but happy.</span></div></div>",

While he was down the hall, I sneaked his belt size...size 52\".<br>\r\nI measured my own gut.....48\".

Hash browns, 3 froed eggs.3 heavily buttered biscuits, a stack of 6 pancakes covered in butter and cane syrup, 3 patties of pan sausage, 6 breakfast sausage links, and a large slice of ham. each that wanted it, were given a full quart of whole milk or quart of orange juice.  To supplement all this were trays of pastries and donuts.  Joey and I were at the head of the line, which allowed the other students to see our shaved heads. Joey and i took the table in the center of the room.  that would now be our table. no one else would sit here without an invitation.  in little time, three guys with medium sized beerbellies came up and said they'd be going to see Coach with me and Joey.  There was a total of 8 guys coach had selected for whatever he was planning.  When the table filled with the 8 chosed by coach....we all shook hands and agreed whatever came up, we would do what Coach ordered, expected, and wanted.  ALL eight of us shirtless guys forced all the food we'd been given into our bellies.<br>\r\nWe left and headed to Coach's office at 6:50.<br>\r\nCoach arrived immediately after us.....opening the back of the gym, and telling us to head to the weight room and wait on him.  We sat on mats listening to Coach.  He explained that we eight were the most likely candidates in his opinion, to reach and/or exceed all their individual gaining goals for this year. the eight of us would remain as a unit until graduation.  The eight of us guys, under Coach's guidance, would <br>\r\nbe the initiative and inspiration for the rest of the students.  We will be known as \"The Gainer Crew\".  He and we eight will easily demonstrate to the remainder of boys and even some staff, that large amounts of weight can be added by guys, as they retain their health, abilities, and energy.  Three of the guys were second year and five were first year.  That's when he asked if any of us did not want to participate in the Crew.  Mike, a chunky first year man raised his hand and asked Coach if he wanted the whole crew to shave their heads like his and ours.  Coach answered that he would indeed prefer all of them to be shaved, but he was not going to require it.  All 6 of the guys declared that they wanted to get shaved like us. Coach was pleased.  You 8 men will work our daily in this room under my supervision.  We will set goals in pounds and inches that you will be expected to reach timely. Four of you guys already are showing potential for developing exceptional ballbellies.....Joey, Matt, Jason, and Will....you boys will develop huge ballbellies; Peter and Andy will get to growsaggin aprons. and Sam and Hank will be somewhere in the middle.

He'd see us privately during the pig-out time to  hear our plans for helping develop our projects.  We would be keeping diaries on each boy:  including initial, and weekly weighings, bi-weekly measuring and weighing, our directions, their own methods, successes, failures, etc.  Primarily, we were to encourage ANYTHING our boys might do that helped them gain weight, and gain self confidence and self pride.  AND, we were to make sure we maintained our own routines to continue our own progress toward our own goals.  Our first meeting of the 36 was to be Wednesday, the day before Tanksgiving......5 1/2 weeks from now.  After conferences on Sunday, we were on our own with our boys.  Coach would be available to meet with any of the crewe during that time for his advice and help solving any problems that might arise.  The three crewe members and their boys who had the most success (and that didn't necessarily mean most pounds gained) in this session would be joining the coach for a special Thanksgiving feast as an incentive/reward for good work and effort.

I told him that would be our plan of attack---kick start him to gaining again, and try a rapid-gain program to grow his gut rapidly until we matched.  He was in total agreement and ready to start.

I would be there to rub his growing gut, to make it easier to do, and he could do the same for me.  I would take him to meet Coach Monday afternoon.  Then we talked about Tommy.  Pete said he'd do all he could to help me with the kid, and we could both turn him around for life.

I talked him into shucking his shirt and jeans so I could see him.  the kid was fairly round all over, but a side view displayed the shape of his middle.  I told him that I thought he'd have no problem developing a nice ball belly, with a little determined work on the weights, it just might happen.  He asked me if I'd help him.  I agreed if he'd do it officially, and he agreed.  I told him about the thing with Coach, and that Pete would be working with us, and He said he wanted to go for it.

I invited him to go to First and Last Dinners tonight with us, and said that we'd be eating together most of the time from now own.  He just smiled.  He stood to go back to his room, grabbed six Oreo's, and asked me about my statement that I'd shave his head for him.......So I made the same deal with him as with Pete......we are successful, then I'll shave them both before the feast, and help them keep themselves bald.  and He left until first Dinner. <br>\r\n <br>\r\nWe BS'd a lot durning first dinner, then got a little more serious afterwards in my room relaxing until last meal.

I left his office really excited and swearing that me and my boys were gonna be first in every area----pounds gained, inches added, and self-confidence.  Coach grinned big, then handed me a box holding 12 of his favorite cigars.  He said that if me and the boys were gonna be at his house for Thanksgiving, we needed to be able to handle good cigars.  I took the box and said he would not be disappointed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPete, Tommy and I worked out every morning at five o'clock.  Pete and I concentrated on keeping our expanding ballbellies firm and hard.  We both worked on our arms, shoulders, hips, lower abdomen, and legs.  Tommy worked just on his arms, shoulders, and legs.  I even began wrapping him between his tits and stomach with elastic wraps to keep his belly shoved down.  I ended each workout giving the kid's jelly gut massages with good lotion to keep it as loose as possible. Then each of us chugged a 32 oz jug of gainer shake.  With the exception of classes, we three were always together.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the first two weeks, I got them to my room after last meal.  We all were stuffed tight, after the pure cream ice cream and sugar cookies in the cafeteria.  I told them that I had a surprise for them before we got to measuring our progress.  Tommy asked, \"Are you gonna give us haircuts?\"  I grinned and said, \"Now Bud, that's an excellent suggestion, but not right.  Pete had no guess.  I pulled Coach's gift from under my bed and opened it.  Pete grinned big, and Tommy looked shocked.  I told them what Coach had said, and that we would NOT disappoint him.<br>\r\nI clipped the ends from three stogies, and we each had one.  When we'd measured, then we'd fire up these babies.  I told them, \"Boys, when the Coach passes out cigars after Thanksgiving dinner, we will be 'pros'.  We'll look like we've been smoking cigars for a long time.  Got it?\"  Both of them agreed.  I tossed them both flexible measuring tapes.  I stripped to my shorts, and told them to get going.  They each made notes as they worked, then let me transfer the numbers to my logbook.  I had gained 15 pounds, added an inch to my hardening pecs, and 3/4 inch to my upper and lower arms.  My hard ball-shaped gut had expanded two full inches, and lost 1/2 inch in my waist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy was measured next.  The kid had put on <br>\r\n18 1/2 pounds in two weeks, and added an inch to his growing mantits, and two inches to his giggly belly, as well as increasing the sag in his growing apron 3/4 inch.  His neck had even grown 1/2 inch.  I had Tommy make all the measurements of Pete.  I wanted to see him handling another boy's body.  I smirked as I saw him \"accidentally\" bump Pete's cock as he worked.<br>\r\nPete had done the best in two weeks....he's gained 24 pounds, and added 3 1/4\" to his swelling ball belly reaching nearly 48 inches girth.  He winked at me and said he was catching up to me.  </span></div></div>",

After second breakfast we met back at my room.  We had all exceeded our goals by almost 50%, weight, size, and shape!  I knew we would be in first place, without any doubt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe sauntered into the gym with pride in ourselves and each other.  In fact, all the teams had done well, and it showed!  Over half of the new boys were sporting buzzcuts just like my two, with not one of the others sporting more than a #2.  All of us had shown up in tight, low-riding shorts, and undershirts meant for little guys that displayed every enlarged belly in the room.  It was incredible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCoach came out of his office, dressed as we were,<br>\r\nhead freshly shaved, and big cigar tight in his jaw.  He hung a posterboard on the wall.......a chart with all our names and blocks for each measurement he'd be taking, that would be beside the original measurements, with a space for amount of growth.  He would be calling each group by the last name of the group leader.  We would be in the middle.  Each guy before us met or exceeded his goal in every area, but no one had our numbers.  Then he called us.  Coach measured me first.  My weight was 21 lbs over the goal, and my size had surpassed my goals by a minimum of 2 inches.  I got a standing ovation from all the guys, and ate it up.  Pete was next.<br>\r\nCoach said he was proud to announce that Pete had<br>\r\nmanaged to surpass his weight goal by an amazing<br>\r\n47 pounds, the most so far.  My proudest moment came with his gut size......61 inches, with his<br>\r\nwaist at just 43 inches.  Pete had beat my gut by 1/2 inch.  Then it was Tommy's turn.  Tommy proudly displayed his enlarged, and sagging apron to the room.  He had surpassed his weight by 20 lbs, as he'd passed all his other goals.<br>\r\nWe hugged and stroked each other's bellies, and Pete said with a wink, \"Boss, we have this in the bag.\"<br>\r\nAfter two hours, everyone had been weighed and measured.  Coach announced the teams that would be feasting at his place tomorrow.  \"Men, it is my privilege to announce the team in top place.<br>\r\nWith a combined total weight of 1068 lbs, it's the team of Jake, Pete, and Tommy!\"  There was lots of applause, then the other teams were announced.  Then Coach made another announcement.<br>\r\n\"Boys, there are 4 weeks until our next holidays,<br>\r\nanyone wants to keep this going is welcome, and will be treated to a wild party on New Year's Eve.\"  We all cheered and we all joined in.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I locked the door, and poured three 20 ounce cups of gainer shake.  <br>\r\nI told them again how proud I was of them, of us.<br>\r\nTomorrow we would be doing some serious partying and gut stuffing sitting with Coach at the head of the table.  Coach has said that he's gonna have some special \"goodies\" there for all of us. <br>\r\nThe gift I'm looking forward to enjoying is the gift of cigars.  Pete said he was excited about the stogies too.  Tommy just looked kind of worried.  I slapped the kid on his gut, and said<br>\r\nI would bet he had never tried one.  I was right.  Pete said he'd smoked five or six in the past and really liked them.  I had tried cigars twice last year and like them too.  I opened my desk drawer and brought out my pouch of a dozen cigars just for us.  They boys loved it.  I had hit the tobacco shop after lunch and passed for being legal age.(another advantage of size!)  I had chosen only one brand and size......an inexpensive Flor de Oliva natural wrapper, 8 inches long and a 50 ring (a good size for big men like us.)  Pete didn't even take the cutter, just bit off the end and clamped it in his jaw.<br>\r\nI cut mine and Tommy's.  I tossed Pete the torch and he fired up his smoke right away.  He even did a full inhale with no problem.  I offered to light Tommy's, then put the fire to mine.  Pete immediately began to give the kid tips and pointers on smoking his first cigar, and succeeded in getting the kid to get past his nervousness, to relax and start learning to smoke it.  I even listened to his tips and used them.  In no time at all, we three were starting to be more comfortable and confident, and were actually smoking them.  Tommy and I had to relight our smokes a couple of times, but we were getting the hang of it fairly quickly. </span></div></div>",

After his father died when Pete was 10 years old, his father's younger brother had stepped in and taken care of Pete's family.  Uncle Jack was his hero.  Uncle Jack  was 29 at that time, and owned his own business.<br>\r\nHe was not married, except to his family and his work, which left him little time for anything else.  He hired a general manager to take on most of the day-to-day running of the business, so he could take on the responsibilities of taking care of Pete, his mother, and little sister.  Jack and Pete had become best friends.<br>\r\nPete became determined to be just like Jack in every way.  The first step was to try to look like Jack, so Pete's focus became getting fatter.<br>\r\nJack stood about six feet two inches, and weighed<br>\r\nover 300 pounds.  By the time Pete was 12, he had gained over 50 pounds.  Now four years later,<br>\r\nPete's mother was so worried about his size that he had ended up here at the Obesity School.  His Mother would have screamed if she knew what the school was actually about.  Two years ago, Pete had spent the summer \"working\" with Uncle Jack, and had his own spending money.  Two weeks into the  summer, Pete had gone to the barber shop and got a flattop haircut like Jack's.  Uncle Jack loved it.  Last summer Pete began trying to smoke cigars like Uncle Jack, but in private.  His Mother would have put her foot down on that, so he'd snagged some stogies with a couple of buds from school.  That's when he knew he would one day be a real cigar smoker like Jack.  He was now well on his way to reaching Jack's size, and was more determined than ever to be just like Jack.</span></div></div>",

You boys ready to join the best looking group of fat men anywhere?  You boys ready to be bald like the Crew?\"  Pete declared, \"Oh hell yeah.  And I even wrote a letter to Uncle Jack last week to tell him I was gonna get my head shaved, and <br>\r\ntold him he should do the same.  That would be totally cool if he did.\"  \"Excellent,\" I answered, and looked at Tommy.  He said he was ready too.  and had been ready since we started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI got out my Wahl electric clippers, oiled the blades, and  told Tommy that he'd be first.  But he had to keep smoking his cigar during his cut.<br>\r\nHe said, \"No problem, Dude.  I am not gonna give up on anything we've planned.  But I have a question....Are we gonna be allowed to shave your head afterward?  It's only fair.\"  I said,<br>\r\n\"Absolutely, Bud.  You both can take turns on me.\"  Tommy and Pete high-fived, and Tommy moved to the stool by my sink after removing his shirt.<br>\r\nI adjusted the mirror so the kid could watch his haircut.  Pete grabbed another cigar, fired it up, and moved closer so he could watch as well.<br>\r\nI grabbed another smoke myself, and picked up the clippers.  I hit the switch and set the machine to buzzing.  I started in the center of his front hairline, and slowly pushed the clippers straight back to the crown, leaving behind a two inch wide strip of stubble.  I paused, and Tommy made his first successful deep inhale.  We all just about lost it.  As Tommy grinned from ear to ear, I went to work mowing the kid's head almost bald.  In no time at all, Tommy's entire scalp hair was reduced to little more than sandpaper stubble.  I soaked a towel in hot water and wrapped his bare dome with it.I let it soften the bristles a few minutes, then covered the stubbly dome with shaving gel.  I put a fresh blade in the razor, and went to work shaving his dome smooth.  I took my time, and worked carefully.  In about 15 minutes, the kid's head was as smooth and clean as a baby's bottom.  Tommy was still grinning really big.  He told us he liked it a lot.  and Pete and I agreed that he looked great bald.  I shook his hand and welcomed him to the Crew.(I think this was the first time Tommy had ever been a real part of a group and I was proud.)  I finished up the shave with witch hazel followed by a moisturizer.  His hairless pate even shined in the light of my dorm room.  </span></div></div>",

Sometimes outsiders tease us, but we either ignore them or gang up on them.  One time my big brother and his friends climbed up on top of some smart-ass\u2019s Corvette after he razed them - they  collapsed the hood and destroyed the car!

Watching Joey eat, Matt is suddenly very hungry.  He leans forward to the platter in front of Joey and takes a bag of chocolate-chip cookies and a sack of roasted peanuts.  Joey shoves a two-litre jug of milk across to him, and Matt begins to seriously snack.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoey and Matt eat in companionable silence for some minutes, with Matt noticing that Joey eats very quickly - taking nearly two bites for every one of his.  As Matt nears the bottom of the bag of cookies, he\u2019s starting to feel full, which Joey just seems to ploughing on, full steam ahead, through bags of chocolate brownies, macaroons, yogurt-covered raisins, snack cakes, chocolate chips, wagon wheels, and other junk food treats.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt finishes off the cookies, then the peanuts.  Sitting still for a moment, feeling his full stomach, he then finishes off the two litre jug of milk.

Matt is wearing size 40 jeans, which feel snug - his gut spills out above them in front, and probably he\u2019s really 45 or 46 inches around.  Joey\u2019s gut, sitting loose above his boxers, seems to overlap the chair, and must be 55, 60, maybe 65 inches around.  Joey must be well over the 300 pound mark.  Matt feels himself getting fascinated by Joey\u2019s belly again, and wanting to touch it.

You can't really see a face because of the huge belly. \" Yeah, I'm good.\" You reply as the kid helps you up. You look the boy up and down. His big belly sticks out of his shirt and half of his naval is showing. His chest jiggles a bit as he talks. \"So, you must be the new kid.\" He pulls out a half melted chocolate bar from his back pocket and begins to chew on it. \"Uh, yeah!

Oh yeah, and Ha ha, salad.\" Brian replied. You just listen to them and watch as their fat rolls jiggle as they walked. You guy's finally reach the cafeteria. As you walk through the door, you are amazed at the sigh. A room full of fat boys. You've never seen so many fat boy's in one room in your whole life. \"Incredible.\" You utter under your breath. You are about to get in line, when you notice a cute Hungarian boy sitting all by himself eating a sloppy Joe. He has brown hair, cute brown eyes, and you can see his big, hard, round, brown nipples through the white shirt.

You are a lite eater. You look tired, I'll bring you the food, just find us some seats\" Said Joey. \"Ok!\" You say happily as he walks off to get your food.

You think about how soft and warm his hand felt.  You also look at his arms and notice that they are hairy, but not too hairy. \"So, where are you from?\" You ask him. \"Hungaria\" He replies with a mouth full of food. \"Wow, that's so cool. Is this your first time in America?\" you ask him. \"Yes.\" He replied, \"Do you like it here?\" You ask him. \"Very much, people her so friendly.\" He said as he scarfed down his fifth sloppy Joe and goes for six. You stare down at his chest and can see through his shirt, sees his big, round, brown nipples. You figure he must be cold, because his nipples are hard. You begin to say \"You know, you have big, beautiful, round...\" but you catch yourself and say \"eyes\". \"Thank you!\" he says happily. You sigh thinking that was close. All of a sudden, a hand comes from no where and pinches your left tit. You look up to see Joey handing your tray of food. Joey's tray is packed with food. He slides in next to you. You are sandwiched between Oscar and Joey. Both of their fat rolls are pressed against your elbows. Brian sits across from you with the table pressing up against his belly. It looked like he robbed the cafeteria of all their food, judging from the amount he has on his tray. \"So, are you going to the Orientation tonight?\" ask Joey. \"Orientation?\" you ask. \"Yeah, it's for new kids. It's not necessary. Just for you to get to know the instructors and all the other newbies.\" Said Brian. \"Well I don't know.\" You reply. \"Or you could stay in the dorm and get to know our other two roommates.\" Joey adds. \"Well, I'll think about it.\" You reply. \"Will you be rooming with us?\" You ask Brian.  \"Naw dog, I'm too fat.

Being from a small town in Oklahoma, and not being around a lot of people your size you are not familiar with the term. \"You don't know what a gainer is?! Well, it when you try to become fat on purpose.\" he tells you. \"Oh, well I guess so. I mean, even though a lot of people told me to lose the weight I really like it a lot. It makes me look... well sexy.\" You say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     You begin to hear loud foot steps. The wooden floor begins to creak. \"Their here.\" Joey says as the door slowly begins to open. Two chubby figures walk through the door. One is  about 6 foot and weights 287 lbs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n    He has sandy blond hair and wears glasses. The other is about  5'7, and weights 267 lbs.

Joey says \" The gainer awards is a ceremony that us kids created. For each class, we give out awards like the most improved gainer, the best body, that type of stuff. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n      But the big award is the fattest kid award. Only four are given out each year, one in each class.\". \"Wow! Do you think I could win a award?\" You ask with excitement. Justin begins to laugh. \" With your size now, you don't stand a chance.\" says Cody. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n      \"Hey, give the kid a break.\" Says Joey. \"I'm just messing with him.\" replies Cody. He begins to take off his clothes to get ready for bed. He pulls off his pants to revel that his hamburger boxers are sagging a bit and showing butt crack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n        \" Did somebody call a plumber?\" says Justin with a huge grin on his face. \"Oh, shut up wolf boy\" Cody replies as he rolls his eyes. Cody turns around and begins to button his stripped night shirt. You catch a glimpse of his pink nipples. Justin unbuttons his shirt and throws it on the floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n           His body is covered with thick hair. he looks like a wild beast with fat rolls. He slips on his Stone Cold t-shirt and some tight shorts. Joey wears a tight tank top that show half of his nipples, and shorts that cover half of his butt crack. \"I got one of the top bunks!\" Justin calls out. <br>\r\n          <br>\r\n             \"You always call the top bunk.\" Joey replies. \"Because, I'm afraid one of you fat asses will fall through.\" Says Justin. \"Your the one to talk.\" says Cody sarcastically. You begin to blush as everyone turns to you. \"What's the matter?\" ask Joey. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n               \"Well, I didn't bring and pajama's because I thought the school would provide them.\" You say. \"You are wearing underwear aren't you?\" ask Joey. \"Well, Yeah.\" You reply. \"Well, sleep in those tonight and ask for some in the morning.\" says Joey. \"Well, ok I guess.\" You say hesitantly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n                You begin to unbutton your tight white shirt to revel your big, soft belly and light brown nipples. Next, you take off your pants to reveal your skin tight briefs. They are almost see through. \"That wasn't so bad.\" said Joey. You all hop into bed.

You see a chubby kid with freckles standing at the edge of the pond with his chubby arms in the air. \"Here comes salami Sam!\" He says as he jumps in the water making a huge splash. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n       You feel somebody poking your left tit. You turn to see Joey. \" Are you going to stand there all day, or are you going to swim?\" Joey says as he takes off for the water. You follow right behind him and jump in. You dive under and look up at all the chubby bellies before returning to the surface for air. You pop your head out of the water to find Oscar next to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n      \"Hey Oscar!\" You say with a grin. He wipes the water out of his eyes. \"Hi friend\" he says in his Hungarian accent.  You stare at his beautiful chubby light skinned body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     His nipples are hard because of the cold wind. \"Having fun?\" You ask him, and he replies \"Yes, very much\". You wonder if he's a gainer too. All of a sudden someone swims up behind you. \" So, you must be new here.\" The boy says. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n       You turn to see a blond hair boy with piercing<br>\r\n blue eyes. You look at his dripping wet chubby body. He has a deep navel, and a big, soft, jiggling belly. His nipples are small, but he has one of the biggest set of man boobs you ever seen. You wipe your face and extend your hand for a hand shake. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n      He just looks at your hand. You slowly bring your hand back feeling embarrassed. \"The names Lex Biggon,\" He says in a snotty way. He looks you up and down and then says \"Don't tell me your a gainer.\". You smile a naive smile and say \"Yep! Sure am!\" . <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     He laughs uncontrollably with all his fat jiggling. You look at him and think to yourself what is so funny about that. \"Next thing your going to tell me is that you plan to compete in the gainer contest!\" He says still laughing. \"He is!\" Joey says as he swims up. \"Ha! You don't stand a chance against me! What makes you think he will.\" Says Lex in a snarling way. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n      \"Because he has more heart, that's why!\" Says Joey. Lex sees Brian out of the corner of his eye. \"I've got to run, I've got bigger fish to catch small fries.\" say Lex as he swims off in Brian's direction. \"Don't worry about him, that's just Lex the rich snob. Every year he wins the best belly award for our class. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n        But this year it's gonna be different, I know it.\" says Joey. He then adds \"Hm, he has a big crush on my brother.\" You quickly turn to him \"You mean he's gay?!\" you ask in shock. \"Yeah\" he replies adding \" there are a lot of openly gay boys here.\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n         You become excited thing that maybe you could hook up with Joey after all, but then he says \"But my brother isn't one of them.\". \"Oh.\" You say disappointed as you slump down in the water.  You muster up enough courage to ask him is he gay or not when a screeching voice comes from nowhere. \"There you boys are! I've been looking all over for you!\" You look up to see Ms. Peach. \"Why aren't you in your uniforms!? Class is about to start soon!\" she says. She spots you and says \"There you are Matt, I need to see you for a moment.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n          All the boys get out of the water, their chubby bodies soaking wet. Ms. Peach hands you a towel and you proceed to follow her</span></div></div>",

Let me know when you've finished that!\" Potts replied.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt made his way over to the drinks fountains, where as well as the colas and sodas and full-fat chocolate milk, he found there was a tap labelled \"Heavyweight Gainer 800\".  Matt took a large glass of the chocolate milk, and soon was finishing off the last of the lasagna.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReplete, he sat back and sipped the chocolate milk, intrigued by the continued gorging of the huge guy.  The thought flicked through his head that guy that could be him in several years, if he kept eating whole trays of food at a time....   Rather than be alarmed, part of him felt intrigued by the thought.</span></div></div>",

Matt, with Johnny and Joey sitting on either side of him and the cute Hungarian Oscar across from him, digs into his delicious meal.

He eyes Oscar chewing on his 3rd hamburger, double chin jiggling and his ever-erect nipples pushing against his tight white shirt.

Seeing all these attractive fat boys eating, he becomes turned on and begins piling large amounts of food into his own mouth, thinking \"I hope I get as fat as these guys soon, I want to be fatter!\" So he dedicates himself to gorging almost constantly, and hopes to see the results soon.</span></div></div>",

Matt heard that he tried to fathom how big someone in that family would need to be to earn that title.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow...\u201d His mouth was dry. \u201cHow big is your uncle?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, about 4,400 pounds.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf Matt's face showed the blue-screening his brain was going through, it was lost on Johnny. The high school freshman was getting swept away talking about his family and his own gaining goals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe's the youngest among my dad and his brothers,\u201d Johnny continued, \u201cand growing up he had the hardest time packing on the pounds. He'd eat his heart out, my grandma says, but nothing would stick to his body.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat happened?\u201d Matt's mind was on fire, trying to imagine was a two-ton man looked like, wondering what it felt like to be that huge, and what it would be like to be with a man that huge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell,\u201d Johnny coughed lightly, \u201cto hear him tell it it was meeting my Aunt May. He calls it 'fat at first sight.' They met as freshmen in college. Uncle Malcolm was only 800 pounds at that point, the runt of the family but easily the fattest guy on campus (it was a small liberal arts school in the northeast). Compared to anyone else he was a beast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAunt May once told me she had only dated a couple guys in high school, both over 300 pounds, but was disappointed they weren't fatter and didn't want to gain any weight. She wasted no time getting to know Uncle Malcolm, and when she learned about our family's girth and how he wanted to get even fatter she vowed to have him and to help him get as fat as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd from that point, according to him, he just exploded with fat. He was already stuffing his face at every opportunity, but once he started dating Aunt May all those calories started adding up to real weight. Aunt May jokes that Uncle Malcolm's body wanted to stay 'skinny' until they were together, so she could enjoy his growth along with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt all sounds a little too mushy to me, but you can't deny the results. Take a look.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny whipped out his smartphone and started scrolling through pictures, stopping on one that was 90% light blue. Matt had to focus his eyes on the peach and brown blob at the side of the screen before realizing that was a head and hair, and that the rest of the screen was filled with belly, the light blue a tent-sized sheet acting like a muumuu for the behemoth. The head was lost among the body<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI've got a few photos of him I like to keep. They remind me what I'm shooting for; make my dreams seem more real, so to speak.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt's heart was beating so strong it was a wonder Ms. Peach didn't hear it and ask if he was alright. Instead she simply smiled and said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou see, Matthew? This school isn't about to tell you to go on a diet. If you want to be fat, you'll feel right at home here. And if you want to get even fatter, you couldn't have picked a better place to come.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI'm going to break 800 before the year's over,\u201d Johnny said, \u201cAnd that'll just be the warm-up. With my appetite and the school's cafeteria, they're going to need a tow truck to get me across the stage for graduation.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt was getting dizzy, barely able to stand up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell you aren't going to accomplish that standing around,\u201d Ms. Peach said. \u201cWhy don't you take Matt to the cafeteria and show him how we do things at OSB?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure thing.

'clunk'  Ms. Peach  moved the weights back to zero.  Matt looked at the numbers on the scale.  They went up over 700 pounds.  \"How big are the kids at this school?\" thought Matt.  Ms. peach adjusted the weights until the bars were balanced.  \"264 pounds.  Good\" said Ms. Peach.  \"Nice,\" said Joey, pinching Matt's love handle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Joey,\" said Ms. Peach, \"why don't you hop up here too.

That did it.  The buttons on his shirt popped off, releasing Joey's gut to expand and relax.  Joey then reached under his belly and undid his pants, and pealed them off.  He kicked off his shoes and stood on the scale.

Then Joey said, \"The cafeteria's down the hall.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boys waddled as quickly as they could to the Cafeteria.  Matt had never seen a school cafeteria like this.  There were huge steamer tables full of deliscious looking food, and there was a pop machine, and a soft-serve machine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt and Joey immediately grabbed some plates and piled them high with the fantastic smelling food.  They horsed down their food, and returned three more times before their strange hunger was satisfied.  Matt sat back and felt his belly.

He had gotten so big that his belly was begining to push against the table even though he had pushed his chair back quite far.  Matt just stood there watching Joey breathe deeply as if he was in a hypnotic trace, watching the belly expand and contract.<br>\r\nSuddenly, Matt realised that he was just standing there gawking at his new found fat friend and snapped out of it.<br>\r\n\"Do you want some more?\" asked Matt.  \"Sure, but could you go get a bigger bowl this time, and do you reckon you could cover it in that chocolate sauce over there too?\"  said Joey.  \"Sure, no problem\"<br>\r\nMatt slowley made his way over the the ice cream bar, as he was still feeling very bloated from his large feast earlier.  However, he thought he'd make things more interesting.  He grabbed a second large bowl and spoon and filled it with the same contents as Joey's new bowl, before making his way back to the table.<br>\r\n\"Thought I'd join you\" grinned Matt.  \"Cool, but I still want you to feed me\" said Joey with a smile. \"Ok, but then you've got to feed me after, fairs fair\" said Matt.  \"Fine, but me first\" grinned Joey.<br>\r\nWith that, Matt began to shovel the ice cream into Joey's waiting mouth.  He began gulping it down and soon Matt found himself feeding Joey faster and faster, as Joey's seemingly never ending appetite absorbed the food.  Finally, the bowl was empty and Joey sat there for a few minutes, taking a few deeps breaths before saying \"Thanks, that much better\".  He grinned at Matt and his fat cheeks dimpled on his face.  Matt noticed that Joey had grown again, and this time his pants were on the verge of giving up.  The button was straining and protesting as Joey's enourmous stomach was pushing hard against it.  Joey noticed this too and took a deep breath and pushed his belly out as far as it would go.  The button finally gave in a with a loud 'ping' sound, flew off his pants, releasing the gargantuan belly contained within.  It flopped out over his lap and filled the availible space in front of the table, actually pushing Joey's chair further away from the table.  His shirt would'nt have come anywhere near the front of his belly now.<br>\r\nMatt just sat there, looking in awe.  \"Wow, I want to get as fat as you, just for that alone!\".  Joey cheekily grinned again \"I know, cool huh?\".  \"Yeah!\" said Matt.  Finally snapping out of it, Matt realised it was his turn.  \"Ok then big boy, me next\" he said.<br>\r\nJoey began to pile the ice cream into Matt as he had done to him, gradualy getting faster and faster in his pace.

The dorm looked positively homey, with a lot of bedrooms around a large central rec room.  The rec room had couches, easy chairs, a couple of TVs, a good stereo, and a half-dozen computers and video-game consoles.  It also had some exercise equipment - weightlifting benches and stuff, but no treadmills or exercise bikes.  As Matt looked around, he noticed a closed door marked \u2018kitchen\u2019.  \u201cIs there a kitchen here?\u201d he asked Joey.<br>\r\n\u201cSure,\u201d said Joey.  \u201cWe\u2019ve got a couple of microwaves, a stove, three fridges, and a dishwasher.  The school keeps it stocked with snacks and other basics, but lots of guys bring food back from home or go out shopping, too.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWow,\u201d said Matt.  \u201cThe school really doesn\u2019t mind if guys get fat.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cMind,\u201d said Joey, \u201cthey don\u2019t mind, they\u2019re here to help us get fat.  Did you think this was some of diet school?  Why did you parents send you here, if you don\u2019t want to get fat?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cOh, I like being fat,\u201d said Matt a little defensively.  \u201cMy Dad is fat.  But he doesn\u2019t like me being fat - at least, I don\u2019t think he likes me being fat - and he\u2019s paying for me to come here.  My mum wanted me to go to New York with them.\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cNew York would be fun - but this school is more fun,\u201d replied Joey.  \u201cNew York kids are all those skinny dweebs you see in TV ads.

Let\u2019s go get lunch!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two head head down the stairs and down the hallway to the cafeteria.  There aren\u2019t many guys there yet, but Joey points out the different tables.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA dorm sits over there - they\u2019re the youngest, and a few jocks as well.  B dorm is here - we\u2019re the middle sized, and we\u2019ve got the foreign students.  C dorm is over there - they\u2019re bigger, lots of brainiacs there.  D dorm sits near the window - they\u2019ve the fattest, and there are lots of geeks.  Well, really the fattest are the Prefects - they have the table closest to the serving tables.  Jeremy, Tod, James, Jerzy, Karl, Hiro - this is Matt.  He\u2019s new.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, Matt,\u201d said a tall, dark haired boy with glasses, \u201cwelcome to OSB.  I\u2019m James.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHi, guys,\u201d said Matt.  \u201cWhat\u2019s for lunch?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLots of stuff,\u201d said Tod.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you like?\u201d asked Karl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome, I\u2019ll show you,\u201d said Hiro, who was being very forward for a Japanese.  Matt went with Hiro to the serving tables.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTake a plate and stock up,\u201d said Hiro, gesturing to serving trays heaped high.  Matt noted lasagna, pork chops, sausage, potato casserole, hamburgers, hot dogs, breaded fish, and salmon, just on the first table.  \u201cYou must eat well if you are to become fat,\u201d Hiro added.  \u201cI want to become great sumo, so I come to OSB to grow.  So far I add more than hundred pounds.\u201d  He pointed to his growing gut. \u201cIs very big, for Japanese.  But biggest sumos now 500 pounds.  So I must grow more.  You like sumo?\u201d he went on, filling his plate with the fish and hot dogs.  \u201cOSB has an excellent sumo coach and team.  I love America!  So much food!  So many good hotdogs.\u201d  Hiro bowed to Matt.  \u201cHurry and fill plate, then come back.\u201d  He scurried off to the B dorm table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSumo!\u201d Matt thought, taking a couple of pork chops and some potato casserole.  He looked around for a serving table of salad, to make up for the greasy chops, then realised that his father wasn\u2019t around, and he could eat what he liked.  So he took a couple of hamburgers instead.  \u201cI wonder what sumo is really like.\u201d  He turned to return to the B dorm table when he saw an absolutely huge boy talking to Joey.  When the boy turned, Matt could see that he looked like an older, far fatter version of Joey.  <br>\r\n\u201cHey, Matt, this is my brother Brian,\u201d said Joey.  \u201cHe\u2019s in Dorm C, but they\u2019re going to move him to Dorm D.  Remember, that\u2019s the fattest dorm.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, congratulations,\u201d said Matt.  \u201cHow big are you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c563 pounds,\u201d replied the newcomer.  \u201cJoey tells me you\u2019re new, and that you\u2019re already 14?  Looks like you have some catching up to do in the weight department.  Just ask me if you want any gaining tips.\u201d  At that, Brian turned and waddled off towards the Dorm C table, his huge gut bouncing as he walked.  Matt stood watching.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Gaining tips?\u2019 he thought to himself.  \u2018Is everybody here trying to gain weight?\u2019  He noticed that while he had one plateful, the other boys had two or three, or like Hiro had already emptied a couple.  He sat at the table and asked Joey,<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Why else would you come to OSB?  This is the perfect place for fat guys, and guys who want to be fat, like Hiro.  He\u2019s still pretty small, but he\u2019s gained over a hundred pounds since he came.  I\u2019ve been here two years, and I\u2019ve gained 120 pounds.

I want to be 800 pounds.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c800 pounds!\u201d said Matt.  The idea of being that big was unimaginable to Matt, and here was this guy two years younger than him who wanted to be that big.  Matt couldn\u2019t imagine what his parents would say if he came home a lot fatter, and announced that he wanted to grow to 800 pounds.  \u201cDo your parents know you want to grow?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure, they\u2019re sending me to OSB, aren\u2019t they?  My Dad is a big guy, though Brian is heavier than he is now, and so is my mom - and she loves to cook.  She makes huge meals for us whenever we\u2019re home, and sends us bigger clothes regularly.  And our granny lives next door, and she cooks for us too!  Sometimes I get two breakfasts, two lunches and two dinners a day!\u201d  Joey smiled in remembrance of such feasting.  \u201cBut the cafeteria here is great - I get all the junkfood I want to eat.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJunkfood?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I love burgers and fries.  I hate salad and vegetables.  That\u2019s why they call me \u2018Junkfood Joey\u2019 \u2018cause I\u2019m always chowing down on a burger or chips or a chocolate bar.  That\u2019s why my gut is so huge!

Matt decided that he really liked Carl - he seemed big and solid compared to Joey or Brian, who certainly were fat but somehow soft and floppy too.  He couldn\u2019t imagine Joey, with his massive floppy guy, actually doing anything but eating and playing video games - the idea of Joey riding a bike or playing ball seemed ridiculous.  Whereas Carl seemed to Matt like the kind of guy who could do both of those - and probably play football too.  Matt decides to have what Carl is having, and heads off to the serving counter.  He returns with his own small mountain of sausages, sauerkraut and fried potatoes.  He comes back to find the seat opposite Carl is vacant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarl looks at Matt\u2019s tray and says, \u201cIs good!  Is good you eat good food, solid food.  Not like Joey and Brent and their junk food.  Just look at them - sure they are fat, but is not useful fat.  Is not fat for going up mountains or doing things.\u201d  Carl took another mouthful of sauerkraut, then thumped his massive gut.  \u201cI have useful fat - I am big, but I do things, I go places, I ride bike, I hike up mountains.  I like to visit beach, I wrestle, I play volleyball.\u201d  He takes another mouthful of sausage with thick mustard.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou wrestle?  You\u2019re not too big?\u201d Matt asks him, digging into his own mountain of sausage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSshhh, no one here at OSB can ever be too big, Matt.  Too big is not possible.  The bigger, the better. Yes I wrestle.  I am good wrestler.  I am strong.  I lift weights too.\u201d Carl went on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut the wrestling coach in my old school was always after the team to loose weight, and he<br>\r\n wouldn\u2019t even look at big guys,\u201d Matt replies.  \u201cI wanted to wrestle, but I was too fat, he said.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour old school probably wrestled in one of the little man leagues,\u201d replied Carl.  \u201cHere we wrestle in real big man league.  No weight limit.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo weight limits?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWeight classes, but no weight limits,\u201d added a boy beside Carl.  \u201cThe biggest guys all go in the extra-super-heavyweight class, and there\u2019s no upper limit there.  It\u2019s like Olympic weightlifting, only our biggest guys are a lot bigger than theirs.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo I could wrestle here?\u201d  Matt asked, excited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure, if you want to,\u201d the other boy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd being bigger a big help in wrestling,\u201d Carl continued.  \u201cReal food builds real men, Matt, real big men, while Joey and Brian and Brent are junk food statues.   You like to wrestle, to do things?  Stick with me and you\u2019ll grow and do well.  You want to wrestle, play football?  I introduce you to the coach.  American football is a good game - lots of big strong guys play.  Even more fat guys play as amateurs. I love American football,\u201d he added, as he rose from the table to get another plateful.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Carl stood up, without struggling or grabbing the table, Matt admired again his magnificent form.  The huge legs below the vast gut did look better than Joey\u2019s skinny legs, he had to admit, and the huge shoulders and arms looked really powerful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Carl returns, his plate heaping with lasagna, he notices that Matt has almost finished his plateful.  He urges Matt to go get some more food.  \u201cEat, eat, you will gain weight and be more attractive.  German girls love big, fat, strong guys like me, und I think American girls not much different.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt gets up and goes back for:<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Brad looked to be about a yard across the shoulders, and the gut that had bowled Matt over was no flat student wrestler\u2019s six-pack but a great round gut, yet Brad had distinctly said \u2018wrestling practice\u2019.

Look!\u201d he adds, pointing out a series of individual cups for various eating competitions.  \u201cWe have some fun awards too,\u201d he adds, \u201clike the \u2018cannonball\u2019 cup at Winterfest.\u201d<br>\r\nJust past the display case, at the foot of the stairs, Matt and Perry pass a poster of a hugely fat wrestler with the caption \u2018Think Big!\u2019. \u201cWow,\u201d says Matt, \u201cthis is all stuff fat guys can do.\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cOf course,\u201d replies Perry, \u201cthis is OSB, after all.

Or at least didn\u2019t - he was always on my case about watching my weight.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd he sent you here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I\u2019m starting to wonder.  Maybe it was my mum who convinced him I should go here - she can eat anything, and she never bugged me about what I ate or my weight.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cC\u2019mon you two, less talking, more eating,\u201d called Brian from the other end of the table.  \u201cLet him eat, Geno, c\u2019mon.  You\u2019re one of our champion feeders, Geno, we need you to eat not talk if we\u2019re going to win.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt turned to look at Brian.  All he\u2019d noticed during the quick introductions was the round, tanned face and blonde, surfer flat-top hair.  Now, though, he realised that Brian was:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

So fat, in fact, that he was sitting sort of sideways to the table, and eating with only one hand; his other hand couldn\u2019t reach around his belly, but seemed to be holding some sort of tube.  <br>\r\n\u201cWho\u2019s that at the end,\u201d Matt asked Geno in a whisper, after he\u2019d gotten about halfway through the fettucine.  \u201cHe\u2019s really fat!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s Brian,\u201d whispered Geno back.  \u201cHe\u2019s in the year ahead of me - two ahead of you.  He\u2019s about 200 pounds heavier than I am - he\u2019s one of the heaviest students in the school.  He\u2019s really serious about the eating contest.  Of course, eating is his best sport.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow can eating be a sport?\u201d asked Matt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSame as any other,\u201d Geno replied.  \u201cWe keep records of who can eat the most, the fastest, etc.  Brian\u2019s one of the school eating champions.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Matt ate, he didn\u2019t know where to look.  Geno\u2019s smooth, olive Italian skin, glossy black pony tail and laughing, infectious grin were in hot competition with Brian\u2019s tanned, broadly fattened face, blonde surf-cut and massive bulk of gut stretching out his crisp white shirt.  Adding to their visual appeal was that both were wolfing down fettucini like they hadn\u2019t eaten in months.  Matt, steadily making his way through his own large bowlful, was so fascinated by the sight of Geno and Brian going scarcely noticed when the server refilled his bowl.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Matt was nearing the bottom of his second four pound bowl of fettucini, the servers appeared with bowls of chocolate trifle and fruit salad in heavy syrup.  Matt leaned back from the table and groaned.  Enthralled by the gorging going on around him, Matt had eaten twice as much as he\u2019d ever eaten before, and his stomach felt like it would burst any minute.  His shirt was quite taut over his overstuffed gut.  Still, the scent of the chocolate tickled his nostrils, and he was desperately wanted to have some of the trifle.  He decided:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

When we\u2019re tried to get someone stuffed to the gills - like Brian, or sometimes me - we get one of the junior boys to massage their guts while they eat.  Or, you can do it to yourself the rest of the time.  You have to know how, it\u2019s essential.  Here, take your hand and place it here.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeno started to instruct Matt in the art of belly self-massage.  As the two of them rubbed - Geno\u2019s fat, olive hand placed over Matt\u2019s - Matt\u2019s gut started to feel less stretched.  Matt actually started to feel hungry again.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere, is that better?\u201d said Geno.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLots better, thanks Geno,\u201d said Matt, amazed.  \u201cNow I\u2019ve got room for dessert.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, be sure to help out other brothers when they need it,\u201d Geno said.  \u201cAnd practice on yourself - everybody\u2019s gut is a little different.\u201d  Geno motioned to the servers carrying the chocolate trifle.  \u201cI\u2019ll have three of those,\u201d he said confidently, pointing to the big plates, \u201cand the new guy here will have...\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeno paused so Matt could reply...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He couldn\u2019t possibly have been stealing your pencil - you\u2019ve only just come out of the principal\u2019s office.  Now, don\u2019t try lying to me,\u201d she went on, as Leo tried to interrupt. \u201cI\u2019ll note this occasion in your file, and the Principal will hear of it.  I don\u2019t know which is worse - that you tried to bully a new student on his first day, or that you tried lying to me about it.  Dismissed!  Go join your class!\u201d  Turning back to Matt, she went on more kindly, \u201cI\u2019m sorry you had to run into Leo before I got here, Matthew.  If he bothers you again, just let me or one of the prefects, know, ok?\u201d She smiled broadly, and then stepped to the door.  \u201cJerry, could you come here a minute?\u201d<br>\r\nA boy about Matt\u2019s age and height, but much fatter, stepped into the office.  \u201cJerry, this is Matthew.  Matthew, Jerry is in your dorm, dorm B, and will show you your room.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cPlease, Ms. Peach, it\u2019s Matt, not Matthew,\u201d Matthew says. <br>\r\n\u201cOK, Matt,\u201d says Ms. Peach. \u201cI\u2019ll just note that.  Jerry, help Matt take his bags up to his room, and then bring him back down here please, so the Principal can meet him.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cSure, Ms. Peach,\u201d replied Jerry.  \u201cCould I check my weight first?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cOf course,\u201d said Ms. Peach.  \u201cAny time I\u2019m here, you only have to ask.\u201d  She turned on the power to the digital scale next to her desk.

The faces, the limbs, the grass below their feet was so real you could almost feel the heat of the fire that burned behind them, but somehow it wasn't disturbing. In the way he seemed to have guided the paint it seemed almost peaceful, because you knew who was going to win.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You painted that?\" <br>\r\n\"Yea.\" Jerry shrugged as if the painting behind him like it was a messy sketch.<br>\r\n\"You guess? Its like the most beautiful painting I've ever seen!\"<br>\r\n\"Nah, its nothing.\" He climbed onto the bed beside him and lay back. \"I wish it came out better.\"<br>\r\n\"You must be crazy, but won't they get mad?\"<br>\r\n\"Nope, not since my grandad pretty much built this place.\"<br>\r\n\"That's cool,\" Matt sat on the bed that the other boy was splayed over on to get a better look at it. <br>\r\nHe stared at it a while before he glanced at Jerry who seemed to have been studying him and turned away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? Something wrong?\"<br>\r\n\"Nope, you want me to help you unpack?\"<br>\r\n\"You don't have to.\"<br>\r\n\"It's okay, lets go so I can show you around the place.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt pulled up his torn up suitcase to his own bed and unlocked it. Clothes popped out and hit him in the face. He cursed aloud annoyed to be embarassed in front of his new friend and began to struggle with his clothes stuffing them into random drawers. He stopped suddenly when he heard a light giggling besided him.<br>\r\n\"Maybe you should be nicer to your clothes,because yours don't seem to like you,\" Jerry reached out to help Matt untangle himself. He than, along with Matt began to fold the clothes and place them into their respectful drawers. As they worked they talked and before they knew it all of Matt's stuff was put away. Matt couldn't help ,but feel almost dissapointed, he hadn't had so much fun doing chores before. Jerry was definately something else. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we're all done, let's go.\"<br>\r\n\"Where?\"<br>\r\n\"Mm, how about we go to the grounds, I can show you the horses.\"<br>\r\n\"Sure.\"</span></div></div>",

It and A Dorm are for the littlest and youngest guys.  As you get bigger, you get to go in the closer dorms if you want.\u201d   <br>\r\nAs they passed the water cooler, Matt noticed that the display cases in the hallways had photos of old sports teams and graduating students.  Boy, were some of them fat!  He was about to ask Jerry about gym class and sports days when Leo Parkey stepped out of the washroom door right in front of them.  <br>\r\n\u201cSo, new guy, we meet again,\u201d he said sneeringly.  \u201cAnd this time, no Ms. Peach to save you.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cOh, buzz off, Leo,\u201d said Jerry.  \u201cYou maybe older than we are, but you\u2019re not any bigger than I am, and there\u2019s two of us.  Go bother somebody else.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWell, Jerry, I see you put on lots of weight over the summer - most of it in your lip,\u201d Leo snapped back.  \u201cGet out of the way while I introduce the new guy to how things are done around here.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cLeo, buzz off.

Matt took only an instant to realise what Jerry was doing, then rushed in himself.  Suddenly Leo found himself pinned to the wall by 600 pounds of flabby 14 year olds.  <br>\r\n\u201cHelp, Mac, help,\u201d whined Leo.<br>\r\n\u201cMac is Leo\u2019s brother,\u201d said Jerry.  \u201cHe\u2019s younger than Leo, but bigger.  He only comes sometimes, though - usually he\u2019s too busy playing games on the computer to bother. And every time Leo yelps for him, usually one of the prefects hears and comes.

He spits at you, as do all the others. \"You can expect a visit from us again, we deal directly in farts!\" he jokes. \"Oh, and if you ever tell anyone about our little shenanigans, we'll do that to you every single day until you graduate\".

The scent of baked beans, hard-boiled eggs and bacon, combined with your oversized oppressor's \"natural odors\" fills your nostrils before you get a chance to cover your nose.

He hopes teaching here will help him regain his lost weight!  What do you think, boys, can we help him grow?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe response to this was a chant that started softly and rapidly gained volume.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"grow, grow, Grow, GRow, GRoW, GROW, GGRROOWW!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce this died down, the headmaster dismissed the boys, and the cafeteria was suddenly filled with big and massive boys all heading out.

Well, I'll leave room for that.\"  He got up and started to unpack his bag.  Todd continued snacking, and once Matt was finished, he went and got some chips too.

This time he seemed to get up for more food whenever Todd did, as if his appetite were matching his 500 pound roomie's for hungriness.  By the time he started to feel full and stopped, Matt figured he'd eaten as much again as he ate at dinner!  He laid down his fork and knife and sat back to let the chocolate cake he'd just 'inhaled' join the pasta and potatoes down in his well-stuffed gut.  Matt figured he must have eaten about as much as he'd eaten at dinner, but he also noticed that there was a lot more pasta and sweet stuff on offer this time, compared to dinner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTodd, noticing the pause, said encouragingly, \"You have a remarkable appetite for somebody so small - you ate about as much as I have!  Are you always so hungry, or are you working on your 'freshman 50'?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've never eaten this much before in one day,\" Matt replied happily, feeling very full.  \"And I guess I am working on my 'freshman 50'.  Did you gain a 'freshman 50' when you first came here?  This isn't your first year here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I came three years ago, and I sure gained more than 50 pounds the first year.  You're what, about 250?  I was 240 when I came for grade six, and I put on 80 pound that year.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later, all the boys headed back to the dorms, and Matt fell asleep quickly with his full stomach.  In the morning, he awoke before his alarm, in anticipation of the first day of school, and hungry.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first day was mostly orientation for newbies like him, and passed quickly, as did the four big meals, and the snacks in between.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Heading to the gym late the next morning with the rest of his class of 'minor niners' Matt was feeling pretty good.  A huge breakfast, then English, then Math, and now Gym.  In the hallway outside Math class he snagged a huge chocolate muffin from the snack table, then munched it steadily as his class made their way down the wide hallways.  Matt reflected briefly that, while not nearly the size of his roomie Todd, he wasn't the smallest of the grade nines either.  And he was so looking forward to seeing Mr. McCrary in gym class - he had been impressed as hell with the huge size of the man at that first dinner, and now he'd get to see him up close and personal, and maybe even in gym shorts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside the gym doors, Mr. McCrary was waiting for them.  \"If you're not in shorts already, into the locker room and grab some,\" he said in his deep baritone.  \"The rest of you put your bags on the side and come sit for a minute.\"  Matt, alread in the usual OSB school outfit of sweat shorts and t-shirt, put his bag down and dropped to the floor near Todd, and another boy he'd met named Logan.  Logan, like Todd, had already been at OSB for a couple of years, and was over 400 pounds, Matt was sure.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right,\" said Mr. McCrary, once the few not in shorts had returned, \"welcome to gym class.  For those of you new here, this will be a gym class probably very different any you've had before.  For those of you who were in grade 8 here last year, this will also be different.  The Headmaster and the Board of Governors have expressed some concerns about the mobility of some of the student body, and they've hired me to help keep you all moving as you grow.  Some people argue that you can't stay mobile as you grow huge, but I'm here to show, and teach, you differently.  How many of you can do this?\" he asked, and dropped into a martial arts stance.  He then jogged about twenty feet, did a forward roll, came back up on his feet and did a jumping jack.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gym's wooden floor resounded with a heavy \"boom\" as his 900 pounds landed back on his feet.  \"Anybody want to try it?\" he asked, standing and grinning.  \"No?  Well, I don't expect you to do all that, but I am here to help you stay fit and mobile while you achieve your body's potential.  Anybody here swim?  Lift weights?  Do sumo?  Martial arts?  Those things I showed you are all from those 'fat guy' sports.  One of the things I had the school do when they hired me was upgrade the weight room, and the pool, and get the mats for a proper martial arts studio and sumo ring.  We'll spend a lot of time on those in class, and I want you to come other days too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt's brain was still boggling from the sight of a 900 pound man rolling back up on his feet - he scarcely heard the rest of McCrary's talk.  Suddenly the whole class was up on its feet and headed towards the weight room, where brand new benches welcomed them.  McCrary led them all through a short stretching routine.  Then, Matt spotted another new boy about his own size, Conor, while Todd spotted Logan on the next bench, and alternately the boys switched places.  Matt was surprised that he could bench almost as much as Todd, though Logan was stronger - he said he'd spent the summer at football camp.  Conor, who was much rounder than Matt, struggled to bench even 100 pounds.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHalf an hour of lifting, and then McCrary led them through more stretches, and then had them all jog the length of the gym. Then it was into the showers, where Matt could see that Conor looked to be all soft fat, while Logan had something of the husky football player showing in his big arms and shoulders.  Towelling off, Matt thought he could feel the 'burn' in his arms and legs, and by the time he got to the cafe for lunch he was ravenous. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWolfing down the Salisbury steak, chicken burgers and broccoli in cheese sauce on offer, Matt decided that he would go to the weight room or the pool on his 'off-gym' days - he had enjoyed McCrary's instruction,and the feeling of working out.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn hour's gorging past, it was off to history and science class for Matt and his classmates.  </span></div></div>",

Maybe even doubled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, the stress of the new school had led Matt's body to deplete its reserves a little in the weeks leading up to the new school year - he had probably dropped a pound or two, and certainly had depleted some of his fat cells a little.  This predisposed him to be hungrier than usual, once he relaxed.  At OSB, away from his parents, surrounded by food and fat guys, he did relax - no more the stress of being the class fatboy, of dreading gym class - in fact, his inner wonderings and fantasies about fat guys were answered and massively reinforced by meeting Todd, his 'nearly twice my size' roomie, and Mr McCrary, among others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, relaxed, surrounded by food and subtle encouragements everywhere to eat more, Matt's appetite takes off.  Probably doubles.  Four meals a day, encouragement, and endless opportunities to snack will do that to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, he's 'only' 264 pounds - and eating more like his 500 pound roomie Todd!  Where do the calories go?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, at first his body, assaulted by the thousands of extra calories, refilled those slightly depleted fat cells, and repaired the damage caused by the stress of anticipating school.  That, plus growing some new capacity in the digestive system, took care of maybe the first day's excess calories (though growing a bigger stomach and intestines, a bigger gut, takes more than a day).  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen his body cranked up its internal thermostat to burn off some more of the extra calories - Matt threw off the extra covers on his bed at night, because he was warm, not realising his body was just trying to cope with a flood of food...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGym class the second day of school provided his body with further relief - all that stretching, weightlifting, and jogging, left well-worked muscles feeling sore.  His body thankfully rushed calories into the breach, fixing the damage caused by heavy exercise and growing the muscles to cope with future workouts.  Swimming the next day worked other muscles, and his body rushed more calories to them, thankful to have something to do with the increasing flood of calories Matt was consuming, as he 'got into' the snacks between classes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, on the fourth day, his first Saturday at OSB, Matt's body couldn't cope any more with the flood of incoming food energy - all existing fat cells had been topped off, the damage from pre-term nervousness was fixed, his body temp was cranked (no flu virus would get any hold in his frame), his muscles bulged with all the calories spent repairing and enlarging their cells...  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nso it was time...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTime for Matt's body to do what every boy's body at OSB does...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrow new fat cells!  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, from day four on, Matt began to get fatter.   And fatter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, Matt didn't just get fatter - his digestive system also continued to stretch and grow, his muscles grew (and surprisingly fast - it turns out he's what the bodybuilders call an 'easy gainer') and of course his bones and heart and all the rest grew too, but from day four on, ...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt was gettin' fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust what OSB is all about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, a week after that first gym class, Matt has added nearly fiver pounds - though he doesn't know it, yet. A couple of pounds of muscle, three pounds of fat.  He feels great, and his lifting has improved in just one week!  So when we drop back in on our gaining boy, he's ...</span></div></div>",

But at OSB, he was quite ordinary - well, except for his appetite, and got praised and admired.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeven days in, and Matt was heading into gym class - just the third one of those he'd had.  His first gym class had a been a time of puzzlement and wonder - completely unlike any other gym class, ever, what with stretching, weightlifting, swimming, and not a team sport in sight!  They'd been told that gym class would be a variety of things, and Matt was actually looking forward to today, when they were supposed to have an introduction to wrestling.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, first, it was time for the weekly weigh-in.  Matt was looking forward to finding out what some of his classmates weighed - not everybody talked about it, but they were going to use a big walk-on scale for this, with a big display, so if he looked, he'd know everybody's weight!  It would be cool.  And, he knew he'd grown himself - how could he not have, he was eating as much as Todd, and more than most of the other grade nines, despite his 'small' size.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTodd was just ahead of him, and stepped onto the steel square.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"506,\" flashed up on the big display.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Another pound,\" Todd said to Matt, high-fiving him as they passed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt stepped on and the display flashed, \"261.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"SEVEN POUNDS!\" Matt said in shock and surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cool!\" Todd said, and then started a chant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"grow, grow, groW, grOW, gROW, GROW!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt just stood there, so surprised.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Matt, please move along\" Mr. McCrary requested.  \"Congratulations.  Good job!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt just moved in a stupor, scarcely seeing the demo of wrestling moves, or hearing it when he was partnered with...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Since he's not allowed to challenge any of you directly, he'll be glad to pass on some advice to anyone on our eating teams, or who is even just curious. Eating challenges, hmm.  We never have those here, do we?\" the headmaster asked ironically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe response to this was a chant that started softly and rapidly gained volume.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"eat, eat, Eat, Eat, EAT, EAT, EAT, EEAATT, EEEAAATTTTT!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce this died down, the headmaster dismissed the boys, and the cafeteria was suddenly filled with blubbery teenage blimps all pushing to leave. Matt joined them, slowly, his greatly filled belly feeling so good yet slowing him down. Slowly walking among so many massive fat boys, Matt's smaller frame regularly got slapped and bounced by other boys' flab making unexpected gyrations. Back in the dorm room, Matt dropped into the easy chair on his side of the room to rest for a minute, but was nearly asleep when Todd came in a few minutes later with a bag of chocolate chip cookies in hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where'd you get those?\" Matt asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Down the hall in the kitchen,\" Todd replied. \"Didn't think you'd want any after your good feed at supper, being a newby and all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I love cookies,\" Matt replied. \"I'll get some later.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You do know about supper?\" Todd asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought we just had supper,\" Matt replied..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, that was dinner, supper is just before bedtime. We all go back down to the cafeteria for it. It's an OSB thing. Eating just before bed makes you wake up fatter in the morning,\" Todd replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh wow, another meal.\" Matt said, impresssed. \"Well, I'll leave room for that.\" He got up and started to unpack his bag. Todd continued snacking, and once Matt was finished, he went and got some cookies too. Before he knew it, Todd was getting up from his chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Time to fill up again,\" Todd said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt followed him, and again the cafeteria was full of bulky boys chowing down.

Matt looked around more as he entered the cafe this time, and saw that there were boys younger than him, but not too many who seemed much smaller than him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt took a seat beside Todd, then followed Todd up to grab some food. This time he seemed to get up for more food whenever Todd did, as if his appetite were matching his 500 pound roomie's for hungriness - only nearly every time, Matt grabbed pasta.  Lasagna, fettucine, ravioli - it was an all-Italian, all-pasta feast for Matt. Plateful by plateful, he matched Todd, though Todd took burgers and chicken and other non-pasta things. By the time he was starting to feel full, Todd was visibly slowing, <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTodd, noticing Matt's slight pause, said encouragingly, \"You have a great appetite for somebody so small - you're eating as much as I am! Are you always so hungry, or are you pushing for your 'freshman 50'?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've never eaten this much before in one day,\" Matt replied happily, feeling very full. \"And I guess I am working on my 'freshman 50'. Did you gain a 'freshman 50' when you first came here? This isn't your first year here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I came three years ago, and I sure gained more than 50 pounds the first year. You're what, about 250? I was 240 when I came for grade six, and I put on 80 pound that year.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm nearly done, but I want some dessert.  How about you, Matt?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds good!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThree trips to the dessert zone later, Matt feels like he's about to burst, and so apparently does Todd.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I thought I'd get ahead of you, but I see not.  And I'm so full l don't even have room for my usual ice cream cone.  How about you, Matt?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just want to sit and digest for a few minutes,\" replied Matt, rubbing his gut a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later, all the boys headed back to the dorms, and Matt fell asleep quickly with his bellyfull of pasta. The next morning, he awoke before his alarm, hungry, and anticipating his first day of school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt's first day was mostly orientation for newbies like him, and passed quickly, as did the four big meals, and the snacks in between. Matt surprised himself with how hungry he alway felt, and again fell asleep quickly, stuffed with carbohydrates from supper.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span><br>\r\nSo Matt is happy at OSB, new fat roomie, new fat classmates, new fat teachers.  He's exploring his new school, he's enlarging his appetite, and he's settling into a new sort of life, but what's going on with that 5'6\", 264 pound body he hauled into OSB?  Because his appetite has grown - well, OK, grown hugely. In two weeks, doubled.  At least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, the stress going to a new school had led Matt's body to deplete its reserves a little in the weeks before Matt arrived at OSB - he had dropped a couple of pounds, and stress and travel had depleted some of his fat cells a little. This made him hungrier than usual, once he arrived - and at OSB, away from his parents, surrounded by food and fat guys, he relaxed and followed his hunger.  Where formerly he'd has the stress of being the class fat boy, at OSB he was just another minor nine - in fact, some of his subconscious wonderings about being fatter and his fantasies about what fat guys were like had come to vivid life at OSB, as he met kids like Todd, his 'nearly twice my size' roomie, and enormous teachers like Mr. McCrary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, relaxed, surrounded by food, guys who looked like his fantasies, and subtle encouragements everywhere to eat more, Matt's appetite expands.  Takes off, really. Doubles in days, and doesn't stop. Four meals a day, challenges and encouragement to eat more, and endless opportunities to snack will do that to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, Matt's 'only' 264 pounds - and eating more like his 500 pound roomie Todd! Where do the calories go?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, at first his body, assaulted by the thousands of extra calories, refilled those slightly depleted fat cells, and repaired the damage caused by the stress of anticipating school. That, plus growing some new capacity in the digestive system, took care of maybe the first day's excess calories (though growing a bigger stomach and intestines, a bigger gut, takes more than a day).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen his body cranked up its internal thermostat to burn off some more of the extra calories - Matt threw off the extra covers on his bed at night, because he was warm, not realising his body was just trying to cope with a rising flood of food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGym class the second day of school provided his body with some relief, as all that stretching, weightlifting, and other activity left well-worked muscles feeling sore. His body thankfully rushed calories into the breach, fixing the damage caused by heavy exercise and making the muscles grow to cope with future workouts. Swimming the next day worked other muscles, and Matt's body rushed more calories into them, thankful to have something to do with the increasing flood of calories Matt was consuming, as he 'got into' the snacks between classes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, on the fourth day, Matt's body couldn't find any more existing places to put the growing flood of incoming food energy - all existing fat cells had been filled right up, the damage from pre-term nervousness was fixed, his body temperature was cranked (no flu virus would get any hold in his doughy frame), and, mostly unseen under his pudge layer, his muscles were growing and bulging with all the calories spent repairing and enlarging their cells...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nso it was time...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTime for Matt's body to do what every boy's body at OSB does...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrow new fat cells!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, from day four on, Matt began to get fatter. And fatter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, Matt didn't just get fatter - his digestive system also continued to stretch and grow, his muscles grew (and surprisingly fast - it turns out he's what the bodybuilders call an 'easy gainer') and of course his bones and heart and all the rest grew too, but from day four on, ...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt was gettin' fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust what OSB is all about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, two weeks after that first gym class, Matt has added ten pounds - though he doesn't know it, yet, as he hasn't weighed himself. Four new pounds of muscle and 'frame', and six pounds of glorious fat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt feels great, and his lifting has improved in just two weeks! So when we drop back in on our gaining boy, he's ...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Sixty pounds in two months is excellent!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I'm up 22 pounds!\" Todd added.  \"I thought this'd be an easy year, but I need to keep ahead of Matt!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And so you are,\" McCrary observed, \"though you had a head start.  So what are you lifting today?\" McCrary then asked, turning the conversation back to class stuff.  The two boys spotted each other through a chest day, then cleaned up and went on to math class.</span></div></div>",

Todd joked that he and Matt had probably put on another 15 pounds that night, and while not literally true, Matt sure felt heavy and slow the next morning....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut a week later, Matt is again in gym class, having moved up his bench press weights again - as has Todd.

Instead, to encourage his charges to further up their weights and strengths, Mr. McCrary has arranged for a sumo ring to be installed!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt and Todd, of course, want to be competitive, but sumo is one place where sheer bulk conveys a big advantage - one that a 335 pounder, as Matt figures himself to be, cannot make up against somebody who outweighs him by nearly 200 pounds. But that's OK - Mr. McCrary has arranged the boys in classes by weight and height, not age, so Matt has other 300 to 350 pound opponents.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA lot of them are younger than he is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMost of them are shorter than he is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so he is often victorious... so much so that Mr. McCrary decides to move him up a weight class!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTodd, meanwhile, is in the midst of the weight class with the most boys in it, so doesn't do so well in all his matches.  McCrary regularly points out to his charges that sumo is about strength and speed and timing, as well as girth, and Todd decides he really needs to get stronger... so the weightroom competition with Matt remains intense.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSumo also provides a great physical outlet for the stresses of school life - not that you'd know these fat lads are stressed - so overall, Matt is incredibly happy about being at OSB.  Classes, gym, eating, gaming, studying, even belly barging with his classmates and even with Todd - Matt's life is good.  November seems to fly by, and then it's time for Thanksgiving. </span></div></div>",

I\u2019m late.  I\u2019m Brad.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cHi, Brad, I\u2019m Matt.  Practice?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, wrestling practice.  It starts in three minutes, and coach gets mad if we\u2019re late.  Are you new, what dorm are you in?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cDorm 3.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cGreat!  That\u2019s where I am.  Well, gotta go.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad ran off, the pounding of his heavy footsteps making the old wooden floors groan and shake.  Matt stared after him.  Brad looked to be about a yard across the shoulders, and the gut that had bowled Matt over was no flat athlete\u2019s gut but a great round sphere, yet Brad had said \u2018wrestling practice\u2019.  Matt wondered what other sports the school offered, as he made his down the hall to the stairs.  You\u2019d think a school that called itself \u201cObesity School for Boys\u201d would at least have elevators, but the stairs loomed ahead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he got close to the stairs he passed a lighted display case, with a series of trophies inside.  He read inscriptions on trophies for wrestling, weightlifting, swimming, football, and a brand new plaque for sumo wrestling.  A series of tartan ribbons surrounded a certificate for junior Scottish heavyweight events.  He also saw a house cup for eating, and a series of individual cups for various eating competitions, along with a cup for the \u2018best cannonball\u2019.  Just past the display case, at the foot of the stairs, was a poster of a hugely fat wrestler with the caption \u2018Think Big!\u2019. \u201cWow,\u201d thought Matt, \u201cthis is all stuff fat guys can do.  I wonder what gym class looks like.\u201d  He began to lumber up the stairs with his bags, feeling sore in his shoulders from the weight of them them, when a great, dark skinned figure loomed above him from the second floor landing.<br>\r\n\u201cHi there, are you Matt?\u201d the figure said.  \u201cI\u2019m Percy, the prefect in Dorm 3, and... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He grinned, and Matt got a view of a dazzling white set of enormous teeth.  Percy advanced down the stairs, and Matt could see that he was enormously broad across the shoulders and chest, with a gut and thick arms that filled his shirt.  His pants appeared to be painted on across enormous thighs.  \u201cWelcome to OSB.  We\u2019ve got your room all ready for you.  You\u2019ll be sharing with another new guy, Jeremy, who\u2019s also in ninth grade.  He even looks to be about your size.  He\u2019s out at the swimming pool right now, but I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll be in before lunch.\u201d  Percy bent over and effortlessly picked up Matt\u2019s heaviest suitcase.  \u201cI saw you got run into by Brad.  Don\u2019t worry about him, he\u2019s a great guy, but he\u2019s always late.  If you see him running, it helps to get out of his way - he has trouble slowing down.  I should be at wrestling practice too, but as prefect, I have to get you settled in first.\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Percy mentioned wrestling Matt looked at him again.  He could see why Percy would make a good wrestler - his legs looked strong, and even under a thick layer of fat his chest and arms bulged with muscle.  Matt asked, \u201cCan anybody join the wrestling team?  I thought wrestlers had to be under a certain size?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cUnder a certain size?  Nah, that\u2019s the World Amateur Federation, we don\u2019t follow their silly anti-fat rules.  Everybody can join the wrestling team here, Matt.  Why don\u2019t you come with me to practice, once we\u2019ve dumped your bags?  You can unpack later.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWhat about lunch? It\u2019s nearly noon.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s ok, the cafeteria waits lunch for us.  It\u2019s better to practise on an empty stomach, then eat - you eat more, and it all goes to your muscles. Do you want to come?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWell...\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t want to come, that\u2019s ok too.

If all the guys on the wrestling team look like Percy and Brad, Matt thinks, then maybe I\u2019ll join.  Matt found himself liking the prospect of wrestling Percy a lot, even if Percy was twice his size.  As Percy effortlessly vaulted up the stairs with Matt\u2019s heavy bag, Matt wondered just how he had become so strong.  Most of the fat guys Matt new couldn\u2019t run up stairs, let alone while carrying a heavy suitcase.  Percy must be incredibly strong!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere you are,\u201d said Percy, stopping to open a door.  He was scarcely breathing heavy, despite having bounded up a flight and a half of stairs.  \u201cRoom B-15, your haven for the rest of your schooling, if you want to stay.  B dorm is a lot of fun - lots of wrestlers here, but also some serious students, and we\u2019re not as rowdy as some, but we stick together.\u201d  He walked in and dropped Matt\u2019s suitcase on an inviting looking double bed.  \u201cAll the comforts a big guy could ask for,\u201d Percy went on.  \u201cFridge, microwave, desk, shelves, closet, bed, easy chair.  The showers and washroom are just down the hall.  Drop your bag and we\u2019ll go - unless you have a wrestling thong?  If you do, dig it out.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cNo, I don\u2019t.  I\u2019m too big for the team at my old school.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWell, you\u2019re certainly not too big for the team here,\u201d said Percy.  \u201cC\u2019mon, let\u2019s go then.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey head back down the stairs, Matt feeling slightly winded, and then Percy practically jogs down the hall towards the gym, pausing at the door so Matt can catch up.  \u201cYou should come jogging with me and Brad,\u201d said Percy, \u201cyou\u2019d be in better shape.\u201d  He holds the door for Matt, who steps in and sees,<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

C\u2019mon,\u201d<br>\r\n said the great dark figure from above.  He grinned, and Matt got a view of a dazzling white set of enormous teeth set in an enormously fat face.  Percy\u2019s white shirt stretched to cover a gargantuan gut that spilled out so far over his trousers that even looking up the stairs Matt couldn\u2019t see Percy\u2019s belt.  Huge legs splayed wide below the massive load of the gut.  Fat arms filled Percy\u2019s shirt sleeves and rested at a 45 degree angle against his fat pecs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan you help me with them?\u201d Matt asked Percy.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOnly once you get them up here,\u201d replied Percy.  \u201cI don\u2019t do stairs anymore if I can help it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt struggled the rest of the way up the flight of stairs to the landing.  Percy grabbed a bag from him, and waddled over to a door in the wall.  Inserting a key, he opened the door.  \u201cSpecial treat for your first day, I\u2019ll take you up in the elevator,\u201d he said.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy can\u2019t everybody use the elevator?\u201d asked Matt, as he set down his bags beside Percy.  Percy seemed even bigger when Matt was standing beside.  Percy seemed to occupy nearly half the elevator, his gut and love handles stretching his shirt and sagging below his belt, his fat pecs hanging around his side, his fat calves filling the bottom of his pant legs.  Percy jabbed with one very fat finger at the \u201c3\" button, and the elevator started moving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe elevators are old and slow, so the Principal reserves them for staff and prefects.  There are also a few very fat guys who aren\u2019t prefects who have permission to use them.  If you get fat enough, I\u2019m sure the Principal will give you a key.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow fat is fat enough?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cProbably fatter than you think.  How big are you, anyway?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c264 pounds.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh, Ms. Peach weighed you, did she?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes.  How big are you?\u201d Matt asked, deciding suddenly to be bold.  He couldn\u2019t explain it - Percy was grossly fat - but Matt thought Percy was attractive, somehow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c264,\u201d said Percy wonderingly.  \u201cHow old are you?  I weighed 250 back when I was eleven.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m fourteen,\u201d replied Matt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, you\u2019ve got some growing to do to catch up, then,\u201d replied Percy.  \u201cAs to when you might get a key to the elevators, I haven\u2019t heard of Mr. Walters giving one to any boy under 500 pounds, unless he was on crutches or in a wheelchair.  Better figure on doubling your weight pronto.  Of course, if you do that, you might end up a prefect, like me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow do they choose prefects?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, you have to be in grade 12, have good marks, and be a good role model.  Also definitely helps to be fat, though I\u2019m not the fattest,\u201d remarked Percy, slapping his vast belly with one hand.  His belly fat rippled under the impact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo how fat are you?  And if you\u2019re not the fattest, who is?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, Terry is the fattest prefect - he\u2019s the fattest guy on campus, he outweighs all the staff!  I\u2019m a few pounds lighter than him - I weigh 684,\u201d said Percy as the elevator doors opened again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c684 pounds!  Wow!\u201d replied Matt.  Even standing beside Percy, Matt found it hard to imagine that Percy weighed 400 pounds more than he did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, it\u2019s impressive,\u201d said Percy, slapping his gut again for good measure. \u201cThat\u2019s why I don\u2019t do the stairs if I can help it - it takes a lot of work to haul this gut up stairs.  I came to OSB when I was nine, and haven\u2019t looked back since.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow big were you when you were nine?\u201d asked Matt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, I was already a tubby tyke,\u201d replied Percy.  \u201cI weighed 150 then. Come on,\u201d he said, slowly waddling down the hall, \u201cI\u2019ll show you your room.\u201d  Matt watched Percy waddle, fascinated.  Percy clearly could move - but various bits of his body bounced greatly as he did so, fat thighs slapping and rubbing, huge arms bouncing as Percy swung them back and forth for balance.  The floor creaked gently under his feet as he moved.  Percy stopped in front of a brown door and opened it.  \u201cRoom B-15 is all yours.  If you hurry and drop your bags, you can ride down with me in the elevator to lunch.  Dorms eat together here, so always look for table B.\u201d  Matt stepped into the room and found:<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span><br>\r\nMatt stepped into room B-15 and was impressed to find that it looked like a decent bedroom, if a little spare.  There was a double bed, a big window, a set of shelves from floor to ceiling, a desk, a comfy chair, and a closet.  There was also a small fridge and atop it, a microwave.  It also was a single room, when he had been expecting to have to share - the school\u2019s brochures had said little about the dorms, and he hadn\u2019t really read them, anyway.  He wondered where the nearest grocery store was, so he could keep the little fridge stocked.  He dropped his bags by the bed, and went to join Percy.  Coming up to Percy, he again marvelled at Percy\u2019s sheer size; the fat gut that rolled so far out over the waist of the pants, the hugely fat pecs - tits, really - the draped down to his gut, the double chin beneath the fat cheeks.  Matt also noticed some non-uniform stuff Percy was wearing - the heavy gold hoop earring, the heavy gold chain showing against the dark skin at the open neck of his shirt, and the heavy gold wrist chain.  Percy\u2019s short, curly hair was cut in a flat-top - and on the back of his head, a thick pad of fat extended down his neck.  Matt wondered if Percy came from the inner city, or if his parents were rich.  Instead of asking that, though, he asked Percy, \u201cI don\u2019t completely get it about this school.  Are the kids here all trying to get fat?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh yeah,\u201d replied Percy.  \u201cThat\u2019s why the school exists, for guys who are fat or want to get fat.  Most kids here are like me - I was a fat kid, and I wanted to get fatter.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy do you all want to get fatter?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t you?  Fat is cool, Matt.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure!  I want to do hip-hop, and just look at the fat guys in that.  I want to be just like Big Pun, and he did his best music when he was over 600 pounds.  I\u2019ve got the weight, I\u2019ve got the voice, I\u2019ve even got the moves, now I\u2019m just trying to be discovered.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow, I had no idea he was so big.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere are lots of big people in music, it\u2019s just that nobody talks about them.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt and Percy get to the elevator, and Percy inserts his key.

Now we\u2019ve gotta use the stairs.\u201d  Percy turned and waddled back to his room, emerging a moment later with a big bar of chocolate.  \u201cGetting this big bod down the stairs takes a lot of energy, I\u2019m going to have a snack first,\u201d he said to Matt, his mouth full of chocolate.  \u201cTake a piece.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure,\u201d said Matt.

Brian Wilson of the Beach Boys was pretty big, and got really fat later.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWas Big Pun always fat?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, he got fat after he got successful. He was only 200 pounds when his first album came out, was into boxing and stuff.  But then he started to put on weight - he said that he \u201cate until he couldn\u2019t see his feet.\u201d  When he was 28, he was over 700 pounds, but still recording, when he had his heart attack.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDid being so fat kill him?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, being fat don\u2019t kill anybody.  He already had a heart condition, and he probably did a lot of alcohol and drugs on the road with his touring.  That\u2019s what killed him.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you rap like him?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh yeah.  I call myself \u2018Fat P\u2019 for my album.  I sound a bit like Big Pun, but I also do stuff like that English crooner, Rik Waller.  He\u2019s fairly fat too - about 300 pounds,\u201d Percy added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, guess we\u2019d better go down the stairs,\u201d Percy went on, looking back one last time at the elevator.  The red \u201cout of service\u201d light still glowed red.  \u201cI\u2019d better go first.  If I fell on you, I\u2019d probably kill you, I\u2019m so much bigger than you are,\u201d Percy said.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he swung one fat leg down on to the first step, the shudders of the motion travelled up his fat leg and through his fat butt.  From the back, Matt could see how Percy\u2019s fat calves and thighs and butt filled his uniform pants. Everytime Percy moved, the seams in his pants strained.  His bottom half would have been most impressive, except that it was eclipsed - literally - by the huge fat gut that hung over it.  The shudders from Percy\u2019s legs travelled up and made his huge love handles vibrate, though their motion was mostly produced by the vast swing of Percy\u2019s gut from side to side.  Matt could see why Percy didn\u2019t like taking the stairs - it took phenomenal muscles and balance to keep all that flab in motion, and upright.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt was mesmerised by the motion of Percy walking down the stairs, and as he stepped down himself, found himself daydreaming about what it would be like to be as big as Percy.

I had a good year last year, and got busy this summer.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, the software business is really taking off.  I had to travel to Los Vegas and Orlando to promote it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLos Vegas is the land of the buffet, fella.  You must have enjoyed that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, yeah, I figure at least 10 of my gain was put on that week in Vegas.  It was a non-stop gorgefest.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, and this is Matt.  He\u2019s new this year.  He\u2019s 14, but only 264.  Do remember being that small?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, but I must have been 11 at the time.  Matt, you\u2019ve got some catching up to do, if you\u2019re going to pull your weight here at OSB.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cPull my weight?\u201d said Matt, puzzled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, OSB isn\u2019t called \u2018Obesity School\u2019 for nothing,\u201d replied Terry.  \u201cThe school expects every boy to gain as he is able.  Do you like to eat?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, when my parents don\u2019t have me on a diet.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe only diet you\u2019ll see here is one to help you gain,\u201d said Terry.  \u201cWe should go down to lunch.  Is that elevator working yet?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy, Terry and Matt look over at the elevator to see that the \u2018out of service\u2019 light is <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I hate stairs.  They should just replace the elevator - or move our dorm to the ground floor.\u201d  He waddled off towards the staircase.  \u201cI\u2019ll go first, that way I won\u2019t fall on anyone.\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy and Matt followed in his wake.  Matt was fascinated to watch the two very fat boys waddling along - each of their bodies bounced and rippled in different ways, with Percy\u2019s gut sloshing from side to side, while Terry\u2019s fat butt seemed to bounced up and down more.  As they passed, the old wooden floors creaked under their heavy footsteps.  Matt wondered just how many other guys here weighed 500 pounds or more.  He\u2019d never met anyone so big before coming, and here were a pair of healthy, happy guys not much older than he who were absolutely enormous.  He wondered if he\u2019d be that big by the time he graduated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three boys rambled down the stairs slowly, and in the hallway were joined by many other boys on their way to lunch.   Matt had never seen so many fat guys in his life - and only the youngest seemed to be much smaller than he was.  As he entered the cafeteria, Matt grabbed a tray and followed along behind Percy, who with Terry headed straight to a counter marked \u2018Hot dishes\u2019.  Over to the left he saw a counter marked \u2018Fast food\u2019, and a very tubby boy a bit younger than he was getting a pile of hamburgers.  There were also counters of various marked \u2018Salad\u2019, \u2018Sandwiches\u2019, \u2018Soup\u2019, \u2018Bread\u2019, and \u2018Desserts\u2019, and a collection of drink dispensers with milk, pop, and juices.  A large ice-cream freezer sat at one end.  Percy asked the server for Hungarian goulash, and was given a bowl the size of a gallon ice cream tub.  Matt looked at the counter and asked for the roast beef.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow much, dear?\u201d asked the large woman behind the counter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA lot,\u201d said Matt, suddenly feeling very hungry.  The server passed him a huge plate mounded high with sliced beef, roast potatoes, and glazed vegetables.  \u201cAre you new?\u201d she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes,\u201d replied Matt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, if you want any more, just come back,\u201d she said.  \u201cHave a good lunch!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt looked at the enormous mound of food on his tray, and wondered if he could eat it all.  It looked like three or four days supper, not one lunch.  He noticed other, bigger guys getting even bigger servings - some of them on platters.  He got himself an enormous glass of milk and headed out into the cafeteria seating, where he noticed Percy waving to him.  As he got closer he saw that one group of tables had \u201cB\u201d painted on their tops, and on the backs of the chairs.  Percy was seated at the end of one table.  Matt sat near him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThese are the tables for B dorm,\u201d Percy told him between mouthfuls.  \u201cYou should always eat at your house tables.  Meet Jeremy, Tod, James, Jerzy, Karl, Joey, and Hiro.  Over there are Paul, Brad, Randy, Rob, Raul, Rico, Leonard, and Brian.  There are more coming.  Guys, this is Matt, and its his first day.  He\u2019ll be in room 15.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWelcome Matt,\u201d said several of them in chorus.  Matt looked around the table, and had the uncomfortable feeling that, aside from Hiro, he was the smallest guy at the table - and Hiro looked younger than him.  Joey, he noticed, was the tubby boy he\u2019d seen getting a heap of hamburgers at the fast food counter - his gut looked even bigger seated, and Matt thought he must be over 300 pounds.  Karl was blond, not tall but big - 500, maybe 600 pounds, though not as big as Percy, Matt thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at the heaping mounds of food on their trays, he thought to himself, \u2018I\u2019m going to have to eat a lot more to keep up with these guys.\u2019  As he scooped up some mashed potatoes, he noticed how intently the other guys at the table were eating - no looking up and around, no joking, just the steady motion of fork or spoon delivering food to their mouths.  Some of them had spoons and forks much bigger than the standard cafeteria ones he was holding - he wondered if they were personal, or if there was a special rack of them somewhere. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe worked his way steadily through the heaping plateful - the food was delicious, and when he got to the end, he wished he\u2019s grabbed some bread to sop up the gravy.  He sat, happy to have finished, when he realised that he didn\u2019t feel full yet - he saw other guys going back for seconds, or for a burger or three, or heading straight to the dessert section.  In fact, as he sat, he felt hungry.  Matt decides to:<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He decided to head back for more roast beef and potatoes.  When he got there, though, he noticed that they had lasagna as well, so he asked the server for a big plateful.  On the way back to the table, he grabbed a litre glass of milk and a couple of huge kaiser rolls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, Matt, I was hoping you'd go back for more,\" said Percy.  \"That first plateful wasn't nearly enough lunch for a growing guy, especially since we here in B dorm pride ourselves on our ability to eat.  Even Hiro, our resident Japanese skinny guy, can eat - can't you, Hiro?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only skinny compared to you, Percy,\" replied Hiro, looking up from shovelling a mountain of mashed potatoes into his mouth.  \"Back home I'm a giant.  I love to eat!  This is my fourth plateful, and I'll eat another one before I hit dessert.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you really from Japan?\" Matt asked Hiro.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, yes, from Yokohama.  My parents sent me to OSB because I want to be a great sumo wrestler, and they think, \u2018everything bigger in America, American school will make little Hiro bigger.'  And they are right, I get bigger everyday.  My aim: to be at least as big as Kottobepu.  Even better would be as big as Akebono.\"<br>\r\n\"How big is he?\" Matt asked.<br>\r\n\"When he was first Yokozuna, 498 pounds.  Later he grew to 520 pounds.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow,\" said Matt.  \"And he could still wrestle and everything?\"<br>\r\n\"Oh, yes.  His great weight was part of the reason he became champion, and it was easier for him to stay champion as he kept growing.  He stayed Yokozuna for eight years!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Was he the biggest sumo ever?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no, Konishiki was bigger.  He was 626 pounds.  But he wasn't as successful - his fat got in the way sometimes, and his knees were bad.  He only made it to the third rank.  It would be great if I could get as big as him. \" Hiro finished off his potatoes and headed back to the serving counter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt dug into his lasagna with renewed hunger.  Boy, the food here tasted good!  He finished it off almost before he realised and went back for a third, getting a grin and a thumbs up from Percy on his return.   When he'd shovelled his third plateful in he headed for the dessert counter.  It was long and had several servers behind it, busy piling up chocolate cake, apple crisp, pumpkin pie, New York cheesecake, and a host of other sweet things onto enormous plates - the same size plates, in fact, as the main course!  Matt grabbed a couple of enormous cookies off a plate on the counter while he waited for the server to finish piling up apple crisp for the boy in front of him.  \"Now be sure to put lots of ice cream on that,\" she advised as he waddled off.  Matt stepped up and she asked, \"What would you like?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt replied, <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He\u2019s not surprised when the server offers him the whole thing - though he is starting to feel full, and wonders if he can eat it all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt brings his cheesecake back to the B dorm table, and is not surprised when Percy reappears carrying not one, but three pies on a tray.  The first piece of cheesecake is succulent, the second equally good, but by the time Matt gets into the fourth, he\u2019s feeling beyond full - truely stuffed.  He sips a bit of milk and tries to slowly finish the fourth, wondering if he can face the fifth piece.  Percy notices his hesitation and asks, \u201cMatt, are you slowing down?  C\u2019mon, you can finish that!\u201d  <br>\r\nPercy starts chanting gently, \u201cMatt!  Matt! Matt!\u201d  He is joined, one by one, by the rest of the dorm.  Matt lifts the remainder of the fourth slice to his lips and slowly chews it.  He picks up the fifth piece and Percy shifts to, \u201cGo, Matt, go!  Go, Matt, go!\u201d  Chewing and sipping alternately, Matt slowly gets the rest of the fifth slice down.  He then sits back and looks at the sixth piece.  Can he eat it?  Percy and the dorm keep chanting gently, while Hiro comes up and puts a hand on Matt\u2019s belly.  \u201cLoosen, yes?\u201d he asks, then undoes Matt\u2019s belt and top pants button.  Matt picks up the sixth and last piece of cheesecake and begins to chew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, slowly, the last piece disappears.  A cheer goes up from the B dorm table.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Matt sits there, breathing gently, feeling like his stomach will explode at any moment, other members of B dorm congratulate him - some even come round his chair to pat him on the shoulders.  He suddenly feels like \u201cone of the gang\u201d - a warm feeling that competes with the feelings of discomfort in his bloated belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he\u2019s sitting there in the warm glow of B dorm, there\u2019s a movement down at one end of the cafeteria.

It used to say, \u201812 persons or 2000 pounds\u2019, but somebody has painted over the \u201812' and painted a red \u20184' in its place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy notices Matt looking up.  \u201cYeah, somebody painted that over to \u20184', but even that\u2019s not true,\u201d says Percy, \u201c\u2018cause four of us prefects would overload this elevator.

The elevator sinks an inch under his weight.  \u201cBut not before we graduate, I expect.\u201d  Terry thumbs the button for \u201c1\" and the elevator lurches downwards, then begins to descend smoothly.  It lurches equally to a halt, and when the doors open, it\u2019s a couple of inches below level of the floor - not that Matt can see this, through the bulk of Terry, but he does notice the elevator rise a bit as Terry steps off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt and Percy follow Terry off the elevator, and as the trio make their way slowly down the hallway towards the cafeteria, Matt asks Terry, \u201cWhat did you mean, \u2018The only diet you\u2019ll see here is one to help you gain,\u2019?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou mean, you don\u2019t know what OSB is all about?\u201d says Terry, in surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I know it\u2019s a school for fat boys - that\u2019s obvious...\u201d Matt begins, but Percy cuts him off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou don\u2019t get it yet Matt, do you?  OSB is not just a school for fat guys - it\u2019s a school - THE school - for guys who want to get fatter.  If your parents sent you here, they must expect you wan to get big - really big.  Didn\u2019t they say anything to you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot really,\u201d replies Matt, furiously thinking.  They really hadn\u2019t said anything about what OSB would be like, except that he\u2019d \u2018fit in well\u2019 and \u2018be comfortable there\u2019 - as the school had \u2018good academics\u2019 and produced \u2018well-rounded students\u2019.  \u2018Well-rounded students\u2019?!  Looking at Percy and Terry, you could say that again.  It suddenly struck Matt that his parents must have known this would happen - in fact, probably wanted this to happen.  His fat dad had always encouraged him to watch his weight, but every attempt at putting him on a diet had ended as soon as he was unhappy - which didn\u2019t usually take long, as Matt liked to eat.  His parents must INTEND him to get fatter, he suddenly realised, and they didn\u2019t want this to happen in the brutal atmosphere of a school in New York City, where he would be teased, so they\u2019d sent him here to this safe place.  He remarked, after a long pause for thought, \u201cI guess my parents must expect me to get fat.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMatt, if they\u2019re paying OSB\u2019s fees, they WANT you to get fat,\u201d replied Percy.  \u201cThis place ain\u2019t cheap, unless you\u2019re on scholarship?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh no,\u201d replied Matt.  \u201cDad wrote them a cheque.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, then he must want you to get fat!\u201d remarked Terry.  \u201cStick with us, and I\u2019m sure you will.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the trio got to the cafeteria doors, they ...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Matt also notices that Percy has added some personal things to his school uniform - big gold hoop earrings, a thick gold chain showing against the dark skin at the open neck of his shirt, and a heavy gold wristwatch. Percy\u2019s  tightly curly hair is shaved short on the sides and back of his head, making obvious the thick padding of fat on the back of his head that extends down his neck. Given all the heavy gold, Matt wonders if Percy\u2019s parents are rich. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead of asking that, though, Matt asks Percy, \u201cI don\u2019t get it about this school - are the kids here all trying to get fat?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh yeah,\u201d replies Percy. \u201cThat\u2019s why the school exists, for guys who are fat or want to get fat. Most guys here are like me - I was a fat kid, and I wanted to get fatter. Don\u2019t you want to be fat? Fat is hip, Matt - fat is in.  Fat is Phat!  I want to do hip-hop, and just look at the fat guys in that - I\u2019ll be just like Big Pun - he did his best music when he was over 600 pounds.

Matt knows he shouldn\u2019t stare, but the sight of Percy\u2019s body undulating as he moves mesmerises Matt. Percy is so fat!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile they wait for the elevator, Matt clears his throat nervously.  \u201cPercy, can I ask you something?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cSure,\u201d replies Percy.  <br>\r\n\u201cAre all the guys here fat like you and Paul?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWell, there\u2019s not many as fat as me, but all the guys at OSB are fat, sure.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cNobody\u2019s parents are trying to make them follow a diet?\u201d Matt continues.<br>\r\n\u201cHeck no, Matt!\u201d Percy replies as he stepped onto the elevator.  Matt notices that the elevator drops slightly as it takes up the strain of Percy\u2019s enormous bulk.  \u201cThe only diet a guy here would go on is one to get bigger \u2018n\u2019 fatter!

Have a gaining summer?  Robby, this is Matt, he\u2019s new in B. Matt, this is Robby. He\u2019s another Prefect, in fact he\u2019s the Head Prefect, \u2018cause he\u2019s the biggest, heaviest guy on campus. How\u2019re you doing anyway, Robby, you old hog?\u201d As Percy finishes he slaps Robby on his ample gut.

And, yes, I had a very good summer - isn\u2019t it obvious?\u201d  Robby makes his massive gut sit out even further, and bounces it  up and down slightly. He grins at Matt\u2019s look of awe, and flexes one of his tremendous arms, making the seams on the shirt sleeve look as if they will burst.  \u201cIt was such a good summer, I set a school record when I weighed in - I\u2019m up to 714!  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c714! Boy, old Peach must have been drooling. How much of a gain is that since June?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c26,\u201d Robby replies. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c26?

But you look bigger too. How did your summer go?  Pack on a few?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh yeah. I kicked back, played a few gigs, did a little recording, and a lot of eating. I\u2019m up an even hundred over last year.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood stuff!  That makes you what, 675?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c684! I\u2019m up to a 90 waist!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTen inches more than me.  You really are one fat fraud, aren\u2019t you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYup!\u201d replies Percy proudly.  \u201cNone of this sports muscling stuff for me - I\u2019m an all-fat musician!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou see Matt,\u201d says Robby, turning to Matt, \u201cPercy and I are the two ends of gaining here at OSB - we both love to eat, and we\u2019re both big, but I play sports and work-out, while Percy here just does the lazy musician thing.  It means that he has a lot bigger gut than me, even though I outweigh him.  I can outlift and outrun him too!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, musclehead, well we smooth music types don\u2019t have to run anywhere - we can hire people for that!  So, did you get anywhere over the summer?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, went to a competition in Los Vegas - that was fun!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, Los Vegas is the land of the buffet, fella. You must have enjoyed that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, yeah, I figure at least ten of my gain was put on that week in Vegas. It was a non-stop gorgefest.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow!\u201d says Matt, his eyes wide.  \u201cTen pounds in a week!\u201d he repeats quietly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, Matt, that\u2019s not unusual for us fat guys,\u201d says Robby.  \u201cBy the looks of you, you could do with a few ten pound weeks - you\u2019ve got some catching up to do, if you\u2019re going to pull your weight here at OSB.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPull my weight?\u201d said Matt, puzzled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, OSB isn\u2019t called \u2018Obesity School\u2019 for nothing,\u201d replied Robby. \u201cThe school expects every boy to gain as he is able. And the different houses compete to see who can eat the most.  Do you like to eat?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, when my parents don\u2019t have me on a diet.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe only diet you\u2019ll see here is one to help you gain!\u201d said Robby. His demanding paunch rumbled its hunger, and Percy\u2019s more eye-catching gut joined in. \u201cLet\u2019s go get lunch!\u201d The two fat boys moved off, leaving Matt to trail along behind them.  From behind, their two huge bodies provide a symphony of moving flesh - though Matt did notice that Robby seemed to move his tonnage with more ease and control than Percy did.

It looks like a cross between Hogwart\u2019s castle and an eating competition - which, Matt later would realise, was EXACTLY what it was.  Percy and Robby\u2019s arrival brings cheers and hoots of recognition from many of the other students, and as they waddle up the central aisle, many hands extend to them for high fives as they pass.

Matt cranes his neck to see, as Robby reaches the end of Table D, and turns to address his house.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, as you can all see, I\u2019ve had a GREAT summer!\u201d says Robby grinning.  \u201cBut I\u2019m glad to be back at OSB - this year is going to be fun!

Covered in a mountain of food, it is rapidly joined by two others pushed by two other cooks.  \u201cJuan Gordo couldn\u2019t eat all this last year, and I bet you can\u2019t eat it all this year.  C\u2019mon, prove me wrong!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a moment\u2019s silence round the hall, one voice at table D resumes the chant, and others around the hall quickly join in.  \u201cRobby!

There wasn\u2019t a skinny guy, or even an average guy, in the place.

Taking a soup spoon, he sat at the nearest table and dug into the bowlful, wolfing it down as if he hadn\u2019t eaten in weeks.  The ice cream was good - rich and smooth and not too hard or too soft.  In no time, he had finished the bowl and gone back for a second - this time, taking raspberry cheesecake and rocky road flavours.  The second bowl vanished nearly as fast as the first, and Matt went back for a third, filling the bowl with cherry vanilla and chocolate cookie dough.  When he was nearly through this third bowl, he heard a noise coming from the kitchen doors of the cafeteria.  A huge man burst through them and said,<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He looks around and sees that the missing sheets and pillow are just dumped on the other bed in the room, which is otherwise clean.  There's a rattle at the door, then the sound of a key in a lock, and another boy comes in.  He smiles and says, \"You must be Matt.  I'm Sunny.  I hear you had a run-in with Brian.

Matt noticed in passing that the photos of the head boys of each class were full-length shots - and that the head boys were all fat, really fat.  As he went he noticed photos of sports teams too - but not all sports, mostly sumo, football, wrestling, and weightlifting.  And all the boys in those photos looked fat too.  \u2018Wow,\u2019 he thought to himself, \u2018they must not mind guys getting fat here.\u2019  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNear the end of the hallway Mr.  Pots slows his waddling gait by a pair of double doors.  Making sure that Matt is right behind him, he steps up to the doors, puffs out his impressive belly, and pushes his gut into the doors to open them, leaving his hands at his sides.  \u201cFreezerburn!\u201d says Matt approvingly.  \u201cYou\u2019re fat enough to open doors without touching them!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, my belly touches them,\u201d says Mr.  Pots, grinning.  \u201cWelcome to the heart of OSB, our cafeteria.

At least if we die from a heart attack due to high cholesteral we will die happy, eating whatever we want. The adminatraters do not care. Rules are rules.

Matt shakes his head no, but just as the candy passes back to Grant, his gut rumbles noisily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, you may not want it, but your stomach does!\u201d says Grant with a grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Matt sits there, trying hard not to think about dieting, one of boys seated on the left (where the \u201cover 275s\u201d are having their diet food)  noisily pushes back his chair, and heads towards the serving counter where Mr. Pots is standing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the boy walks, Matt realises that he is truly, awesomely FAT.  No way he could weigh only 300 pounds!  Matt\u2019s not good at guessing, but he reckons the boy is at least 400 pounds - his huge white uniform shirt is stretched tautly across a belly that sags forward over the beltline of his navy uniform chino pants.  The boys\u2019s round, fat face seems to sit directly on his fat padded shoulders, thanks to the double chin that totally obscures his neck.  As he gets closer you see he\u2019s got a gold stripe on the collar of his shirt.  As he gets closer to the serving counter, the boy speaks, in a rumbling bass voice that appears to come from somewhere in his cavernous gut, \u201cNice salad Potsie, now what\u2019s for dinner?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNothing more for you, fatso, until you lose that sagging pot!\u201d says Mr.  Pots, rubbing his own massive gut with apparent pleasure.  \u201cGood food\u2019s reserved for skinnies and newbies like the guy who just came in!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe huge boy turns to Matt.  \u201cWill you help me out?  Potsie\u2019s starving me.  I\u2019ll just waste away if I don\u2019t get some of that pot roast!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, Matt\u2019s really confused.  He wonders how, if fat guys are put on a diet here, how did this guy grow from the \u201cobese\u201d line of 275 pounds to his current colossal size?  Why is Pots, who\u2019s at least twice the size of your dad, trying to enforce a diet on a guy for whom it\u2019s clearly not working?  Speaking of which, why is a fat guy like Pots cook in a school that puts fat boys on diets?  Pots has to be well over the 275 mark too?  What\u2019s going on?  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt hates the idea of diets, and at this moment he has a terrible mental flash that the year ahead will be a miserable year from hell in deepest, darkest Oklahoma.  Maybe, says the despairing, homesick part of his mind, his parents won\u2019t even let him come home at Christmas...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he\u2019s sitting there, drowning in morosity, Grant passes the candy in front of Matt again.  Despondent and confused, he takes some, forgetting all about his intended diet.  All at once, the two tables of boys jump up and scream, \u201cSURPRISE!!\u201d and Mr.  Pots beams at Matt.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCheer up lad, it\u2019s all a joke!  There\u2019s no diets here - this is the OBESITY School for Boys, after all.\u201d He continues, \u201cWhich is not to say that you don\u2019t have to eat your veggies, in whatever form you choose - smothered in cheese sauce, say - but you get to eat as much of everything else as you want.\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing Matt\u2019s shocked face, he continues more quietly.  \u201cThe boys just helped me set up this little joke for you, that\u2019s all.  No way Mr. Rocco here ever made it to his current size on any diet.  What size are you up to these days, Rocco?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe huge boy with the stripe on his shirt collar, whose dazzling smile lights up his olive complexion, reaches out to grab Matt\u2019s hand.  \u201cWelcome to OSB, newby!  My name\u2019s Robby Rocco.  You\u2019re going to have fun here.\u201d  He turns towards the cook.  \u201cFor your information, Pots, and that of my friends, when I weighed in yesterday I was...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Yet, inside, I knew I was meant to be fat - my dad is a big fat guy, my uncle is a huge fat guy, and my cousins are all fat.  Once I got here, surrounded by all these fat brothers, I relaxed.

His stomach gurgles loudly, and Matt feels a wave of confidence and hunger roll through his tubby body.  Looking around at all these happy fat guys, he sudden decides he\u2019s going to be fat too. \"Well,\u201d he goes on, bravado creeping into his voice, \u201cI intend to break the school record then!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. Potts smiles at his enthusiasm, and hands him an enormous plate - a trencher, really - of food.  Potts had heard lots of newly arrived boys at OSB boast as Matt just had, but they all slowed down after the first week or two . . .Matt would be the same, he expected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut all those years of abuse as a fat kid, coupled with admiration for his fat father, subtle encouragement from his mother, and the great genes he\u2019d inherited from both of them, would all come together for him at OSB.  He ate that meal like he had never eaten before - and his appetite and gaining didn't slow down at all! In fact , Matt grew and grew and grew, so that by the next September, he would be 500 pounds!  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut that\u2019s getting ahead of the story.  Matt took the massive trencher of food back to his seat and dug in like he\u2019d never seen food before.  His boast, plus his smallish (for a 14 year old at OSB) body had attracted notice. Robby was the first to speak up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to have to eat a lot more than that to break my record!\u201d As Robbie speaks he hoists his fat body off his seat to head back for more food. \u201cI\u2019m going to be 450 before I finish eating today!  What do you weigh, anyway?\u201d he asks, pausing behind Matt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c264 when the office weighed me today!\u201d replies Matt, shoving back his chair too.  \u201cBut I\u2019m sure I\u2019ve gained already!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKeep eating and you will!\u201d smiles Robby.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGo for it, Matt!\u201d Albie adds as Matt passed.  Matt and Robby head back to Mr. Pots for refills - heaping mounds of pot roast and mashed potatoes, and broccoli smothered in cheese.  On the way back Robby grabs a loaf of cheese bread, and Matt does the same. Although Matt was a lot smaller than Robby, he matches Robby bite for bite through that meal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re doing really well!\u201d Robby admits as he headed over to the dessert counter, with Matt hard on his heels.  \u201cI don\u2019t usually have someone matching my intake.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, well, thanks for showing me the ropes,\u201d replies Matt.  \u201cTomorrow I\u2019ll break off on my own.  Or maybe Grant will join me,\u201d he adds as Grant comes up beside them.  \u201cI might need someone to encourage me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure!\u201d says Grant.  \u201cMaybe we\u2019ll help each other eat more.  I\u2019d like to gain more weight this year than last.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSounds good!  So, what\u2019s good here?\u201d asks Matt as the three arrive at a table heaping with cakes, pies, cookies, and other sweet goodies.  Beside the long table is a big ice cream freezer with massive bowls waiting to be filled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s all good Matt!\u201d grins Robby, scooping up a whole pie.  He takes it over to the freezer and expertly adds a mound of ice cream on top.  \u201cThough I\u2019m a pie a la mode guy myself.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll go for the chocolate cake!\u201d adds Grant, taking a huge slab of the gooey cake and its inch-thick frosting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt hesitates.  He loves both pie and cake - partly because his father discouraged both of them - but he\u2019s also feeling full, and doesn\u2019t want to take so much he can\u2019t finish it.  He finally chooses...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

As he gets close to the serving table, the boy says, \u201cNice salad Potsie, now what\u2019s for dinner?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNothing more for you until you lose that sagging pot!\u201d says Mr.  Pots, rubbing his own massive gut with apparent pleasure.  \u201cGood food\u2019s reserved for skinnies and newbies like the guy beside you!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe huge boy turns to you.  \u201cWill you help me out?  Potsie\u2019s starving me.  I\u2019ll just waste away if I don\u2019t get some of that pot roast?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, you\u2019re really confused.  How did this guy grow from the \u201cobese\u201d line of 300 pounds to his current size?  Why is Pots, who\u2019s at least twice the size of your dad, denying him food?  What\u2019s going on?  You hate diets, and you have a visual flash of a miserable year from hell ahead of you in deepest, darkest Oklahoma.  Maybe your parents won\u2019t even let you come home at Christmas...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you\u2019re standing there, feeling incredibly down, the two tables of boys jump up and scream,<br>\r\n\u201cSURPRISE!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr.  Pots beams.  \u201cCheer up boy, it\u2019s all a joke!  There\u2019s no diets here - this is OBESITY School for Boys, after all.\u201d He goes on, \u201cWhich is not to say that you don\u2019t have to eat your veggies, in whatever form you choose - smothered in cheese sauce, say - but you get to eat as much of everything else as you want.\u201d  Seeing your shocked face, he continues more quietly.  \u201cThe boys just helped me set up this little joke for you, that\u2019s all.  No way Mr.  Rocco here ever made it to his current size on any diet.  What size are you these days, Rocco?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy with the Prefect\u2019s badge, whose dazzling smile lights up his olive complexion, reaches out to grab your hand.  \u201cWelcome to OSB, newby!  You\u2019re going to have fun here.\u201d  He turns towards the cook.  \u201cFor your information, Pots, I\u2019m up to<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

His two favourite forbidden foods in one meal! He shoves his tray along, following Rocco.

Then on to dessert!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt looked at Rocco wide-eyed.  The mound of food in front of Rocco was vanishing rapidly, as Rocco ate between sentences.  Faster than Matt could have imagine, Rocco was climbing to his feet again, big belly shaking with the effort.  \u201cNow, on to spaghetti!\u201d Rocco proclaimed with a grin, then ambled off towards the serving counter.  As he ambled off Matt noticed the cafeteria was rapidly filling with boys - fat boys, some boys his size, but mostly boys bigger than he was - some of them a lot bigger than he was, some of them looking even bigger than Rocco!

Hey, here he comes now!\u201d Rocco continued, waving an arm towards the cafeteria doors.  Matt turned to look and saw the biggest boy - heck, the biggest person - he had ever laid eyes on cruising in through the door.  Fat was an understatement.  Obese didn\u2019t begin to describe him adequately.  The boy who came in through the door was IMMENSE.  And FAT.  GIGANTIC, in fact - his mammoth gut bounced in rhythm with his footsteps.  He looked like the wax statue of the world fattest man that Matt had seen in a travelling Ripley\u2019s \u2018Believe it or not!\u2019 show come to life.  Matt realised that he was holding his breath, and let it all out in a gust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow!\u201d he said in surprise and admiration.  As the immense fat boy came closer, Matt could see that he was truly, awesomely immense - but also obviously mobile, and alert.  Rocco waved a hand at the obese newcomer and he changed course, coming closer to Rocco and Matt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Rocco,\u201d the fat boy said, in a deep, smooth voice, \u201cwho\u2019s this?\u201d As he came to a halt, Matt could see his mammoth gut surge up and down, and waves of motion pass through his fat pecs and arms, as he stopped pumping these last for balance.  The fat boy was clad in a t-shirt that exhibited his voluminous curves, and a pair of fleece track pants.  Matt realised that most of the boys in the cafeteria were similarly clad - and that such stretchy clothes certainly showed off the burgeoning fat bodies around him.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRocco replied, \u201cHey Fats, this is Matt, a newby in Grade 9.  He\u2019s never seen so many fat boys before.\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, that\u2019s not surprising, is it?\u201d replied Fats.  \u201cAnd I bet he\u2019s never seen anyone as fat as me before, have you?\u201d he added, directing the last part at Matt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo,\u201d Matt replied, almost stammering, \u201cI haven\u2019t.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, take a good look - but don\u2019t worry, you\u2019re going to see a lot of fat boys this year.  And you\u2019re going to see a lot of me - and more and more of me as the year goes on.  I\u2019ve got quite the gut, hey?\u201d he added, noting Matt\u2019s stare.  \u201cYou\u2019ve heard of \u2018abs of steel\u2019, like boxers boast of?  Well, I\u2019ve got the reverse - \u2018abs of flab\u2019.  My abs are so fat, they absorb impact!  I call them my front bumper!\u201d  He rammed one meaty hand into his glorious gut and it sank as if underwater.  Concentric circles of disturbance rolled out across the adipose curves of his paunch.  He extracted his hand and laughed.  \u201cNever seen anybody do that before, hunh?  Well, you see,\u201d he said, suddenly louder, \u201cFAT\u201d- a few other boys joined him - \u201cIS\u201d - most of the rest of room joined in - \u201cWHERE\u201d \u201cIT\u2019S\u201d \u201cAATTT!!!!\u201d Fats concluded, rocking up and down on his heels, laughing loudly and making his abundant bay-window surge up and down.  \u201cWell,\u201d the fat boy continued, \u201cafter that workout it\u2019s time to eat! Pot!  Have you got my tray ready?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure do, Farley!\u201d Pots replying, hoisting a huge metal casserole onto a tray and passing it over.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFATS! FATS!

He\u2019s about six feet tall, but his height is not what impresses matt - what impresses Matt is his sheer breadth - - the guy\u2019s mammoth broad shoulders would be impressive enough, but they seem to shrink as Matt\u2019s glance moves down to the colossal gut that protrudes below them.  Matt\u2019s overall impression is of a massive barrel of moving fat - thick, larded arms, fat-swollen pecs, heavy padded shoulders, and oil barrel legs all dwarfed by an awe-inspiring mammoth gut.  Humourous eyes suss out Matt from between fat cheeks, and a thick, padded hand reaches out towards him.  Matt also takes in a thick gold chain hanging from the boy\u2019s neck where the top buttons of his shirt are open, and an expensive, heavy watch riding on one well-padded wrist.

The amount of pork must of exerted much energy from his attempt to finish it, even Matt's face was drenched with sweat over puffy red cheeks...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehehe...\" Mr. Potts chuckled deeply, as his belly shook along with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't need to push yourself so hard at the first meal of your stay... there will be plenty of food for you...\" As Mr. Potts had spoke, Matt's head had leaned back, begging to get his breath. His stomach had been pulsing ever since the 5th pound of bacon.  He grasped onto his bloated abdomen and tried to calm it down, knowing that he asked for more...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'What got into me?' He thought as his eyes clenched, ' That feeling... that push I gave myself to eat more... what a rush!' He remembered how well his first feeding went. Visions of his hands rushing to the pile in front of him, stuffing his chubby cheeks with hands drenched it pork and fatty grease, chew upon chew in his jaw, and finally sensing the greased meat sucked down into his stomach... and his stomach...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaning back, he gazed at the marvel that stored his delicious victory. After 10 whole pounds of bacon, Matt's belly sure ached with results. His hand went up and down the swollen gut feeling the tightness that now stretched his shirt. He could believe that is how his skin must feel, tightened and round, stretching to an even greater size... It was with this realization he had a passion. The thrill of eating, the sense of accomplishment from a full stomach, the zest of the delicious, undeniable food, even the idea that his parents would be shocked out of their minds, and the grand dream that this fat body of his could become the biggest thing to hit the school (Literally) gave him the final push to try it...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked up with a sense of zeal in his eyes, that another plate had instantly appeared in front of him. There lay a pile of sausages that wafted the smell of temptation to Matt's greasy lips. He then gazed at Mr. Potts, who had already been gazing at him, leaning on the table top with an brow raised and a content smirk on his face, as if he had heard everything that was going on in Matt's head. He simply edged the plate closer to Matt and smiled...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The feeling only gets better from here buddy... I think that it's time for a change around here, don't you? Sure, I won't lie, everyone around here loves food, loves eating, loves growing, stuffing, and being fat all together! We have seen a lot of guys get huge, but lately... no one good enough has stepped up to the real contest. The one boy in this school to be the biggest, hungriest, and worth while glutton of them all... And now, you come by to attend our school here... so you must be it...\" Matt's eyes began to widen in awe...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You come by this kitchen here everyday after classes are done, and I'll give you an extra meal before dinner, and I promise you once a week you'll have that feeling of being stuffed you have come to know now. All I ask, is that you don't tell anyone about this and you show me results!\" Matt shook his head eagerly, and then dove into the platter of sausage displayed in front of him, with the words that Mr. Potts echoing in his ears...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs time went by...</span></div></div>",

At the last millisecond, his brain tries to stop his speeding body, but it takes a lot to stop a speeding fat boy - especially one who\u2019s not used to running.  Matt\u2019s bouncing belly connects with the far more massive paunch of the Prefect, and the two compress enormously, like heavy-duty shock absorbers.  Matt has a momentary vision of a grin of surprise on the face of the the Prefect, before the rubberiness of the two bellies pushes him back again.  Fortunately, the Prefect\u2019s preponderant mass helps his body absorb the impact of a speeding Matt and stay upright, but Matt is not so lucky; as the lighter guy, he bounces back from the enormous impact and falls on his substantial butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhere ya going so fast, little guy?\u201d the other Prefect asks as he offers Matt a fattened hand to help him up.  \u201cThank goodness Fats here has such a good front bumper, or you\u2019d both have fallen down!\u201d he adds, patting the bigger Prefect on the side of his gigantic gut.  \u201cYou okay, Fats?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFats?\u201d asks Matt, getting up to his feet.  \u201cIs that your real name?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, my real name\u2019s Farrell,\u201d replied the bigger Prefect, \u201cbut I\u2019m been \u2018Fats\u2019 since I was a little kid.\u201d  He laughs and his massive belly shakes up and down as he bounces a meaty fist off its side.  \u201cI don\u2019t know if it\u2019s obvious why...\u201d he adds, as his huge grin lifts his fleshy cheeks and lights up his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNah, it\u2019s not at all obvious, is it, newby?\u201d remarks the other Prefect ironically.  He bounces a padded hand off Fats\u2019 massive frontal protuberance.  \u201cNothing about old Fats here even suggests that he\u2019s fat, hey?  So,\u201d he continues in a more serious vein to Matt, \u201cwhy were you running?  It\u2019s unusual behavior here at OSB, running.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I was in the office, and this big cook-guy came in and said he had a \u2018special treatment\u2019 for me, and I\u2019ve heard what private schools do to newbies, so....so,\u201d Matt hesitates, choking up in the presence of these two colossally fat authority figures, \u201cI don\u2019t wanna be hazed, so I ran!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHazed?\u201d says the smaller Prefect, \u201cOh, we don\u2019t do that here!\u201d at the same time as the bigger Prefect says, \u201cOh, Pots - he looks ferocious but he\u2019s harmless.

He leaned back, and his mammoth gut rose slightly, exposing more of the navy blue shorts.  \u201cThey\u2019re better to eat in.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh,\u201d says Matt, the idea of clothes to eat in being a new one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, the t-shirts are cut loose and, look, the shorts have a stretch waistband!\u201d  As he speaks, Tor reaches around the front of his own generous gut and grabs the waistband of his shorts.  He gives a pull, and the shorts stretch before him.  Matt realises that the navy shorts are actually fleece warm-up shorts! \u201cThere\u2019s lots of room in here for a meal - or three.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut I didn\u2019t bring any of those,\u201d Matt remarks.  \u201cMy dad figured private school meant shirt and tie.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s OK,\u201d says Fats, \u201cthe office can supply them cheap - they\u2019ll write your parents and bill \u2018em.

And it\u2019s essential if you want to be really fat.  And, have you ever seen a skinny powerlifter?  Weightlifting gives us the muscle we need to carry around all the fat we\u2019re gaining.  Aerobic exercise is overrated - our hearts get a good workout from weightlifting, and when we have to go up and down steps.  The rest of the time we save our calories for growth by riding our Segways.  By riding instead of walking, I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll put on an extra ten pounds this term alone - and I want every extra pound I can get!

Matt, ravenous now that\u2019s he\u2019s calmed down from his little jog, rips off the wrapper and bits off a generous mouthful of the bar.

Their guts must be twice as big around as his Dad\u2019s, he thinks - they have actual hangover in front!  Torn between the need to evade capture and a fervent admiration of the two fatsos in front of him, Matt tries to run between the two loads of teenage flab.  Just before he reaches the two Prefects, he hears, \u201cBrace for impact!\u201d The two Prefects step towards one another just as Matt collides with their vast obese pots. At the last millisecond, Matt\u2019s brain tries to stop his speeding body, but it takes a lot to stop a speeding fat boy - especially one who\u2019s not used to running.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt\u2019s bouncing belly slides between the two far more massive paunches of the Prefects, and the three guts compress enormously, like heavy-duty shock absorbers.  Matt has a momentary vision of a grin of surprise on the faces of the Prefects, before the rubberiness of all three bellies brings him to a sudden, breathless halt.  Fortunately, the two Prefects\u2019 commanding combined bulk absorb the impact of a speeding Matt so they stay upright;  Matt, lighter by far than the Prefects, ends up pinned between the two stocky porkers, with his arms pinned to his sides by their navy-clad well-rounded paunches. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhere you going so fast, little guy?\u201d the smaller Prefect asks as Matt struggles to catch his breathe.  \u201cThank goodness Fats and me have such good front bumpers, or we\u2019d all have fallen down!\u201d he adds, patting the bigger Prefect on the side of his gigantic gut.  \u201cYou okay, Fats?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, how about you, Tor?\u201d the bigger Prefect replied, in a surprisingly...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

His huge grin lifts his fleshy cheeks and lights up his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNah, it\u2019s not at all obvious, is it, newby?\u201d remarks the other Prefect ironically. \u201cNothing about old Fats here would even suggest that he\u2019s fat, hey?  Why, he\u2019s nothing but skin and bone,\u201d Tor continues as he sinks a fist deep into Fats\u2019 fleshy middle. \u201cLOTS of skin!  So,\u201d he turns back to Matt, \u201cwhy WERE you running?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I was in the office, and this big cook-type-guy came in and said he had a \u2018special treatment\u2019 for me, and I\u2019ve heard about what private schools do to newbies, so....so,\u201d Matt hesitates, choking up in front of the two confident, colossally fat authority figures, \u201cI don\u2019t wanna be hazed, so I ran!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHazed?\u201d the two Prefects said simultaneously. \u201cOh, we don\u2019t do that here!\u201d Tor says at the same time as Fats says, \u201cOh, Pots - he looks ferocious but he\u2019s really harmless - except to your waistline, and there he does a lot of good!  He always wants to feed up the new students.  You all look skinny to him!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh,\u201d says Matt, disentangling the two statements.  \u201cSo, should I go with him?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI would!\u201d says Tor.  \u201cHe\u2019s a great cook, and his special meals are so good, you\u2019ll eat until your belly hurts.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhich takes a pile of food in our cases!\u201d adds Fats.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you do say yes, you might want to put on some more comfy clothes first - those pants look a little tight!\u201d Tor adds, one chubby hand gesturing towards Matt\u2019s size 44 dress twills.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I was wondering about that,\u201d says Matt.  \u201cMy dad sent me with dress pants, shirts and ties, but you\u2019re in shorts and t-shirts?  Does that mean I don\u2019t have to wear a shirt and tie round here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNope,\u201d says the smaller Prefect, \u201cwe only wear dress shirts and pants on dress occasions - and the school provides them, since GROWING boys like us grow through the sizes so quickly - last year I outgrew my pants three times!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd again over the summer I bet!\u201d laughs Fats.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYep.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s the advantage of these fleece shorts,\u201d continues Tor, \u201cthey stretch as we grow, so they don\u2019t need changed so often. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot to mention the t-shirts,\u201d says Fats, hoisting up his massive fat arms to show off the dark blue t-shirt. He leans back, and his mammoth gut rocks, exposing more of the navy blue shorts.  \u201cThey\u2019re better to eat in.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh,\u201d says Matt, the idea of clothes to eat in being a new one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, we always get the t-shirts too big so they\u2019re really loose and, look, the shorts have a stretch waistband!\u201d  As he speaks, Tor reaches around the front of his own generous gut and grabs the waistband of his shorts.  He gives a pull, and the shorts stretch before him.  \u201cThere\u2019s lots of room in here for a meal - or three.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut I didn\u2019t bring any of those,\u201d Matt remarks.  \u201cMy dad figured private school meant shirt and tie.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s OK,\u201d says Fats, \u201cthe office can supply them cheap - they\u2019ll write your parents and bill \u2018em.  Or you can swap a set of dress pants for a set of fleece...\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGuess I should head back to the office,\u201d says Matt, feeling a bit happier and more at home than before.  \u201cIt would be cool to wear fleece to school!  Maybe I\u2019ll see the cook again.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, this time take him up on his offer!\u201d exhorted Tor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt turned to go, but turned back.  \u201cCan I ask you something?\u201d he said, looking at Fats.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure,\u201d says Fats.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt takes a breath and asks, <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Grab yourself a plate, Matt, fill it and join us!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt headed towards the buffet table and serving window.

And as much of it as you want too!  If something runs out and you want more, just ask at the serving window. Dig in!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks,\" replied Matt, spying some fried chicken.  That, and a hamburger, and fries, and biscuits soon made their way onto Matt's plate, which he carried happily back to the table to sit across from Brandon.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eating light?  Well, it is your first day,\" Brandon noted between bites of lasagna.  Up close, his resemblance to Tor was striking, though he wasn't nearly Tor's size... though he was a lot bigger than Matt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How long have you been here?\"  Matt asked, though he was really dying to know if Brandon and Tor were related. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Since grade five,\" Brandon replied, \"my cousin Tor there had started a couple of years before me, and he kept telling me and my parents about it, so when I was old enough, it was OSB for me!  Haven't looked back since!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're cousins?\" Matt asked, curious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Our dads are brothers,\" Brandon replied. \"Tor's got a younger brother here too, and my younger brother started last year. You got any brothers?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Two younger,\" Matt replied.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe four boys chowed down companionably together, then Fats and Tor got up to go to a Prefect's meeting. Brandon shoved his chair back heavily, and Matt could see that while he was shorter and lighter than Tor, he was probably twice Matt's own size!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's get you up to your room, drop your bags, then I'll show you around,\" Brandon offered, as he snagged a couple of plate sized cookies from a dessert display.

The two campus cops turn their guts towards one another and move in, so Matt\u2019s 250 pounds  collides with the rubbery, abundant bellies of the two big boys in blue.  Their combined copious bulk brings Matt to a sudden halt, leaving him wedged between the two endomorphic junior cops, with his arms pinned to his sides by two navy-clad spreading paunches.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOoof!\u201d exclaims Matt involuntarily as the air is driven out of him by the collision.  The two \u2018boys in blue\u2019 are a little taller than Matt, so that their mammoth bellies collide with his diaphragm as well as his own small gut.  He struggles to breath again before replying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, well, umm,\u201d Matt begins, \u201cwell, you see, I\u2019m new, and I met this cook guy in the office, and, umm, he said something about ... a special treatment, and, well,.... I don\u2019t wanna be hazed!\u201d  Matt concludes in a rush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHazed?  Who said anything about getting hazed?\u201d says the smaller of the two hallway cops.  He takes a second big bite out of his doughnut and continues.  \u201cI know Pots can be intimidating to newbies, but he means well - he\u2019s just...well...big...big, gruff and intimidating. Kinda like my dad - kinda like what I\u2019ll be when I get out of school.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt thinks to himself that the junior cop already has the big and intimidating parts down pat!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut his heart\u2019s in the right place,\u201d the boy continues.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd his stomach\u2019s the right size!\u201d the other hall cop laughs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c....and he really enjoys helping new guys at OSB settle in to the OSB lifestyle, helping them bulk up so they fit in.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBulk up to fit in?\u201d Matt repeats, dazed.  He tries to back out of the two boy\u2019s \u201cbelly embrace\u201d without success, until the bigger of the two notices his trials and turns his massive pork body to release him.  \u201cThanks!\u201d  Matt says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh yeah,\u201d replies the smaller boy in blue.  \u201cNewbies like you look small compared to the rest of us, you gotta get big to fit in.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut I am big, that\u2019s why my dad sent me here,\u201d Matt replies.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell,\u201d says the bigger of the two boy cops, inhaling and sticking out his gut, \u201cby his standards, maybe - not by ours!\u201d  Matt watches in amazement as the boy\u2019s gut and chest swells out even further, lifting the huge navy t-shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow big are you?\u201d Matt breathes the question in amazement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShould we tell him?\u201d the bigger boys asks the smaller one.  \u201cOr will the knowledge stun him too much?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, sure, tell him!\u201d the smaller boy replies.  \u201cIt\u2019s not like you trying to keep it secret or anything.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOK.

Are you and Fats roommates?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh yes, we\u2019re roommates,\u201d Tom Ton replies. \u201cEveryone at OSB has a roomie!  That way we can compete with each other, egg each other on - get bigger together!  They try to match us carefully, and it usually works.  For Fats and me, we've been together since grade five. We're so well matched, some guys think we're brothers, or even twins!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As to how much I weigh, I\u2019m not far behind my \u2018hog twin\u2019 here, this morning I weighed in at 588 pounds!\" Tom Ton swings around towards Fats and steps forward. Fats turns with him, and the two lard-laden campus cops' bellies mash into one another, flattening to an incredible degree. Both boys lean in, then Fats grunts and leans in harder, pushing Tom Ton back a little. Tom Ton then grunts and suddenly leans forwards, and the two obese teens push even harder for a moment.  Then, both gasp, then laugh and step back.  Grinning, they then high-five one another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What...what... what was that?\" Matt asks, surprised and puzzled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Belly-barging!\" Fats replies. \"Tom ton and I are well matched for the the sport of the truly fat! Wait until gym class, all will be explained.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have you actually checked in yet? Or did Pots chase you out of the office?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No,\" replies Matt sheepishly. \"I'd better go back.'\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do that, and we'll see you at supper - or before, in the cafeteria,\" Fats says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

With this intimidating guy?  Matt hesitates, and Pots wheels around.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatsamatter, cat got your tongue?  Come ON!\" Pots says and grabs Matt's arm and pulls him along.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt has to get away!  Half a decade of being teased and abused about being fat, though, has made Matt not shout, but try to fight - not very effectively.  He pushes at Pots' hand, and Pots bends closer, so Matt pinches his cheeks, then pulls a silly face, and hits Pots a smack on right cheek.  Pots, shocked by this strange reaction, lets go, and Matt starts to run as fast as his 350 pound flabby body can move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPots....</span></div></div>",
