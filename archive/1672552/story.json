It reminded him of some sort of jungle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt puzzled him. On the plus side, it wasn't all fire and brimstone, like what Hell would be, yet at the same time, it wasn't like there were angels sitting on clouds singing hymns. Of course, that might have also have been a bit of a blessing, as Alfred knew that he wasn't the most religious of people, and felt that an eternity of such music might actually be worse than Hell itself. Still, he wondered where he was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was when he saw the tiger. He could see that the tiger was looking at him. He gulped as he watched it. Having worked at a zoo, he knew about the power of such creatures. He wasn't exactly sure, but it looked looked like a Bengal Tiger. More importantly, the pattern of the stripes seemed eerily familiar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tiger began to walk up to him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlfred knew that the best thing he needed was some sort of weapon, and being in a forest, with plenty of trees, there was always improvised clubs and spears to be had, especially since he saw a decent sized branch. Grabbing it, he ripped it off the tree, and thrust the one end towards the tiger. On that particular end was what looked like a bunch of mangos. It would have been funny, actually, if not for the fact that he was focused on protecting himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tiger stopped, and laid down. \"Don't you recognize me, Alfred?\" it asked, in a female-sounding voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlfred blinked. \"You talk?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tiger chuckled. \"Of course I do. Don't you talk?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How?\" Alfred asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's the Afterlife,\" the tiger said. \"Allows for Communication, among other things.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do you know my name?\" Alfred asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Two years ago, remember,\" the tiger said. \"You worked at the zoo I resided at. I was sick. You spent a lot of nights at the place, trying to help the veterinarians help me try to get better. Didn't work, obviously, but I remember you, sitting by me, reading one of those books.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRecognition came to Alfred. \"Sasha?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tiger got up. \"You remember now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlfred nodded. \"Um, what happens now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSasha chuckled. \"Well, if you're hungry, I could help you to split open those mangos. Virtuous Prey seem to enjoy them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Virtuous Prey?\" Alfred asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Predators have to eat too,\" said Sasha. \"Got to eat Prey.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, is this Heaven or Hell?\" Alfred asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Both, or Neither,\" said Sasha. \"I'm not sure. You have the Virtuous, who have lived a Good life, and you have the Condemned, who didn't. I hope that you lived a Good life. You smell like one who did.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I know I wasn't Perfect, but I think that I was mostly good,\" said Alfred.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There is a few simple tests that you could do to figure out if you're Virtuous, or Condemned,\" Sasha said, as she came up to him, and knocked a mango off of the branch. She then split the rind, pulled it off of some of the fruit's flesh, and passed the rest to him. \"If you're Virtuous, it tastes like one of the best mangos you've ever eaten. If you're Condemned, apparently, it tastes like plain tofu.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlfred picked it up. \"Well, I've had mangos, and I've had tofu, so I know the difference.\" He took a bite of the flesh, and his eyes widened. \"This is better than any mango I've ever had!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSasha chuckled. \"I'm glad I was right about you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what happens now?\" Alfred asked.</span></div></div>",

I know of a cave.\" She started walking away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlfred followed. \"Thanks. Also, do you know where there's clothes that I could wear?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, if you don't mind looking like something out of one of those caveman movies,\" said Sasha. \"There's a distinct lack of anything really advanced beyond Stone Age type of technology.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, what are the clothes made out of?\" Alfred asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSasha chuckled. \"Hide of course. I'm sure that mine could fit you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlfred's eyes widened. \"You'd let someone kill and skin you, just to make me some clothes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not too bad,\" said Sasha. \"I would reform afterwards. Besides, you might want some meat to eat anyways.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think that I could go through with that,\" said Alfred. \"I mean, does every animal here talk?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" said Sasha. \"It's nothing personal, for the most part. You might even like my meat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think that I could do that to someone I know,\" said Alfred.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Suit yourself,\" said Sasha. \"Still, once you get tired of plant matter, I know of plenty of cattle, pigs, sheep, goats, and other Virtuous Prey animals, whom you might find to be tasty.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you don't mind this?\" Alfred asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They don't feel any pain, if that's what you're worried about,\" said Sasha. \"Some even get a kick out of it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mentioned Virtuous,\" said Alfred. \"What about the other group, the Condemned, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They feel pain,\" said Sasha. \"They are to suffer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did they do to be Condemned?\" Alfred asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Killing just to kill, basically,\" said Sasha. \"That or were very gluttonous, eating more than they needed to, or greedy, and horded way more than they needed, causing unneeded pain and suffering.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do they suffer?\" Alfred asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's just say that if I was a Condemned Predator, I wouldn't be able to catch you if you tried to escape from me,\" said Sasha. \"If you were Condemned, you wouldn't be able to escape me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, just what am I, exactly?\" Alfred asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Humans count as both Predator and Prey,\" said Sasha. \"A number of smaller Carnivores and Omnivores have both classifications of Predator and Prey if there's something that can eat them and they can eat smaller animals.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, the Food Web thing is, more or less, intact, basically?\" Alfred asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Some could say that,\" said Sasha. \"Of course, one thing that you might want to get used to is the fact that you aren't the Apex Predator, as it were.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, you could eat me, right?\" Alfred asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I could, but only if you give me permission to do so,\" said Sasha. \"There's something of a 'No means No' rule. You say 'Yes', and I could chow down on you. You say 'No', and I'd have to respect it, even if you said 'Yes' a moment prior.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see,\" said Alfred.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Got the same rule where sex is concerned,\" said Sasha. \"I'd have to ask if you wanted to have sex with me, and respect your wishes if you said 'No'.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, you could have sex with me?\" Alfred asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSasha chuckled. \"Sometimes male tigers aren't interested at the moment, same with other male big cats, and one just needs that itch to get scratched.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sure that there's a few rules against that sort of thing,\" said Alfred.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only when it isn't consensual,\" said Sasha. \"Other than that, anything goes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds crazy,\" said Alfred.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSasha chuckled. \"Well, if you can't find a female human, but want to have sex anyways, let me know. I can, at the very least, take the edge off.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's file that for another time,\" said Alfred.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSasha chuckled. She then looked ahead. \"There's the cave. Should keep us dry, and we can watch the rain. Afterwards, I'll introduce you to the others around here.\"</span></div></div>",

Her jaw quivered, drooling, trying not to take a bite of him so soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer mane puffed up aggressively, as she roared directly in Alfred\u2019s face, revealing the true size and power of her enormous maw. The man\u2019s ears where left ringing, as he stood there awaiting his fate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSurprisingly, her breath was pleasant, something expected of a carnivore but, none the less clean.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlfred\u2026 run from me please\u2026 it\u2019s better that way, fight back.\u201d, Sasha stated gently before licking his cheek, and gently pushing him away with a massive paw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlfred turned tail and began to jog away deeper into the jungle. Sasha simply watched him leave, laying down on her perch, intending to give him a head start.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRunning for about ten minutes, Alfred figured he had put some good distance on the beast. His feet and naked body already having signs of damage from navigating the brush.  Stopping to catch his breath Alfred thought to himself, \u201cShe won\u2019t find me here!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinutes went by, it was practically silent.  Only sounds of the jungle, and the wind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, Alfred heard a disturbance in the brush, and decided to keep going.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMildly afraid, but mostly trying to put on a good show for Sasha, Alfred made a break for a clearing up ahead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, Alfred could hear the snapping of branches, and the crunching of the forest floor, something large was in pursuit. Out of the corner of his eye, he could see flashes of orange, black, and white. No doubt it was his tigress. The memory of her massive maw permeated his mind allowing him to run faster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, not as fast of the tigress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Alfred was about to make it to the clearing, she had gained on him enough to leap for his backside. Feeling claws tear into his lower back, Alfred fell face first into the clearing, landing face first on loamy sand. A moment later, Sasha\u2019s jaws had seized his ankle, dragging him backwards, towards herself while growling ferociously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPivoting to his back, Alfred grabbed a handful of sand, casting it into Sasha\u2019s bright eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe immediately let go of her hold and was blinded for the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m going to tear you apart!\u201d, Sasha roared in anger, lashing out at the darkness with a massive swipe of the paw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlfred took the opportunity to limp away, doing the best he could do with his mangled ankle. Taking shelter behind some large river <br>\r\nrocks. Alfred peeked over watching Sasha struggle to find her way around, roaring and pacing in anger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGaining back her composure, Sasha abruptly stopped her display of anger, pointing her nose to the sky. She realized how her heart was beating, reveling in the moment. She took a deep breath through her nose, a deep breath of Alfred.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can\u2019t wait to taste you Alfred!\u201d Sasha taunted, standing proud, yet blind. She began blinking, each time restoring more and more of her vision.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce her eyesight returned to her Alfred was nowhere to be seen. However, she could smell him nearby. Sasha hoped atop of a large river rock, seeing Alfred at the base.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRecoiling from the base of the rock, Alfred smiled holding a club in a defensive posture, while stepping back into the ankle deep water. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCute stick!\u201d, Sasha jeered, jumping down into the water, sending up a splash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey circled each other, locked in a friendly, yet deadly combat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSasha swung her powerful claw at the club, sending it flying 6 feet away. Alfred hesitated momentarily, making a slight motion towards the club. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSasha saw his as her opportunity, leaping upon her keeper. The weight and claws of the tigress brought the man to his back in the shallow water. He quickly reached for the club, but Sasha intercepted his reach, by pinning his forearm down with her claws.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlfred\u2019s blood faintly stained the water as he looked up at her, breathing heavily, soaking wet, and salivating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWatching as Sasha\u2019s maw come upon upon him, Alfred felt nothing as its darkness enveloped him.  The last thing he remembered was a faint twist of the neck.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Of course, if you ate <i>way</i> too much or killed <i>way</i> too much, then you're at risk of being marked as Condemned.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Condemned?\" Eric asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They suffer punishments,\" the snake said. \"Condemned Predators cannot catch Virtuous Prey, and Condemned Prey cannot outrun Virtuous Predators. Virtuous ones enjoy the taste of what they eat, while the Condemned taste only blandness.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean by that?\" Eric asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Try the fruit,\" said the snake. \"It should taste like the best papaya you've ever had, or at least taste delicious to you at any rate. Otherwise, it will taste like tofu.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric carefully picked up the fruit, and tried it. It was delicious. \"This is good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe snake chuckled. \"Good to know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, just how do things work around here?\" Eric asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not too different from how things <i>should</i> work,\" said the snake. \"Predators hunt for Prey, and Prey try to avoid being caught by Predators. Just to let you know, your sort is both Predator and Prey, meaning that you can always capture Condemned Prey, and outrun Condemned Predators, unless you let them catch you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let them catch me?\" Eric asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sometimes one feels sorry for them, and conveniently trips and doesn't get up in time to escape,\" the snake said. \"Of course, Virtuous Prey don't feel any pain when they get eaten.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What if say a Virtuous Predator came after me?\" Eric asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe snake chuckled. \"Depends on if you gave the Predator permission to eat you or not. If you gave me permission, I could eat you. If you didn't, I'd have to look for someone else.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What would happen afterwards?\" Eric asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your body would be recreated,\" the snake said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see,\" said Eric. \"Um, what's your name?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe snake chuckled. \"I prefer to be called Rosa when folks make use of such things.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric's eyes widened. \"Okay. My name is Eric, Eric Roberts.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pleased to meet you,\" Rosa said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what now?\" Eric asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, Rosa said.....</span></div></div>",

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">Animals die: this is a Fact. So, the question is; do they go to Heaven, or do they go to Hell? The answer is this - they all go to the same place, but each get different rewards, or punishments, depending on if they were classified as Virtuous, or Condemned. Then there's the humans that have shown up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Virtuous enjoy a lot of rewards:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. They can always find some sort of pleasure. This can be through having fun with friends, eating good food, having sex, and just enjoying things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. Virtuous Prey have no problems escaping from Condemned Predators.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. Virtuous Predators have no problems catching Condemned Prey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n4. Virtuous Predators can eat Virtuous Prey, but there's a \"No means No\" policy in place - Predators must ask the Prey if they can eat them, and if the Prey refuses, the Predator is to respect it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n5. Virtuous Prey don't suffer any pain if they get eaten. In fact, some actually enjoy being eaten. In fact, they taste better than Condemned Prey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n6. Animals that qualify as both Predator and Prey enjoy both sets of benefits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n7. There aren't many rules were sex is concerned, so long as it's consensual.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Condemned have a lot of punishments:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. They don't get any pleasure, unless the other is willing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. Condemned Prey can't outrun Virtuous Predators.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. Condemned Predators can't catch Virtuous Prey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n4. Condemned Predators can eat Condemned Prey, but they don't taste real good to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n5. Condemned Prey feel pain when being eaten.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n6. Animals that qualify as both Predator and Prey get both sets of punishments.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n7. They get no pleasure from sex, unless the other is willing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat's common to both is this:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. They can talk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. Their bodies can reform.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. For Non-Human, or Non-Antho, Animals, being marked as Virtuous or Condemned has to deal if they killed just to kill, killed <i>way</i> more than they could eat or horded <i>way</i> more than they could eat, which tends to get them marked as Condemned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n4. It's possible to change from being a Condemned to a Virtuous through doing Good Deeds, as well as the opposite, for a Virtuous to be Condemned for doing Evil Deeds. This is especially useful in the cases of those who are, more or less, border-lined.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n5. There is plant matter that can be eaten by those who eat such things, but while those who were Virtuous enjoy the food, with it being rather flavorful, those who are Condemned find it to be tasteless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n6. Humans are Animals too, as are Anthros and both can fall into Virtuous or Condemned, and are classified as both Predator and Prey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n7. Technology seems to be similar to that of Stone-Age level, with clothes being made of Animal hide. Often times, Virtuous animals, especially those with enough hide to either make the equivalent of a shirt or a set of pants, will make a \"donation\" to help clothe Virtuous Humans, or Anthros that like to wear clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Setting:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Setting isn't Fluffy Cloud Heaven, nor is it Fire and Brimstone Hell, which could be good or bad, depending upon one's point of view, but is instead more of a Natural and Unmodified world, similar to an animal's usual habitat, with a distinct lack of man-made buildings and structures. On the plus side, food is easy to find, as is shelter during the times it rains. Humans, upon finding out about the place, might be initially confused over the obvious differences between what they'd believed and actuality, tend to get used to things after a week or thereabouts, at least those who were Virtuous - as for the Condemned, this is but the start of their suffering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRules:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. Spelling and Grammar are Important<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. Sex is allowed - hardly any rules, beyond that of Consent, at least for those who are Virtuous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. Vore is allowed, although Consent is required between Virtuous Predator and Virtuous Prey. Also, it is possible for the Predator to swallow the Prey whole, providing that the Predators is big enough to do so. A tiger, for instance, could swallow something the size of a human, but a fox would be unable to do so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n4. Plots must be story-driven, in one way, or another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n5. Always leave an option open, when possible - I'll add the others if need be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n6. Third-person point-of-view.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n7. Anything else goes, unless I say otherwise.</td>",
