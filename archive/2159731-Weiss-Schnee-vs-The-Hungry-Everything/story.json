Last night had been one of the most restful sleeps she had had in a long time. As Weiss stretched her arm brushed her pony tail. Wait her pony tail?! The former heiress was sure she had let her hair down when she went to bed. Now wide awake Weiss looked down at herself just make sure there was nothing else unusual about her appearance. Sure enough Weiss was still in her nightgown and barefeet. Weiss breathed a slight sigh of relieve, before looking at her surroundings. That was when she felt her heart sink. Weiss was no longer where she went to bed last night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore we get into where she was now, let's first decide if Weiss starts this adventure normal sized or she going to be an inch tall.</span></div></div>",

She could be in serious trouble. With a 'gulp' Weiss carefully got out of bed, making sure to avoid hitting her head on the top bunk, and got to her feet. Weiss cold feel how cold the hard wood floor was beneath her barefeet as she slowly made her way to the window. Once there the former heiress positioned herself so that she would be able to see out the window, but the chances of anything seeing her would be minimized. What she saw made Weiss gasp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Outside was an infestation of Grimm. On the ground Weiss had been able to see Beowolves, Creeps, Goliaths, and more. She could swear she even caught a glimpse of a King Taijitu. In the air the former heiress had seen an assortment of flying Grimm ranging from Griffons and Nevermores.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Weiss backed away from the window as she tried to calm herself down. This was a horrible situation to be in. Weiss needed to get out of here before she became Grimm chow. 'But how,' Weiss pondered. She didn't have her weapon or any dust so her ability to use her semblance would be limited. Weiss might've been able to sneak out, but should she go left down the hall or right? Alternatively, Weiss could stay where she is and wait to see if anyone else shows up. What did Weiss end up doing?</span></div></div>",

Not even a minute after she decided this, the door to her dorm burst apart. Weiss couldn't help but cry out as the gorilla like Grimm, known as Beringel, rushed in and stopped in front of her. The Beringel looked at Weiss, who was too petrified by fear and shock to move, for only a moment before it grabbed with its hands, pinning her arms to her side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Weiss snapped out of her paralysis and began squirming in order to try and escape, but the Beringel's grip on her was too strong. Without ceremony the gorilla like Grimm began lifting Weiss up into the air. With her feet no longer on the ground the former heiress began kicking her legs in the air in an attempt to possibly hit the creature, but to no success. The Beringel lifted Weiss up until her head was level with its mouth, and then it opened its maw wide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"NO!\" Weiss cried out as the Beringel shoved her head into its mouth. Thanks to her aura Weiss was not decapitated when the Grimm's toothy maw wrapped around her head, though it still hurt having those pointy teeth poking into her neck. The feeling of being eaten overwhelmed Weiss though and she began kicking her dangling legs harder for all the good it did her. Then with a 'GULP' the Beringel shoved Weiss's shoulders and breasts into its mouth as her head entered its throat. The beast moved its grip down to the former heiress's rear to reduce any chance of her escaping. With another 'GULP' the Beringel shoved Weiss up to her rear in its maw, thus leaving only her kicking legs dangling outside its maw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Sensing that the huntress was now helpless the Beringel released the grip it held on her with its hands. Then tilting its head upwards the Grimm took another 'GULP' and swallowed Weiss up to her knees. The former heiress's kicking became more restricted now. With another 'GULP'  the Beringel's toothy maw sealed around the former heiress's ankles. Now that her barefeet were all that remained of her outside the Beringel's maw all Weiss could do to struggle was wiggle her feet and toes. Then with one final 'GULP' the Beringel's maw sealed around Weiss's wiggling feet and toes before they too slid down its gullet. The Beringal brought its head back to level and patted its belly as it felt Weiss fully slid into it. It could feel her wriggling inside as she desperately struggle to escape, but paid its wriggling gut no mind. With a 'BURP' the Beringel left to do something else while it slowly digested Weiss Schnee.</span></div></div>",

As Weiss quickly got back up onto her feet, while brushing the sand off her night gown and bare legs, and quickly ran through her options.Weiss would eventually need to find sustenance and shelter which meant have to venture into the unknown jungle. However, she would also need to get off the island which meant Weiss would have to either build a signal of some kind or a raft. Both she could do by sticking to the edge of the jungle.

The jungle was hot and humid. The sunlight barely broke through the canopy of leaves, making navigation through the dense foliage somewhat harder for Weiss. Lush vegetation slapped into Weiss as she moved deeper into the jungle. Her aura prevented her from taking any damage from the vegetation, though she could still feel the pain. Something Weiss was reminded very much of when she accidentally stepped on sharp rock causing her to cry out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0As Weiss wiped some sweat from her brow she suddenly stopped as she saw something that might help her. Before the former heiress were three paths. The path on the left was covered in vines and other dense vegetation. That meant Weiss could potentially find food and water down that path, but something about the vines gave her the creeps. The path straight ahead was clear as though it experienced frequent traffic and seemed to head towards the island's mountain. The would be less resistance for Weiss to move through and the mountain might have caves she could use as shelter. However, it looked like a game trail, and predators that would be more than happy to eat Weiss might be hunting on it. Finally the path on the right looked like it was somewhat paved by stone suggesting it was man made. Going down that path might mean food, shelter, and help for Weiss. However it looked as though that path hadn't been maintained in a while. Weiss pondered for a moment on which path to take before heading down...</span></div></div>",

The scent made Weiss's mouth water, and a sudden grumble from her stomach made her aware of just how hungry she was. Whatever the source of that scent was had to be edible. While the vines didn't sit right with Weiss, she decided she had to find the source of that alluring aroma. So with little hesitation Weiss began her trek down the path covered in vines.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Travel down the path was slow going as Weiss made every possible effort to avoid making contact with the vines. The fact that there was even less sunlight on this path made them all the more unsettling. Avoiding the vines wasn't easy for the former heiress since they were everywhere. Often Weiss would have to squeeze her slender form past groups of them just to avoid brushing up against them, and more then once she would start having to walk on her tip toes to avoid stepping on the vines. Weiss was sure though that once she found the source of the alluring aroma the effort would all be worth it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Said aroma only grew more entrancing the closer the former heiress got to it.

Just one look was enough for Weiss to she that it was big enough to fit her in its jaws, and it was still trying to make her its next meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0As the flytrap's vine continued to pull on her, Weiss felt like she might be ripped in half as she grunted from the effort to stay put.

Then she began moving towards the huge carnivorous plant again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Weiss screamed and began squirming in the plant's  in order to escape, but it was useless. She was plant food now. Weiss watched in horror as the ground below her was replaced by the plant's lower lobe.The vines that held Weiss gently lowered her onto the interior of the lower, and held her squirming form there. Then the plant's maw began to close around her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"This can't be happening,\" Weiss moaned as she saw daylight slowly disappearing around her. Just before the plant completely sealed Weiss inside its maw, the vines that held her unwrapped themselves from her wrists and ankles before sliding out of the maw. Then Weiss was sealed in darkness. Now that she was no longer bound by vines Weiss began her struggle inside the plant in earnest. The former heiress kicked and punched as as best as she could in the lying position she was forced to remain in as she cried out for help. Unfortunately, Weiss's struggles were barely noticeable as tiny lumps that appeared in the lobes of the flytrap and her screams were heard as no more than a muffle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Then the worst part began. The inside of the venus flytrap's maw began to ooze digestive enzymes. Weiss slowly became covered from head to toe in the digestive enzymes. She could feel her whole body began to tingle as the enzymes began the process of digesting her. Weiss's aura protected her from the worst of being digested, but she knew that wouldn't last. The former heiress began struggling harder and screaming louder, but it was ultimately pointless. After about five minutes Weiss ceased her struggling and her voice was sore from screaming. All she had managed to do was tire herself out. Weiss drifted off to sleep just before her aura gave out and her true digestion began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The venus flytrap slowly digested Weiss Schnee  over the course of three days until she was nothing more than a nutritious soup.

Soon the sun was high over her head and the heat was starting to get to the former heiress as she trudged on. Weiss panted heavily as she wiped sweat from her forehead. Then she saw it. A log that had seemingly fallen in the middle of the path. Weiss could easily climb over it as it only came up to her waist, but she could also use it to sit and rest for a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"It couldn't hurt to rest for a bit,\" Weiss mumbled to herself as she walked over to the log.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Upon reaching the log the sweaty huntress sat down upon it to rest.

Then there was a shockingly loud hiss from behind. Wide eyed Weiss turned around and became frozen in fear. The log hadn't been a log at all. It was a massive snake that was more than large enough to make a meal out of Weiss. Even worse it was staring right at her with hunger in its eyes. The snake let out another hiss and rushed at the former heiress. Weiss...</span></div></div>",

As soon as she did that, the ground beneath her barefeet began to shake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"What's happening?!,\" Weiss cried out as she tried to maintain her balance. The former heiress stuck her arms out and waved them wildly as the ground continued to shake. Then Weiss gasped as she was lifted up into the air by a rising mound of sand. She nearly fell off the mound twice, but somehow she managed to stay on her feet. When the mound finally stopped rising, and the last grains of sand fell from it, Weiss looked down to see what she was standing on, and let out a horrified scream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Weiss was not standing on a mound, but a giant worm of some kind. The worst part was that she was standing directly on its lips. Before Weiss could even think of jumping off those very same lips began splitting apart as the worm opened its hungry maw in order to consume the unlucky girl on its head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"No, no, no, no,\" Weiss cried as she was forced to do a split order keep from falling into her hungry predator's maw. Weiss had to wave her arms about just to maintain her increasingly precarious balance. As the worm's jaws continued to widen Weiss felt as though she would be torn in half. Then the jaws reached their limit, and the former heiress let out a slight sigh of relief. However, Weiss's situation was far from improved as she was practically hanging onto each lip by her toes. A quick glance down provided the huntress with a view of a slimy maw filled with tiny teeth, a rope like tongue, and a dark abyss she would find herself travelling down if she didn't do something. Weiss looked back up and started looking around for anything to help her escape, when she suddenly felt a slimy sensation on the sole of her right foot. Another glance down caused Weiss to grimace as she saw the rope like tongue licking her foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Eeww,\" Weiss moaned as the tongue then began to lick her other foot. Then the former heiress noticed that she was starting to slide. The worm's saliva was causing her to lose the fragile grip she had with her feet. Weiss could only watch wide eyed as she slid millimeter by millimeter until finally she lost her grip altogether.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"NO!\" Weiss screamed as she fell into the worm's hungry maw. Desperate to save herself, Weiss quickly and reflexively wrapped her arms and legs around the rope like tongue before she could plummet into the predator's throat. Turning her head up Weiss looked out at the sky for one final time before the worm's jaws snapped shut, sealing her inside. For about five minutes the worm shook its head about in an attempt to shake its meal free of its tongue. Then without ceremony the worm made an audible 'GULP', and a slight bulge that used to be Weiss Schnee could be seen traveling down its underside just before the creature returned underground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Weiss grimaced once again as she found herself travelling feet first down a slimy, confining tube. All around her, Weiss could feel the muscles of the esophagus massaging every inch of her slender form down to her doom. A mixture of saliva and mucus clung to the former heiress from head to toe. Below her feet Weiss could hear the gurgles of the belly growing closer and closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"This is a nightmare,\" Weiss moaned as her feet came into contact with the stomach sphincter. Recognizing the young woman as food, it quickly squeezed her into the waiting belly. Weiss now found herself in a fleshy chamber that was roomier than the esophagus, but not by much. Weiss quickly found that she could only get up on her hands and knees as she observed her fleshy tomb. Before Weiss could act further the walls, floor, and ceiling began undulating, kneading every inch of the poor girl. Then the digestive juices began to ooze out and cover the former heiress from head to toe. As Weiss lay there marinating in digestive enzymes and being kneaded by the stomach, she couldn't help but be thankful that her aura was protecting her from being digested for now. Though Weiss could still feel the digestive juices causing her skin to tingle. After about ten minutes the lack of air began to get to Weiss, and she passed out into a sleep she would never awaken from just before her aura gave out and her true digestion began.</span></div></div>",

She seemed to be in some kind of forest surrounded by flat, green trees. 'But trees don't grow like that' Weiss thought to herself. Then her eyes widened as the realization hit her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Those are blades of grass,\" Weiss gasped in shock and awe. \"I've shrunk!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Indeed Weiss had been shrunk. The how and why she did not know, but that wasn't her biggest concern. Looking at her surroundings Weiss determined that she was about an inch in height at most. Practically bite sized. Weiss needed to find help before she got crushed or worst eaten. To do that though she needed to get a better view of her surroundings first. Thankfully Weiss noticed a rock, now the size of a boulder to her, a feet from that she could use to get a better vantage point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Scrambling atop the rock the first thing Weiss noticed was the scent of live stock in the air, and took only one glance for her to realize why. The former heiress saw from atop her perch that not only had she been shrunken, but that she had been transported to a farm as well. In the distance Weiss could see a farm house and various pens for the animals. Closer to her position was a pond that the animals no doubt drank from when out in the field.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0After gathering as much information as she could Weiss scurried off her rock in order to ponder what her next course of action should be. The farm house might be her best bet to find someone to help her. However, since she was on farm the farmers might be tending to the animals already. Then there was the pond. It might be a good idea for the tiny huntress to use it to freshen up a bit before she went find help. Weiss pondered her options for a moment, before she finally decided to go to the...</span></div></div>",
