Stanley Peters was a permanent visitor to <i>Hudson Park Library</i> at 66 Leroy street, NYC. Every Monday exactly at noon he used to come there and stay until closing at 6p.m. Stanley was an average man, someone who you wouldn't notice in a crowd who waits for green traffic light in Park Avenue, or someone who look like perfect family man, though he was't ugly. He looked more like high school nerd. <br>\r\n\"Good afternoon Mrs.Bernard,\" he answered as he took off his glasses and put them in a pocket of his suit.<br>\r\n\"Here is my library card but, as usual, I will stay here to read. I don't have too much time at home. You know, my wife is angry at me sometimes. She said that I read unnecessary things and it's better if I take care about my job and our kid,\" he took out the library card out of the pocket. Mrs.Bernard took the card and wrote her usual data. She already new Stanley's card number as he visited them so often but she didn't want to look rude or weird.<br>\r\n\"What is going to be this time Mr.Stanley?\" she tried to break unpleasantness of his <i>life story</i>.<br>\r\n\"I don't know, Mrs.Bernard. Last time I read Stephen King, Night Shift and I enjoyed. He is such a great writer. He scared hell out of me with that book,\" Stanley looked all excited while he talked about it. He tried with both hands and legs to explain to Mrs.Bernard the most interesting parts in a book. She looked at him, and if she wasn't sure before, now she knew how weird he is. The sound of his voice became louder and louder and when she couldn't listen it anymore she interrupted him gently.<br>\r\n\"Mr.Peters, please, we are in public library and we require silence. I know what happened in <i>Night Shift</i>, I read it already,\" she took his hand and tried to make him calm. He stopped when he realized that his behavior crossed the borders and rules of the library. <br>\r\n\"There you go. Are you alright now? Do you need any help from me?\" Mrs.Bernard stood up from her chair.<br>\r\n\"I'm fine, thank you,\" he tried to calm, \"I will just go now and read something.\" Stanley took out the glasses from the pocket and made his way to the center of the library. <br>\r\n\"Mr.Peters,\" Mrs.Bernard called him back.<br>\r\n\"Yes, Mrs.Bernard?\"<br>\r\n\"We make up horrors to help us cope with the real ones,\" she said. \"Enjoy your reading.\"<br>\r\nHe didn't understand what she tried to say. As he continued to walk he knew that hundreds of books waited to be read. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As Stanley walked toward the back of the library, the librarian's comment echoed through his mind. She had said that we create horrors in our literature to help us deal with the real horrors in everyday life. He wondered: \"What horrors are there in life that are so scary that writers like Stephen King are trying to help us deal with them?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking for real life horrors, he found himself standing in the section devoted to history and war. His eyes scanned the massive row of shelves. He instantly spotted one book among the thousands. It was just a normal looking  volume, but he could see the air seem to shimmer in front of it. He reached up, and the book seemed to move to his hand as if guided by a magnet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe walked to his regular seat, an over-sized chair next to a window on the back wall. He sat and looked down at the book in his hand. The title seemed to make no sense, it was \"Das war Dachau\". He opened the cover, and immediately realized that the book was written in German, a language he knew nothing about. He scanned the page, trying to understand what he was reading, when suddenly he felt the world spin. He felt himself pushed into the chair, and then everything went black.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis head hurt. He could hear the sound of voices around him. He was laying on something hard, and the air was thick with a putrid stench. He opened his eyes slowly, trying to orient himself. He saw he was face down on wooden planks. He felt a hand on his shoulder, and a voice urgently saying \"Hans, wacht auf!\" He knew that the words were German, but he clearly understood them, not as if they were translated, but as if it were his native language. \"Hans, wake up!\" the voice repeated. He turned and sat up slowly, letting the dizziness pass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe saw the man standing over him, the one who had been shaking his shoulder and speaking to him. His face was thin and hollow looking, with a scraggly beard stubble. His skin was thick with grime, and there were open sores on his cheek. The man was wearing filthy rags, which seemed to once have had blue stripes. Now it appeared that they were being held intact only by the filth and grime ground into them. He had the fleeting thought that if they were to be washed, they would simply dissolve. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hans\", the man said, \"you are hurt, but you must make role call or he will beat you even worse\". Stanley touched the right side of his head. It hurt. He could feel that the scalp above his ear was split. He looked at his hand, the traces of blood were thick and congealed. He noticed that his own hands and arms were caked in thick grime which seemed to be cracked and flaking. Seven blue numbers were tattooed on his left forearm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened?\" he asked the man. As he spoke, he realized that he was speaking German, although he had never spoken it in his life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You did not answer at role call this morning, and he hit you with his rifle\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanley was still confused, \"Who is 'he'?\" he asked. He noticed several other men had begun to move closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't remember? Herr Greubber, the fire chief, is now a Gestapo guard. He hates Jews more than any other guard here, and prefers to beat us rather than kill us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry\", Stanley said, \"I can't remember! Who am I? Where am I? Who are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your head wound\", the man replied, pointing to the bloody rags next to Stanley. \"The bleeding has stopped, but  it must have harmed memory as well. I am Rabbi Jacob Weise, your friend, you are Hans Gertz, and we are in the Dachau Camp\" he paused, and then added thoughtfully \"That you cannot remember may be a blessing from God\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA clang of metal came from outside. \"It is role call\" said Jacob. \"Let me help you walk. Remember: Answer when your name is called, it is Hans Gertz!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanley stood, placing his right arm over his friends shoulder and moved toward the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not Jewish\" Stanley said softly as they moved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perhaps you weren't\" said Jacob, \"but now you are\".<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He certainly didn't have any horrors in his life... or did he? His wife Evelyn was most certainly a nag, but he wouldn't call her a horror. Stanley wondered about horror writers, such as Stephen King, Dean Koontz, and Ann Rice. Did they each have horrors in real life they'd been coping with? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Stanley shook his head, forcing himself to concentrate on which book he'd like to read. For some reason, he decided against his favorite genre... horror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Psst!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Stanley glanced around but spotted no one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Psst! Over here!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The loud whisper seemed to be coming from the top shelf to his left.

A fairy peeked out and grinned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Stanley pulled his glasses off and wiped them with a handkerchief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I'm not going anywhere,\" the fairy said. \"And you're not seeing things. I'm as real as the mole on your nose.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Stanley touched the spot on his nose that seemed to be growing larger, day by day. \"Is there something I can help you with?\" he finally said. \"This is my reading time and don't care to be wasting it talking to a fairy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Mr. Peters!\" the librarian's voice warned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Sorry, Mrs. Bernard,\" he apologized, then whispered to the very strange looking fairy. \"Who are you? Leave me alone!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The fairy grinned again, showing her crooked teeth. \"My name is Nessie, but the book reads <i>Messie</i>. It's a misprint and I need the typo fixed. Then I will be beautiful, thanks to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Me? Oh, no you don't. I have more important things to do than helping fairies. I don't even like fantasy books.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Have you ever read one, Stanley?\" Nessie asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I prefer horror.

Her shoes could be heard marching between the tall stacks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Before Stanley could resist, Nessie sprinkled fairy dust on him so he would shrink to her size.

He glanced around at his surroundings. The thick forest, filled with strange creatures and sounds, frightened him. He hadn't remembered this fear since he was a child, lost in the woods.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0There was nowhere to run, nowhere to climb, nowhere to escape at all. None of the strange beings greeted him, nor did they attack him. So... he wondered what he should do next?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Nessie!\" he whispered as loud as he dared. But she did not appear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Come,\" a low voice behind him demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Stanley turned to find his father... except it wasn't really his father. But he followed anyway. He felt anxious. His father had been verbally abusive to him, critical, never doing father-son things with Stanley. Then his mother left the two of them and never came back. So Stanley had buried himself in books... mostly horror books, and now all the horror stories he'd ever read were reminding him of the things he was afraid of. Really afraid of. But this was a fantasy book, right? <i>Stay focused,</i> he kept telling himself. <i>This isn't real. You'll wake up soon.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Where are you taking me?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Don't ask questions, idiot. Just do as I say.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Aw, yes. Those old feelings of worthlessness flooded back. Fear that his father might cast him away if he didn't do what he was told. That big empty space in his stomach longing to be filled with love and acceptance. If he'd only known back then, his father was not capable of love and compassion. He grew to understand why his mother had left, though he'd often wondered why she hadn't taken her little boy with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Psst!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Stanley glanced around. He knew Nessie was nearby and he actually was relieved she came back. If he had the choice, he would most definitely choose the disheveled fairy over a monstrous man with no capacity for kindness or love.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Psst! Over here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0His father turned just as Nessie sprinkled fairy dust over Stanley, making him disappear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Show yourself!\" his father barked. \"Or else.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Or else <i>what?</i>\" Nessie asked Stanley.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Or else the dungeon,\" he replied as he wiped the perspiration from his forehead. \"Actually, the basement in our old house. I thought of it as a dungeon. He'd lock me in down there, sometimes for days. It was cold and damp... and dark.\" He shivered and wondered if Stephen King had ever experience real horrors such as this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Nessie took his hand. \"He's gone now. Come with me. It's not safe here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Every day exactly at noon he goes to Hudson Park Library, NYC to read a books. Weird thing about Stanley is that he don't just read them but in every book that he read he <i>falls into it( he is becoming a character in that book)</i>.<br>\r\nThe first chapter that I wrote is just small intro and you can continue with your own idea how is going to look like, but please make it interactive as much as you can. When Stanley came to library he didn't know which book he is going to read. I put only genres and the next chapter you choose. I didn't want to be specific about the book since it would be very hard to find a person here who already read the same and to continue with the rest of the story. So, it's your choice. Once when you're done with your chapter (it can be your own book and thoughts or not) please leave enough informations for the next interactive story teller. You can finish your chapter as Stanley finish with reading one book or you can make other writer to finish your story. The choice is yours. Have fun and thanks for participating. </font><div align=\"center\"></div></td>",
