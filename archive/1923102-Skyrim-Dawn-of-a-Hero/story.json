Her desert cloak tried to escape from her body due to strong gusts of wind in a powerful wind storm. Although the dust storm provided her with cover from the sun it was hot, and the sandy soil constantly getting into her armor wasn't helping. The silhouette of a town appeared some distance ahead of her A sign pointing to it read <i>Meir Lynmount</i>. She proceeded her heading toward the town, and when she was only a few tens of meters away, the dust storm died down. She removed her hood, and Khajiit began walking out of their homes to uncover food and weapon stalls. Whenever a Khajiit would spot her, the first thing they would notice would be Claire's helmet, and slowly back away. She proceeded to the town's inn, and took a seat at a table in the middle of the room. A Khajiiti server came up to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"E-excuse me, sir,\" he began with a stutter. \"Is there anything I can get you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just a bottle of ale and, if you have any, a horker loaf,\" Claire said, as she handed the Khajiit a small bag of coins. He was shocked to find that who he thought was a man, was in fact a woman. Claire removed her Daedric helmet, revealing her face to the young Khajiit. She had pale skin with a slight, blue tinge and white hair that only reached down just past her ears, with a few strands in front of her left ear, as well as silver lips and eyes red as flawless garnet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right away, miss,\" he said.

At many times, Dadeli can't control his transformations because of the ring. Dadeli is surprisingly kind and is not a real drunkard, but just drinks Skooma because he likes it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe traveled with a Caravan as defense for some time before he left to explore. While with the caravan, he picked up a bit of archery and sneaking tips. After leaving, he got into quite a few brawls and was able to become quite skilled in hand-to-hand combat. He even won his gloves from a man in the Ratways. He also became a skilled thief, even rivaling the Thieves Guild's best.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDadeli burst through the door and let a roar out. He didn't want to do this, but the blood called him, the ring called him, Hircine called him. Dadeli let out a primal roar as he looked at what was on the menu. Normal khajiit as usual, but there was something else now. A dark elf. She looked like a well enough meal. Dadeli rushed toward her but before he knew it, she was gone. He turned and roared as he saw a figure run out of the door and followed in a a sprint. The figure ran until they were far enough away, and turned and placed a helmet on and pulled two blades out. Dadeli roared and charged.</span></div></div>",

His face turned red from embarrassment. \"Forgive me.\" He walked over to an area where he couldn't see her, out of respect. \"One of the new students, Dadeli, I believe, has turned up missing. We all heard howling, and I did some brief scrying. What turned up was a werewolf headed toward Journeyman's Nook.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know the place,\" Claire began. \"A few miles due south of here. I should head out immediately.\" The clanking of metal stopped, and Claire walked out in full armor, with a dragonbone sword on her left hip, and another on her back. Her helmet was in her right hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as Claire left the room, Tolfdir took a seat next to the enchanting table and muttered to himself, \"I hope she doesn't think me a perverted, old fool.\"</span></div></div>",

Where... where am I?\" Claire asked, slightly disoriented. She sat up and looked around. A hedge of tightly wrapped wisteria and mandevilla vines encroached nearby fencing, accompanied by red and yellow dahlia bushes and creeping, blue day plants almost completely encircled them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're in Cheydinhal. I think you may have had a bit to drink. Come on! The party's right this way!\" Allinor exclaimed, running off. Claire hurried to try and keep up with him, and paused when she heard cheering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Did we win a war or something?</i> Claire thought. She looked forward, and could see people celebrating. There was more mirth per square foot than she had ever experienced. Imperials and even some Nords splitting kegs of mead with elves, mostly Dunmer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, are <i>you</i> a pretty lady!\" A man exclaimed. Claire looked over to her right to see an Imperial approaching her, and it was clear he was heading into his later years, and obviously full of liquid courage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go back to drinking your mead, old man,\" Claire said sternly, trying to get the point across she was nowhere near interested in him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're a farm girl, right? Whadda ya say you come to my place for a night?\" The old man asked, still trying to flatter her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen here, old fool,\" Claire began. \"I'm only going to say this once. I'm not interested in 'spending the night', and unless you want to be castrated, I suggest you leave me alone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, fine! You weren't that pretty, anyhow!\" The old man exclaimed under his breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! Claire! Over here!\" Allinor shouted, waving to get her attention. She quickly headed over to him, the old pervert staring at her the whole way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it?\" She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Take a drink of this,\" Allinor requested, holding a tankard of drink out for her to take.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, alright...\" Claire said, as she hesitantly took the tankard and took a drink of it. It tasted normal, like ale, but after a few seconds, she felt an intense burning sensation throughout her body. The pain was so great, she could only scream silently, and all was black. When she came to, she was chained to a wall in a dungeon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait until those elves get here! They promised a huge gold reward for whosoever captured that little pest of theirs alive!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire felt around. Her skin was warm, and the wall cold.</span></div></div>",

It read,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<i>Dreseth has been acting rather strange after giving that report about those Telvanni mages picking up the bodies of our most recent prisoners 3 days ago. After I had a short talk with him about his suffering performance, due to his most recent botched contract, he said he's had difficulty sleeping at night. Said he keeps having terrifying dreams of zombie werewolves and a spectral dragon tearing us all to shreds in a manner more violent than any of us had witnessed before. I don't understand how dreams could have such an effect on one of our top assassins, but I don't like the sound of it at all. Such highly-detailed dreams could only be a message from beyond, saying we have to get out of here, otherwise we'll end up far worse than that dark elf with the Imperial dragon tattoo. If our patrols see one of them, they're to report to me, and we're heading to our sanctuary by Blacklight to regroup with more assassins. Strength in numbers, as they say. Not sure how that will help us, considering we just got their battle records. There's not much on the Khajiit, but that ring had raised a few eyebrows, considering it couldn't be removed. The Khajiit also smelled of wet dog. The Dunmer, however, had a list longer than the amount of successful contracts for any of us.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0By Azura, I and five others have started having the same dream as Dreseth, and the others haven't been told of his night terrors! It's far more terrifying than I could have fathomed. It all felt so real- the pain, the suffering, the want to just roll over and die! Then there's that terrible dragon spirit. We should have just given that Dark Brotherhood assassin and her pet quick, merciful deaths! I can only pray they don't return here. Has this sanctuary been cursed? By those mages? Or are we being haunted? Nonsense! They're just dreams! They'll pass in time. I hope.</i></div></span></div></div>",

After her vision cleared, she noticed she and Kresnik were stripped down to their undergarments. Claire blushed at this less-than-pleasant surprise as a Thalmor Justiciar entered the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen, and listen well, scum,\" The Justiciar spat. \"You have been...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...arrested for my crimes against the Second Aldmeri Dominion and disrupting their foreign affairs,\" Claire finished, exaggerating a sigh. \"Got anything else to say?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Smart girl, but do you actually think the life of a criminal pays?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think crime pays,\" Claire began. \"The money's good, you travel a lot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Justiciar cut her across the stomach with a dagger. Not deep enough to cause organ damage, but enough to cause a great deal of pain and bleeding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You think your torture methods are painful?\" Claire asked. \"I nearly died at the hands of the Morag Tong, and was mutilated to the point where anyone would have thought I was beyond saving. This torture is nothing compared to the methods they employed, and do you know why they did it? They nearly killed me simply because I'm with the Dark Brotherhood.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't care about the hows and whys, all I care about is getting the answers I need. So spill what you know about those shrines being built!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Miraak, the first dragonborn is possessing people to build those shrines for him. I thought I destroyed him.

She underwent basic training in Alchemy and the Restoration art of Magicka in order to further assist herself and others in the field. Eva is an excellent archer, able to launch of a volley of arrows in quick succession, each of which has amazingly precise accuracy up to about one hundred meters. Her swordsmanship skills are also formidable and she has little trouble defending herself in combat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEva prefers to understand people with their actions rather than with words, something which very often made it difficult to form relationships with other members of the Imperial Legion. She is very strongwilled and likes it when things get done rather than wasting time. It was these problems which caused her to strongly object to the White Gold Concordant. Finally after fifteen years, the Thalmor managed to have her forcibly ejected from the legion (Under the pretenses of not abiding by the treaty) and then attempted to assasinate her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow on the run, she is tired and has just passed the border into Skyrim, a place where the Thalmor's hold is not nearly half as strong as that of Skyrim's. She is completely unable to rely on the support of the legion despite her strong loyalty to them. It is time for her to create a new life and hopefully live well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere are several options laid out for Eva. What path does she take?</span></div></div>",

A stray arrow had cut through the skin on her upper left arm, leaving a gaping wound that she only had time to wrap a crude bandage around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was no time to use any healing spells on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere wasnt time for anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarely conscious, and aware of the stolen horses own tiredness, she looked at the path in front of her.

At least with the right gold, none of them should rat her out to the Thalmor. Eva turned the weary horse east and headed into the mountains. It was sheer luck that she wasnt beset upon by a troll or a pack of wolves. Either of which would have easily made a meal out of her in this state.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, the snow covered ground gave way to frosted grass. But Eva barely noticed it. With what little focus she had left, she wanted to get away from any sort of danger. The difference between thirty minutes and thirty seconds quickly became a blur to her as the horse continued down the path, only the knowledge of the difference between cobblestone and mud prevented it from leaving the road and into the uncharted wilderness since Eva was now too tired to stay awake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhether it was a sixth sense or luck, something stirred in Eva's mind, forcing her awake.

I didn't think you'd butcher me after I was done fixing you up\"<br>\r\n\"And a grand job you've done looking after me\" Eva said, smiling lightly and turning to sit on the edge of her bed.<br>\r\n\"Now now, don't get up to quickly. Going to take a while to weed that poison out of your system\"<br>\r\n\"Poison?\" Eva asked with alarm.<br>\r\n\"A combination of honeycomb and Deathbell. Both substances are easy to come by so its easy to fix. Found it had entered through that arm wound of yours\" The woman said, jabbing it with her finger. Eva winced in pain. So that explained why she became tired so quickly. An awkwardness held in the air for a few seconds.<br>\r\n\"I'm Eva\" Eva said, making a light informal curtsey to the woman.<br>\r\n\"Ingvild\" The elderly woman said, completely straightfaced and unmoving. \"Thorvald should be upstairs finishing up with dinner. Come and share it with us\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDinner was far better than any legion rations Eva had been given. Chicken had been thrown into a pot with a wide assortment of vegetables and mixed together to form a rather tasteful stew. Although the liquid was slightly thick, it gave a delicious edge to it, locking in the flavour.<br>\r\n\"So tell me, Eva\" Thorvald said, finishing his portion and helping himself to more. \"How does a legionaire like you end up unconscious on our doorstep?\". Thorvald had an extremely thick nordic accent which for a moment made a few words difficult to understand.<br>\r\n\"Former legionaire\" Eva said quietly. Thorvald stared blankly at her.<br>\r\n\"Why'd you leave?\" He asked flatly.<br>\r\n\"I was released from active service on account of fradulent behaviour\" Eva said, clearly annoyed at the reason.<br>\r\n\"Fradulent?\" Thorvald said, his emotion unchanging.<br>\r\n\"Apparently a deep hatred for the white gold concordat counts as fradulent behaviour... That and locking a senior member of the Thalmor in his room\"<br>\r\nThorvald rumbled a deep laugh in his belly. He reached down his shirt, pulled something out and tossed it to Eva. It was a dragon in the shape of a diamond, the symbol of the legion.<br>\r\n\"They gave me that when I retired. But I'm still a legionaire. Deep down, so are you\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, there was a knock on the door: \"Thalmor Justiciars! Open up now!\" Came a voice from outside.</span></div></div>",

She hurred to get Eva downstairs and hidden behind a dozen barrels in the back of the cellar. Thorvald stalled for a few seconds before opening the door to the Justiciars.<br>\r\n\"What do you want Elf?\" He asked brutishly. Eva could hear everything through the floorboards but couldnt see upstairs.<br>\r\n\"There is a renegade in the area, wanted for high treason. You wouldnt be harbouring a felon... Would you?\" Said the Justiciar, suspicious from the start.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll Thalmor had been like this. Ever since they were given free reign to go wherever they chose, they had been extremely arrogant, actively proclaiming their own strength over humans and the like.<br>\r\n\"I'm a farmer\" Thorvald said. \"What would I achieve by hiding a felon except getting in trouble?\"<br>\r\n\"Then if your so sure of yourself, I'm sure you wouldnt mind us looking around\" The elf said. Eva could hear him push Thorvald out of the way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only sound that came from upstairs was the sound of metalclad feet on the wooden flooring. Eva sat perfectly still, muttering a silent prayer to the divines. One of the thalmor had come downstairs now and was searching around. She could see through a narrow gap in the barrels that he clearly was sure that nothing of interest was down here. He began walking back upstairs but just at the last second, turned for another look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFive minutes later, the clearly annoyed Thalmor left the farmhouse and continued down the track.<br>\r\nIngvild fetched Eva and all three sat down at the table again.<br>\r\n\"Well that was enjoyable\" Thorvald said with mock amusement. Ingvild didnt say anything. \"So, any plans for where you are going?\"<br>\r\n\"In truth, no idea\" Eva said.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Well then. We can either send you on your way with a few supplies, or you can stay here and help on the farm. I'll even pay you but the wages will be measly at best\" Thorvald said, taking a drink from his mug. Ingvild certainly brightened at the idea.<br>\r\n\"It'd be nice to have extra company around for a while\" She said brightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then it's a deal\" Eva said happily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\nSix Months Later<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEva cut the scythe through the tall blades of wheat, quickly gathering it up before it scattered before the wind. She stopped for a minute, wiped her brow and looked up. The hot sun beat down on her and a few beads of sweat had already gone down her face and dropped to the dry ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough the farm itself was relatively small, there was always plenty to do. Eva had seen farmers all her life, but never realised just how much work was involved in growing food. Looking back down, she continued to cut the wheat and pile it into a small wheelbarrow. Thorvald had happily shown her exactly what to do and became extremely relieved to see the work be divided from two people into three, thus making everything much easier. Ingvild on the other hand had taken to showing Eva how to prepare delicious meals with only the most basic ingredients.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPutting the last of the wheat in the wheelbarrow, Eva picked up the handles and wheeled it over to the small grindstone where Thorvald was busy hard at work pushing it around. If they were any richer, Thorvald would have long ago built a windmill so that it was air powered rather than man powered. Sadly, they werent exactly the richest family and as such, had to resort to either Thorvald or Eva pushing it.<br>\r\n\"Take a break Thorvald\" Eva said. \"You pile this stuff in and I'll keep pushing\"<br>\r\nThorvald stopped pushing at looked up at Eva. While Eva may have had a few beads of sweat from the mornings work, Thorvalds face was covered in it.<br>\r\n\"Thanks\" He said, taking his hands off the handle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEva got down and started pushing it around. Around and around. Each time she passed Thorvald, he piled more wheat inside to be ground down. In the city, flour was always in great demand whereas ordinary wheat was practically unsellable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNearly two hours later, the last of the flour was scooped up and dropped into the full bag. Thorvald tied the bag with a piece of rope and hauled it onto the horse pulled cart.<br>\r\n\"You know, before you were here, it'd take me all day to do this. I wouldnt get the last bag on there till sundown\"<br>\r\n\"Well, there's always plenty more to be done. I havent started uprooting the carrots or potatoes yet\" Eva smiled. Thorvald eyed her carefully.<br>\r\n\"An hours break first\" He said, heading into the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Ingvild and Thorvald prepared a small lunch, Eva headed down to her bedroom. At least, that's what she called it. Technically it was just a small rug strewn over straw with a chest beside it, but it was all Eva had now. The horse she rode in was now in the care of Thorvald who used it to pull the cart to and from the city. Eva's weapons and armour were now resting in the chest and she cleaned them on a regular basis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she had left Cyrodiil, she had only brought a small bag of coins with her. Last she counted, the bag was filled with five hundred septims. Having worked for Thorvald and Ingvild for the last few months had earned her a further one hundred and fifty three, bringing her to a grand total of six hundred and fifty septims.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe work at the farm had been good, but Eva was eventually coming to terms with the fact that she would soon need to leave. That party of Thalmor were still lurking around The Pale and it was only a matter of time before they discovered that Eva had actually been with the farmers all this time...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Eva headed upstairs to lunch and sat down at the table with Ingvild and Thorvald. Ingvild dished up the broth and they began eating slowly.<br>\r\n\"Thorvald, Ingvild... There's something I need to talk to you about\" Eva said slowly, trying to get some courage. Thorvald stopped pouring his drink and looked up at her.<br>\r\n\"Aye?\" He asked. Ingvild eyed Eva carefully.<br>\r\n\"You two are both great people but... I think it may be time for me to move on\" Eva said. Thorvald put the pitcher down and looked at Ingvild.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I knew this would happen\" He said, turning to Eva. \"It's been good having you here. When were you planning on heading out? We can provide you with a pack full of things to keep you going.\"<br>\r\n\"Tomorrow morning. I'm a wanderer, always have been.\"<br>\r\n\"Then we'll make sure to have a good dinner then\" Ingvild said, a distant smile on her face. Eva knew she didn't want her to go, but it had to be so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat evening, they feasted on thick chunks of pork, freshly slaughtered from one of the pigs round behind the farmhouse. The delicious meat was supplimented by fresh apples, lettuce and cold carrots. On the whole, it was quite nice.<br>\r\nThat night, Eva found it difficult to get to sleep, the thoughts of the journey ahead swam in her mind, as well as the thoughts of what she was leaving behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\nEva waved goodbye to Thorvald and Ingvild and headed down the path. Thorvald had fixed her up a nice backpack made of tough leather and sheep's wool. Inside was a loaf of bread, a few apples, some dried pieces of ham and a few utensils and a small lightweight cooking pot. Although it was decently heavy, Eva was easily used to the weight thanks to working for the Imperial Army.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe started walking down the path. Riften was easily a two day walking journey and judging by the height of the sun, it was roughly Ten In The Morn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe journey was completely uneventful and Eva found a long straight stick on the side of the road to use as a hiking pole. Eventually, she walked over a rise and saw the large expanse of the lake outside Riften. Riften itself was just over the edge of the horizon and it would take almost a full day to walk around the lake. Besides, the sun was already quite low and Eva suddenly realised that she had walked pretty much the whole day without eating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sat down on a fallen log just off the road and began to rummage through her bag, finding and pulling out an apple and then biting down onto it's jucy flesh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of a sudden, she was approached by a man in furs who looked worried.<br>\r\n\"Here take this and hide it!\" He said, not giving Eva a chance to respond. \"I'll be back for it later, don't lose it or i'll kill you!\"<br>\r\n\"Hey, stop!\" Eva called to the man who was still running. But it was hopeless, he had already gone round a corner and was lost from sight.<br>\r\nShe sat back down on the log and examined the steel dagger. Overall, it was completely unremarkable but it had an odd reddish tint to the blade.<br>\r\n\"It's enchanted\" She murmured. \"Wonder what's been done to it\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost as if on cue, Eva was approached by a different man, this time clad in a leather jerkin with a bow in his hands. The only noticeable feature about him was the scar down his left cheek and the nose which must have been broken several years ago as it hadnt reset into the right place. If it wasnt for that, he'd be quite handsome. \"Did you see someone come past here a short while ago?\" He asked, clearly out of breath.</span></div></div>",

Eva put the hilt in his hand.<br>\r\n\"Thanks! Did you see where the bastard went?\" He asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEva stood up and pointed in the direction of where the fur clad man had run. \"Down that way\" She said, \"But I don't know how far. Lost sight of him round the bend\"<br>\r\n\"Good enough. I'm gonna kill him for this.\" The man said, annoyed. But before he went, he pulled out a septim and flicked it to Eva. \"Thanks\" He said, and ran off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe whole event had taken only five minutes.<br>\r\n\"Well that was interesting\" She murmured. She sat back down on the log and finished eating her apple.<br>\r\nHaving finished it down to the core, she threw the dead husk away into the forest. The sun was still settling over the horizon and Eva decided to use the remaining light to find a better camping spot. She was all too aware of the fact that bears roamed the wilds in country so she found a slight dip behind some bushes that would mask her from sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnravelling her bedroll, Eva finished off her meagre dinner with a few pieces of smoked fish and then rolled up in her makeshift bed and soon fell asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was early morning when Eva awoke, sitting up and stretching her arms out. A loud yawn escaped from her mouth before she had even begun to think. It was natural for Eva to wake early on any morning and the sun had only just peaked over the horizon. A perfect time to continue walking. Eva ate another apple from her bag, packed up her bedroll and picked up her hiking pole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sun had risen high in the sky and it was almost midday when Riften finally came into sight. The road had snaked off away from the lake for a while and Eva was surprised to discover just how close she was to the city now. Looking to her left, she found a small group of islands out on the lake, a mansion occupying the biggest one with bridges connecting each island to the mainland. Another hour later and the southern gate of Riften was in sight, a lone guard was leaning against the wall. He stood to attention as Eva approached. Clearly he didnt trust her, as his hand rested on the hilt of his sword, sheathed by his side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Greetings!\" Eva called out in a friendly manner.<br>\r\n\"This gate is closed\" The guard said firmly, obviously not caring for Eva's greeting.<br>\r\n\"Oh, why so?\" She asked.<br>\r\n\"Not my problem. Go around to the main gate\"<br>\r\n\"Sorry, I'm new to these parts. Whats the easiest way to get there then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite the helmet completely covering the guards face, Eva was fairly certain that he was staring at her.<br>\r\n\"Around that way\" He said, pointing to the east.<br>\r\n\"Thanks\" She said happily, heading in the direction he indicated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took a further two hours to go around the city, Riftens walls were high and long. However Eva did notice that they didn't appear to be thick. They looked like they were just to keep unwanted people out.<br>\r\n\"Or in...\" She muttered to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, she approached the maingate. There was a stable just outside and two guards standing at the door. The same as the other gate, they both appeared bored. One of them took a few steps towards her.<br>\r\n\"Hello!\" Eva called out happily.<br>\r\n\"Welcome to Riften traveller. You heading inside?\" He asked.<br>\r\n\"Aye, that I am\"<br>\r\n\"Great. That's ten septims\" The guard said.<br>\r\n\"Sorry, what?\" Eva asked, confused.<br>\r\n\"Ten septims to enter the city. Entrance tax. One off\"<br>\r\nEva was stunned. This had never happened in any city she had ever been to - and she had travelled across most of Tamriel.<br>\r\n\"Surely this is a shake down?\" She asked. The guard stood solid, his hand still outstretched wanting the money. Eva rolled her eyes and produced the requested gold.<br>\r\n\"Excellent. Enjoy your stay in Riften traveller, don't cause any fuss\" The guard said, putting the coins in a small wooden box on the ground.<br>\r\nEva didn't reply as she entered through the large wooden gates.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe great city of Riften now stood before Eva in all it's less than intoxicating glory. Two options stood out before Eva</span></div></div>",

Eva had been forced to leave her military armour back at the farmhouse and as such, had travelled in a simple attire of a long sleeved dark blue tunic with a black apron. Although it was very comfortable to wear, it would definately not be of any value in keeping her alive in an armed fight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEva strode through town, all to aware of the fact that people appeared to be unusually silent, though nobody appeared to be looking cautiously at her. Having crossed through the marketplace, Eva reached the blacksmith. A man was at the anvil, hammering a piece of metal into shape. He briefly stopped, looked it over and then tossed it into a trough of cold water.<br>\r\n\"Hail!\" She said. The blacksmith turned to her.<br>\r\n\"Greetings traveller! Names Balimund. Have you come to trade?\" The blacksmith responded in a thick nordic accent.<br>\r\n\"Indeed I have\" Eva said. \"I'll need a full fitting for some armor\"<br>\r\n\"Aye, that's expensive depending on what your looking for... Could you tell me what you'd be wanting?\"<br>\r\n\"Something with a decent level of protection. Perhaps some steel?\"<br>\r\n\"Ah, good ol' fashioned nordic steel. That'll stop the blow of many weapons. What kind though; ordinary or plate? Plate is far stronger, but it's more expensive and heavier. Of course, if you've got the gold, I've got the equipment\"<br>\r\n\"I was told that if I provided ingots, it would lower the cost?\"<br>\r\n\"Aye madam, that it would. Though if you've got all the metal you need, you might as well do it yourself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEva held up a hand to stop him. She didn't really know anything about metalworking. \"It's fine\" She said, and produced a single steel ingot from her backpack. She handed it to Balimund and he studied it carefully.<br>\r\n\"Hmph... Looks like it's in fine condition. Alright, that'll knock off the price a little. Come inside and see what we have in stock.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEva followed Balimund inside his shop. There were several questions asked and comments exchanged about size, shape and weight. Eventually, Eva happily settled on a steel curiass with pauldrons, steel gloves, steel boots and a steel helmet with a chainmail neck guard. Overall, she was happy with her purchase and the ingot had knocked off the price somewhat. Rather than paying a near five hundred septims, she had settled on four hundred. All of the armour pieces also were covered in the traditional nordic carvings which distingushed them from armour's in other parts of Tamriel. Balimund let Eva get changed in another room and she came out very happy with her purchase.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pleasure doing business with you.\" Balimund said, finally taking the gold from her. \"Feel free to stop by any time\"<br>\r\n\"Thanks Balimund. I'm sure you've made this armour well\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEva left the blacksmith's shop and headed back outside into the cool fresh air. Now, her first task was done.</span></div></div>",

While the scars of battle are evident across his body, none of these old wounds have even pierced the thick, naturally scaled armor that shields his limbs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Biography: A relatively young dragon in comparison to the ages of his kin, his ferocity and cunning in battle earned Vulunslad a fearful recognition during the Dragon War as Alduin's new right wing lieutenant after the betrayal of Paarthurnax to mankind. By the time he had fallen during the intensity of the final battle, he was surrounded by the bodies of dozens of revolting Nords and traitor dragons that sought to slay him. He would not fall without taking a toll and even with his dying breath, he was not satisfied... Now, as he rises from the ashes of his burial tomb during his revival by Alduin, he seeks to sate his thirst.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, what now?</span></div></div>",

A perilous mental continuum was the least direct way to describe this state. One could only guess how long this perpetuated for... But then there was a feeling of movement, very rigid, yet still considerable in comparison to his past lack of sensation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe darkness was still there, but Vulunslad could feel solid ground, the rigidness of the dirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>...Tiid~ Vo!</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbove himself, he could hear the words for \"time\" and \"undo\" come from a very familiar voice. When he had finally regained his vision, he saw the ebony-black wings of Alduin beating far off into the horizon, towards the West. Vulunslad knew that this time would finally come and the waiting developed the ire within him to roaring extent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he came to the recognition that Skyrim had changed to a great extent from the times long past, something caught his attention. To his left, he heard a shaky, rattling gasp; apparently a younger Nordic farmhand clad in leather was chasing after a runaway stead, where both the farmhand and the horse bore witness to the whole event. An emptiness gnawed at Vulunslad and he knew that he did not fully recover his energy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe began to utter the words, \"<i>Gaan, Lah... Haas!</i>\" towards the duo, with utmost emphasis on the word 'Haas', meaning 'health'. As soon as he did so, the horse collapsed unto the ground and ceased to move. The farmhand was a little more fortunate, only losing his breath for a second and forcefully regaining it the next. Wide-eyed, the Nord just stared at his aggressor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling a wonderful resurgence within himself from the gained life-force, Vulunslad peered deeply into the farmhand and simply put, \"I must thank you for your tribute... It has been a long time since one such as yourself gave an offering to me. For that, you may live. Now go and tell the world of my, Vulunslad's, return!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith silent haste, the farmhand scrambled out of the passage and fled while clutching his chest. As Vulunslad turned away, he glimpsed towards the north to see a large lake-side settlement to the north, just past the horizon. While he did not know that the place was called Riften, he knew what his next goal was as he gazed intently at his future dominion.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Only a decree of heavenly establishment could sway Vulunslad from his path of intent. His strength was regained and his mind was clear, for once.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he reared back and took to flight, he noticed a vaguely memorable structure dug deep into the snows close to his burial ground; Forelhost. As far as he had known, it was the last bastion for the cult followers during the final moments of the war. He cracked a small laugh during his flight. It was amusing that the victors of the war never took the place apart or, at least, caved it in. Something else caught his attention from above: a blazing campfire just in front of Forelhost's entrance, with what appeared to be a tall elf changing between two vastly different armor sets next to the tent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a powerful landing, Vulunslad swooped down beside the camp, shaking the ground with such force that nearly knocked the elf over. A sudden glance of shock came over the high elf's face as he reactively grabbed his weapon from his side. With preemptive confidence, Vulunslad merely spat the first word of his thu'um \"<i>Zun!</i>\" for 'weapon' and the elf's hand axe was sent flying into the snow behind him. In moments, the unarmed and terrified fighter was yelling for mercy, saying, \"No! I beg of you, I do not know what you want, but spare me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVulunslad contemplated this offer. He responded to the elf, simply putting, \"I seek knowledge. Tell me about the settlement to the north of this tomb.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The settlement!? Y-you mean Riften? The Nords call it a haven for thieves and corruption... But that's all I know! I swear!\" the elf shakily said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe drake grinned for a moment. Riften. Thievery in plain sight and behind closed doors. A locale just waiting for a change, with hardly any opposition... A rather low start for a new domain, but Vulunslad was already interested. He gave a demeaning gaze towards the elf and said, \"I can see that you value your life. However, it is already within my grasp. If you want it back, then you shall buy it with anything of value that you find within this derelict tomb of times long past. Your payment will be taken upon my return here.\" As soon as the dragon took to the air once more, the elf began to think about his current predicament and hastily ran to the snow behind his camp in search of his lost weapon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAway from the mountains and ancient burial grounds, Vulunslad peered deeply at the town of Riften from above, with its high walls and large docking platforms. At this height, he could see the outlining buildings, stalls in the town center, and the lower-level moats of water running through the bottom of the area. After an initial scan, he seized his perch directly on top of the high wall behind a forge on the western side of the center. Shouts of 'Dragon!' and the running of numerous citizens could be heard below. Soon enough, every guard in sight was readying a bow aimed directly at the ensuing threat. Before any arrow could be fired, Vulunslad calmly pronounced his presence with one of his favorite thu'ums, bellowing, \"<i>Faas, Ru... Maar!</i>\". As soon as the sound vibrated across the cityscape, anyone left wielding a weapon in his vision was madly fleeing to safety from the dragon. Vulunslad grinned in satisfaction. It was a long, long time since he was able to insinuate mass fear before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, his grin quickly turned to a frown of denial. There, almost directly below him, elapsed in his ecliptic shadow over the forge alongside the high wall was a warrior who was not fleeing. Rather, the warrior bore the same surprised frown as Vulunslad did. There was something... different about this warrior. The thoughts were racing through the dragon's mind; Magic? No, no magic could stand against the might of a fully mastered thu'um. Was it a Daedra? No, those demonic incantations were chased towards the ends of Tamriel. But then... What...</span></div></div>",
