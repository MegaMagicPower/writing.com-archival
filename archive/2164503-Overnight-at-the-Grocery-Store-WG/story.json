            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It all started on a balmy Summer afternoon when Peter's mother had taken him to the grocery store. As Peter paced down the aisles under the looming shadow of his mother, he eyed the items on the shelves, running his fingers tips along bags of chips and gummy worms. His stomach growled, a painful reminder that he hadn't had breakfast. As if on queue, Peter's mother, an imposingly large woman with a glued on grimace, smacked his hand away from the shelves. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I ain't buying you that crap, you're fat enough,\" she muttered. Even her muttering was shrill, and the unpleasant tone was highlighted by her dumping two large bottles of store brand coke into her cart and her own sagging paunch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeter pulled his hand back, recoiling at the sting. He looked down at his pudgy belly, blushing with shame. He didn't know why his belly made his mom so upset. He didn't see anything wrong with it, but somehow it was enough to be used as an excuse to make life at home a living hell sometimes. Peter's only solace was when he could slip out to the backyard when his parents weren't paying attention and spend time with the boy next door, Aaron. Sometimes Aaron would come to his house when his father drank too much, so the two boys spent a lot of time together over the past few years. Aaron taught Peter lots of things, like how to steal money from his parents, how to patch up cuts and bruises, and funnily enough, multiplication and division.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeter snapped back to attention, now finding himself at the customer courtesy counter, treated to the harsh sounds of his mother arguing over something about prices and wine bottles. Peter had seen his mother do this before. She'd typically put up a fight about nothing until they gave her a discount and she'd celebrate by having a few glasses once they got home. He knew he's have time to slip away and pick up something from the bakery with the money he'd slowly swiped over the past week.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the other side of the grocery store, the bakery was typically a popular place for shoppers, with sweet treats and fresh breads, and conveniently close to the ice cream aisle. However, when Peter approached the counter, he peered through the glass window behind which stood small pastries and saw nobody. Blood rushing and stomach ever growling, Peter made the split decision to sneak around the counter and snag a cupcake or two. \"It'll be fine,\" he thought. \"Just be fast and act like nothing is wrong, just like Aaron says.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCLUNK<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCupcake in hand, Peter spun around, ready to apologize and cry, but there was still nobody in sight. Instead, Peter noticed a pile of boxes that had fallen over on their own, and a strange panel behind them. Peter knew that sometimes when there are electrical boxes and other mechanical things that buildings don't use, they sometimes get forgotten and patched up so they don't draw attention, but this one seemed different. It didn't look like it had been painted over and the stains on the wall ran across it uninterrupted, giving it the appearance that it hadn't been discovered. In fact, the panel's slumping forward was what knocked the boxes down. Peter found himself drawn slowly towards the panel, curious about what could be behind it as he slowly licked the frosting off the chocolate cupcake in his hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCramming the rest of the treat into his mouth to leave his hands free, Peter pried the panel open a small bit more to peer inside. Beyond was an empty space that was both dark and spacious. Peter yanked on the panel until it gave enough for him to slip his pudgy body inside. Light crept into the room from the bakery outside, providing enough dimness for Peter to see. The room was simply a space between the walls, coated in a light layer of dust under which sat a tile flooring that looked like it was chosen in the 80's. There were a few power outlets but no furniture. The beams of the walls showed on all sides, making the room clearly appear incomplete. The room was the size of a small living room. Something about the space felt cozy, despite how dangerously unclean it appeared. Satisfied with his find, Peter placed the panel back in the wall and snuck back to his mother, undetected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater that day, as Peter's mom was on her third glass of cheap chardonnay, the young boy wandered off to his backyard to find Aaron waiting for him<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Aaron!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Peter. How's it going?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not bad, I suppose.\" Peter shrugged. \"You know how you showed me that video game where you went through portals?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, Portal 2,\" Aaron said dismissively, hoping he wasn't about to be asked to play that game again. He was not in the mood to head back into his house, and the thought of going back made him more aware of the bruise he was rubbing on his arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I found a secret room today, like those ones the rat guy lives in!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, it's behind the wall in the bakery at the grocery store on Stedman Street. You could totally make a secret base there, and you wouldn't have to worry about food like I said the rat guy did since it's in the store!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You would think about the food.\" Aaron grinned teasingly and grabbed at Peter's belly, to which the younger boy responded with a giggle and twitching away. The two continued their teasing poking for a few minutes before falling on the ground laughing. \"Well, maybe you should move there so I don't have to worry about losing my stress ball!\" Aaron joked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, Aaron. You make me feel better about being fat, ya know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, yeah. Say, how did you even get into the bakery?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There was nobody there, I guess.\" Peter stared off at a cloud. \"Weird.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah, I think my cousin works there and I heard him say everyone there's off training a few towns away. It'll probably be like that for a week.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"More cupcakes for me then! I stole one from the case.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's how it's done!\" Aaron patted Peter on the back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat night, Aaron lay awake in his bed staring at the low ceiling of his room. He shut his eyes, only to be kept awake by the booming of music and cop shows downstairs. \"I can't sleep here...\" Aaron thought to himself. \"Damnit, I've got to get out of this place some day. Get a place of my own with no adults... Like...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A secret base...\" He said out loud. His mind flashed to the bakery grocery store. For a week it'd be abandoned and easy to sneak into... Could it be done?</span></div></div>",

This would take an hour after closing when both Aaron and Peter can be seen sneaking around the building without getting caught.  They brought along some bags and sleeper items, so that they can sleep for the remainder of the week.  Luckily it was eleven at night, so everyone may be sleeping than the two still awakened and both crouched down to find a way in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright, you lead the way to the hole you saw the other day, but try not make any sounds while we here.  Got it?\u201d  Aaron whispered when asked his next door neighbour, Peter to lead the way quietly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay Aaron, I will!\u201d  Peter replied with a thumbs up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so Peter crouches forward and leads the way by the walls as much quiet as he can.  He can see the hole he spotted before, and thankfully someone had fixed up some problem, leaving the two all clear to get in.  They placed the bags in and Peter crawls through first before he would pull Aaron in a dark looking storage room behind the bakery Peter saw a some days ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhoa!  I never felt this very creepy than I expected when it closes.\u201d  Peter shivered a bit as he had to describe the place as unusual scary to say the least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know, but at least we\u2019ll in now, and no one is gonna stop us whatever happens to this place.\u201d  Aaron shrugged it off and worries nothing about the place now under siege by the two boys to camp out.  \u201cNow let\u2019s get out stuff unpacked and see what we can do from there.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat\u2019s what these two are doing now, as both unpacked their stuff, forming a sleeping bag on the floor, had some cables to charge up mobile in case they might play some games just in case, and other things they could use during a course of a week.  Once it had been sorted, the two boys look around and felt like there\u2019s so many food to feed, especially the the place is so huge to explore.  They had this curious look and wondered otherwise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSay, do you wanna go and starting stuffing ourselves straight away?\u201d  Aaron wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I\u2019m getting hungry all of the sudden.\u201d  Peter replied and poked his chubby belly, which made himself giggle when it felt like tickles to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sure you are!\u201d  Aaron sarcastically responded with laughter before he felt his stomach growling too.  \u201cNow let\u2019s __________ and eat everything we like to stuff ourselves on!\u201d</span></div></div>",

One of these, is to spend twenty-four hours in the grocery store, which luckily someone managed to complete this without getting caught as a result.  This has surprised an eight year old boy by any means, and finds this really challenging to say the least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhoa!  I couldn\u2019t believe how he manages without being seen.\u201d  Lewis was disbelief at this point when he had finished watching the video.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was fascinating for Lewis to see this and he could think about this for the long while.  It was then at that point, when he stomach had started to growl and was feeling hungry much badly  once he gotten to his bed to get some sleep.  It was in the middle of the night, and it was the worst time, knowing he can get caught by his parents if he was to head to the kitchen to have his own feast he shouldn\u2019t have at this time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis is when he would realised something coming from his head when thinking about it.  He was so starving and desperate, his thoughts turned to when thinking about the grocery store this person attempted before, where there are so many foods can be found all over the place.  That was an ideal he had in mind, and wondered if he could ever try and attempt this challenge just like a guy did before, but eating so much food as much as he can?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm... I bet it\u2019ll be fun, if I can lock myself in the store and eat everything whatever I want?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was Lewis\u2019 aim and it would only take a couple of days to prepare, and it was nighttime when it happens now.  Lewis can be seen in his clothes and a bag on his back, and had to sneak behind the back of the store where the trucks loads stuff into the building.  Luckily, the door was unlocked when it shouldn\u2019t be, and a youngster was at the right place, right time when he went in and was at dark looking grocery store he stumbled upon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe couldn\u2019t believe that all of the store is completely empty with nobody around, except himself and the food all over, and Lewis couldn\u2019t wait to get started when his flat stomach growled once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow!  That\u2019s a lot of food to fill into my empty stomach, and I\u2019m so starving!  I guess there\u2019s no time waste then and start stuffing myself at...</span></div></div>",
