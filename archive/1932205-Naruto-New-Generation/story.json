Target confirmed.\" He said as he was holding the cat.<br>\r\n\"Good work Haruto.\" Said the source of the older voice over the radio. <br>\r\nHaruto Uzumaki<br>\r\nAge: 12 <br>\r\nRank: Genin. <br>\r\nAppearance: straight red hair, light blue eyes, whisker-like marks on cheeks, headband around his forehead, red and black jumpsuit.<br>\r\nVillage: Leaf.<br>\r\n\"Thank's Konohamaru Sensei.\" Haruto said.<br>\r\nKonohamaru Sabutobi<br>\r\nAge: 28<br>\r\nRank: Jonin<br>\r\nAppearance: spiky brown hair, black eyes, long light blue scarf around his neck, headband around his forehead, standard Leaf vest with black body suit.<br>\r\nVillage: Leaf.<br>\r\n\"You know that you would not be able to get Leo (the cat) if we were not here too.\" Said a young boy around the same age as Haruto.<br>\r\n\"Ryousake!\" Haruto said as the two glanced at each other fiercely.<br>\r\nRyousake Uchiha<br>\r\nAge: 12<br>\r\nRank: Genin<br>\r\nAppearance: Shoulder length black hair in a ponytail, black eyes, faded scar going down his left eye, headband around his left bicep, white top with a hi-collar and blue pants.<br>\r\nVillage: Leaf<br>\r\n\"Calm down Haruto, Ryousake.\" Said a girl there age.<br>\r\n\"Keep out of this Kei.\" They both said in unison.

At that the two started to look at each other with daggers.<br>\r\n\"Alright you two that is enough.\" Konohamaru said as he tried to calm them down. The two then looked away from each other. \"That was close.\" He said to himself. <br>\r\nWith that they then headed to the Hokage's office with the cat in hand.<br>\r\n\"Leo, darling you made mommy scared.\" The cat's owner said. She then payed for the mission and left.<br>\r\n\"Good work.\" The current Hokage said.<br>\r\n\"Thanks dad...

We need a harder mission.\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I mean how are we to get better if we are stuck in the village.\" Kei said.<br>\r\n\"I see a lot of use in this team.\" Naruto said to himself. \"Konohamaru, what do you say?\"<br>\r\n\"Well I think they have the skills to do higher missions.\" He said.<br>\r\n\"Alright then, I have a mission that would be just your speed.\" Naruto said. \"It is an escort mission. You are to accompany a guest back to his home land and then return with a package.\" <br>\r\n\"Sounds easy enough.\" Ryousake said to himself. \"But there must be a catch.<br>\r\n\"So who are we escorting?\" Haruto said.<br>\r\n\"Let her in.\" Naruto said. With that the door was opened and then entered a young girl, looked to be 5, in a wheelchair. \"This is Tanya, she is from the Land of Iron and was brought here in need of surgery. It is your job to get her back in one piece. Understand!\" <br>\r\n\"Of course Naruto.\" Konohamaru said. <br>\r\n\"How long until she is cleared to travel?\" Naruto asked the nurse that wheeled Tanya in.<br>\r\n\"Lady Sakura wishes to do one last check but it should be tomorrow morning.\"<br>\r\n\"Okay then you are dismissed until then Team.\" Konohamaru said.<br>\r\n\"Yes sensei.\" They said.

Why would we be sent to return her?\" Kei asked.<br>\r\n\"Now that you mention it that is a point.\" Haruto said.<br>\r\n\"Whatever the reason a mission is a mission.\" Ryousake said.<br>\r\n\"Why do you have to be so serious all the time?\" Haruto asked. \"We are not on a mission so relax.\" <br>\r\n\"Yeah whatever.\" Ryousake said. <br>\r\nHe then started off. \"I better get going too.\" Kei said. \"I have to pick up some things from the store on the way home so I better get going before it get's too late.\" With that she headed out as well.<br>\r\n\"Now what am I to do?\" Haruto asked himself.

You focus so much on nutrition the food is that there is no taste.\" Sasuke said.<br>\r\n\"Well excuse me for worrying about yours and the kid's health.\" Sakura said.<br>\r\n\"Enough.\" Then was a loud yell and then the table had a hole through it. The source of the hole and yell was Akiza. \"I hate it that the two of you fight.\" <br>\r\n\"Fine you are right.\" Sasuke said.<br>\r\n\"Yeah you make a point.\" Sakura said.<br>\r\n\"Good.\" Akiza said. \"Now I am going to finish my Omushubi and then we will repair the table.\"<br>\r\n\"I will help but I don't see why.\" Ryousake said. <br>\r\n\"Good.\" Akiza said.<br>\r\nAt Kei's house.

Sorry for being late.\" Konohamaru said.<br>\r\n\"Just don't make it a habit.\" Haruto said. \"Let's go.\" He was about to walk off but then stopped. \"Where is the Land of Iron?\"<br>\r\n\"I will take lead but first I will be describing the way we will be traveling.\" Konohamaru said. \"Tanya's legs still are weak so we will be traveling by carriage. Kei you will be in the carriage with Tanya while Haruto and Ryousake are on either side of the carriage while I take the rear. Got that?\"<br>\r\n\"Yes sensei.\" They said. With that they started on the mission.<br>\r\nThere were about half way to the Land of Iron when they stopped. \"Is there something wrong?\" Asked Haruto.<br>\r\n\"We are reaching the border so the weather will be getting colder so we better stop for the night so to build our strenth for the journey.\" Konohamaru said.<br>\r\n\"He is right. Plus I think the trip is effecting Tanya.\" Kei said.<br>\r\n\"Fine by me, I just want use to get to the Land of Iron in one piece with little incident.\" Ryousake said.<br>\r\n\"Okay then.\" Haruto said disappointed. With that they found an inn and stayed the night. The next day they continued there travels. \"Man it is getting cold.\" Haruto commented.<br>\r\n\"The Land of Iron is a land that has periodical snow fall so of course it is cold.\" Ryousake said.<br>\r\n\"Shut up.\" Haruto said.<br>\r\n\"Stop fighting each other.\" Kei said. Then she felt it.<br>\r\n\"You sense that?\"Ryousake whispered to Haruto and he gave a nod. \"How many?\"   <br>\r\nHaruto then made a hand sign. \"Byakugan! Ten, low chakra levels. They're bandits.\" Haruto said. \"We are surrounded.\" Just then the bandits jumped out from the trees around them. \" Just live this to me.\" Haruto then jumped up and then started and the pursuit and then fought them with taijutsu and took them out with out killing them. \"That was easy.\" Haruto said. \"Too easy.\" He then turned around with a kunai in hand and slashed a incoming arrow. \"There was another one.\"<br>\r\n\"I missed.\" The archer said as he was reaching to reload. but the moment he reached for another arrow he could feel a blade to his throat.<br>\r\n\"Don't move.\" Said Konohamaru how was behind him. The archer lowered his hand. \"Good now tell me were you hired by someone to attack us?\" <br>\r\n\"Not you the girl.\" The archer said.<br>\r\n\"Why is that?\" Konohamaru asked.<br>\r\n\"She is the key to stabilizing the allies of the Shinobi and Samurai, if that was to happen my employer would not like it.\" The archer said.<br>\r\n\"Who is your employer?\" Konohamaru asked.<br>\r\n\"His name is...\" Just then an arrow came flying at him and hit him straight in the heart.<br>\r\n\"Silenced before he could reveal anything. What a waste.\" Konohamaru said. He then returned to the team and explain it to them.<br>\r\n\"So we have to keep her safe from more then bandits. It would be harder but I am all for it.\" Haruto said.<br>\r\n\"Same here.\" Ryousake said. <br>\r\n\"There is little chance I be left out.\" Kei said.<br>\r\n\"This three are sure complicated.\" Konohamaru said. \"Okay then let's get her back to her home.\"<br>\r\n\"Right.\" They all said.</span></div></div>",

They were being led by a man with long black hair that was spread out behind him wearing the same armor as the rest with a single sword at his side. The platoon stopped and the man spoke. \"My name is Kenshin, i serve under General Takei, He was worried about attack so he sent us to investigate.\" <br>\r\n\"We are ninja of the Leaf sent to escort this girl to her father. Your General I presume.\" Konohamaru said.<br>\r\n\"Well it is good that you got her this far safe. Now if you don't mind we will take her the rest of the way.\" Kenshin said as he started towards the carriage. Just as he was getting close a kunai was thrown at him and he jumped back. \"What is the meaning of this?\" <br>\r\n\"You goofed.\" Konohamaru said. \"You came without a helmet on. Also this amount of men for recon is too small. Also your movements are to relaxed.\" Konohamaru said. \"Finally, only generals would carry a single blade.\"<br>\r\n\"Is that so.\" With that Kenshin jumped back in front of his platoon. \"Well no need for the charade anymore.\" Kenshin said. He then draw his sword and charged at the Genin but Konohamaru blocked the attack and countered.\"I will take you out first Leaf Ninja.\" With that they started to fight.<br>\r\n\"Team take Tanya and go.\" Konohamaru said. <br>\r\n\"But Sensei, We can't leave you.\" Haruto said.<br>\r\n\"Haruto, you and the others will go. Kenshin here may not have been sent by her father but he is still skilled enough that I can't fight and protect the four of you. Now go.\" Konohamaru said in a serious tone.<br>\r\nAt that the Genin took hold of Tanya and left. Kenshin pushed Konohamaru back. \"After them and remember to bring the girl back alive.\" With that the men that were with him ran after the Genin. Konohamaru was about to go after them but Kenshin stopped him. \"I don't think so.\" <br>\r\nMeanwhile with the Genin and Tanya. They have been running for some time and have found a place to hid and caught their breath. \"Are we safe?\" Kei asked.<br>\r\n\"They are approaching fast, we have to get moving again.\" Haruto said. They were about to leave when Tanya fell over. \"Tanya, what's wrong.\" <br>\r\n\"Let me see her.\" Ryousake said as he went up to Tanya. \"She is still weak from the operation and pushed herself too much.\" He then looked her in the eyes and said. \"We can't stay here, I am going to carry you is that okay?\" Tanya nodded. \"Okay help her onto my back.\" With that Haruto picked her up and placed her on Ryousake's back. \"Hold tight.\" With that he started off and the rest of his team following him. They soon got to a old shack and entered it and placed her down. Ryousake then started to look her over.<br>\r\n\"What are you doing Ryousake?\" Haruto asked. \"We don't have time to  sit around. We need to think about our next move.\"<br>\r\n\"Quiet Haruto.\" Ryousake said. \"If you are so worried go and keep watch.\"<br>\r\n\"Whatever.\" Haruto then stepped outside. <br>\r\nKei then stepped out with him. \"Still made about leaving Konohamaru sensei?\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah but that Ryousake, what makes him think he can give orders since sensei is not here?\" Haruto asked.<br>\r\n\"Haruto, what do you now about Ryousake's parents?\" Kei asked.<br>\r\n\"I know that his mom is Lady Sakura, head of the medical corp, and that she was on my dad's team.\" Haruto said.<br>\r\n\"And of his father?\" Kei asked.<br>\r\n\"Just that his name is Sasuke and that he is Jonin.\" Haruto said.<br>\r\n\"What you don't know is that his dad was a rogue ninja that was wanted by the Five Great Nations.\" Kei said. This shocked Haruto. \"Think about it, being the son of a traitor.\" <br>\r\n\"Kei, you talk too much.\" Haruto said. He then activated his Byakugan. \"Here they come.\" With that he and Kei got ready for a fight.<br>\r\nBack at at the fight with Konohamaru and Kenshin.<br>\r\n\"You are strong.\" Kenshin said. \"That is why I must not let this mission fail.\"<br>\r\n\"What mission is that?\" Konohamaru asked.<br>\r\n\"Since you must be killed I will tell you, The Land of Iron must stay neutral, we cannot interact with the shinobi world and must not let you shinobi from invading ours.\" With that he charged at Konohamaru and he was sent to the ground. \"That wound will not kill you but I will take you life in time but first I must make sure that the girl is retrieved.\" With that he started off leaving Konohamaru there.<br>\r\nBack at the shed.<br>\r\n\"Where is the girl?\" asked one of the 'samurai.'<br>\r\n\"What makes you think we would tell you?\" Kei said.<br>\r\n\"It does not matter, I will kill you two and make the other one tell use.\" Another said as he charged at them.<br>\r\nKei then ran forward and then 'samurai' that attacked was on the ground. \"What?\" Said one of the 'samurai.'<br>\r\n\"That girl has some skills with a sword. But she is both a child and a girl so she is weaker then us.\" With that several of them attacked.<br>\r\n\"Then why must you attack all at once?\" Kei then placed her sword into the ground next to her and then took out from her bag a scroll and then opened it to reveal a blank scroll. She then took a brush and quickly draw on the scroll in ink. She then performed a single handed sign.\"Ninja Art: Super Beast Scroll.\" At that ink-drown Lions come out of the scroll and attacked. The 'samurai' destroyed them easily but then saw that Kei had already gotten to them and slashed them. \"They seem not to be that strong.\" She was then kicked back.<br>\r\n\"Kei!\" Haruto then jumped up and caught her. \"You okay?\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah, he caught me by surprise.\" Kei said.<br>\r\n\"Give us the girl and we may let you live.\" One of the 'samurai' said as several of them were standing ready to fight.<br>\r\n\"Never tell me to give up.\" Haruto said. He then formed his hands into a cross sign. \"Shadow Clone Jutsu.\" With that twenty copies of Haruto appeared. <br>\r\n\"How did this brat do that?\" Asked one of the \"samurai.' <br>\r\n\"It doesn't matter, get rid of them.\" With that they charged in the 'samurai' attacked but they dodged and then thrust a palm at them and disturb the flow of chakra. \"Gentle Fist and Shadow Clone using Genin, how is that possible.\" <br>\r\n\"We are not getting paid enough for this.\" One of the 'samurai' said. \"Get them.\" Just then Ryousake stepped out. \"One more will not help them.\" With that they charged. <br>\r\n\"I guess I have to use this.\" With that Ryousake performed hand signs and launched his jutsu. \"Fire Style: Fire Ball Jutsu.\" With that he launched a stream of fire and used it to cut off their path. <br>\r\n\"We're surrounded.\" At that Haruto's clones then finished the job. <br>\r\n\"You okay?\" Ryousake asked Kei.<br>\r\n\"My chest hurts but I am fine.\" Kei said.<br>\r\nRyousake's hand then glow light green and he held it over Kei's chest. \"The guy is a medical ninja.\" This is my chance to get the girl while they are distracted.\" The remaining 'samurai' crawled towards the shed but then Ryousake appeared before him. \"Please have mercy.\"<br>\r\n\"You are in luck. I don't like fighting fakes.\" With that Ryousake's eye turned from black to red with three black tomoes.\" <br>\r\n\"The Sharigan that mean this is the son of Sasuke Uchiha...\" With that the man went to sleep.<br>\r\nWith that done they were getting ready to go and head back to the Leaf with Tanya until Kenshin appeared and slashed Ryousake. \"Ryousake!\" Haruto said.<br>\r\n\"Two sure ways of winning a battle. Eliminate the leader and eliminate the medical support. Now that I have taken both out then I will give you one last chance, give me the girl.\" Kenshin said.<br>\r\n\"Ryousake!\" Said a voice from the shed.<br>\r\n\"Oh there she is.\" Kenshin said.<br>\r\n\"I will not let you take her, not as long as I still take breath.\" Haruto said.<br>\r\n\"Fine then.\" Kenshin was about to attack until he felt something. \"What is that?\"<br>\r\n\"Miss me?\" Konohamaru said.<br>\r\n\"How can you still move?\" Kenshin asked.<br>\r\n\"You never asked, what my name is. It is Konohamaru Sarutobi.\" He said.<br>\r\n\"The Second Ninja Professor.\" Kenshin said.<br>\r\n\"So even a ronin has heard of me.\" Konohamaru said. \"Now tell me who hired you to take her?\"<br>\r\n\"I am not telling.\" Kenshin said. \"Plus I will kill you like I killed your student.\"<br>\r\n\"Haruto?\" Konohamaru asked.<br>\r\nHe then activated his Byakugan. \"He is till alive.\"<br>\r\n\"Well then I will have to take care of you then.\" Konohamaru said. Just then shruiken came flying towards them and the two separated. Kenshin then ran away. \"He got way.\" Konohamaru then ran to Ryousake and then started work on him. \"There, how is that?\"<br>\r\n\"Not perfect but it will work.\" Ryousake said. Tanya then peeked out of the shed. \"It is okay I am fine.\" She then ran up and hugged him. \"Ow.\" <br>\r\n\"Sorry.\" She said.<br>\r\n\"Okay Tanya, we will be taking you directly to your father, once there you will be safe.\" Konohamaru said.<br>\r\n\"Okay.\" She said and with that they were off.<br>\r\nMeanwhile elsewhere. Kenshin was still running until he got tired and laid against a tree. Someone then approached him. He was about to attack until he saw who it was. \"You are getting sloppy.\" Said a woman in a black hooded cloak.<br>\r\n\"Shut up, you told me that those men you gave me were skilled.\" Kenshin said.<br>\r\n\"Well I never expected that they were going against such skilled ninja.\" She said. \"Well your plans are ruined.\"<br>\r\n\"Not exactly.\" He said getting up. \"My plans are about to go into the second stage.\" This confused his partner.</span></div></div>",

Even if they were not my men they still wore my armor.\"<br>\r\n\"It is fine.\" Konohamaru said. <br>\r\n\"Well if you say.\" Takei said.<br>\r\n\"If I may ask, why was Tanya in the Land of Fire in the first place?\" Konohamaru asked.<br>\r\n\"I am Tanya's father but her mother was a kunoichi I met while I was acting as an emissary for the Lord of the Land of Iron. One thing led to another and she was born of it.\" <br>\r\n\"Where is her mother now?\" Haruto asked.<br>\r\n\"Dead.\" Takei said. <br>\r\n\"Sorry.\" Haruto said.<br>\r\n\"It is okay.\" Takei said. With that on of his men entered carrying a wooden box. \"Inside this box is the second part of the mission.\"<br>\r\n\"Right.\" Konohamaru said. \"We better get going.\" <br>\r\n\"But you student is still recovering.\" Takei said.<br>\r\n\"No we must go.\" Konohamaru said. With that they left.<br>\r\nThey are now on there way back home with that package. \"You sensed it right?\" Ryousake asked.<br>\r\n\"Yeah.\" Konohamaru said. \"Come out now.\" Just then Kenshin walked out from the nearby woods.<br>\r\n\"So how long have you known I was here?\" Kenshin asked.<br>\r\n\"The moment we left the castle.\" Konohamaru said. \"Is your friend going to join us?\" <br>\r\nAt that Kenshin signaled for his partner to come out. \"You are good.\"<br>\r\n\"She must be the one that throw the shuriken that allowed him to escape.\" Kei said.<br>\r\n\"Three Genin, skilled or not their teacher is there is more then just that.\" She said.<br>\r\n\"Who are you?\" Haruto asked.<br>\r\n\"Why tell you?\" She said. \"You are just a weak little Genin.\"<br>\r\n\"Weak you say.\" Haruto said. With that Haruto rushed her but she dodged him. Haruto then turned around. \"Shadow Clone Jutsu.\" With that a single clone was formed and he used it to push himself back at her and then thrust at her with a open palm but she dodged again.<br>\r\n\"Kid you lack the skill to take me on.\" She said.<br>\r\n\"I don't need to beat you.\" Haruto said as he charged again.<br>\r\nMeanwhile back with Konohamaru and Kenshin.<br>\r\n\"So time for use to finish our fight.\" Kenshin said.<br>\r\n\"If I must then I will fight you fairly.\" Konohamaru then took out a short black rod.<br>\r\n\"That is what you mean by fight fairly.\" Kenshin then draw is sword and slashed at Konohamaru saying. \"What a joke.\" With that Konohamaru then held the rod up and used it to block the sword. \"This rod is not going to hold my blade back.\" Konohamaru then swung the rod and pushed Kenshin back. \"What! but how?\" Kenshin then saw that the small rod had extended to a staff equal to his own length.<br>\r\n\"Pseudo Adamantine Staff.\" Konohamaru said. \"My weapon of choice.\" With that said he charged and slammed Kenshin into the ground.<br>\r\n\"I will not lose.\" With that The fight continued.<br>\r\nBack with the Genin.<br>\r\n\"How is this kid not tried yet.\" The hooded kunoichi said to herself as Haruto kept attacking. She then kicked him and then Haruto puffed into smoke. \"Shadow Clone, but when?\" Then she thought about it. \"Since after that first attack.\" Just then Haruto erupted from underground. \"There he is.\" She then throw shuriken but when they hit He was replaced by a log. \"Substation Jutsu this time. Where is he?\" She looked around and saw that the other two are gone. \"They got away.\" She said and was stun to see that Kenshin was having trouble with Konohamaru.<br>\r\n\"Kinda busy Sanrai.\" He said.<br>\r\n\"Sanrai. As in Sanrai of the Hidden Rain Village.\" Konohamaru said. \"I see now.\" Konohamaru then pushed back and look at them. \"This is about the safety of your respective Lands.\" <br>\r\n\"How wrong your are.\" Sanrai said. \"This has little to do with the Land of Rain. All I want is that scroll.\" <br>\r\n\"Scroll? What about it?\" Konohamaru asked.<br>\r\n\"That scroll must have a jutsu that could make who ever have it the strongest power.\" She said.<br>\r\n\"And you are working with this wacko.\" Konohamaru asked Kenshin.<br>\r\n\"I will kill you for that remark.\" Just then a Black snake came slithering around her. \"What is this?\"<br>\r\n\"Good work Kei.\" Konohamaru said.<br>\r\n\"Thank you sensei.\" Kei said as she appeared from behind a cloth.<br>\r\n\"If that scroll is what they want why don't we destroy it and make sure that it can't fall in the wrong hands.\" Haruto asked.<br>\r\n\"Because of the seal, It is set to release an explosion that would destroy all that is with in ten miles around.\" Sanrai said. \"That is why only a seals master like myself can open it.\" <br>\r\n\"Enough of this.\" Kenshin then charged at them. \"I will not lose.\" Konohamaru then smashed the sword. \"No!\" Konohamaru then thrust the staff into Kenshin's gut. They then tied the two up. \"Go on kill us. Like you ninja all do.\" <br>\r\n\"I am a follower of the Way of Naruto. We kill only as a last resort.\" Konohamaru said as he placed his staff on his shoulders and started off.<br>\r\n\"Never turn you back on an enemy!\" Kenshin then broke from his bonds and charged at him with the remains of his sword. <br>\r\nKonohamaru then dodge the attack and then swung his staff with enough force to sever Kenshin's right arm. Kenshin was on the ground in pain when Konohamaru spoke up. \"I have killed you, your life as a samurai is over as I have severed your dominate arm. If you still wish to be able to even hold a blade stand down.\" With that said Konohamaru then wrapped the remains of his arm.<br>\r\n\"I am not as easily beaten as that samurai.\" Sanrei said as she jumped into the air to get ready to attack. But then two Konohamaru then appeared behind her. <br>\r\n\"Rasengan.\" With that the two Konohamaru rammed the Sphere of Chakra into her sending her into the ground. \"Tanya, I know you followed us.\" He said. <br>\r\nShe then stepped out from behind the tree. With her was a single samurai. \"I will leave Kenshin to you and we will take Sanrei.\" <br>\r\n\"Understood.\" The Samurai said.<br>\r\nThe Ninja were about to leave when Tanya spoke up. \"I want to met up with you guys again, that is way I have decided to became the first female Samurai.\"<br>\r\nKonohamaru then walked up to her and said. \"Being the first female samurai is going to be hard so work hard because there are no shortcuts in life. Well see you later, Tanya of the Land of Iron.\" With that they left.<br>\r\nThey soon arrived back in the Leaf Village. \"So the mission was a success.\" Naruto said. \"Good.\"<br>\r\n\"Sir, what is in the scroll?\" Ryousake asked.<br>\r\n\"Haruto, would you mind?\" Naruto asked.<br>\r\n\"Okay.\" Haruto then performed a hand sign and then the seal disappeared. He then took the scroll out and handed it to his father.<br>\r\n\"Thank you.\" Naruto then opened it. \"I see.\" He then closed it and placed it back in the box.<br>\r\n\"What is it?\" Konohamaru asked.<br>\r\n\"This scroll holds a chakra that is so vile it took the form of a beast.\" Naruto said. \"The scroll can not be destroyed as it would release the creature.\" I will place a new seal and give part of the key to the seal to someone else and keep the final piece to myself. As for the scroll itself, I will place it in a safe place. With that said you are all dismissed.\" They then took there leave. As he was leaving Haruto could hear his father say. \"Good work out there son.\"<br>\r\nOnce out of the office they headed off. \"Where are you all going?\" Konohamaru asked.<br>\r\n\"Well I have training to do.\" Haruto said.<br>\r\n\"Haruto. Mind if I join you?\" Ryousake asked.<br>\r\n\"Of course.\" Haruto said and the two started off.  \"You too Kei, we need someone to make sure we don't kill each other.\"<br>\r\n\"Okay.\" Kei said as she followed them.<br>\r\n\"Those three have grown in such a short time.\" Konohamaru said to himself. \"Not just in skills but in how they work together. Maybe they should undergo the Chuunin Exams. Nah too soon for them.\"</span></div></div>",

During that time Haruto and the others have divided there time between training, missions and just hanging out together. It is at this point that we find them just just finishing a mission. <br>\r\n\"Why are you so hard to deal with?\" Haruto said to Ryousake. <br>\r\n\"Why are you so hard to deal with?\" Ryousake replied. \"I just said that your form could use work.\" <br>\r\n\"Why you!\" Haruto said.<br>\r\n\"Okay you two top this know.\" Konohamaru said. Just then he looked up to see a hawks flying towards the Hokage's tower. \"It is that time already.\" He said to himself while the two boys argued. \"I will let you deal this out yourself.\" <br>\r\n\"You leaving?\" Kei asked.<br>\r\n\"Yeah I have to make my report on the mission. Met up tomorrow at the stone of heroes.\" With that he left.<br>\r\n\"Well I guess we have the rest of the day off.\" Kei said.<br>\r\n\"Well I don't know about you but I am going to train.\" Ryousake said.<br>\r\n\"Training is all and good but we should stop and have some fun once in awhile.\" Haruto said.<br>\r\n\"You are too laid back.\" Ryousake said. With that said he left. <br>\r\n\"Up tight.\" Haruto said.<br>\r\n\"If you want to do something I would love to.\" Kei said.<br>\r\n\"Kei, well I guess but I have no idea as to what to do.\" Haruto said. Just then in the condor of his eye he saw a big square stone. He turned around and said. \"That is not going to work. I know you are there.\" <br>\r\n\"Man, what a waste.\" Just then the box explode with pink smoke and then two kids, one boy and one girl,  were standing in place of the stone.<br>\r\n\"It takes more then that to full a ninja.\" Just then Haruto got a kick to the head. \"What the?\" Haruto looked up to see that his brother had just kicked him. \"Kenta, what is the big idea?\"<br>\r\n\"Are you done with missions because you said we could play ninja if you are not busy.\" Kenta said.<br>\r\n\"And who are this two?\" Haruto asked.<br>\r\n\"I am Anezi.\" The Girl said pointing at herself.<br>\r\n\"My name is Reichi.\" The boy said nervously.<br>\r\n\"And Of course you know me Kenta.\" Haruto's brother introduced himself. \"And the three of use are Team Kenta.\"<br>\r\n\"Team Kenta. Really?\"\" Haruto said. \"Well I did promise to play ninja with you all. Sorry Kei but a promise is a promise.\"<br>\r\n\"That is okay, mind if I watch?\"  Kei asked.<br>\r\n\"Hey Haruto, who is she?\" Kenta asked.<br>\r\n\"You remember Kei don't you?\" Haruto said.<br>\r\n\"Kei... Whoa I thought you were a boy!\" Kenta said.<br>\r\n\"That is not nice to say.\" Haruto said as he placed Kenta in a headlock. Kei just laughed.<br>\r\n\"So is she your...\" Kenta was in the middle of asking but Haruto added more pressure.<br>\r\n\"She is a friend and teammate and that is it.\" Haruto said.<br>\r\n\"Plus he has a crush on...\" Kei was saying until Haruto interrupted. <br>\r\n\"Kei learn to be discreet.\" Haruto said as he let go of Kenta and faced Kei.<br>\r\n\"Well let's get to playing.\" Anezi said.<br>\r\n\"You guys go on and start I will catch up later.\" Haruto said and they ran off. He then turned to Kei and said. \"Listen Kei sorry about the way I said we were only friends.\" <br>\r\n\"It is alright, you are not my type anyway.\" Kei said.<br>\r\n\"Thanks I guess.\" Haruto said. \"Well let's go and catch up with the others.\" Just then they heard a scream. \"That is Kenta's voice.\" With that the two of them ran off. They soon arrived at a scene of a boy around the same age as him holding in the air Kenta and another boy the same age standing in the background. \"Hey what is the big idea?\"<br>\r\n\"This twerp bumped into me and made me drop the dango I was carrying.\" The boy said.<br>\r\n\"I said I was sorry and offered to buy him more but he just took hold of me and will not let me go.\" Kenta said.<br>\r\n\"Now there is no reason to fight.\" Haruto said uneasily. <br>\r\n\"If they were just any dango maybe but I will not forgive him for ruining this dango.\" He said.<br>\r\n\"Well I tried the nice way.\" Haruto then charged at him but then he felt something grab onto his leg and then he tripped. <br>\r\n\"Is that what you call a rescue.\" He said.<br>\r\n\"Kenta!\" Haruto said before he then did a handstand and kicked the hand that was holding Kenta and then Kenta jumped to his friends.<br>\r\n\"What a pain you are.\"  He then reached for the sword on his back.<br>\r\n\"Your not going to use that here are you?\" His friend asked.<br>\r\n\"Don't worry I will make sure nothing is left.\" As he was about to draw his sword a rock was thrown at him and hit his hand forcing him to let go. \"Who did that?\"<br>\r\nUp in a nearby tree was Ryousake. \"Ryousake!\" Kei said.<br>\r\n\"Well it is good that you are here.\" Haruto said.<br>\r\nRyousake then jumped down and landed in-front of Haruto. \"With the kids here we need be careful but this two my not so be on guard.\"<br>\r\n\"Well this will make things interesting.\" He said. <br>\r\n\"Mentai, that is enough.\" Said a female voice.<br>\r\nMentai<br>\r\nAge: 13<br>\r\nRank: Genin.<br>\r\nAppearance: short brown hair with turban on the top of his head, teal eyes, Sword on his back leading to the right side,  headband around forehead, loose fitting tan shirt and loose fitiong pants.<br>\r\nVillage: Sand.<br>\r\n\"You too Dakashi.\" The voice said.<br>\r\nDakashi<br>\r\nAge: 13<br>\r\nRank: Genin.<br>\r\nAppearance: wearing a mask with blue markings, a giant object wrapped in bandages, wearing a black cap with the headband sewed into the cloth and loose fitting black outfit. <br>\r\nVillage: Sand.<br>\r\n\"Whoever you are show yourself.\" Ryousake said.<br>\r\nJust then a girl dropped in. \"Hello there.\" She said.<br>\r\n\"How are you?\" Ryousake asked.<br>\r\n\"You dare talk to her is such disrespect. This is Lady Akina, the daughter to the great Fifth Kazekage.\" Mentai said.<br>\r\nAkina of the Desert.<br>\r\nAge: 12.<br>\r\nRank: Genin.<br>\r\nAppearance: short rusty-red hair, green eyes, a giant gourd on  her back, wearing a brown top with fishnet sleeves and light gray pants.<br>\r\nVillage: Sand.<br>\r\n\"Mentai, stop you are embarrassing me?\" She said.\"Now what is the trouble?\"<br>\r\n\"You said you wanted to taste the food hear so I went to get you Dango and that kid pumped into me and made me drop it.\" Mentai said.<br>\r\n\"Mentai...\" Akina then delivered a kick to Mentai's head. \"I could have gotten them myself.\"<br>\r\n\"Same Akina.\" Haruto said to himself. <br>\r\n\"Haruto, is that you?\" Akina asked.<br>\r\n\"Yeah it is.\" He said.<br>\r\n\"Wow to meet so soon that must be fate.\" Akina said. <br>\r\n\"Why are you here?\" Haruto asked.<br>\r\n\"The Chuunin Exams of course.

The Forest of Death.<br>\r\nJust as they all stood at attention they show something running towards them. \"What is that?\" Asked a Sand ninja.

On route Kinmaru smelled something. \"What is that?\" Koga asked. They then stopped and hid themselves to look to see what it was. On the other side of the trees were the Ninja from the Sand village.<br>\r\nSand Team:<br>\r\nThe team from the Sand village had just encountered a team of Rain Ninja. \"Stand back Lady Akina.\" Mentai said. \"Let me and Dakashi take this guys out.\" Mentai then reached for his sword and Dakashi for the bundle on his back when two of the Rain ninja performed hand signs and then Blasted a stream of water that hit the two males.\" This water, what is the meaning of this.\" Dakashi said.<br>\r\nThe third rain ninja said. \"The water drains you of your chakra and there will not stop until you are drained.\" Just then two threads of sand rushed and pierced the two Rain ninja that use the jutsu. \"What the?\" He followed the sand to see that they were coming from the female. \"Why you.\" He started the use the handsigns but then Akina used her sand and encased his hands. \"Please stop don't. The jutsu can be canceled so please don't kill me.\" <br>\r\n\"Sand Bural.\" With that She crushed the Lead rain ninja's hands. <br>\r\n\"Ah!\" He said and then pasted out.'<br>\r\n\"Please don't kill use, We mean no harm we just are trying to get to the finals.\" One of the remaining Rain ninja said.<br>\r\nJust then the sand returned to her and floated there. \"You two alright?\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah.\" Dakashi said. \"Thank you Lady Akina.\" <br>\r\n\"Lady Akina you should have stayed out of this.\" Mentai said.<br>\r\n\"You two are always the same, you never let me have a turn in the fight.\" Akina said. \"I could handle them my self if you had let me and then you two would not have been attacked.<br>\r\n\"But Lady Akina...\" Mentai said but then Dakashi spoke up.<br>\r\n\"Forget it Mentai, Lady Akina will never take your reasoning.\" <br>\r\n\"Whatever.\" Mentai said. \"Let's just get going.\" With that they left.<br>\r\nTeam 8: <br>\r\n\"She is scary.\" Ayashi said.<br>\r\n\"Well her father is the Kazekage.\" Koga said. \"Let's go.\"<br>\r\nWith that they left as well.<br>\r\nTeam 10:<br>\r\nThe two boys were in hiding protecting Inoko's body. Just then she woke up. \"So any luck?\" Shikako asked.<br>\r\n\"Yeah I found a team that has the scroll needed and that had just defended it.\" Inoko said.<br>\r\n\"Right. Let's go.\" With that they went after the target team.<br>\r\nTeam 9:<br>\r\nAt this point in time Saisemaru was rushing to their meeting place. \"Man no luck with finding a good target.\" When he arrived he found that Tai and Akiza were already there. \"Either of you had any luck?\"<br>\r\nAkiza then held up a scroll. \"Tai got this for us.\"<br>\r\n\"Careful, if someone sees it then they will know everything.\" Tai said.<br>\r\n\"Right got that.\" Akiza said. \"Let's hurry.\" With that they headed for the tower.<br>\r\nTeam 7:<br>\r\n\"Good, Akiza's team plus the others are already on route to the tower.\" Haruto said.<br>\r\n\"This means we don't have to wary about them and get our scroll with ease.\" Kei said.<br>\r\n\"Good because there have arrived.\" Ryousake said. <br>\r\nJust then three Ninja jumped towards them. \"We get to kill the traitor's son and get away with it.\" One of them said. They then through kunai and they were all heading towards Ryousake.<br>\r\n\"Ryousake out of the way.\" Haruto then pushed him out of the way. <br>\r\n\"The Hokage's son stepped in the why.\" The lead ninja said.<br>\r\nHaruto then took a stance and then in a matter of moments the kunai were sent back at the attacking ninja and struck them. \"Kei, Tie them up.\" That was the last thing the ninja hear before passing out. <br>\r\nThey woke up and found they were tied up and that they were alive. \"Good you are up.\" Haruto said. \"Sorry about hitting you with your own kunai but it was a way to stop you from killing my friend.\"<br>\r\n\"How dear you call him your friend he is nothing but the son of a traitor.\" The ninja said.<br>\r\n\"No one talks ill of my friend our his family.\" Haruto applied pressure.<br>\r\n\"That is enough.\" Ryousake said. \"Let's go.\" <br>\r\n\"Right.\" Haruto said as he let go and then the three of them left for the tower.<br>\r\nThey made there way to the tower and then entered the tower. They entered a empty room. \"What is that?\" Haruto asked.<br>\r\n\"Words of the late Third Hokage.\" Kei said.<br>\r\n\"If Heaven is what you lack get knowledge and be prepared. If Earth is what you lack seek strength. If you open both scrolls, dangerous paths will turn to safe ones. This is the secret of something. It will lead you on your way.\" Ryousake read.<br>\r\n\"Secret of something?\" Haruto said. \"What is that all about?\"<br>\r\n\"I don't know but maybe if we open both scrolls we will find out.\" Ryousake said.<br>\r\n\"Okay.\" Haruto then took out the Earth Scroll and Kei took out the Heaven Scroll. They then opened them.'<br>\r\n\"Summoning Jutsu.\" Ryousake said as Haruto and Kei through the scrolls away.

There are also three teams of Cloud ninja and two teams each of Rock and Mist ninja. And one team of Rain ninja.\" Haruto said. <br>\r\nBefore them is the Hokage, the proctors for the first two Stages exams, and what looks the sensai for all the teams there. \"First before we start the exams I would wish to Congratulate all who made it this far.\" Naruto said. \"Now that you are here I must say that not all of you will pass.\"<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" Asked one of the rain ninja. <br>\r\n\"That is something for a later time. I will leave you to your proctor.\" Just then Someone dropped to the ground.<br>\r\n\"Hello I am the proctor of the Third exam, Rock Lee.\" <br>\r\nRock Lee<br>\r\nAge: 33<br>\r\nRank: Jonin.<br>\r\nAppearance: Black bowl haircut, dark eyes, Headband around waist, green leopard with orange leg warmers and jonin vest. <br>\r\nVillage: Leaf.<br>\r\n\"The third exam is a series of one on one matches. This means you could even be placed against one of your team. Sadly do to the amount of those who made it we must have preliminary matches to cut the amount of combatants to half.\" Lee said. \"Of course if any of you wish to leave then you may do so now. Are there among you that so wish to exit the exam?\" None of them left. \"Okay then let us start. Let's see how is first to go.\" The randomization started spinning and then two names came up.<br>\r\nRyousake Uchiha v.s Rock Tai.<br>\r\n\"Okay the first two participents have been chosen. The rest of you please head up to the raters to watch.\" Lee said. After the others made there way to the raters Ryousake and Tai faced each other. \"Ready! Begin.\"<br>\r\nThey two then charged at each other. Ryousake throw a punch but Tai dodged it. Ryousake then tried to kick but Tai got out of the way. Ryousake kept attacking but Tai kept dodging. Then as Ryousake throw a punch Tai caught it and was in the process of twisting but Ryousake managed to get away and got some distance. <br>\r\n\"Sorry to say but brother will not win.\" Akiza said from the sidelines. \"Even with the Sharigan, Tai is too fast and has more flexibility to dodge and that gives Tai the edge.\"<br>\r\nThe fight continued.<br>\r\nNow Ryousake was on the defensive. \"Tai is fast. I need to think of how to beat him.\" He said. Ryousake then throw shuriken but Tai then swung his leg and the shuriken were stopped in mid-air then dropped to the ground. \"What?\"<br>\r\n\"Here's my chance.\" Tai then Reached behind him and pulled two dao swords from the scroll and then charged. He swung the swords and then used his legs to kick and then throw the swords to the air to use his fist then caught the swords once more. He repeated the process and switching the order, repeating steps, until he manage to lay a hit with his leg sending Ryousake to his knees. \"Surrender, I don't want to kill a fellow Leaf ninja. Just bow out and try again next time.\"<br>\r\n\"Answer me this, Why do you wish to be chuunin?\" Ryousake asked.<br>\r\n\"Why do I wish to be chuunin? Okay I will tell you. Actually this is just a stepping stone to my real goal.\" Tai said.<br>\r\n\"And that is?\" Ryousake asked.<br>\r\n\"To find my self at least one student to pass the teachings of the Strong Fist art.\" Tai said.<br>\r\n\"But you use thus weapons, how can you be a strict teacher of one style if you don't use that style alone?\" Ryousake said.<br>\r\n\"Why you!\" Tai then got ready to swing but then Ryousake vanished. \"Where did you go?\"<br>\r\n\"Right here.\" Came Ryousake's voice from behind him. As Tai turned around Ryousake punched him in the gut and sent him into the air.<br>\r\n\"How did he get this fast.\" Tai asked himself. <br>\r\nJust then Ryousake appeared behind Tai. \"You forget who I am.\" <br>\r\n\"This position.\" Tai said. <br>\r\nRyousake then turned in mid-air and landed a kick to Tai's gut that sent him straight to the ground. He then landed and stood in a ready stance. Lee then walked over to Tai and gave him a once over. He then stepped back and said. \"The match is over, Ryousake Uchiha is the winner.\"<br>\r\nRyousake dropped his stance and headed to join his team in the raters. As the medical ninja were taking Tai away a thought was going through Lee's head. \"To pass the teachings of Strong Fist to another generation that is a goal worthy of one with a blazing Flame of Youth, sorry my son for your defeat, I hope you this doesn't crush you.\" Lee then said. \"Okay time for the next selection.\"<br>\r\nThe randomization started and gave out the next two names.<br>\r\nShichi v.s. Unima<br>\r\nOnce those names were given two ninja made there why to the floor. Shichi of the Hidden Mist Village, a slinder boy wearing a gray top and dark shorts. On his back he carried a regular sword, and Unima of the Hidden Cloud Village, a slightly muscular teen wearing a white sleeveless shirt and gray pants. On his back he carried a shorter sword then that of Shichi.<br>\r\nThe Two ninja got into position and readied for battle.<br>\r\nMeanwhile in the raters Haruto was congratulating Ryousake on his win. \"That was a great fight.\" Haruto said.<br>\r\n\"No it was too hard, I underestimated him. I though he only used Taijutsu. I messed up.\" Ryousake said.<br>\r\n\"Don't be hard on yourself.\" Kei said.<br>\r\n\"Thanks.\" He said.<br>\r\nThey looked back to the match to see that Shishi was the winner. Then it was time for the next match. The randomization gave two names.<br>\r\nMentai v.s. Ari<br>\r\nMentai then headed for the arena and so did Ari, a Cloud ninja who had a dark top and pants and a white sash. <br>\r\nLee the started the match.

Sister.\" Shikaro said. \"This would be an interesting match.\"<br>\r\n\"Please I can beat her with ease.\" Inoko said as she headed down to the arena. Kei was already on the ground waiting.<br>\r\n\"You know I never really seen the two of them together but, is it me or is there more then a simple family resembles to those two?\" Haruto asked.<br>\r\n\"That is because they are identical twins.\" Konohamaru said.<br>\r\n\"Identical twins? But how is that possible, I mean as long as I have know them Kei has had black hair and Inoko blond hair.\" Haruto said.<br>\r\n\"Ready begin.\" Lee said as the battle was sent to start.<br>\r\nInoko then took a kunai out and charged at Kei. \"She will defend herself out of reflex then all I have to do is disarm her and then use Mind-Transfer Jutsu and force her to surrender.\" Inoko then swung her kunai and Kei defended herself with her sword and then Inoko then disarmed her. \"Now's my chance. Unless.\" Inoko then kicked Kei and it started to melt. \"Gross a Ink Clone. But that means she was aware of my plan. But where is she?\" Inoko then looked around and then found her. \"She is on the ceiling.\" What is she doing up there?\" Inoko's attention was then interrupted when the ink started to move. \"How is that possible?\" Inoko said. The ink then took form of Kei. The Ink Kei then turned her arms into lances and thrust them at Inoko. Inoko dodged them.<br>\r\n\"What is happening? I thought I could win this.\" Inoko said to herself. Inoko then took a Kunai and then slashed the ink Kei but it soon reformed. \"Nothing else seems to work so it is worth a try. Mind-Crush.\" Just as she used the jutsu the ink Kei stopped in it's track and then turned to ink. Then Kei started to fall from the ceiling but she regain herself and landed on the ground. \"What is the meaning of this?\" Inoko asked in a loud tone.<br>\r\n\"I heard that an artist places a piece of themselves in their work.\" Kei said. \"That is where the idea for this jutsu came from.\" <br>\r\n\"You mean you sent you mind into that of the ink clone and then reformed yourself.\" Inoko said. \"But how?\"<br>\r\n\"I still am a Yamanaka and skilled in the Mind-Transfer Jutsu.\" Kei said.<br>\r\n\"Why you little.\"  Inoko said. She then ran at Kei but she countered. \"You are not support to be this strong.\" <br>\r\n\"That is easy, unlike you I train.\" Kei said with a smile.<br>\r\n\"That smile, I hate it the most.\" Inoko said. \"That smile is as fake as you.\" She then punched at Kei but she dodge but was hit in the side of the leg.<br>\r\n\"My leg but how it was a simple tap.\" Kei asked.<br>\r\n\"Surprised right. Well don't be I learned to use Medical Jutsu from mom and I am almost as good with it as with my Mind-Transfer Jutsu.\" Inoko said.<br>\r\n\"Too bad you are too weak to have to use Medical Jutsu against your little sister.\" Kei said.<br>\r\n\"Why you.\" Inoko then readied Mind-Transfer Jutsu put so did Kei.<br>\r\n\"What just happened?\" Asked Haruto.\"<br>\r\n\"I think the two just switch bodies.\" Ryousake said.<br>\r\n\"Let me check.\" Haruto then used the Byakugan. \"Yes they have switched but I wonder how they are going to fight know.\"<br>\r\n\"So I am in Kei's body. She may be in mine but at least I can win this.\" She then took a kunai and was about to stick it into the hand of her sister when she was sent back by a punch. \"What happened.\" She said as she woke up in her own body.<br>\r\n\"I...forced the release with pain.\" Kei said.

Just then Jarie was sent flying out of the dome wall by a gust of wind. He was then caught by shadows.<br>\r\n\"But how?\" Jarie said.<br>\r\n\"I am a Nara so I am smart.

Aito then took his umbrella and throw it at Saisemaru who then knocked it away then he saw himself being surrounded by frogs. He swatted at them but they kept coming. \"When did he summon all this frogs?\" Saisemaru said. Despite his attempts the frogs did not stop until they were covering all but his face.  Then it started to rain. \"What is this, now it is raining. What is going on here?\"<br>\r\nMeanwhile in the raters. <br>\r\n\"What is Saisemaru doing?\" Akiza asked. \"He is just standing there.\"<br>\r\n\"He must be under a genjutsu.\" Her sensei, Hanta Daichome, said. Hanta Daichome is a jonin ninja of the Leaf that has short pale blue hair and dark green eyes that is wearing a large tan robe with a dark blue sash.<br>\r\n\"Then why does he not break it?\" Akiza asked.<br>\r\n\"He may not be aware that he is in one.\" Hanta said.<br>\r\nBack in the arena in reality. \"This fool, he will be an easy win.\" Aito said. \"He has no clan or is the son of a great ninja so all he has is basic skills. Enough to win.\" He then started to approach Saisemaru slowly with a kunai in hand.<br>\r\nIn the genjutsu. Saisemaru is trying to keep himself from the rising water. \"This is mad, there is no way that I can get out of this.\" He started to black out and as he was he saw a image that looked like the moon. Then it hit him. \"This is not real.\" He said as he woke up. He then reached in both the genjutsu and reality for a kunai and throw it to where the moon was. At that the genjutsu faded and then Saisemaru then woke up. <br>\r\n\"What!\" Aito said as he jumped back. \"So you finally snapped to your senses. But that will not matter, You are a simple ninja with no true skills.\" <br>\r\n\"Is that so?\" Saisemaru asked. \"Then I have some news for you, You are wrong.\" Saisemaru then removed his shirt and then everyone was stunned at what they saw. His body was covered by a sealing formula.<br>\r\n\"So you have a seal on you so what?\" Aito said.<br>\r\n\"This seal is not what I was talking about.\" Just then the seals started to fade. \"It is what they were sealing away.\" As the marks disappeared something started to come out of Saisemaru's body.<br>\r\n\"What is that?\" Aito asked. As the last of the seal disappeared the object become clear. It was a sword. \"All this for a sword.\" Aito then used thread to retrieve his umbrella and then pulled a small blade from it and then charged. \"I could care less about that.\" <br>\r\nThe blade then glow light blue and then Saisemaru swung it. A wave of chakra was launched and then slashed Aito across the shoulder and look his arm off. \"This sword is not a sword, it is a Soul Cutter.\" Saisemaru said. Aito then collapsed.<br>\r\n\"Winner Saisemaru Tanchikaki.\" Lee said.

Where is he?\" Just then Ayashi received a kick to the back of the head. \"What the?\" The smoke started to clear and Haruto was there and looked to have kicked Ayashi in the head. \"That attack held no form with the Gentle Fist. What is happening here?\" <br>\r\n\"Haruto actually doesn't use a pure form of Gentle Fist, He uses elements of basic taijutsu and melee fighting.\" Konohamaru said to himself. \"This way he is able to fight with any one.\"<br>\r\n\"Come on I wish to see you fight me with everything.\" Haruto said. \"Stop holding back.\"<br>\r\n\"As you wish my Lord.\" Ayashi then reached into his pouch and then pulled out two gantlets that had stinger like blades on each finger.

Now I have reason for this.\" Haruto then jumped up as Ayashi was about to attack again. <br>\r\n\"Where is he?\" Ayashi asked.

There must be a why to win.\" Just then it came to him. \"I got it.\" Chokai then rolled at Nerin straight on and then Nerin hit him into the air. \"Now, Human Meteor.\"  With that he used the fall to increase the speed of the roll and then using the force destroyed the club as it was being use to guard. <br>\r\n\"Oh no.\" Nerin said.<br>\r\n\"Now to finish this.\" Chokai then continued the roll to get near Nerin. Then once close undid the jutsu and punched Nerin into a wall.<br>\r\n\"Winner Chokai Akimichi.\" Lee said. \"Since there are no more candidates then I rule that Narika of the Cloud Village passes to the final round and conclude the Third exam's preliminaries matches.

You not upset about that are you?\" Naruto asked.<br>\r\n\"A little but I understand.\" Haruto said. \"So where do I start?\"<br>\r\n\"First let's see how much work we have to do?\" Gamakichi said.<br>\r\n\"Okay.\" Haruto then took a deep breath and then went through the hand signs and then attempted the summoning jutsu. From the smoke appeared a small red toad with black markings wearing a dark blue vest.<br>\r\n\"He was able to summon a small toad his first go.\" Naruto said to himself. <br>\r\n\"Hey there?\" Haruto said to the toad. \"What is your name?\"<br>\r\n\"Gamaten.\" It said.<br>\r\n\"Gamaten, that is a good name.\" Haruto then turned around and asked. \"Now what?\"<br>\r\n\"Now you keep it up to see if you can summon something bigger.\" Gamakichi said.<br>\r\n\"Right.\" Haruto then got to work.<br>\r\n\"I will leave him to you two.\" With that Naruto left.<br>\r\nMeanwhile elsewhere Ryousake was starting to train on his own when he head something. \"Who is there?\" Ryousake then looked to see a man with gray hair with a mask over the lower half of his face and a headband over his left eye reading a book laying on a tree branch. \"I ask again, who are you?\"<br>\r\n\"My name is Kakashi Hatake and I was asked to train you since your father is on a mission that required him to be out of the village.\" <br>\r\n\"You know my father?\" Ryousake asked. <br>\r\n\"And you mother.\" He said as he closed his book and jumped down. <br>\r\nRyousake now recognized him. \"You are there sensei, that means you also trained Lord Naruto.\" Ryousake said. \"Well if you are going to train me then please let's get to it.\"<br>\r\n\"Very well.\" Kakashi said as he walked up to him. \"Then let's get to it.\"<br>\r\nWith that they started.<br>\r\nTime skip two weeks: <br>\r\nHaruto had already improved with the use of Summoning Jutsu so now he is sparring against Gamatatsu and Gamakichi. After the first few times that Haruto had summoned out Gamaten he had decided to stay and watch Haruto train. \"That is it Haruto you can do it.\" He said simulating a crowd of fans cheering.<br>\r\nAfter a while they decided to call it a day and Haruto took a seat. \"So Haruto, how do you fell?\" <br>\r\n\"Well I think I have gotten better but I still fell that there is something missing.\" Haruto said. \"I don't know what do you think?\"<br>\r\n\"Sorry Haruto but we have no idea what that thing is.\" Gamakichi said.<br>\r\nHaruto then got up and started off. \"I am going for a walk.\" Haruto then started off and then Gamaten jumped onto his head.<br>\r\n\"I'll go with you buddy.\" He said.<br>\r\n\"Fine but hid yourself and keep your voice low. Don't want people to know that I can do the summoning jutsu just yet.\" Haruto said.<br>\r\n\"I got it.\" Gamaten said as he then hid in Haruto's jacket. And with that they were off.<br>\r\nOnce in the village Haruto was looking around for inspiration. While he was walking he came across Ayashi. \"Lord Haruto.\" He said and then looked away. \"Please I am sorry for what I did during our match.\"<br>\r\n\"That is okay. And please just call me Haruto, I may respect the Hyuuga's but I am not the heir.\" Haruto said.<br>\r\n\"But Lord Haruto, you are son to Lady Hinata as such you as well as your siblings are just as much members of the Hyuuga clan as you are members of the Uzumaki Clan.\" Ayashi said.<br>\r\n\"Whatever.\" Haruto said as he started off. Soon as he was walking off he came across Rock Tai. He was training by himself. \"Tai? What are you doing?\"<br>\r\n\"Since I last I have to train to get better.\" Tai said.<br>\r\n\"Shouldn't you be training with Saisemaru? I mean you are on the same team and since you are currently not getting ready for the tournament shouldn't you help him train?\" Haruto asked.<br>\r\n\"I have offered but he said that this is something he has to do on his own.\" Tai said. \"But why are you not training?\" <br>\r\n\"Just taking a break, have to go. But first I have something to ask. How is Akiza?\" Haruto asked.<br>\r\n\"She is fine, luckily the damage was not. She is however hurting that she lost and could not get to the finals.\" Tai said.<br>\r\n\"Thanks.\" Haruto said. \"Where is she?\" <br>\r\n\"The damage was enough that she is at home.\" Tai said.<br>\r\n\"Thanks again.\" Haruto said as he left.<br>\r\nHaruto then found his way to the Uchiha residence and show Akiza sitting outside. He then came up to the house. \"Who's there?\"<br>\r\n\"It's me Haruto.\" He then stepped out to show himself.<br>\r\n\"Why are you here?\" She asked. <br>\r\n\"I was worried about you.\" Haruto said. \"I mean you are a good friend to me.\"<br>\r\n\"Thanks for your concern.\" Akiza said. <br>\r\n\"Well I better get going.\" Haruto said. With that he left.<br>\r\n\"You like her right?\" Gamaten asked.<br>\r\n\"Yeah I do. But I don't know how to say it when I am around her.\" Haruto said. \"Well I need to think of inspiration.\"  He then sat down and looked up into the sky. Then it hit him. \"I think I got it. But I will need help.\" He then left to get that help.<br>\r\nTime skip one month:<br>\r\n\"Today is the day.\" Haruto said as he got up from his bed and got ready to leave for the tournament.</span></div></div>",

As he looked Akina noticed and waved at his which caused him to shudder. As everyone was arriving Haruto then looked around. He looked to the stands and saw Akiza. \"Good she looks better.\" He then turned his attention towards the Hokage's box and saw his father plus the other Kages from the main villages, each having two shinobi bodyguards. Naruto then stood up and started to speak. <br>\r\n\"Welcome to all guests and to our brave ninja that have made it her today. Today we are going to find out if any among this nineteen have what is required to be called Chuunin.\" He then moment Lee and then he turned to the candidates. <br>\r\n\"Okay everyone let's see you all show all your skill. The rules are the same as the Preliminaries. Now time to start the first match, Haruto Uzumaki v.s. Narika. This two stay here and the rest of you go up and wait in the competitor's box. They did that. \"Haruto Uzumaki v.s. Narika. Let the first match begin.\" With that said Lee jumped back. <br>\r\n\"Narika lucked out and had no opponent. I have no idea as to how he fights.\" Haruto said to himself as he looked at Narika. He was a tall, muscular man with dark skin and mid-length white hair in braids. He was wearing black pants with white and red leg warmers and on his right arm a white and red fingerless glove. Along the small of his back was a sword with a white hilt in a matching hilt that was on his left side. \"Well, THere is one way to find out.\" With that Haruto reached and throw shuriken towards Narika. Narika then swung his left arm and went the shuriken hit they were then cut in half. It was then that he saw way.<br>\r\n\"Is that what I think it is?\" Naruto asked.<br>\r\n\"Yes.\" The Raikage, A stated. \"The Cloud village's Lighting Armor. Sorry but your son will not last long.\"<br>\r\n\"You think so.\" Naruto said.<br>\r\nIn the Competitor's Box. \"So that is the Lighting Armor of the Raikage.\" Ryousake said. \"I can see know why father had trouble with it.\"<br>\r\n\"That little trick is not the only thing that Narika is able to us of Lord Raikage.\" Ki stated to himself.<br>\r\nBack in the arena.<br>\r\nNarika then charged at Haruto at high speed. \"He is fast.\" Haruto said as he received  a punch that sent him flying back. Haruto then skid on the ground and stopped just short of the wall.<br>\r\n\"You should be lucky that I canceled the lighting armor before punching. If not you would have a hole through your chest.\" Narika said. \"But with the force and speed alone you should be...\" Just as Narika was talking Haruto got up. \"...out of commission. So I guess the rumors the Hyuga are strong.\"<br>\r\n\"What was that?\" Haruto said. \"You said that you could have killed me? Well, then I guess I will have to return the favor.\" <br>\r\n\"Please...\" Narika then charged again saying. \"I am too strong for you to over power and too fast for you to dodge, how do you expect to stop me?\" Just then Haruto disappeared and Narika's fist crashed into the wall. \"What the...?\"<br>\r\n\"Having trouble?\" Haruto said as he appeared standing facing Narika's side.<br>\r\n\"I am not the type to be angered easily so making me anger will not work.\" Narika said as he pulled his hand from the wall. He then swung at Haruto but Narika missed and Haruto was now behind him. \"Nice trick.\" He then started to attack but Haruto managed to disappear and then reappear elsewhere. Narika then draw his sword and swung it back hand at Haruto who disappeared and then reappeared. Narika then swung is sword again and Haruto disappeared but as he reappeared Narika then delivered a punch to Haruto's side. At this Haruto disappeared into smoke. \"Shadow Clone. But when?\" Just then Haruto charged up from underground and delivered an uppercut to Nariku's jaw sending him back. Nariku then got back up. \"So What was that about?\"<br>\r\n\"You now as a kid my dad would tell be stories from his younger days. He once told be he used this same technique on Neji Hyuga and won the match. I wished to see if I could do the same. Guess I got the timing off.\" Haruto said.<br>\r\n\"That is an understatement.\" Nariku said as he performed a leg sweep but Haruto jumped up and dodged it. Nariku then head-butt Haruto and he fell back and rolled to his feet. \"What is with this kid?\" He said to himself. \"My first blow alone should have beat him. I hate to say it but I have to use this.\" Nariku then put his sword away and then extended his arm and then it lit up with Lighting chakra.<br>\r\n\"That technique!\" Haruto said before his was struck but it.<br>\r\n\"Larit.\" Nariku's attack hit and it sent Haruto back. \"I did not mean to go this far but you left me no choose.\" <br>\r\n\"Wow you seem really are strong, shame you did not fight before now.\" Hearing this shocked Nariku as it was Haruto speaking.<br>\r\n\"How is it that you are still breathing?\" Nariku asked.<br>\r\n\"That is my secret.\" Haruto said. Haruto then got up and then charged in and then performed attack after attack.<br>\r\n\"He is not human.\" Nariku said to himself as he was dodging that attacks. Could he be...\" Just then Haruto thrust a palm into Nariku's gut and then Nariku was sent flying into the wall spinning. <br>\r\nLee then made is way to Nariku then back to Haruto. \"Winner Haruto Uzumaki.\" <br>\r\n\"No surprise there, he is the son of the Sixth.\" Stated a Leaf ninja from the stands to his friend. <br>\r\n\"Right now let's see the next match.\" Said the friend.<br>\r\nHaruto made his to the  Competitor's Box. He then stopped next to Ryousake. \"That was a big risk fighting him like that.\" He said to Haruto.<br>\r\n\"It did the job.\" Haruto replied.<br>\r\n\"Will Saisemaru Tanchikaki and Mentai please come to the field.\" Lee asked. At that the two made there way to the arena floor. Saisemaru was dressed differently. He now wore a shirt with longer sleeves and pants that legs went down and stop just above the ankle, both the same color as before. He also now sported a white sash and his sword, now in a dark brown sheath hung to his left side. The two swordsmen faced each other. \"Mentai, I will not let myself loss.\" Saisemaru said.<br>\r\n\"You are delusional if you think you can beat me. I am the best swordsmen in the Sand Village. You just started to us that sword of yours.\" Mentai said. With that both took hold of the hilt of there respective swords and got into a stance. <br>\r\n\"Saisemaru Tanchikaki v.s. Mentai, ready begin.\" Lee said before getting out of the way.<br>\r\nAt that Saisemaru draw is sword and charged in hand slashed but Mentai used his free hand and then held a half tiger sign and then jumped back. Saisemaru then grabbed his sword with both hands and then charged in and slashed at Mentai who dodged it. \"I got him.\" He then turned and then swung his blade and sent a blade of chakra towards Mentai.<br>\r\nMentai then draw his sword and then a blade of wind shot out and collide with Saisemaru's attack canceling both of the attacks out. Then  Mentai disappeared from sight. \"This is the end.\" Mentai said as he was about to strike but then Saisemaru blocked the attack with his sword and then a wind blade was formed and then slashed down to the ground. \"What but how?\" Mentai asked.<br>\r\n\"I have been training with swords since then moment I could pick one up, I merely was infusing it with my chakra to make this blade my own.\" Saisemaru said. He then pushed off and then it was seen that Mentai was using a tanto. \"That is how I know that your strength comes from not your sword play but your drawing speed combined with the length of the sheath and your use of wind chakra.\" <br>\r\nJust then Mentai charged in and then swung his blade and Saisemaru blocked. \"You really think that?\" He then continued to attack, causing Saisemaru to move back to keep on the defensive. Then at one point he struck and sent Saisemaru back, forcing him to take a knee and start to pant. \"Just because you understand how I fight does not mean you can stop me.\" <br>\r\n\"The saw can be said both way.\" Saisemaru then got up and held his blade in-front of him and then he started to glow with chakra and so did his sword. \"Now Break through the Limits, Bujuukibaken.\" With that Saisemaru's sword changed. The blade now looked like a giant fang.<br>\r\n\"What did you do?\" Mentai asked.<br>\r\n\"I merely advanced to the next level.\" Saisemaru said.<br>\r\n\"Why you.\" Mentai then got ready to attack but then Saisemaru then swung his sword and then the blue wave of chakra shot out and sent Mentai back.<br>\r\n\"Winner Saisemaru Tanchikaki.\" Lee stated.<br>\r\nSaisemaru then started to sheath his sword and as he did the blade turned back to its former form. He then made is way back to the Competitor's Box. As Mentai was being carried away by the medics he looked but to the Competitor's Box and said to himself. \"Lady Akina I failed you.\" He then passed out. </span></div></div>",

Dakashi ready begin.\" And with that the match began.<br>\r\n\"He can't mark me if I am on the move.\" Chokai said to himself as he use Expansion Jutsu and then rolled in a ball. \"Human Boulder.\" He then charged at Dakashi, rolling at high speed. Dakashi dodged but Chokai then turned and came back for another pass. Dakashi dodged again and again. <br>\r\n\"This is bad the more he rotates the faster he is...\" Dakashi then took several senbons and throw them at Chokai but they were of no use. \"...and while rotating like that my needles just bounce off.\" Then out of the corner of his eye he saw the wall. He then bounced off the wall to dodge. \"He will either go crashing into the wall or will stop his spinning so not to crash. Either way he will be stopped.\" Just then when Chokai hit the wall he just bounced off and then turned and started to chase Dakashi down. \"What is with him?\" Well, if that won't stop him then I guess I have to go with that.\" Dakashi then turned around as Chokai was heading straight for him.<br>\r\n\"What is he thinking, there is no way that he can stop that with brute force.\" Chokai said to himself as he continued to roll. As Chokai got close Dakashi the went to action. He then started to move his hands and then two claw like arms came out of the bundle on his back and then clamped onto Chokai, stopping him from spinning and holding him in the air. \"Hey what is going on here? Let me go?\" Chokai said.<br>\r\n\"Sorry but this is the only way that I could stop you.\" Dakashi said. \"Will you give the match up?\" He asked.<br>\r\n\"No, I will not.\" Chokai said.<br>\r\n\"Very well.\" With that Dakashi gestured with his hands and then the claw arms then lifted Chokai up and then dropped with him in their grip to the ground. <br>\r\nWhen the dust cleared Chokai laid there out cold. \"Winner Dakashi.\" Lee said.<br>\r\nWith that the claw arms then retracted into the bundle and then Dakashi retightened the bandages of the bundle and then headed to the Competitor's Box. Once in the box Dakashi went and sat next to Akina and on his way there he pasted by Haruto and even through the mask he could feel a glare from Dakashi.\"Would Koga Inuzuka and Shichi please come down for your match.\" Lee asked. Koga came down with Kinmaru in tow and Shichi came down and faced the Dog user and his wolf pup.\"Koga Inuzuka v.s. Shichi, Ready begin.\" Lee said and the match began. <br>\r\nShichi took out a bottle of water, opened it and throw it in the air, and then performed hand-signs. \"Water Clone Jutsu.\" With that the water then took the form of him and then fan towards Koga and using its sword swiped at Koga, separating him and Kinmaru. \"Without their hound a Dog user is nearly useless.\" He then ran and took hold of Kinmaru by the fur of his neck.<br>\r\n\"Kinmaru!\" Koga said as he tried to save him but the water clone was in his way. <br>\r\n\"Say your good bye's to this beast.\" With that he throw Kinmaru into the air and then draw his sword ready to slash him. <br>\r\n\"Kinmaru!\" Koga said as he then thrust his arm through the clone and then rushed and got hold of Kinmaru and the two then jumped off Shichi and then while in mid air. \"Now Piercing Fang.\" With that the two of them then spun around and charged at Shichi but he dodged the worse of the attacks. <br>\r\n\"Lucky dogs.\" Shichi said. He then charged in to cut Kinmaru but Koga got in the way but his right arm was cut.<br>\r\n\"Well, at least with only one arm you can't beat me.\" Shichi said as he raised his sword to make the final strike but then Kinmaru bite Shichi allowing Koga to get way. \"Stinking beast.\" He then tossed Kinmaru how managed to land next to Koga. \"I will kill you both.\"<br>\r\n\"I don't think so.\" With that Kinmaru climbed onto Koga's arm and then transformed in a poof of smoke. Koga then punched with his right arm and then a drill-like force of wind struck Shichi and sent him backwards and then knocked out. When this cleared on his right arm was a gantlet that looked like a full grown wolves' head with gold fur. It poof away and in its place was Kinmaru.<br>\r\n\"Winner Koga Inuzuka.\" Lee said. The medical team arrived and then examined Koga and then after bandaging him up he and Kinmaru headed for the Competitor's Box. \"Now will Enita and Daino please come down to the arena.\" Lee said. The two came down to the arena. Enita is a big guy with long pale yellow hair braided and leading down to the small of his back. He wore white pants and had a light gray loose jacket that was opened that reveal his build. Daino what an average size man with short dark hair wearing a red shirt and dark gray pants.<br>\r\n\"Ready begin.\" Lee said and the two started to fight. The fight concluded with Daino the winner.\"Winner Daino.\" Lee said. And then the next match was to begin.  \"Ki v.s. Lubiwa, ready begin.\" The two engaged in battle but soon a winner was declared. \"Winner Lubiwa.\" Lee then called the next fighters. \"Would Naare and Sechida Aburame came down please.\" Sechida came down and so did Naare. \"Naare v.s. Sechida Aburame. Ready begin.\"  Lee said and the fight began.<br>\r\nSechida then unleashed a swarm of her beetles and command them to attack. Naare then took his sword and swung it and then the beetles froze and dropped to the ground. \"What?\"<br>\r\nNaare then charged in and then made contact with Sechida and struck hard sending her back. He then took off his shirt and throw it aside. He then slashed at her but she dodged. He attacked again but She dodged again. He got her to a wall but then he felt weak. He then noticed that there were beetles on him and there were draining him of his chakra. He then passed out. <br>\r\n\"Winner Sechida Aburame.\" Lee said as the medical team took Naara way. \"Now time for the next match. Would Ryousake Uchiha and Oneka please came down here.\" With that the two made there way to the arena. Oneka is average hight with short black hair wearing a white and red shirt. \"Ryousake Uchiha v.s. Oneka, ready begin.\" Lee said as he got out of the way.<br>\r\nOneka then charged in and started to punch at Ryousake but he blocked the attacks. \"Now I got you.\" Oneka said.<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" Ryousake asked.<br>\r\n\"Look for yourself.\" Oneka said as Ryousake looked at his arms and saw two seals. \"One seals Fire Chakra, the other lighting chakra, now you can't use elemental chakra on me.\" Oneka said. He then summoned metal gantlets on to his hands and started to punch at Ryousake again. A hit was made and Ryousake was sent back and stopped on a knee.<br>\r\n\"Smart, metal conducts electricity and heat so those gantlets make you a target for such things, also since my father is who he is and I his son I could be like him. Good, you made the right choose, as far as that.\" <br>\r\n\"Don't even think about it, I am also skilled at genjutsu dispersal so that will not work on me.\" Oneka then charged in to finish Ryousake off.<br>\r\nJust as his punch was made it was stopped. Ryousake caught it. \"You focused on my Uchiha skills, even the skills that my father learned form his sensei, but you have forgotten one interesting thing about people.\"<br>\r\n\"What would that be?\" Oneka asked.<br>\r\n\"That each person is the produce of two individuals then makes one individual of his or her own.\" With that Ryousake got up and tighten his grip. \"You forgot about skills I learned from my mother.\"<br>\r\n\"How is your mother?\" Oneka said as he was in pain.<br>\r\n\"Sakura Haruno.\" With that Ryousake placed his foot to one of Oneka's legs and then push down on the leg as he pulled his arm out of its socket.<br>\r\n\"AwWwWW.\" Oneka said as Ryousake did that. Ryousake let go of Oneka's arm and got off his leg and Oneka cried in pain. Ryousake then placed a hand on the shoulder of Oneka and he stopped screaming. <br>\r\n\"I relieved the pain so you can think clearly. Give up, if not and the injuries I inflicted will get worse. You have one minute before I let the pain continue. So choose.\"<br>\r\n\"I give up.\" Oneka said.<br>\r\n\"Winner Ryousake Uchiha.\" Lee said.<br>\r\n\"Okay, I will be letting go.\" As soon as he let go the pain returned and the medical squad arrived and took Oneka away. Ryousake then made his way back to the Competitor's Box.<br>\r\n\"Yifawa and Akina of the Desert please come down to the field.\" The two did that. \"Yifawa v.s. Akina of the Desert, Ready begin.\"<br>\r\nWith that the match began. Yifawa then throw Kunai with explosive tags attached. Akina then dodged and used her sand to cancel the blasts. Just then Yifawa ran towards Akina with a kunai in hand and then slashed at Akina, striking her face. Akiza then used sand to attack Yifawa but he got way. Akiza then took her and and touched where she was hit and then looked to see that she was bleeding. \"Ow, that hurt.\" Akiza said. She then sent her sand after Yifawa who kept moving but Akiza got Yifawa by the leg and then tossed him to the ground. She then pinned him to the ground with the sand and used her sand to fly over him. \"Any final words. She asked as she formed a spear from the sand and throw it.<br>\r\n\"I give up.\" Yifawa said. He then closed his eyes.<br>\r\n\"Ow man.\" She then gestured her fingers and then the sand spear landed in the ground inches from Yifawa's head.<br>\r\n\"Winner Akina of the Desert.\" Lee said. With that She made her way back to the Competitor's Box. Once there Dakashi walked but to her. \"Are you okay Akina?\" <br>\r\n\"Yeah, I'm fine.\" She said.<br>\r\n\"You are still bleeding.\" Dakashi then took out a medical kit. He then applied a healing cream and then applied a bandage. \"There all better.\" <br>\r\n\"Thanks but I did not need you to do this.\" Akina said.<br>\r\n\"It is may honor Akina.\" Dakashi said.</span></div></div>",

Saisemaru Tanchikaki, ready begin.\" With that Lee jumped out of the way as the two charged at each other.<br>\r\nSaisemaru slashed but Haruto dodged and then struck Saisemaru's wrist but he then kicked Haruto back and then slashed at him again but then Haruto disappeared in a poof of smoke. \"Shadow Clone.\" Saisemaru then closed his eyes and then blocked incoming shuriken. \"There you are.\" Saisemaru then took a kunai and throw it but another kunai was thrown and the two knives deflected each other. Haruto then started towards Saisemaru and was ready to fight with him.<br>\r\nSaisemaru then slashed but Haruto dodged and then delivered a kick to the back of Saisemaru's head. He then jumped to get some distance. Saisemaru then slashed and released the wave of chakra but Haruto then took a kunai and then throw it and then the chakra was cut in half. \"What, but how?\" Saisemaru then noticed the kunai was still heading towards him and he partly got out of the way. The kunai cut his shoulder. \"What is the meaning of this?\"<br>\r\n\"I have started wind chakra training already.\" Haruto said. \"I have yet to master it but it is enough.\" <br>\r\n\"Well, luckily I know that I can't beat you with only one good arm.

Just then Dakashi delivered a kick to one of the Koga's face and sent him back. He then turned into Kinmaru. \"Kinmaru! How did you know?\"<br>\r\n\"I have my ways.\" Dakashi said.<br>\r\n\"Why you.\" Koga said as he ran towards Dakashi but then Dakashi gestured with his fingers and then one of the clawed hands shot from the bundle and then held Koga down. \"Go on do your worse.\" Koga said.<br>\r\n\"Very well.\" Dakashi then used the Puppet master Jutsu on Kinmaru.<br>\r\n\"What are you going to do?\" Koga asked.<br>\r\n\"I don't know. But I would be inclined to let him go if you surrender.\"<br>\r\n\"Find I give up.\" With that Dakashi released both master and beast.<br>\r\n\"Winner Dakashi.\" Lee said. Dakashi then headed back to the Competitor's Box. Lee then start the next match. \"Daino v.s. Lubiwa, ready begin.\" With that the match went on but it then ended in a draw. \"Time for the next match, Sechida Aburame v.s. Ryousake Uchiha.\" The two then came down to the arena. \"Ready begin.\" <br>\r\nSechida then sent her insects at Ryousake but he disappeared and reappeared behind her. \"I am truly sorry.\" With that he delivered a chop to the back of her neck.<br>\r\n\"Winner Ryousake Uchiha.\" Lee said.\"Now it is time for the next match\"<br>\r\nAkina and Shikaro then came down to the arena.<br>\r\n\"Akina of the Desert v.s.  Shikaro Nara, ready begin.\" As soon as Lee said that the entire area was covered by sand and only the most skilled ninja could see what was going on. The sand soon faded and only Akina was still standing. \"Winner Akina of the Desert.\" <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The match will commence in one hour.\" <br>\r\nAt this point Dakashi then approached Haruto and Ryousake. \"Dakashi, what do you want?\" Haruto asked.<br>\r\n\"I wish to speak to you in private. Problem with that?\" Dakashi asked.<br>\r\n\"No not at all.\" Haruto said. <br>\r\n\"Good.\" With that the two headed for the staircase but Dakashi then stopped and turned to Ryousake. \"First I need to say something to you Ryousake Uchiha. I understand that you must do what you must to try and win and I respect that but hear this. You go even one millimeter to far in you match with Akina and I will tear you to shreds.\" With that said he then turned back and he and Haruto headed down to a landing. <br>\r\n\"Okay what is it that you need to say?\" Haruto asked.<br>\r\n\"I ask that you give up the fight.\" Dakashi said.<br>\r\n\"Why?\" Asked Haruto. \"You are not that strong that you can beat me in the match.\"<br>\r\n\"That is not why.\" Dakashi said.<br>\r\n\"Then why?\" Haruto asked.<br>\r\n\"Akina... Akina does not wish you hurt, unless you give up before the match then that would not be possible.\" Dakashi said.<br>\r\n\"You like her don't you?\" Haruto asked.<br>\r\n\"What?\" <br>\r\n\"I could tell by how you threaten my teammate, you don't wish to make her unhappy. Sorry but I will fight with all my heart and skill because I have a dream to reach.\" Haruto said. \"I will not give up until I reach that dream.\"<br>\r\n\"Then I have only one option.\" Dakashi said. \"In that arena I will fight you with all my heart and skill as well.\" With that Haruto headed  back up. Dakashi soon came across a Mentai. \"Good to see your are fine.\" <br>\r\n\"Drop the act, Lady Akina is not here so you can drop the act.\" Mentai said.<br>\r\n\"What act?\" Asked Dakashi.<br>\r\n\"Have you forgotten that we must keep Lady Akina in check. That mean making her happy that is why you must forfeit this match.\" Mentai said.<br>\r\nHe then turned around but then Dakashi said. \"No, I am doing things my way.\"<br>\r\n\"Then I will have to stop you.\" Just as Mentai reached for his sword chains wrapped him up. \"What? When did you?\"<br>\r\n\"I haven't the time for this.\" Dakashi said as the chains loosened and then returned to his bundle and he walked off.<br>\r\nMeanwhile with Haruto. \"So what did he want?\" Ryousake asked.<br>\r\n\"Nothing just a chat between two men.\" Haruto said. He then saw Akina. \"Now I need to have a chat with a fellow Kage offspring.\" With that Haruto walked up to Akina. \"Akina, we need to talk.\"<br>\r\n\"Oh Haruto I knew that you would accept me in time.\" She said.<br>\r\n\"That is it I don't accept your marriage proposal.\" Haruto said. \"I have told you that already.\"<br>\r\n\"But we are so alike.\" She said.<br>\r\n\"That is exactly why it will never work, I need someone how completes me.\" Haruto said.\"I am sorry but I need to say this once and for all.\"<br>\r\n\"Why tell me know?\" Akina said.<br>\r\n\"Two reasons, one is I may not get the chance to.\" Haruto said. Just then there was a call to indicate the semi-final were to start. \"Well, looks like the fights are about to start up again.\" Haruto started to leave and on the way Akina asked. \"Wait, what is the other reason?\"<br>\r\n\"I have someone already and I will have to deal with her family at one point.\" Haruto said with a smile.<br>\r\n\"Now will Haruto Uzumaki and Dakashi please came down to the arena?\" Lee asked. With that Haruto and Dakashi entered the arena. \"Okay, Haruto Uzumaki v.s. Dakashi, Ready?\" Lee said as he looked to both the competitors. \"Begin.\" <br>\r\nHaruto ran towards Dakashi at high speed. Dakashi then blocked and the two engaged in a taijutsu battle. \"What is he thinking he is not that skilled in taijutsu.\" Akina said from the Competitor's Box.<br>\r\n\"He must be up to something.\" Haruto said to himself. \"He then kicked Dakashi back and it sent him into the air. Just then chains launched towards Haruto but he got out of the way. Dakashi was then pulled back to the ground and then the chains retreated back to his bundle. \"What was that all about?\" Haruto asked.<br>\r\n\"I needed to see if you were serious about being fighting with all your skill. Now I know that you were telling the truth.\" Dakashi then performed a series on hand signs and then he throw the bundle into the air. Then the bundle opened and then our came his puppet. The clawed-hands were seen but also metal backs were around its body, Legs appeared to be thick, its face looked almost human. Its body seemed to be covered by a gray hooded cloak. \"Now I will to with my friend Specter.\" Dakashi said.<br>\r\n\"In that case...: Haruto then started towards Specter. <br>\r\n\"I got what you are trying.\" Dakashi said as he gestured  with his fingers and hands.  At that the puppet then released a stream of gas.<br>\r\n\"No.\" Haruto said as he got caught in the gas. \"Can't breath the gas in, it may be poison.\" Dakashi then launched a wave of senbons from Specter. \"I have to dodge them.\" Haruto then tried to dodge the needles as they flew. <br>\r\n\"Now.\" Dakashi said as he did another gesture and then an arm of Specter extended and took hold of Haruto. As soon as Haruto looked to be running out of air he let go and out of reflex Haruto breathed in the gas. <br>\r\n\"Oh no.\" He said as he tried to close his mouth.<br>\r\n\"Too late.\" Dakashi then launched another wave of sendons and Haruto dodged them. Dakashi then had Specter extend it's arms and punched at Haruto but he dodged it. He then gestured his hands and fingers and then one of Specter's legs bent and then the knee opened up to reveal a rapid fire mechanism. From it launched Kunai with explosive tags attached. Haruto then knocked them away but then stopped and started to pant. <br>\r\n\"I was right, that gas was poison.\" Haruto said. \"The more I move the more the poison will spread.\"<br>\r\n\"You are wrong.\" Dakashi said. \"It is not the gas that was poisoned, It is the claws.\" <br>\r\n\"But when?\" Then he remembered. \"When you grabbed my throat.\"<br>\r\n\"Give up, there is no way that you can beat me and get the poison removed and be able to fight in the next round so just give up, so it will take another six months for you to try for it again.\"<br>\r\n\"I will not give up without a fight.\" Haruto said. He then activated the Byakugan. \"There it is.\" He then took a kunai and stopped himself in the shoulder.\"<br>\r\n\"What! Are you crazy? You could bleed out and go into shock.\" Dakashi said.<br>\r\n\"I don't care, I will not give up.\"  He then charged in. \"Shadow Clone Jutsu.\" With that he created ten clones. \"Now!\" With that he and the clones all scattered and moved around and started to throw kunai.<br>\r\n\"You think this will help you?\" Dakashi then had Specter use a chakra shield. \"Now where is he? There.\" He then hand is puppet launch chains and then hooked Haruto's arms and legs. \"Since you will not give in, die.\" With that the chains retracted and the chest of Specter opened up and blade moved out and Haruto was down in closer. <br>\r\n\"I will not let this happen.\" Haruto then used his chakra to break the chains and then throw a kunai with an explosion tag and then jumped into the air as the explosive went off, destroying the puppet. \"There it is over.\" Just then Dakashi then charged in with a kunai in hand. \"What the?\"<br>\r\n\"You underestimate me, I may have lost Specter but, I can still fight.\" Dakashi then slashed at Haruto and he slashed back. Haruto slashed him but he did not stop attacking. <br>\r\n\"How is it that you did not fell that?\" Haruto asked. Dakashi then attacked again and Haruto dodged and attacked again but still nothing. They continued to fight but then Haruto managed a hit to Dakashi's face and knocked off his mask. Haruto was shocked at the sight he saw. \"Your face.\" Dakashi's face was covered bay scars and burns. \"What happened?\"<br>\r\n\"Not everyone had the privileged life of a prince.\" Dakashi said. \"My father treated me like a nuisance. He would do terrible things to me.\" He then picked his mask up and put it on. \"My father was the worse of people, lucky for me I managed to get away from him but I digress.\" <br>\r\n\"So why do you wish to fight so hard.\" Haruto asked.<br>\r\n\"Although I escaped him his words still stick to me and I feel I must prove him wrong. That is why I must fight.\" Dakashi then charged in but when he hit Haruto disappeared. \"Where are you?\"<br>\r\n\"Right here.\" Haruto said as he stood behind Dakashi. \"Eight Trigram...two palm...four palm....eight palm...sixteen palm...thirty two palm...sixty four palm.\" With each attach he hit with twice as many hits. \"Now Final Palm.\" With that Haruto thrust his palm and sent Dakashi onto his back. <br>\r\n\"Winner Haruto Uzumaki.\" Lee said.<br>\r\nHaruto then moved over to Dakashi and spoke up. \"Losing is not the end, you can learn from one lose more then twenty victories.\" Haruto said.<br>\r\n\"In our life as shinobi that is very difficult a thing but it is something to think about.\" Dakashi said. \"Haruto reach into my pouch, there is the antidote to the poison I used.\" Haruto did as he was asked and took a container. \"Drink it and you will get better.\" With that Haruto drank the contains.<br>\r\n\"I actually fell better.\" Haruto said as he placed the container into Dakashi's hand as he is taken off the field.</span></div></div>",

Ryousake throw shuriken but Akina's sand knocked them away and then she launched sand streams towards him but he then went through hand-signs. \"Fire Style: Phoenix Flower Jutsu.\" With that Ryousake launch several fireballs that intercept the sand streams. He then got in close and the two engaged in taijutsu. \"You seem to be good at close range as well as in a distance.\" Ryousake said.<br>\r\n\"The same seems true for you.\" Akina stated. \"But that is not all that I can do.\" With that sand stared to engulf Ryousake. \"Sorry but you lose.\" Just then the sand around Ryousake cracked and then he broke out. \"But how?\"<br>\r\n\"This is how.\" Ryousake said as he looked up to reveal that his eyes now showed the Sharingan. He then performed hand-signs. His hand then started to glow and was releasing lighting bolts. \"Chidori.\" He then charged in towards Akina.\"<br>\r\n\"What is he thinking using an assassination technique on her?\" Haruto said.<br>\r\nAkina then created a barrier of sand. The lighting technique went through and hit her. She released the barrier and was on her knees before falling to the ground. Lee walked over to examine Akina. \"Amazing, there is barely any damage.\" Lee said to himself. \"Winner Ryousake Uchiha.\" <br>\r\nRyousake went up to Akina and then check on her. \"You okay?\" <br>\r\n\"Yeah.\" Akina said as she open her eyes and then help her chest in pain. <br>\r\n\"Just rest.\" He said.

Haruto Uzumaki...\" With that said Haruto jumped down to the field, \"...versus Ryousake Uchiha.\" Lee said pointing to Ryousake.<br>\r\n\"This is going to be an intense match.\" Said Naruto to one of his guards. \"Reminds you of old times.\"<br>\r\n\"Of course.\" The guard said.<br>\r\nBoth boys looked at each other, then at the stands, and then to the Kage's box, finally back at each other. \"Haruto Uzumaki v.s. Ryousake Uchiha, Ready begin.\" At that the two then made a half tiger sign. They then fell into their battle position and charged at each other ready to battle. Ryousake throw the first punch but Haruto deflected it and then went in for a thrust but Ryousake dodged it. He then got some distance. \"Fire Style: Fireball Jutsu.\" He then launched a giant ball of fire towards Haruto. <br>\r\n\"Rotation.\" Haruto the spun around and protected himself from the fire ball. Haruto then took a kunai out and then charged in at Ryousake but he followed suit and then the two clashed. After they slashed at each other they jumped back and throw the kunai at each other but they intersected and were knocked aside. Ryousake then throw shuriken but Haruto used Rotation to send them aside. He then used Shadow Clone Jutsu and formed four clones. The clones charged at Ryousake and each attacked, but Ryousake blocked each attack and then grabbed one of the clones' legs and then used one clone as a club and slammed it into the other three, destroyed them all. Haruto then charged in and to delivered a kick. <br>\r\nRyousake blocked the hit but was sent flying up into the air. Just then Haruto appeared behind Ryousake. He then use Shadow Clone Jutsu and then both spun and used a drop kick but Ryousake then got hold of each other legs and then slammed them together, destroying the clone. He then throw Haruto to the ground. Haruto used Rotation to soften his landing. Ryousake then charged down ready to punch but Haruto got out of the way. Ryousake's punch created a crater and he got up ready to attack. He then charged at Haruto punching. Haruto kept deflecting the attack. Ryousake then perform a drop kick but Haruto dodged it and got some distance. \"You are forcing my hand.\" Ryousake then performed hand-signs. \"Blaze Style: Inferno Shot.\" With that a fire ball of black flames formed and then he shot them at Haruto. Haruto dodged but the flames followed him. Haruto kept dodging and running but he flames followed him.

When Haruto stopped spinning he was surrounded by red chakra. \"Ryousake, that was uncalled for.\"<br>\r\n\"And what about you using that chakra?\" Ryousake asked.<br>\r\n\"I did this as a defense You attacked me with it.\" Haruto said as the chakra flared. He then ran in and charged at Ryousake but he dodged but Haruto redirected himself and then charged in again. Ryousake dodged and was about to kick but Haruto got out of the way and then tackled Ryousake, sending him back. Haruto then fell to a knee as his shoulder had received shock. \"Lighting Chakra.\"<br>\r\n\"That was a powerful hit.\" Ryousake said. He then noticed that the force had a swirl design. \"Could this mean?\" He looked Haruto in the eyes and even with Haruto evading direct eye contact so not to be affected by genjutsu he could see that his suspicions was true. \"All right then.\" Ryousake then prepared Chidori.<br>\r\n\"What is he thinking?\" Sakura said as she looked out from the medical room.<br>\r\n\"All right then.\" Haruto then help his hand out and then chakra started to form with in it in the form of a spiraling ball.<br>\r\n\"Could that be?\" Asked Kei.<br>\r\nThe two charged straight at each other.<br>\r\n\"Chidori.\" Ryousake said.<br>\r\n\"Rasengan.\" Haruto said.<br>\r\nWith that the two got close. Ryousake was then sent back and skid on the ground until he came to a stop. Lee looked him over. \"Winner Haruto Uzumaki.\" <br>\r\n\"Haruto won.\" Kei said. <br>\r\n\"So Ryousake lost.\" Sasuke said from his position as Naruto's bodyguard. \"Well, it just mean he has to get stronger.\" He then looked at Naruto. \"What is wrong?\"<br>\r\n\"I am so proud.\" Naruto said. \"He has fully mastered the Rasengan. As a father I am so happy.\" Naruto then regained his composer and said. \"I con-graduate our winner.\"<br>\r\n\"Wait.\" Ryousake said as he tried to get back up he was about to fall and Tai appeared and caught him.<br>\r\n\"Careful.\" Tai said.<br>\r\n\"The match my be over to you but it is not to me.\" Ryousake said. \"There is one thing that needs to be done first. Tai please get me to the center.\" <br>\r\n\"Okay.\" Tai then helped Ryousake to the center and Haruto met them there.<br>\r\n\"So let's do this.\" Haruto said.<br>\r\n\"Right.\" Ryousake said as he regained is balance and then the two interlocked their half tiger sign.

About ten minutes later Haruto walked out of his room. He was dressed like he normally do but he did not have his headband on.<br>\r\n\"Morning Haruto dear.\" Hinata said.<br>\r\n\"Morning Mom.\" Haruto answered back. He then sat down and ate breakfast.<br>\r\n\"So do you have plans today?\" Hinata asked.<br>\r\n\"Well I was going to do my morning exercises but other then that I have no real plans.\" Haruto said. \"Why do you ask?\"<br>\r\n\"You know that I am off of maternity leave now so I can go on missions again.\" Hinata said. \"So I need you to watch Shina for me.\" <br>\r\n\"Well I would love to but why me?\" Haruto asked.<br>\r\n\"Your dad is too busy at present to be about to juggle looking after your sister and do his work.\" Hinata said.<br>\r\n\"Hey why not let me look after Shina?\" Naruko asked.<br>\r\n\"You have class today.\" Hinata said.<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah.\" Naruko said as she hit herself in the head and stuck her tongue out a bit.<br>\r\n\"Well okay I will watch her but I agreed to met up with someone.\" Haruto said.<br>\r\n\"How would that be? You girlfriend Akiza?\" Naruko said.<br>\r\n\"That is none of your business.\" Haruto said. He finished his breakfast and then got up to train. After that he took a shower and he and started off with Shina. He soon came across Ryousake and Akiza. \"Man Ryousake is here.\" Haruto said to himself. He then looked to a smiling Shina. \"Well not like I would try anything with my baby sister present.\" He then said to them. \"Oh hey there.\" <br>\r\n\"Oh hey Haruto.\" Ryousake said.<br>\r\n\"Hey there Haruto.\" Akiza said. \"And how is this with you?\" <br>\r\n\"Sorry, this is Shina, my baby sister.\" Haruto said. \"Say hi Shina.\"<br>\r\nShina just giggled. \"Oh so cute.\" Akiza said. \"She is so full of energy.\"<br>\r\n\"Well she is my sister.\" Haruto said.<br>\r\n\"So you are looking after her, why?\" Akiza asked.<br>\r\n\"Mom is going on a mission and dad is too busy. As the oldest it is my responsibility to take care of my younger sibling.\" Haruto said. <br>\r\n\"I can't wait to have one.\" Akiza said. This caused both boys to freeze. She looked at them and then said. \"No I mean a younger sibling.\"<br>\r\n\"Well...\" Haruto paused to get the right words to use. \"It is possible for your parents to have another kid.\" <br>\r\n\"Actually there won't be that much of a wait.\" Ryousake said. <br>\r\n\"You mean your parents are expecting another baby? Congrats.\" Haruto said. \"Here that you will have someone to play with soon.\" He said to Shina. She just looked at him confused. \"So how long have you known?\"<br>\r\n\"After our match, Lady Ino was treating me.\" Ryousake said.<br>\r\n\"And?\" Haruto asked.<br>\r\n\"My mother would not put the care of her own child in the hands of anyone else not even her best friend unless she was unable to herself I placed two to two together.\" Ryousake said.<br>\r\n\"She told me as she was giving me my post-op examination.\" Akiza said.<br>\r\n\"Is that so.\" Haruto said. <br>\r\n\"Hey can I hold her?\" Akiza asked.<br>\r\n\"I don't see the harm.\" Haruto said. He then looked around and saw a bench. He then headed there with Shina in hand. \"Sit down here.\"<br>\r\n\"Okay.\" Akiza then sat down and then Haruto handed his sister to Akiza. <br>\r\n\"Careful there.\" Akiza was holding Shina. <br>\r\n\"Hey there cutie.\" Akiza said as she looked at Shina. Just then Shina started to cry. \"Did I do something wrong.\" <br>\r\nHaruto then took Shina back and then started moving with her up and down gently. \"It is alright.\" Haruto said to Shina. \"So what is the matter?\" Haruto then moved his hand towards Shina's behind. \"There is the problem.\" Haruto then headed and changed Shina. \"There all better.\"<br>\r\n\"You are good at this.\" Ryousake said.<br>\r\n\"Practice that's all.\" Haruto said. \"Well we should get going.\" Haruto said. <br>\r\n\"Mind if I came with you.\" Akiza asked.<br>\r\n\"Not at all.\" Haruto said.<br>\r\n\"I have to go a met Father for something anyway so I will be seeing you.\" With that Ryousake left.<br>\r\n\"So Haruto. Why don't we go back to your house and we can both watch Shina.\" Akiza said.<br>\r\n\"Okay sure.\" Haruto said. With that they headed for the Uzumaki household. <br>\r\nA few hours later, Hinata had gotten home from her mission and saw Haruto and Shina sitting on the floor along with Akiza Uchiha. Looking towards the door Akiza got up. \"Hello Mrs. Uzumaki. I am Akiza Uchiha a friend of Haruto.\"<br>\r\n\"I know how you are.\" Hinata said in a kind voice. \"It is okay, I don't mind that Haruto invited you here.\" She then turned to Haruto. \"So what did you do today?\"<br>\r\n\"Just hung out.\" Haruto said. \"Right Shina.\" <br>\r\nShe just laughed and smiled.<br>\r\n\"Well that is good to hear.\" Hinata said.<br>\r\n\"well look who we have here.\" They turned to see Naruto at the door.<br>\r\n\"Lord Hokage, Hello.\" Akiza said.<br>\r\n\"Akiza, Right?\" Naruto asked. \"Both your parents were my teamates and friends. As their child you may call me Lord Naruto.\"<br>\r\n\"Always the same dad.\" Haruto said.<br>\r\n\"Well I guess I should be heading home.\" Akiza said.<br>\r\n\"wait.\" Naruto said. \"Caught.\" He tossed her a riceball. <br>\r\n\"Thank you Lord Naruto.\" with that Akiza left.<br>\r\n\"Well let's have our dinner.\" Naruto said.<br>\r\nWith that they sat down and enjoyed their meal.</span></div></div>",

They each grabbed their Chunin vest and started out. <br>\r\nOnce outside Shikaro started talking. \"Man this is troublesome.\" He said as he slipped the vest on. \"I mean now that I am a chunin that means that Nareki Sensei will be giving me harder training.\" <br>\r\n\"Relax for once.\" Haruto said. \"Anywhy you should go and share the news with your family.\"<br>\r\n\"Whatever.\" Shikaro said as she turned around and started off.<br>\r\n\"What about you Haruto?\" Ryousake asked.<br>\r\n\"Well I would like to share with my mom the news but I think we should tell Kei.\" Haruto said.<br>\r\n\"Okay then. We have to go met with her and Konohamaru Sensei anyway.\" Ryousake said.<br>\r\nWith that the two headed to the training field where Kei and Konohamaru were waiting. Once there they shared the news with them. \"Well I know you both would be able to make chunin easily.\" Konohamaru said. \"The only shame is that Kei did not make it yet.\"<br>\r\n\"Don't worry it will happen.\" Haruto said.<br>\r\n\"Oh I know that I will make chunin. Until then I will just have to be the best Genin I can to keep up with you two.\" Kei stated.<br>\r\n\"That is the attitude I like.\" Konohamaru said. \"Well since you two have just became Chunin I have to take some time to think up what to train you two in next. You two can go and have the day off.\" <br>\r\n\"Thank you sensei.\" Ryousake said.<br>\r\n\"Right thanks sensei.\" Said Haruto.<br>\r\n\"As for you Kei time for a little one-on-one training.\" Konohamaru said.<br>\r\n\"Okay.\" Kei replied.<br>\r\nWith that the two newly promoted Chunin left.<br>\r\nThe next day Haruto headed for the training field. He and Ryousake and Kei arrived around the same time and saw Konohamaru Sensei no where in sight. \"Where could he be?\" Ryousake asked.<br>\r\n\"I don't know?\" Kei said. \"All I know is that when we left I saw him leave and meet up with a woman.<br>\r\n\"A woman huh? Did you see what she looked like?\" Haruto asked.<br>\r\n\"Haruto, you are a chunin, you should place this games behind you.\" Ryousake said.<br>\r\n\"You are just as intrested as I am.\" Haruto said and Ryousake shut up in defeat. \"Okay what did she look like?\"<br>\r\nBefore she could speak Konohamaru appeared. \"Sorry for being late.\" He said. <br>\r\n\"Why were you late?\" Kei asked.<br>\r\n\"Kei no!\" Haruto and Ryousake said.<br>\r\n\"He is just going to tell us a story that is a half truth.\" Ryousake continued. \"Okay go on and tell us.\"<br>\r\n\"I was actually trying to find someone to help me with today's training.\" Konohamaru said. <br>\r\n\"Really who?\" Asked Haruto.<br>\r\n\"Me.\" Said a female voice.<br>\r\n\"That voice.\" Haruto said. Just then a young woman landed in front of them. \"Aunt Hanabi.\" Haruto said in a scared tone.<br>\r\nHanabi Hyuga<br>\r\nAge: 27<br>\r\nRank: Jonin.<br>\r\nAppearance: Long black hair in a braided ponytail, white eyes, Headband around her forehead, wore standard jonin outfit with short sleeves.<br>\r\nVillage: Leaf.<br>\r\n\"Why are you here Aunt Hanabi?\" Haruto asked.<br>\r\n\"Well Konohamaru asked a favor of me so your three can get effective training.\" Hanabi said.<br>\r\n\"What training is that?\" Ryousake asked.<br>\r\n\"I am going to teach you three about Elemental Manipulation.\" Konohamaru said.<br>\r\n\"I know that, it is the uses of Elemental chakra to perform techniques.\" Ryousake said. \"I can already do that?\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah but you can create more techniques by combining elemental jutsu.\"<br>\r\n\"Okay I can get that.\" Ryousake said. \"Okay now we first need to see what your primary element is.\" Konohamaru said. \"That will be the element that you are the most natural at.\" \"How will we find that out?\" Kei asked.<br>\r\n\"With this.\" Konohamaru then held up four strips of paper. <br>\r\n\"What are those?\" Asked Haruto. \"They are special chakra paper that will indicate what element you're chakra is.\" Konohamaru said as he held on in his fingers. \"Sent a little chakra into it and it will then inform you of what type of chakra best suits you. Like so.\" Konohamaru sent chakra into the paper and ignited and turned to ash. \"If you are fire like me then the paper will ignite and turn to ash as you just show. If you are wind the paper will split in two, lighting the paper will wrinkle, earth the paper will turn to dirt and crumble away, and water the paper will become damp. Got that. Good now each of you take one and try it.\" They each proceeded in doing that. Ryousake's ignited and turned to ash. \"Well that is to expected seeing you are an Uchiha.\" Konohamaru said. Kei's became damp. \"So you use water.\" Haruto's paper split in two. \"And wind for Haruto. Just like your dad.\" <br>\r\n\"Is that so?\" Haruto said. \"So what do we do now?\"<br>\r\n\"Ryousake, you already have fire chakra down so I will train you in the next expect, as for you two I will get you started.\" He then turned to Kei. \"You first.\" With that Konohamaru then took a scroll out that had the character for Water on it. He opened it up and then there were two seals. He then unlocked the first seal and out came a barrel with a  ladle. <br>\r\n\"What is in there?\" Kei asked.<br>\r\n\"Water.\" Konohamaru said.<br>\r\n\"First step is to familiar yourself in how to use the jutsu.\" Konohamaru said.<br>\r\n\"And what is the water to do with that?\" Kei asked.<br>\r\n\"It is easy to use a water jutsu with a large supply.\" Konohamaru said. \"Hanabi would you mind helping me demistrate what Kei needs to do?\"<br>\r\n\"That is why you asked me hear.\" Hanabi then held her hands over the barrel and then focused chakra into her hands and then the water shot up and then she held it in midair. \"Getting the water to came to you is the first step of using water ninjutsu.\" <br>\r\n\"Wow.\" Kei and Haruto said.<br>\r\n\"Okay let me try.\" Kei asked and Hanabi then lowered the water back and then stepped back so Kei could give it a try. Kei placed her hands over and focused her chakra but all that was happening was the water was being pushed away from her hands. \"It is not working.\"<br>\r\n\"It will take time.\" Hanabi said.<br>\r\n\"Why is Aunt Hanabi being so nice, when she trains others she uses an iron fist.\" Haruto said to himself.<br>\r\n\"Okay Haruto, since Hanabi seems to have Kei handled, let me get you started with Wind chakra.\" Konohamaru said. (Some training as Naruto to learn Wind chakra.) After that Konohamaru got to work with Ryousake.<br>\r\n\"There that's it think of a form to give your chakra and have it hold it.\" Konohamaru said. By the end of the day the three were tried. \"You did good for the day, let's stop for the day, don't want to break you.\" Konohamaru said. <br>\r\n\"Okay sensei.\" Kei said. She seemed to want to ask something. <br>\r\n\"What do you wish to ask Kei?\" Konohamaru asked.<br>\r\n\"Well, I was wondering why you asked Hanabi here to help if you did not know that I was a water chakra type?\" Kei asked.<br>\r\n\"Well you see...\" Konohamaru said. \"...a little help.\" He said turning to Hanabi.<br>\r\n\"Oh no I want to hear your explanation.\" Hanabi said.<br>\r\n\"The truth is that...\" Konohamaru then looked to the sky. \"...oh look the time I have to go bye.\" With that Konohamaru left.<br>\r\n\"That Konohamaru, why can't he just admit it.\" Hanabi said.<br>\r\n\"What was that?\" Haruto asked.<br>\r\n\"Nothing Haruto.\" Hanabi said. \"It is getting late thou. Haruto you are not too old for me to take you home?\"<br>\r\n\"Actually I am Aunt Hanabi, but you did say you were coming over to see you nieces and nephews so we can walk together.\" With that Haruto and Hanabi head for his house and the rest headed home. Haruto got home.<br>\r\n\"Welcome home Haruto, Have you seen Aunt Hanabi?\" Hinata asked.<br>\r\n\"Actually, there was a change of plans.\" Haruto said with a grin.<br>\r\nThe next day at the training field. \"Konohamaru sensei proposed to Hanabi sensei.\" Kei said in a yell.<br>\r\n\"Quiet Kei, it is not offical yet, they still need to ask permission from Grandfather.\" Haruto said.<br>\r\n\"So you have told them?\" Konohamaru said as he appeared behind them.<br>\r\n\"Sorry Sensei.\" Haruto said.<br>\r\n\"It is okay. I will have to leave you to train on your own so see you later.\" Konohamaru said before leaving.<br>\r\n\"Must be asking know.\" Haruto said. \"Well let's get to work.\" With that they went to work training.</span></div></div>",

This enemy was sitting on his throne awaiting his second-in-command. When this man approach the man spoke up. \"You called for me Lord Orochimaru.\" <br>\r\nThe mastermind looked up and acknowledged his second-in-command's presence.<br>\r\nOrochimaru<br>\r\nAge: 70<br>\r\nRank: Sannin/Rogue Ninja<br>\r\nAppearance: waist-length black hair, amber eyes with slits in his pupils and purple markings around his eyes, wears plain grey garbs with black pants and a thick purple rope belt tied in a large knot behind his back and blue tomoe-shaped earrings.<br>\r\nVillage: Sound.<br>\r\n\"Kabuto, you to have revived well.\" Orochimaru said to his right hand man.<br>\r\nKabuto Yakushi<br>\r\nAge: 39<br>\r\nRank: Genin/Rogue Ninja<br>\r\nAppearance: has onyx eyes, ash-grey hair in a ponytail, wears a pair of black rimmed circular glasses.<br>\r\nVillage: Sound.<br>\r\n\"So what news have you brought me?\" Orochimaru asked.<br>\r\n\"Well it seems that Sasuke's son has proven to be a stronger ninja then his father.\" Kabuto said.<br>\r\n\"Is that so.\" Orochimaru said. \"Then we must have him.\"<br>\r\n\"Very well I will lead a small squad to go retrieve him.\" Kabuto said.<br>\r\n\"No, that is too much of a risk, we need to make sure to get them.\" Orochimaru said. He then got up from his throne and then performed handsigns and then slammed his hands to the ground. Up came five caskets. The caskets opened.<br>\r\n\"I see, as always Lord Orochimaru your decisions are wise.\" Kabuto said as he handed to Orochimaru a picture of Ryousake.<br>\r\n\"This is your target, go and bring him here by any means nessessary.\" Orochimaru said. \"Now go.\" With that the five left the caskets and headed out. <br>\r\nBack in the village, Ryousake was walking down the street when he senced something. He turned into an alley way and then turned around. \"What do you want with me?\" Ryousake then noticed. \"You four are reincarnated.\" He said noticing the eyes.<br>\r\n\"Smart.\" Said a the white haired one.<br>\r\n\"Who are/ where you?\" Ryousake asked.<br>\r\nThe reincarnated ninja introduced themselves.<br>\r\n\"Kidomaru of the East Gate.\" Said the one with six arms and dark skin.<br>\r\n\"Sakon of the West Gate.\" Said the one with dark grey hair and looks like he has two heads, a bead necklace around the first head's neck.<br>\r\n\"Tayuya of the North Gate.\" Said the pink haired girl.<br>\r\n\"Jirobo of the South Gate.\" Said the big fat one with an orange mohawk.<br>\r\n\"Kimimaro.\" Said the pale skin one with white hair.<br>\r\n\"Now what do you want?\" Ryousake asked.<br>\r\n\"We are hear to recuit you for our master.\" Kimimaro said.<br>\r\n\"Not interested.\" Ryousake said.<br>\r\n\"That was not a request.\" Kimimaru stated. With that Kidomaru charged in to attack but Ryousake jumped up to dodge. Then Sakon appeared ready to punch. Ryousake then kicked him and then in a twist was about to strike back when he got attacked by something fast. This sent Ryousake straight down where Jirobo grabbed him and then started to drain Ryousake of his chakra.<br>\r\n\"What the.\" Ryousake said as he tried to struggle free. \"Let go of me.\" He said.<br>\r\nJust then Kimimaru rushed in and stabbed Ryousake in the gut.\"Sorry but that is not on option.\" Kimimaru said. He singled Jirobo to let him go and when he did Ryousake dropped to the ground. \"Don't worry, killing you is not our master's first intention.\" With that he signaled the others and they then summoned a round coffin. They then placed Ryousake in it and then sealed him in. \"Good now let us get moving.\" Kimimaru said.<br>\r\n\"Listen hear, you may be Lord Orochimaru's old favorite but you are dead like the rest of us so don't think you can order me around.\" Sakon said.<br>\r\n\"You will do as you are told because Lord Orochimaru did revive us all.\" Kimimaru said. \"Now let's go.\" With that they headed out with the coffin in hand. <br>\r\nAs they were heading out of the village a swarm of shuriken came flying towards them. Kidomaru then turned towards the shuriken and then performed handsigns and then spat out a web that stopped the shuriken in there tracks. \"Who is that?\" Asked Kidomaru. Just then five Ink drawn Lions came towards them and was about to attack but then Kimimaru jumped in and then slashed all the ink lions. <br>\r\nMeanwhile from her hiding spot. \"This guys are strong.\" Kei said to herself. She then saw that one was gone. \"Where is the white haired one?\" Just then she could tell that Kimimaru was behind her. She turned around and got slashed across the chest. She then fell from the tree into the bushes below.<br>\r\nKimimaru then returned to the group. \"You got them?\" Asked Tayura.<br>\r\n\"Yes, know we must move.\" With that they headed out of the village.<br>\r\nOnce they left, Kei stepped out from the bushes and then struggled to the Hokage's home. \"I have to let him know.\" She made there and once she got to the door and after knocking on the door she started to pass out. The door opened and Haruto was there to check her and then heard her say. \"Reincarnated ninja have taken Ryousake.\" With that Kei passed out.<br>\r\n\"Kei, hang in there.\" Haruto said as he then got Kei to the hospital.Once she was stable Naruto came to get more information and the situation.<br>\r\n\"There were five of them and they were heading north east.\" Kei said.<br>\r\nJust then Haruto barged in the room. \"Dad, please let me go and get Ryousake back.\"<br>\r\n\"Haruto this is not just any ninja, they are dead ninja that have been revived, also I have a bad feeling about who the five are.\" Naruto said remembering events of the past. \"I can not risk it.\"<br>\r\n\"But if the person could revive the dead then Ryousake's life...\" As he was talking someone said \"Could be in danger.\" Haruto turned to see Shikaro.<br>\r\n\"Shikaro, what are you doing here?\" Haruto asked.<br>\r\n\"I called him here, I needed to make sure that the mission had a cool head leading it.\" Naruto said.<br>\r\n\"So you are sending a team to rescue Ryousake.\" Haruto said. \"I still need to go, he is my friend. I never desert a friend.\"<br>\r\n\"Alright I will assign you to the mission. Assemble a team of top genin.\" Naruto said.<br>\r\n\"Yes sir.\" They said as they left.<br>\r\nAs they left Kei's hospital room they saw Akiza. \"Akiza.\" Haruto said.<br>\r\n\"Is it true, has Ryousake been taken?\" She asked.<br>\r\n\"Yes he has.\" Shikaro said.<br>\r\n\"Then let me go with you to retrieve him.\" Akiza asked.<br>\r\n\"No.\" Haruto said.<br>\r\n\"Why not, he may be your friend and teammate but he is my brother.\" Akiza said.<br>\r\n\"And that is why you can't go.\" Haruto said. He then placed a hand on Akiza's shoulder. \"He needs a reason to comeback.\"<br>\r\n\"Okay.\" Akiza said. \"Then I will be here ready to give treatment to those who need it when you return.\" <br>\r\n\"Right.\" With that Haruto and Shikaro then headed to retrieve their first recruit.<br>\r\nOutside the Chokai Akimichi's home they knocked on the door. \"Chokai walk up we have a mission.\" Shikaro said.<br>\r\nOut walked Chokai.  \"What type of mission needs to be done this early he asked before he took a swig of milk to watch down the kick meal he was having.<br>\r\n\"Taking on reincarnated ninja to save Ryousake Uchiha.\" Shikaro said.<br>\r\nAt this Chokai spat his milk out. \"Are you serious? Why me?\" He asked.<br>\r\n\"You and I have worked together before so that will make things easier.\" Shikaro said.<br>\r\n\"Okay then who next.\" Haruto asked. Just then he got tackled by something. \"What the what is going on?\" He looked to see Kinmaru. \"Kinmaru, that means that Koga is nearby.\" <br>\r\n\"Good logic.\" Koga said as he walked up. \"Kinmaru get off him.\" Kinmaru did that. \"Chunin or not you are the same Haruto.\"<br>\r\n\"Why are you... two here?\" Haruto asked.<br>\r\n\"I was taking Kinmaru for his walk and we overheard what you said. It should be fun.\"  Koga said. <br>\r\n\"That takes care of tracking, but I would like more trackers.\" Shikaro said. \"No offence.\"<br>\r\n\"I understand.\" Koga said. \"But were to find that, Sechida is out on a mission with her father so she is out.\"<br>\r\n\"I have an idea.\" Haruto said.<br>\r\nThey then found themselves in the Hyuga Compound. Just then they were approached by Ayashi Hyuga. \"Lord Haruto, what brings you here?\"<br>\r\n\"I have no time to argue with you about me not being called lord.\" Haruto said to himself. \"We need your help.\" He said as he explained the situation.<br>\r\n\"I will help you. I am honored to work alongside you.\" Ayashi said.<br>\r\nAs soon as they got ready they headed for the gates. \"Good this should do it.\" Shikaro said.<br>\r\n\"Hold it there.\" They turned to see Rock Tai and Saisemaru Tanchikaki heading for them in fool battle gear.<br>\r\n\"Why are you here?\" Haruto asked.<br>\r\n\"Akiza asked use to go with you.\" Tai said.<br>\r\n\"That why you are coming?\" Shikaro asked Saisemaru.<br>\r\n\"A reincarnated is hard to deal with, you will need all the help you can get.\" Saisemaru said.<br>\r\n\"Okay.\" Shikaro said. \"This is my first mission leading so I should make a speak to inspire all of us. All I can think to say is that as Leaf Ninja we are all more then comardes, we are friends, and friends don't leave others behind. That goes for Ryousake as well.\" He looked to see that everyone had head his words well.  <br>\r\n\"So how will we approach this?\" Haruto asked.<br>\r\n\"First we find them.\" Shikaro said. \"Haruto, Ayashi, take notice to this.\" He then held up a sketch of five individuals. \"Kei sketched the five that she saw. As Byakugan users as well as checking all around us you can identify them easier.\" <br>\r\n\"Right.\" The two Byakugan users said.<br>\r\n\"We will also be following there scent.\" Shikaro said. \"Base on the scene Ryousake has been injuried so he is bleeding.<br>\r\n\"So me and Kinmaru are to track Ryousake's blood.\" Koga said. \"Got it.\" <br>\r\n\"The rest of you are to help in fighting them.\" Shikaro said. They nodded. \"Okay now let's go.\" With that the seven ninja made their way to rescue Ryousake.</span></div></div>",

Kimimaru then told them to stop. \"Why are we stopping?\" Sakon asked.<br>\r\n\"Jirobo, check to see if he is alive?\" Kimimaru said.<br>\r\n\"Whatever.\" With that he then placed the coffin down and then placed his palm over it and started to absorb chakra. \"He is alive still.\" <br>\r\nJust then kunai came flying towards them. <br>\r\n\"Scatter.\" Said Kimimaru. They jumped back. \"Who is there?\"<br>\r\n\"You know you made two mistakes.\" Said a voice from the coffin which was Ryousake's.<br>\r\n\"And that would be?\" Asked Tayura.<br>\r\n\"The first is that you injured my friend and teammate.\" Ryousake said.<br>\r\n\"And the second?\" Asked Kimimaru.<br>\r\n\"Not tying my hands.\" Ryousake then broke free from the coffin. He then tried to jump off but then Jirobo took hold of his leg and then slammed him to the ground. <br>\r\nJust then Haruto and the others arrived at the scene.\"Ryousake!\" Haruto shouted. \"What have you done to him?\" <br>\r\n\"What was needed.\" Kimimaru said.<br>\r\n\"Hey is it me are do they look familiar?\" Jirobo asked.<br>\r\n\"Yeah but it can't be.\" Sakon said.<br>\r\n\"Well it does not matter we will just use our immortal bodies to beat them.\" Kidomaru said. <br>\r\n\"We will not let you take Ryousake.\" Haruto said. He charged towards them.<br>\r\nRyousake then spoke up. \"Haruto don't they are too powerful.\"  Just then Kidomaru appeared and had two golden kama ready to use to slash. <br>\r\n\"Lord Haruto.\" Ayashi then appeared and used Gentle Fist and sent Kidomaru back. \"Are you okay?\"<br>\r\n\"Fine thanks.\" Haruto said. \"Who are you?\"<br>\r\n\"Kidomaru of the East Gate.\"<br>\r\n\"Sakon of the West Gate.\"<br>\r\n\"Tayuya of the North Gate.\"<br>\r\n\"Jirobo of the South Gate.\"<br>\r\n\"Kimimaro.\"  They each said introducing themselves.<br>\r\nThe Sound Ninja Four plus Kimimaro. \"This will be a hard fight.\" Haruto said. \"Good thing that attack worked like a charm.\"<br>\r\nWith that said the reincarnated ninja found that they could not move.<br>\r\n\"This is the Shadow Possession Jutsu.\" Tayura said. She said as she managed to noticed Shikaro using it.<br>\r\n\"Tai go.\" Shikaro said.<br>\r\n\"Right.\" Tai then charged in and grabbed hold of Ryousake and got him back to there side.<br>\r\n\"You okay?\" Asked Saisemaru as he took Ryousake's other shoulder.<br>\r\n\"I am low on chakra and I have a pain from my gut but other then that I am fine.\" Ryousake said. <br>\r\n\"We must get him back.\" Said Kimimaru. With that the five of them started to transform.<br>\r\n\"What is going on?\" Haruto asked.<br>\r\n\"I heard of this, they must use curse mark transformion.\" Ryousake said.<br>\r\n\"What are we going to do?\" Chokai asked.<br>\r\n\"We will have to fight them.\" Haruto said. \"Saisemaru you and Ayashi get Ryousake back to the village and come back with help.<br>\r\n\"Sorry Haruto but I will not leave you.\" Ayashi said. <br>\r\n\"Me neither.\" Saismaru said.<br>\r\n\"I will stand with you too.\" Ryousake said as he forced himself to stand.\" <br>\r\n\"Stay out of this Ryousake.\" Shikaro said. \"You are who they want and as long as they get your body they will succeed.\"<br>\r\n\"I understand.\" Ryousake said.<br>\r\nShikaro then stood up. \"Tai defend Ryousake.\"<br>\r\n\"Right.\" Tai said as he summoned his dao swords. <br>\r\n\"I will kill you for my master.\" Kimimaru said as he charged in but then Saisemaru then draw his blade and the two clashed.<br>\r\nSaisemaru then used his sword and draw a line in the ground. \"They don't cross this line.\"<br>\r\n\"Right.\" They said and went into action.<br>\r\nJirobo charged in but Chokai was there to hold him off. \"Out of the way Fatso.\" Jirobo said.<br>\r\n\"You are one to talk.\" Chokai said as he was pushing Jirobo back.<br>\r\nKidomaru started to launch arrows at them but Ayashi deflected the arrows. \"This will be fun.\" Kidomaru said.<br>\r\n\"I am grad you are entertained.\" Ayashi said.<br>\r\n\"So You are that Kiba's son, I guess I can get revenge on you.\" Sakon said. He attacked and Koga blocked. Sakon then smiled before a second fist came out and then Kinmaru bit it and then pulled sepereating Ukon from his brother.<br>\r\n\"How?\" Asked Ukon.\"<br>\r\n\"My sence of smell is nothing in comparison to that of my dad's but, Kinmaru's is better then Akamaru's at the same age.\" Koga said.<br>\r\n\"So let me play you a song.\" Tayura said as she played her flute. But nothing happened.<br>\r\n\"I have already taken precautions.\" Shikaro said as he showed his ear plugs. \"Now time for me to blow wind.\" He then took out two small folding fans and then swung them and created a strong gust of wind.<br>\r\nKimimaru and Saisemaru were trading blow for blow. \"Why are you holding back.\" Kimimaru asked.<br>\r\n\"I can tell that you were strong in life dispite your choice in allies. It is shameful having to fight you as a living corpse.\" Saisemaru said as he went in for another attack.<br>\r\n\"It is hopeless, our bodies are immortal.\" Jirobo said.<br>\r\n\"We know.\" Chokai said as he throw Jirobo into then air.<br>\r\n\"Is that all you...\" Just then he got hit by a kunai with a tag on it. Seal formula started to move from it and then Jirobo got sealed and his body turned to dust.<br>\r\n\"What was that?\" Asked Kidomaru. He then got hit by a simliar kunai.<br>\r\n\"What is going on?\" Tayura said as she was hit by the seal kunai.<br>\r\n\"That is not going to work on us.\" Sakon said for himself and his brother.\" Just then his body started to turn to dust as he looked to see Haruto stab Ukon with one of the kunai. \"How?\"<br>\r\n\"I have studied the one ninja art that defeats you, Sealing Jutsu.\" Haruto said.<br>\r\n\"That is a skilled trick but I am not going to let that happen.\" Kimimaru said.<br>\r\n\"That is not needed.\" Saisemaru said. He then jumped to dodge an attack and then hit Kimimaru in the arm  Just then Kimimaru's arm started to glow.<br>\r\n\"What is that?\"<br>\r\n\"This sword is a Soul Cutter.\" Saisemaru said. \"This sword is made to sever the soul from the body, normally without killing the body but in your case it free your soul.\" He then said. \"Let Kami judge you well.\" With that he slashed Kimimaru down the middle.<br>\r\n\"You did it.\" Said a tired Ryousake as he made it back with Tai behind him.<br>\r\n\"We were lucky.\" Shikaro said. \"Most of you have had a parent that fought one of them so we were ready.\"<br>\r\nThey then made there why back to the village.<br>\r\nBack in Orochimaru's hideout. \"Interesting. It seems that Sasuke is not the only one that has produced powerful offspring.\" Orochimaru said as he felt the bonds to the Sound Five get severed.<br>\r\n\"This is bad Lord Orochimaru, The Leaf Ninja will know that you are up to something.\" Kabuto said. <br>\r\n\"Relax Kabuto, this is nothing but a minor hitch in my plain.

Did not expect two thieves to be the cause.\" Haruto said.<br>\r\n\"This two are Leaf Shinobi, this could be fun.\" Mar said.<br>\r\n\"We don't have time for this.\" Jiriyu said. He then reached into his <br>\r\n<br>\r\npouch and throw a smoke bomb. When the smoke cleared they were gone.<br>\r\n\"Haruto?\" Ryousake said.<br>\r\n\"Right.

Just then he was kicked into the stream. Haruto <br>\r\n<br>\r\ncaught himself and stood on the water as he looked back at the one that <br>\r\n<br>\r\nattacked him. It was the smaller of the two. \"There is one. Now where <br>\r\n<br>\r\nis the other?\" Just then the bigger one appeared behind him but then he <br>\r\n<br>\r\ngot kicked away. <br>\r\n\"Need some help.\" Ryousake said.<br>\r\n\"Yeah I would.\" Haruto said.<br>\r\n\"Glad to assist.\" Just then Ryousaked draw out a kunai to black the <br>\r\n<br>\r\nincoming slash from the smaller of the thieves. <br>\r\nJiriyu just smiled. Electricity then mode it's way through the naginara <br>\r\n<br>\r\nand then shocked Ryousake.<br>\r\n\"Ryousake!\" Haruto yelled as he hand his way to Ryousake only to get <br>\r\n<br>\r\nattacked by Mar.<br>\r\n\"Sorry but this is going to hurt.

Haruto <br>\r\n<br>\r\ncontinued the attack and Jiriyu kept blocking until Haruto knocked the <br>\r\n<br>\r\nnaginara out of his hands and then thrust his palm into Jiriyu's gut. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJiriyu then got blasted back and was laying on his back. \"It is over, <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can't win.\" Haruto said.<br>\r\n\"You think so?\" Jiriyu said as he got up. and grabbed at Haruto's legs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaruto jumped back. \"You know I am more then swift movements and <br>\r\n<br>\r\nstealth.\" With that Jiriyu performed handsigns. \"Lightning Style: Super <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLighning Dragon Fist.\" With that electricity formed around Jiriyu's <br>\r\n<br>\r\nright arm that took the form of a dragon's head and he then charged in <br>\r\n<br>\r\nto punch. <br>\r\nHaruto tried to move but he felt he could not. \"What the?\" He looked to <br>\r\n<br>\r\nsee that his legs each had a lightning stun seal. \"This is bad.\" With <br>\r\n<br>\r\nthat Haruto braced himself. <br>\r\nJiriyu then made contact with Haruto and sent him through a wall and <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaruto went skidding into the forest. Jiriyu then made his way to <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaruto. \"I did not won't to do that but you left me little choose.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJiriyu said as he was about to leave. <br>\r\n\"What there.\" Jiriyu then turned around to see Haruto standing with <br>\r\n<br>\r\nminimal damage to his chest. \"How did you survive that?\"<br>\r\n\"You are not the only one who can use elemental chakra.\" Haruto said as <br>\r\n<br>\r\nhe focused wind chakra into his legs to cut the tags.<br>\r\n\"A wind chakra user. Well that won't help you, even with the seals gone <br>\r\n<br>\r\nit will take you some time to regain full use of your legs.\" Jiriyu <br>\r\n<br>\r\nsaid.<br>\r\n\"I know, that is why we are here?\" Haruto said.<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" Jiriyu said. Just then sand rose around him and <br>\r\n<br>\r\nthen ensnared him. \"What is this?\" Just then Akina stepped out from <br>\r\n<br>\r\nbehind the tree. \"Sand Ninja here too.\" Jiriyu said to himself.<br>\r\n\"Just as I bromised, here is one of them.\" Haruto said.<br>\r\n\"Dakashi, do something about Haruto's legs.\" Akina ordered.<br>\r\n\"Right.\" Dakashi then went over to him and then did a medical ninjutsu.<br>\r\n\"So that is what you were aiming for.\" Jiriyu said.<br>\r\nFlashback:<br>\r\n<i>\"We have been sent here to track down the persons reponsible for the <br>\r\n<br>\r\nthiefs.\" Akina explained to Haruto.<br>\r\n\"I can understand but as ninja of the sand you have no jurisdiction <br>\r\n<br>\r\nhere.\" Haruto said.<br>\r\n\"At least keep on eye out.\" Mentai said.<br>\r\n\"I will. And if I find one I will lure them outside the castle. That <br>\r\n<br>\r\nway you can say you caught them before he arrived here.\" Haruto said <br>\r\n<br>\r\nbefore he headed back to his post.</i><br>\r\nEnd Flashback.<br>\r\n\"To think you let yourself get hit by my attack just to get me out of <br>\r\n<br>\r\nthe castle ground.\" Jiriyu said.<br>\r\n\"Whatever, because of you I have to get my Captain medical treatment.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaruto said as he made his way back. Just then Haruto senced something. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Akina, incoming.\" <br>\r\nWith that they turned to find a giant glowing orb coming at them. \"Sand <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPrison Wall.\" With that Akina used here sand to create a giant wall <br>\r\n<br>\r\nthat took the hit but the force sent the entire Sand ninja team back <br>\r\n<br>\r\nand let Jiriyu free.\" </span></div></div>",

Good job to all of you.

Also through out the <br>\r\n<br>\r\nfight he had one thing on his mind.\"<br>\r\n\"His gang.\" Naruto said. \"It felt like how one feels for a teammate.\"<br>\r\n\"More like one felts for a friend.\" Haruto said.<br>\r\n\"Well I just hope we never met them again.\" Naruto said.<br>\r\n\"Not likely.\" Haruto said. <br>\r\nMeanwhile elsewhere, Jiriyu was resting in a bed at a medical clinic. A <br>\r\n<br>\r\nman then approached him. \"This will be so simple.\" He then took a kunai <br>\r\n<br>\r\nand ready to strike. \"This is for my partner.\"  He then thrust the <br>\r\n<br>\r\nkunai but then Jiriyu knocked it away and then attacked. He took hold <br>\r\n<br>\r\nof the intruder's neck and slammed him to the group. \"What how did he <br>\r\n<br>\r\nuse his right arm?\" The sheet fell to reveal that Jiriyu now had a <br>\r\n<br>\r\npuppet arm.<br>\r\n\"Jiriyu are you okay?\" Byo asked as she and Mar entered the room.<br>\r\n\"I still feel weak but for the most part I am fine.\" Jiriyu said. \"Mar <br>\r\n<br>\r\nget rid of him.\"<br>\r\n\"Right.\" With that Mar took hold of the intruder and then carried him <br>\r\n<br>\r\naway.<br>\r\n\"It will take time for you to be ready to travel, where will be be <br>\r\n<br>\r\nheading when that time is?\"<br>\r\n\"The Former Land of Whirlpools.\" Jiriyu said.</span></div></div>",

Every <br>\r\n<br>\r\nthing that has happened it makes no sence.\"<br>\r\nJust then something dropped down before him. \"Hey Haruto what's up.\"<br>\r\n\"Koga?\" Haruto asked.<br>\r\nKoga Inuzuka<br>\r\nAge: 17 <br>\r\nRank: Chunin.<br>\r\nAppearance: brown hair, dark eyes, red fang tattoo one each cheek, <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeadband around forehead, wearing a long open black jacket with nothing <br>\r\n<br>\r\nunder it and black pants.<br>\r\nVillage: Leaf.<br>\r\n\"Yep it is you alright, your scent changed so I was not sure.\" Koga <br>\r\n<br>\r\nsaid.<br>\r\n\"Since you are hear...\" Haruto was interupted by samething tackling <br>\r\n<br>\r\nhim.<br>\r\n\"Kinmaru that was not nice.<br>\r\nKinmaru<br>\r\nAge: 9.<br>\r\nRank: Nin-Wolf.<br>\r\nAppearance: Dark yellow fur with black along the sides oh his chest, <br>\r\n<br>\r\nsilver eyes, pointed ears.<br>\r\nVillage: Leaf.<br>\r\n\"So that is Kinmaru.\" Haruto said. \"Good to see you again. You too as <br>\r\n<br>\r\nwell Sechida.\" <br>\r\nSechida walked out from under a nearby tree. \"You finally noticed I was <br>\r\n<br>\r\nhere.\"<br>\r\nSechida Aburame<br>\r\nAge: 17.<br>\r\nRank: Chunin.<br>\r\nAppearance: long black hair, sunglasses black eyes, wears a high <br>\r\n<br>\r\ncollared jacket.<br>\r\nVillage: Leaf.<br>\r\n\"I know you were here, it's just that I had things on my mind.\" Haruto <br>\r\n<br>\r\nsaid. \"Now if you don't mind.\" With that he placed his hand out and <br>\r\n<br>\r\nstopped the incoming Hyuga. \"You never learn Ayashi.\"<br>\r\nAyashi Hyuga<br>\r\nAge: 17. <br>\r\nRank: Chunin.<br>\r\nAppearance: short black hair, white eyes, headband around forehead, <br>\r\n<br>\r\nwears gray robes.<br>\r\nVillage: Leaf.<br>\r\n\"Lord Haruto why do you have to be so cruel?\" Ayashi asked.<br>\r\n\"You are lucky that I am not in the mood now.\" Haruto said as she <br>\r\n<br>\r\ncontinued his way.<br>\r\n\"What is up with him?\" Koga asked.<br>\r\n\"I don't know.\" Sechida said.<br>\r\n\"Sechida when did you get her?\" Ayashi asked.<br>\r\n\"I was here from the start.\" She said.<br>\r\nHaruto then found his way to the park. He sat on a bench. He layed back <br>\r\n<br>\r\nand closed his eyes. Shortly after he heard a voice. \"Haruto.\" <br>\r\nHaruto looked up and saw Wanati Namikaze. \"Wanati Sensei, why are you <br>\r\n<br>\r\nhear?\"<br>\r\n\"I always came here when I need to relax.\" Wanati said.<br>\r\n\"Why would you need to relax, you are an instructor.\" Haruto said.<br>\r\n\"Have you had to deal with little kids?\" Wanati asked.<br>\r\n\"I think I understand.\" Haruto said. \"Why not do something else?\" <br>\r\n\"It may be stressful but someone has to do it.\" Wanati said. <br>\r\n\"I guess.\" Haruto said. \"I am worried.\"<br>\r\n\"About what?\" Wanati asked.<br>\r\n\"That I am not good enough.\" Haruto said.<br>\r\n\"So, if that is the case the strive to get better.\" Wanati said.<br>\r\n\"Thanks.\" Haruto said. \"Well I better get going.\" With that Haruto <br>\r\n<br>\r\nleft.</span></div></div>",

Now.\" With that the six of them went to work.<br>\r\nMinutes later, the Uchiha's were working hard to keep the prisoner from <br>\r\n<br>\r\ncrashing while the Yamanaka searching his mind for anything.<br>\r\nInside the prisoner's mind.<br>\r\nIno and her daughters have made their way to the brain. On route the <br>\r\n<br>\r\nmindscape was shocking. \"What is going on?\" Inoko asked.<br>\r\n\"This is an effect of the real world.\" Ino said. \"We better hurry and <br>\r\n<br>\r\nget all we can.\"<br>\r\nBoth girls gave a knod and went to work. <br>\r\n\"The images are all too dark.\" Kei said.<br>\r\n\"That means that he has seen light for a while.\" Ino said. \"I think I <br>\r\n<br>\r\nfound something.\" Ino then reached deeper and then found something. \"No <br>\r\n<br>\r\nit can't be.\" Just then the mindscape started to break apart. \"Get out <br>\r\n<br>\r\nnow.\" With that the three Yamanaka got out. <br>\r\n\"Did you find anything?\" Sakura asked.<br>\r\n\"I have but this is bad.\" Ino said. She then got up and made her way to <br>\r\n<br>\r\nthe Hokage's office to give her report.<br>\r\n\"So Orochimaru is involved.\" Naruto said.<br>\r\n\"Right.\" Ino said.<br>\r\n\"What are we going to do?\" Sakura said.<br>\r\n\"This is bad.\" Naruto said. \"If Orochimaru is invovled then we need to <br>\r\n<br>\r\nsend Sasuke.\"<br>\r\n\"You sent him an a gut feeling already didn't you?\" Sakura asked.<br>\r\n\"Yes I did.\" Naruto said.<br>\r\nWith that Sakura charged and took hold of Naruto by the throat and held <br>\r\n<br>\r\nhim to the wall. \"How dear you send him with not much of a guarantee <br>\r\n<br>\r\nthat it was Orochimaru we are dealing with.\" Sakura said.<br>\r\n\"You now that it was our best bet to sent him.\" Naruto said.<br>\r\n\"I hate it when you talk sense.\" Sakura said. \"So what are we going to <br>\r\n<br>\r\ndo now?\"<br>\r\nJust then a chunin ran in. \"Lord Naruto, Sasuke Uchiha's team have <br>\r\n<br>\r\nreturned and Sasuke Uchiha is in critical condition.\"<br>\r\nWith that they rushed to the hospital. Once there there all went to <br>\r\n<br>\r\nwork to stablize the team. While Sakura and her team of medics were at <br>\r\n<br>\r\nwork on the most injuried, Naruto was taking with the less injuried.<br>\r\n\"So what happened?\" Naruto asked.<br>\r\nThe chunin took a deep breath and then started. \"We were examining <br>\r\n<br>\r\nlocations of Orochimaru's old lairs in the Land of Fire. But the moment <br>\r\n<br>\r\nwe got there we were attacked.\"<br>\r\n\"Did you see who did this?\" Naruto asked.<br>\r\n\"I am sorry, it all happened so fast I didn't see anything until it was <br>\r\n<br>\r\ntoo late. If not for Sasuke, I would have been killed.\" He said.<br>\r\n\"Is there any thing that you can remember?\" Naruto asked.<br>\r\n\"Sorry no.\" He said.<br>\r\n\"Just rest.\" Naruto said as he left. After the surgery were done Naruto <br>\r\n<br>\r\nspoke with Sakura. \"So are they going to be okay?\" Naruto asked.<br>\r\n\"They will all live but it took longer to stabilize Sasuke.\" Sakura <br>\r\n<br>\r\nsaid.<br>\r\n\"Why is that?\" Naruto asked.<br>\r\n\"He lost alot of blood but that is the strange thing as the wounds are <br>\r\n<br>\r\nnot enough to allow him to bleed that much out.\" Sakura said. \"I think <br>\r\n<br>\r\nhe may have been drained.\"<br>\r\n\"They took his blood.\" Naruto said. \"Why would they need that?\"<br>\r\n\"I don't know.\" Sakura said.<br>\r\nMeanwhile elsewhere, Kei and Ryousake came to talk to Haruto and told <br>\r\n<br>\r\nhim about all that happened. \"That is so wrong.\" Haruto said. \"I am <br>\r\n<br>\r\nuseless.\" <br>\r\nRyousake then took hold of Haruto and held him up. \"Stop saying such <br>\r\n<br>\r\nstupid things, you are not useless. Everyone has different skills that <br>\r\n<br>\r\nare useful in the right time. So get over yourself and be a man.\" With <br>\r\n<br>\r\nthat Ryousake let Haruto go.<br>\r\n\"Thanks Ryousake, I think I needed that.\" Haruto said. He then gathered <br>\r\n<br>\r\nhis things. \"I think it is clear what we have to do.\" Haruto said.<br>\r\n\"Right.\" Kei said.<br>\r\n\"Correct.\" Ryousake said.<br>\r\nWith that they got their stuff and headed for the main gate. There they <br>\r\n<br>\r\nsaw Naruto and Konohamaru there. \"Where are you three going?\" Naruto <br>\r\n<br>\r\nasked.<br>\r\n\"To find out where Orochimaru's Lair is.\" Haruto said.<br>\r\n\"I can't let you do this.\" Naruto said.<br>\r\n\"Why not?\" Haruto asked.<br>\r\n\"If is clear that Orochimaru wants individuals with unique abilities. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf you go then you could be giving him what he wants.\" Naruto said.<br>\r\n\"I understand that and that is why I am going. If they are looking for <br>\r\n<br>\r\nsuch individuals then we will draw them out.\" Haruto said.<br>\r\n\"You will go even if I tell you not to. Okay then be careful.\" Naruto <br>\r\n<br>\r\nsaid.<br>\r\n\"Alrigh team let's go...\" Konohamaru started to say before Ryousake <br>\r\n<br>\r\ntapped Konohamaru's gut and he stumbled back. <br>\r\n\"No Sensei, your body is still recovering from the shock of the thief, <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are not ready to battle.\" Ryousake said.<br>\r\n\"You got shocked too.\" Konohamaru said.<br>\r\n\"I am use to lightning chakra.\" Ryousake said. \"We are going and I am <br>\r\n<br>\r\ngoing to act as leader.\"<br>\r\n\"I can deal with that.\" Haruto said.<br>\r\n\"Same here.\" Naruto said.<br>\r\n\"Naruto, Are you sure?\" Konohamaru asked.<br>\r\n\"No but I trust in Ryousake.\" Naruto said. \"What are you waiting for <br>\r\n<br>\r\nget going.\" <br>\r\n\"We are waiting for our fourth.\" Ryousake said. \"And here she is.\" As <br>\r\n<br>\r\nhe said that Akiza approached them.<br>\r\n\"Akiza, you too?\" Naruto asked.<br>\r\n\"Yes, I have every right to go with them.\" Akiza said.<br>\r\n\"Now that we are all here, move out.\" With that the four of them <br>\r\n<br>\r\ndeparted.</span></div></div>",

Once there <br>\r\n<br>\r\nhe spoke up. He then took a sample of the blood and then went to work <br>\r\n<br>\r\non it. \"Adding the accelerating agent now. There now we just wait.\"<br>\r\nHe then steeped out of the lab and then was approached by two others. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like we are to have guests.\" One of them said. <br>\r\n\"Let the sentries deal with them.\" Hebimaru said.<br>\r\n\"That would be great, except...\" The other one said.<br>\r\nMeanwhile near the enternce to the base.<br>\r\n\"Eight Trigram Air Palm.\" Haruto said as he sent ten sentries flying <br>\r\n<br>\r\ninto a tree and they shattered.<br>\r\n\"We are clearly close.\" Kei said.<br>\r\n\"Be on your guard.\" Ryousake said.<br>\r\n\"Right.\" Haruto then activated his Byakugan. \"Ten meters.\"<br>\r\n\"Okay.\" Ryousake said as they moved closer.<br>\r\nIn the base.<br>\r\n\"Wow they managed that.\" Hebimaru said. \"Who are they?\" <br>\r\n\"There is one way to find out.\" The smaller of the two men said.<br>\r\n\"You are right.\" With that said Hebimaru and the other two made their <br>\r\n<br>\r\nway to a pair of steel doors. He opened the doors and inside the room <br>\r\n<br>\r\nwere cells. \"Okay, we have intuders that have made it through the <br>\r\n<br>\r\nsentries and you know what that means.\" Hebimaru said. \"One of you get <br>\r\n<br>\r\nto get out of your cage. Question is who?\" Hebimaru then looked around. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You will do.\" With that Hebimaru opened the cell and then said. \"Yes <br>\r\n<br>\r\nyou will do indeed.\"<br>\r\nAt the entrence. <br>\r\n\"Are you sure it is here?\" Ryousake asked looking at the rock in-front <br>\r\n<br>\r\nof them.<br>\r\n\"Yes I am.\" Haruto said.<br>\r\n\"Alright then leave this to me.\" Akiza said as she was about to charge <br>\r\n<br>\r\nat the rock.<br>\r\n\"Hold it.\" Haruto said. \"I know this may be weird coming from me but we <br>\r\n<br>\r\nneed to use the silent approach.<br>\r\n\"But they already know that we are here.\" Akiza said.<br>\r\n\"True but if we sneak in the less conflict we have to deal with.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaruto said.<br>\r\n\"What do we do?\" Kei asked.<br>\r\n\"We will split into teams.\" Ryousake said. \"Haruto you and Akiza will <br>\r\n<br>\r\nattack from the front and Kei and I will enter from below.\"<br>\r\n\"Right.\" Haruto said.<br>\r\nThey seperated and then went into action. Akiza then punched the front <br>\r\n<br>\r\nand made a hold that she and Haruto ran through. At the same time <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyousake and Kei dug a hole and traveled through it.<br>\r\n\"Remember Akiza, You and I are to keep them busy while Ryousake and Kei <br>\r\n<br>\r\nexamine this place.\" Haruto said.<br>\r\n\"I know that.\" Akiza said. As if on que there were several ninja that <br>\r\n<br>\r\nran towards them. \"So let's get started.\"<br>\r\nAt the the two started to fight the ninja back. Meanwhile Ryousake and <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKei dug themselves into the base and found themselves in a room filled <br>\r\n<br>\r\nwith giant glass tubes. <br>\r\n\"What is this place?\" Asked Kei.<br>\r\n\"I don't know.\" Ryousake said as he started off in one direction while <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKei went the other. It was soon that Ryousake found show what they <br>\r\n<br>\r\nwhere. \"I can't believe it.\" <br>\r\n\"What is it?\" Kei said as she ran to him.<br>\r\n\"This.\" Ryousake pointed to the tube in front of him and Kei showed <br>\r\n<br>\r\nshock. <br>\r\n\"A human baby. But I don't understand.\" Kei said.<br>\r\n\"I don't know.\" Ryousake said. With that they contiuned their <br>\r\n<br>\r\nexamination.<br>\r\nMeanwhile Haruto and Akiza where fighting off the ninja that tryed to <br>\r\n<br>\r\nstop them. \"That was easy.\" Akiza said.<br>\r\n\"Don't get too cocky.\" Haruto said.<br>\r\n\"There is one.\" Akiza said as one ran off. She ran after it.<br>\r\n\"Akiza wait.\" Haruto said as he chased after her. The ninja ran into a <br>\r\n<br>\r\nroom and the two Leaf ninja went in after.<br>\r\nBack in the Tube room Ryousake and Kei had searched all around the <br>\r\n<br>\r\narea. \"All these things found and still no answers.\" Ryousake said.<br>\r\n\"Yeah nothing at all.\" Kei said. Just then the floor opened up and they <br>\r\n<br>\r\nboth fell down.<br>\r\nWith Haruto and Akiza, they followed the ninja through the door into an <br>\r\n<br>\r\narena. \"What is this place?\" Akiza asked. <br>\r\nAs they took a step on the stairs leading down they collapsed and they <br>\r\n<br>\r\nslid into the arena. \"Akiza, are you okay?\" Haruto asked.<br>\r\n\"Yeah I'm fine.\" She said.<br>\r\nJust then Ryousake and Kei landed next to them. \"How did you two get <br>\r\n<br>\r\nhere?\" Haruto asked.<br>\r\n\"The floor opened up.\" Kei said. \"You two?\"<br>\r\n\"Chased the ninja there and then the stairs turned to a slide.\" Haruto <br>\r\n<br>\r\nsaid.<br>\r\n\"Well then at least we can have someone to interrogate.\" Ryousake said.<br>\r\nJust as they were about to approach the ninja, something else entered <br>\r\n<br>\r\nthe arena. It landed on the ninja, killing him.<br>\r\n\"What is that thing?\" Haruto asked. It was giant with grayish skin and <br>\r\n<br>\r\nlarge fore-arms and legs. On each of his wrists were shackles.<br>\r\n\"I remember father telling use about this, this is a curse mark user in <br>\r\n<br>\r\nit's second stage.\" Ryousake said.<br>\r\n\"I do too but this is beyond that.

But I needed to learn what Orochimaru know.\"<br>\r\n\"So those babies in the tubes!\" Ryousake asked.<br>\r\n\"Clones of shinobi that had unique abilities, yes.\" Hebimaru said.<br>\r\n\"I will not let you continue this act of horror.\" Ryousake said as he took a kunai and charged but then someone blocked his attack with a sword. \"Who did that?\" <br>\r\n\"That would be me.\" Said a lean-built man.<br>\r\n\"And who are you?\" Ryousake asked.<br>\r\n\"The name is Akagetsu.\" He said.<br>\r\nAkagetsu<br>\r\nAge: appears 16.<br>\r\nRank: Rogue Ninja/Jonin strength. <br>\r\nAppearance: short white hair with a tint of red in it, purple eyes, shark-like teeth, wearing a light purple top and long light blue pants. The sword he was holding had a smooth edge.<br>\r\nVillage: Orochimaru's Army.<br>\r\nThe two pushed each other back and then stared at each other. \"So you don't just have that beast.\" Ryousake said.<br>\r\n\"That is rude to say, it my not be able to make sense of it but he can still hear what you say to it.\" Akagetsu said. \"Plus this that is the least of your worries. But don't worry I will soon put your  worries to rest.\"<br>\r\nJust then Akagetsu took out a kunai and throw it to his side as Kei had deflected it as she had tried to go in for a surprise attack. \"How did he find out that I was going to attack?\" Kei asked herself.<br>\r\n\"Kei above you!\" Haruto shouted. At that Kei moved out of the way as someone charged into the ground. \"Now who do we got?\"<br>\r\n\"I am Kiira.\" The large man said.<br>\r\nKiira<br>\r\nAge: appears 16. <br>\r\nRank: Rogue Ninja/Jonin strength.<br>\r\nAppearance: Long spiked orange hair, crimson eyes, wears open gray vest and black pants.<br>\r\nVillage: Orochimaru's Army.<br>\r\n\"Looks like the gang is all here?\" Akiza said. <br>\r\n\"That just means we have more to deal with.\" Ryousake said. He then performed hand-signs and and launched a fire ball.<br>\r\n\"Fool.\" Hebimaru said. \"Akagetsu.\"<br>\r\n\"Right.\" With that Akagetsu jumped in the way and took the full force of the blast.<br>\r\n\"Why would he do that?\" Ryousake asked himself.<br>\r\n\"Stay focused.\" Haruto said. With that Ryousake blocked an attack from an arm of water. <br>\r\n\"Thanks Haruto.\" Ryousake said as he jumped back to join them. The water then regain the form of Akagetsu. \"But how?\"<br>\r\n\"Orochimaru used more then his DNA samples.\" Hebimaru said. \"He used all the DNA samples that he had left as well as the ones Kabuto had attained. Including Team Hawk.\"<br>\r\n\"Team Hawk?\" Asked Haruto.<br>\r\n\"That is the group of ninja that Sasuke gathered to help him in his goal.\" Kei said.<br>\r\n\"Well in formed little mouse.\" Hebimaru said and then Kei took a defensive stance.<br>\r\n\"So this are the offspring of Suigetsu...\" Ryousake said as he looked to Akagetsu. \"...and Juugo.\" He said looking at Kiira.\"<br>\r\n\"We better be careful.\" Kei said.<br>\r\n\"I know.\" Ryousake said. With that Kiira and Akagetsu disappeared. \"Where are they coming from?\"<br>\r\n\"Ryousake, Akiza in front of you.\" Haruto said.<br>\r\nWith that Ryousake lift his kunai and blocked the sword and Akiza blocked the incoming punch. \"Lightning Style: Chidori Current.\" Ryousake said as he sent Chidori into his kunai and then through Akagetsu's sword into his body causing him to lose his form and turned into a semi-liquid state.<br>\r\n\"Fire Style: Rising Dragon Striker.\" With that Akiza's hands surrounded with fire and then she punched Kiira, leaving a deep wound causing him to stumble back.<br>\r\nHebimaru then started to clap. \"Congratulations, you managed to wound them. Too bad it does not matter.\" He then made and hand sign and then touched the creature. The creature's eyes then opened to reveal two red eyes. Hebimaru then launched four snakes at Ryousake and the others and the snakes tied up around them. \"Now attack.\"<br>\r\n\"Sen Ball Blast.\" The creature said in a deep but raspy voice. It launched a giant sphere at the ceiling and then it fell on the Leaf ninja.  <br>\r\n\"That will do it.\" Hebimaru said. But when he looked at where he had the creature attack now stood a giant toad holding a large piece of rubble above him and was standing over the Leaf Ninja. <br>\r\n\"Sorry for the quick summon, Gamaten.\" Haruto said.<br>\r\n\"I understand.\" Gamaten said. He looked the same as he did when Haruto first summoned him but he now had two blades on either side of his <br>\r\nwaist. <br>\r\n\"He summoned a toad but how his arms were bond.\" Hebimaru said. He then saw that the snake was cut in pieces and all but Akiza was free. \"A Hyuga. So that is how you got out of the binds.\" <br>\r\n\"I am of Hyuga blood but I am not Hyuga.\" Haruto said.<br>\r\n\"Then who are you?\" Hebimaru asked.<br>\r\n\"I am Haruto Uzumaki.\" Haruto said as he cut Akiza free. \"You okay?\" <br>\r\n\"Yeah I am fine.\" Akiza said.<br>\r\n\"Good now treat Ryousake.\" Haruto said.<br>\r\n\"But he is not...\" Akiza then noticed the blood on Ryousake's arm.<br>\r\n\"It's just a nick.\" Ryousake said.<br>\r\n\"I don't care you are letting me treat you.\" Akiza said.<br>\r\n\"Kei you keep guard on them and then take Ryousake out of here and bring that corpse with you.\" Haruto said as he pointed to what remained of the ninja he and Akiza chased there.<br>\r\n\"Right.\" Kei said.<br>\r\n\"Akiza, once you are done with healing Ryousake, I want you to leave too.\" Haruto said. He then used Shadow Clone Jutsu and they all <br>\r\nattacked. <br>\r\n\"So we have the Hokage's brat here.\" Akagetsu said. \"This will be fun. How long until he can use that jutsu again?\" <br>\r\n\"Ten minutes.\" Hebimaru said.<br>\r\n\"More then enough time to have some fun.\" Akagetsu said. With that said he and Kiira charged in and battled with the clones and making there way towards where Haruto was. <br>\r\nKiira then kicked but Haruto blocked it. \"He was not pushed back, but how?\" Haruto then took hold of the leg and then tossed Kiira away. When Kiira tried to get back up he found out the answer to his earlier question. \"You blocked by attack by cutting off the flow of chakra in my leg.\"<br>\r\n\"Wow this Haruto shows skill.\" Akagutsu said. \"But that will not help hit with me.\" He then jumped at him and prepared to strike. Haruto then brought out a kunai and then used it to make contact with Akagetsu's sword. \"I got you know.\" Akagetsu then turned his body into water and then surrounded Haruto. \"Hebimaru now is your chance.\" <br>\r\n\"Right.\" Hebimaru then readied the creature. \"Launch.\" The creature then shot it's Sen Ball Blast at Haruto. \"Hold up this will hurt you Akagetsu even while you are in you liquid state.\" Hebimaru said to himself.<br>\r\n\"This is bad Haruto is done for.\" Akiza said to herself.<br>\r\n\"Relax Akiza.\" Ryousake said. \"Haruto can get out of this.\"<br>\r\nHaruto then closed his eyes and then activate his Byakugan. \"Rotation.\" This throw Akagetsu away and then Haruto was facing the incoming orb.<br>\r\n\"He may have gotten away from Akagetsu but he doesn't have the time to dodge.\" Hebimaru said.<br>\r\nHaruto then start to move his hands, sending thin blades of chakra and forming them into the form of an arc. \"Protection of the Eight Trigrams Sixty-Four Palms.\" With this the orb was sliced into bits and then Haruto slashed them into nothing.<br>\r\n\"He stopped the Sen Ball Blast.\" Hebimaru said. \"Interesting.\"<br>\r\n\"I will not let him get away with making Hebimaru look the fool.\" Kiira said. With that he then charged at Haruto and then struck him, sending him into the air. He then attacked from above while Akagetsu attacked from below.<br>\r\nHaruto regained his composure and then formed a Rasengan and thrust it into Kiira and then kicked Akagetsu in the face and then jumped into the air and used Shadow Clone Jutsu and then each of them beat on the two as they fell to the ground. \"That will deal with them.\" Haruto said. \"Akiza I thought I asked you to leave?\"<br>\r\n\"I will not leave you to dealing with them alone.\" Akiza said. \"Especially with that creature in their arsenal.\"<br>\r\n\"Trouble in paradise?\" Hebimaru asked. \"Sorry but I must take advantage of this.\" With that he made a hand sign and the creature charged at them.\"<br>\r\n\"Well I guess you would have seen this eventually.\" Haruto said. The creature then punched Haruto into a wall.<br>\r\n\"Haruto!\" Akiza yelled.<br>\r\n\"That is one down.\" Hebimaru said. </span></div></div>",

Just then Hebimaru saw <br>\r\n<br>\r\na red chakra surrounding Haruto. \"What is happening. <br>\r\nThe chakra the <br>\r\n<br>\r\nincreased and took a shape. It looked like a fox. The creature then got <br>\r\n<br>\r\nback up. Haruto then charged at the creature and then beat it up like <br>\r\n<br>\r\nit was nothing. \"Is that Haruto?\" Akiza asked. <br>\r\n\"So this is the <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNine-Tail's chakra.\" Hebimaru said. \"Strange that he has it.\" <br>\r\nHaruto <br>\r\n<br>\r\nthen looked towards Hebimaru. He stepped back he then took hold of <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHebimaru and then Kiira and Akagetsu then charge at Haruto, but Haruto <br>\r\n<br>\r\nextended a chakra arms from his back and punched them back.<br>\r\nHaruto then got ready to slash Hebimaru with chakra claws. As he was <br>\r\n<br>\r\nabout to the creature jumped in and attacked Haruto letting Hebimaru <br>\r\n<br>\r\nget away. Haruto then slashed the creature. At this point Hebimaru, <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkagetsu, and Kiira got away. He then turned to face Akiza. \"Haruto, is <br>\r\n<br>\r\nthat you?\" <br>\r\n\"Yes.\" He said. <br>\r\n\"It is done you can stop using the chakra.\" Akiza <br>\r\n<br>\r\nsaid.

Just winded.\" Haruto said. <br>\r\n\"Hey?\" Kei said as they looked to see her at a door way nearby. \"This <br>\r\n<br>\r\nway hurry.\" The four of them got out of the base and made their way <br>\r\n<br>\r\nback to the village. <br>\r\nWhile making their way to the village Ryousake spoke up. \"Haruto care <br>\r\n<br>\r\nto explain about that red chakra you were using?\" <br>\r\nHaruto looked at Akiza. \"They deserve to know.\" She said.<br>\r\n\"I guess you are right.\" Haruto said. \"True is that I don't know the <br>\r\n<br>\r\nhow but eversince I could remember, maybe even longer, my body produced <br>\r\n<br>\r\ntwo chakra, my normal chakra and that of the Nine-Tails.<br>\r\n\"Are you like Lord Hokage?\" Kei asked.<br>\r\n\"No, as for as I can tell there is no consciousness that belongs to the <br>\r\n<br>\r\nchakra.\" Haruto said.<br>\r\n\"How well can you control it?\" Kei asked.<br>\r\n\"I can summon it at will and can only form a chakra cloak.

Why does Orochimaru treat that Clone with respect even thou he messed up so much?\" He asks himself thinking on how Hebimaru was not destroyed for failing to capture or kill those Leaf ninja, not to mention letting them get away. \"Lord Orochimaru has changed since his resurrection.\" He then walked into Orochimaru's room. \"You summoned me my lord?\" Kabuto asked.<br>\r\n\"Actually I needed you.\" Kabuto turned to see Hebimaru standing in the corner. <br>\r\n\"Hebimaru, what brings you here?\" Kabuto asked.<br>\r\n\"He was reporting to me on his failure.\" Orochimaru said.<br>\r\n\"Is that so?\" Kabuto said.<br>\r\n\"Kabuto, I need you and Hebimaru to go on a mission for me.\" Orochimaru said.<br>\r\n\"Both of us, are you sure that is a wise decision?\" Kabuto asked.<br>\r\n\"Hebimaru needs the experince of the outside world.\" Orochimaru said. \"I would trust the task of keeping my 'son' safe only to my most trusted man.\"<br>\r\n\"Very well Milord.\" Kabuto said. With that he and Hebimaru left.<br>\r\nMeanwhile back in the Leaf Village, Haruto was heading for his house. As he got closer he head something going on. He went to investigate. He came across his baby sister, Shina. She was beating on a tree. \"Shina, is something wrong.\" Haruto said as he came up to her.<br>\r\n\"Haruto, it's nothing.\" Shina said.<br>\r\n\"Come on. You know that I know if you are not saying the whole truth.\" Haruto said. \"So spill.\"<br>\r\n\"Well you see I there is this kid that bad mouthed me and then dad.\" Shina said. \"I wanted to shut him up so I let my temper get to me.\"<br>\r\n\"Did you hurt this kid?\" Haruto asked.<br>\r\n\"No, he dodged me and this is not the first time.\" Shina said.<br>\r\n\"Listen Shina, fighting is should never be the option at your age.\" Haruto said. \"I fight but that is for a reason.\"<br>\r\n\"But I tried to defend dad.\" Shina argued. <br>\r\n\"And that is fine but here me out, you can not go around and fight everyone or you will be no better then those who got you mad.\" Haruto said.<br>\r\n\"But he said that his entire family is a bunch of losers.\" Shina said.<br>\r\n\"Is that so. Where can I find him?\" Haruto asked.<br>\r\n\"He is at the park.\" Shina said. \"I'll show you.\" With that Shina started to run but then tripped on her hair. <br>\r\n\"Not again.\" Haruto said. With that Shina got up and led him to the kid that insulted her. They soon arrived at the park. \"Okay do you see him?\" He asked.<br>\r\n\"He is over there.\" Shina said pointing at a little boy. <br>\r\n\"Okay let's go.\" Haruto said. He then walked up to the boy. \"Excuse me.\" Haruto said to get his attention. \"Are you the one that insulted my sister here?\" Haruto asked.<br>\r\nThe boy turned to face Haruto. The kid looks to be sucking the tip of his left thumb. He then looked to Shina. \"Loser.\" He said pointing to Shina with his right index finger.<br>\r\n\"Why you, let me at him.\" Shina said as she charged at the boy. The boy just jumped up and then pushed off her back, knocking her to the ground.<br>\r\n\"Shina, you okay?\" Haruto asked.<br>\r\n\"Yeah Loser did I hurt you?\" Asked the boy.<br>\r\n\"Mine your own business.\" Shina said yelling at the boy.  When she was about to charge again Haruto stopped her. \"Haruto let me go.\"<br>\r\n\"Calm down first Shina.\" Haruto said. He then turned to the boy. \"Who are you here with?\"<br>\r\n\"Itachi.\" Haruto recognized that voice. <br>\r\n\"Akiza, That you?\" Haruto asked.<br>\r\n\"Haruto, why are you here?\" Akiza asked.<br>\r\n\"Sorry I am partly responsible for the commotion.\" Haruto said. \"So this is your baby brother, Itachi.\"<br>\r\n\"Yep.\" Akiza said.<br>\r\nItachi Uchiha<br>\r\nAge: 3-4<br>\r\nRank: Not Ranked.<br>\r\nAppearance: Short black hair, black eyes, black top with dark blue shorts.<br>\r\nVillage: Leaf.<br>\r\n\"So what is the issue?\" Akiza asked.<br>\r\n\"Apparently Itachi had been bad mouthing my sister Shina and the rest of my family.\" Haruto said.<br>\r\n\"Is that true?\" Akiza asked Itachi.<br>\r\n\"No, I did not insult her mom.\" Itachi said.<br>\r\n\"That is still not nice.\" Akiza said.<br>\r\n\"Well while Itachi did insult my family, Shina is to blame too.\" Haruto said.<br>\r\n\"What did I do?\" Shina asked.<br>\r\n\"You still tried to attack him.\" Haruto said.<br>\r\n\"But he\u2026\" Shina tried to say but Haruto gave her a look. She then turned to Itachi. \"Sorry for attacking you.\"<br>\r\n\"You too.\" Akiza said to Itachi.<br>\r\n\"But I only said what I heard dad say.\" Itachi said.<br>\r\n\"Apologize now.\" Akiza said in a strict tone.<br>\r\nItachi then turned to Shina. \"Sorry for insulting you and your family.\" Itachi said.<br>\r\n\"Wow where did that come from?\" Haruto asked half scared.<br>\r\n\"Oh, well I picked it up from my mom.\" Akiza said.<br>\r\n\"Itachi?\" Shina asked him. \"What to play?\"<br>\r\n\"Play? Why?\" Itachi asked.<br>\r\n\"No reason.\" She said with a smile. \"Come on.\" Shina turned to run off but then tripped on her hair again. <br>\r\n\"That happens a lot?\" Itachi asked. \"Why do you grow your hair out if you trip on it?\" <br>\r\n\"I have my reasons, now come on.\" Shina said as she took Itachi's hand and the two ran to play.<br>\r\n\"It is amazing that they can forgive so fast.\" Akiza said.<br>\r\n\"Well I missed Shina as her personality developed but from what I can gather she is someone that let's her emotions get the getter of her.\" Haruto said.<br>\r\n\"Itachi is reserved and thinks before he does something.\" Akiza said. \"They will at least be friends right?\" <br>\r\n\"Only time can tell.\" Haruto said.</span></div></div>",

At this time they were on a ship. \"Kabuto, are we there yet?\" Asked Hebimaru.<br>\r\n\"Almost.\" Kabuto said. They soon came to a good place to make dock. They then got off the boat. With them were ten ninja and two large figures covered head to toe with bandages and raggy cloaks on.<br>\r\n\"So this was the Land of Whirlpools.\" Hebimaru said as he pushed his hood down.<br>\r\n\"Yes, this Land once homed one of the strongest clan of ninja.\" Kabuto said.<br>\r\n\"And we have to search for samples, but there are too old to be usable for the cloning process. So why are we here?\" Hebimaru asked.<br>\r\n\"You will see soon.\" Kabuto said. With that they headed into what remained of the Village Hidden by Whirling Tides. Unknown to them there was something watching them from the shadows.<br>\r\nKabuto, Hebimaru and the ninja they brought with them had been searching without much to speak for it. \"Slim pickings, I know it.\" Hebimaru said. \"Well some are better then nothing.\"<br>\r\n\"You are right.\" Kabuto said. \"But maybe if we also bring Lord Orochimaru the brute that have been watching use since we set foot on the island this trip may not have been much of a waste.\"<br>\r\n\"Agree.\" Hebimaru said. At that Hebimaru disappeared.<br>\r\nFrom is hiding spot. Mar was watching the activities of the individuals that arrived on the island when one of them disappeared. \"Where did he go?\" Mar asked himself.<br>\r\n\"Right here.\" With that Mar turned to block a kick from Hebimaru. Hebimaru then summoned snake and had it strike Mar sending him towards Kabuto.  Mar held the snake's mouth opened and was pushed towards the group. He then jumped back. \"Running away, this is going to be fun.\" Hebimaru said.<br>\r\nMar then made a hand-sign and then the explosion tag attached to the snake went off and destroyed the snake. \"Alright!\" Mar said excited. \"So who will fall to the Blazing Demon next?\" Just then one of the bandaged figures appeared in front of Mar and then slashed Mar across the chest. \"What was that?\" He asked as he saw the figure's arms had blades on them. Before he could reach more The other figure charged in with a hammer like hand and clubbed Mar in the back of the neck. Sending him onto the ground. Hebimaru then launched another swarm of snakes that bond around Mar. <br>\r\n\"See, I have the handle of this.\" Hebimaru said to Kabuto.<br>\r\n\"You think so.\" Mar said. With that Mar managed to get one of his hands loose and then sent chakra into his hand and then as if out of nowhere, explosives came flying towards them.<br>\r\n\"What the?\" Hebimaru said. The explosives soon hit and destroyed the land and allowed Mar to escape. <br>\r\n\"You can come out I know you would not have been killed that easily.\" Mar said. <br>\r\nWith that both Kabuto, Hebimaru, and the other ninja appear out from the ground. \"That was interesting.\" Hebimaru said. \"So you have sent up a launcher that you can activate using your chakra.\" With that Hebimaru charged in and then attacked. <br>\r\nMar went to block but then Hebimaru pulled back his punch. \"A feint.\" Mar said as a kick was coming in. He then moved to block that but then Hebimaru stopped and then summoned a snake from his mouth and then from the snakes mouth a sword shot out into Mar's shoulder. \"He used two feints in a row and then throw a sword using one of his snakes.\" With that Mar fell back from the force of the sword throw. <br>\r\nHebimaru then appeared over Mar and then took hold of the hilt of his sword. \"So big guy, why are you here?\" Hebimaru asked.<br>\r\n\"You can torture me all you what but I will never speak.\" Mar said.<br>\r\n\"Shut it.\" Hebimaru said as he twisted the blade into Mar's shoulder more. Mar winced but did not scream. \"Oh a tough guy, me like.\" Hebimaru then continued to twist the blade. He then took the blade out just to thrust it elsewhere and twist again. This went on for ten minutes and still Mar did not speak. \"My you take pain well.\" He then lifted his sword. \"Since you are not talking I guess I am done with you, you now what that means?\"<br>\r\n\"Letting me go.\" Mar asked.<br>\r\n\"Nice try.\" Hebimaru was about to delivered one final slash when he got attacked and sent back. \"What did that?\" He was shocked to see a raccoon hissing at him. \"You got be kidding me?\" Hebimaru said.<br>\r\nJust then Jiriyu appeared. He had move Mar to the side of the battle field. \"You okay bud?\"<br>\r\n\"Do I look okay, it took all my strength not to tell them where our base was just to stop him from talking.\" Mar said.<br>\r\nJiriyu then spoke to Byo thru the radio. \"I got Mar and is ready when you are.\" Jiriyu said. \"Well you just stay here and recover.\" Jiriyu then took out a canteen of water and drenched Mar with it. <br>\r\n\"Water Style: River Joining the Sea.\" Byo said from the base. With that the water spread around Mar's wounds and then the wounds started to heal.<br>\r\n\"A Medical Ninjutsu using water as a base, this guys would be trouble.\" Kabuto said. \"That is if we didn't already have all this samples to use. Ten less would not matter.\"<br>\r\n\"I hope you were not planning to use this.\" Jiriyu said as he appeared behind Kabuto. He turned to attack but Jiriyu dodged out of the way. It was then that he saw that the ten ninja with them were an the ground dead.  <br>\r\n\"How did he do this without a single sound?\" Kabuto asked himself in aw. Just then he took a kunai out but he had already been hit by Jiriyu's blade. <br>\r\n\"Smarts right.\" Jiriyu said. He then lifted his right arm and then extended a side blade and blocked the incoming blade arm figure's attack and then using the pole of his naginata to deflect the hammer armed figures attack and pin it to the ground. The bladed arm one continued to attack but Jiriyu blocked with side blade and then pushed it back. He then stabbed the pole of the naginata into the hammer armed one's wrist and then detached the top of it and, using it like a sword, clashed with Hebimaru. <br>\r\n\"Your skills with that arm and that naginata are interesting to say the least.\" Hebimaru said.<br>\r\n\"You honor me.\" Jiriyu said. \"Lightning Style: Static Surge.\" With that Hebimaru got shocked and then jumped back to avoid serious damage.<br>\r\nThe Hammer Armed one got free and then it and the Blade armed one transformed into monstrous forms and then were about to attack but then they both got cut straight through their centers. \"Tis tis tis, look at yourselves laying down on the job. How unprofessional are you two?\" Asked a man wearing a blood red mask.<br>\r\n\"Who are you?\" Asked Kabuto.<br>\r\n\"Who am I, Who am I, WHO AM I? That is a good question. Who am I again?\" The newcomer asked himself out-loud. He then reached into a pocket and pulled out a battle axe. He throw it aside and reached into another and pulled out a broad sword. He throw it aside. He reached into pocket after pocket, pulling out everything he saw. He then took his clothes, leaving him wearing boxers with chibi on them, but still nothing. He then reached into his mask and then pulled out a small business card. \"My sweat must have ruined my name but at least I have a name to use.\"<br>\r\n???<br>\r\nCodename: The Crimson Maniac.<br>\r\nAge: Unknown.<br>\r\nRank: Unknown.<br>\r\nAppearance: Blood red and black full face mask, bright blue eyes, Red and black short sleeve top with a fishnet under shirt and long pants covered with pockets, Black gloves, two swords on his back.<br>\r\nVillage:  Freelance.<br>\r\n\"So The Crimson Manic, cool.\" He said as he had mystically gotten redressed. \" Well time to have some fun.\" He then looked to see the village in ruin. \"It has been a while. There was a party and man, I am so fashionably late I missed to entire thing.\" He said pouting. \"Now I have to blow off some steam.\" He then charged at Jiriyu. Jiriyu then swung his blade but The Crimson Maniac clashed and repeated that.  He then throw kunai at him but they missed.<br>\r\n\"You missed.\" Jiriyu said. <br>\r\nThen the Kunai started to come back to The Crimson Manic and hit Jiriyu from behind as The Crimson Manic caught them and put them back in his pockets. The Crimson Manic then slashed and Jiriyu was sent back.<br>\r\n\"Can You believe that I did it mama, I did it.\" The Crimson Manic said. Just then Jiriyu charged at The Crimson Manic with his Super Lightning Dragon Fist, piercing his body.<br>\r\n\"I am sorry I had to do this.\" Jiriyu said.<br>\r\n\"That tickled.\" The Crimson Manic said shocking Jiriyu. <br>\r\n\"This is bad.\" Mar said from the sidelines as he ordered a volley of explosives onto the Crimson Manic. Jiriyu got free and landed next to Mar.<br>\r\n\"You did good.\" Jiriyu said.<br>\r\n\"That was good indeed.\" The Crimson Manic said just as he stabbed both Jiriyu and Mar and then draw his swords out of them. \"That was so\u2026\" He was interrupted when A snake come up from below and swallowed him up. The Snake then Rushed to Hebimaru. \"This will make a greater prize.\" Hebimaru said as he and Kabuto made there way out of there.<br>\r\n\"Jiriyu, Mar you fine?\" Byo asked.<br>\r\n\"Yeah, lucky your medical jutsu was still in effect.\" Jiriyu said.<br>\r\n\"Well What do we do?\" Byo asked.<br>\r\n\"We do the one thing that we never should do.\" Jiriyu said. </span></div></div>",

He ended by telling him about the sudden arrival of the individual that called himself the Crimson Maniac. \"So where is this Crimson Maniac?\" Orochimaru asked.<br>\r\n\"Hebimaru has him trapped in one of his snakes and is trying to find out about the secret of his immortality.\" Kabuto said.<br>\r\n\"Well let's go see how he is doing.\" Orochimaru said as he headed for Hebimaru's lab. Once there they saw that the floor was littered with the bodies of his men. \"What happened here?\" Asked Orochimaru.<br>\r\n\"Oh milord. Sorry for the mess.\" Hebimaru said as he appeared with his left arm missing.<br>\r\n\"What happened to you?\" Orochimaru asked.<br>\r\n\"Our guest some how forced me to summon the snake I was storing him in and then did all this.\" Hebimaru said.<br>\r\n\"I thought he was sedated?\" Orochimaru asked.<br>\r\n\"He was, I gave it to him myself.\" Kabuto said.<br>\r\n\"And it worked.\" Hebimaru said as he steeped aside to show the Crimson Maniac with his arms shackled to the wall and his eyes closed. \"He did all of this while asleep.\" Hebimaru said as he shed his body to a new one with both arms interact. \"Much better.\" Hebimaru said.<br>\r\n\"So I assume you don't have any thing about our guest.\" Kabuto said.<br>\r\n\"That is were you are wrong.\" Hebimaru said. \"As he was attacking I was able to analyze how he did not die.\"<br>\r\n\"Really then please explain.\"  Kabuto asked.<br>\r\n\"Very well.\" Hebimaru then went on to say. \"Apparently you were not the only one that experimented with DNA manipulation, someone must have transferred Uzumaki DNA into him this alone allowed him to have a long life span and live from fatal blows. The damage it self seems to be healed by some Medical Ninjutsu before much blood is lost so.\" <br>\r\n\"Impressive Hebimaru.\" Orochimaru said to his clone. \"Anything else?\"<br>\r\n\"Just that he is a skilled fighter.\" Hebimaru said.<br>\r\n\"Well let's just question him to see if we can get any more information from him.\" Orochimaru then ordered one of his men to inject their guest with something to woke him up.<br>\r\nThe Crimson Maniac's eyes shot open the moment the shot was made and then he activated a device and a blade shot from the tip of his shoe and then used it to slit the throat of the ninja that gave him the injection. \"Man what a rush.\" He then tried to move his arms. \"What did I do late night?\" He said in a drowsy voice.<br>\r\n\"Good you are up.\" Orochimaru said. \"I am Orochimaru and you must be The Crimson Maniac.\"<br>\r\n\"Oh hey there, it is great to see you. I would shake your hand before cutting it off if my hands were not chained.\" He said. \"He then looked around frantic. \"Where are they? Where are my babies.\" He then saw his swords on the table and then tried to get free. \"Stupid chains.\" He then kicked up trying to hit the chains but he missed and hit his wrist. \"Well when you got lemons\u2026\" He then moved his foot and cut his hand off. \"One down.\" He then cut his other hand off. He then ran to the table and picked his swords up with his stubs of hands and then hugged them and stabbed himself with them in the process. \"Sorry girls, I was tied up.\" He then pushed his mask up enough that his lower mouth was sawed but he took hold of one of his swords and throw it with his mouth and it head straight for Orochimaru and it hit him. He then charged at Orochimaru. <br>\r\n\"Lord Orochimaru, watch out.\" One of his men said as he and several others stepped followed to guard their master. <br>\r\nThe Crimson Maniac then took his other sword in his mouth and started forward and slashed the ninja with the sword and his shoe blade, killing all of them. He was about to slash Orochimaru when he suddenly froze. \"What is this\u2026\" He asked out-loud. \"Why can't I kill you?\"<br>\r\n\"When in your night killing, I managed to place a genjutsu order on you.\" Hebimaru stated. <br>\r\n\"What type of order?\" He asked.<br>\r\n\"Nothing much, just that you are forbidden to kill Lord Orochimaru.\" Hebimaru said.<br>\r\n\"What the?\" He then took the sword that he was holding it in his mouth and then throw it and it happened to pierce a surviving ninja, killing him. \"I can't believe you did this to me, the great\u2026 oops almost gave you my real name.\" He said as he pulled his mask down. \"What do you what from me?\" He asked as he turned to the wall he was chained to and then tried to place his hands back on his wrists. \"That is better.\" He then looked at them. \"That is not right.\" He said as he look to his right hand and saw it was his left hand. He then chopped it off and then looked at it to find it was a right foot from one of the dead guards. \"That is not it either.\"<br>\r\n\"Sorry to interrupt but to answer your question, the way you heal and lived being destroyed.\" Hebimaru said as he noticed the Crimson Maniac trying to strangle him.<br>\r\n\"Why can't I kill you?\" He asked.<br>\r\n\"I am a genetic clone of Orochimaru so you can't kill me either.\" Hebimaru said.<br>\r\n\"Then I will kill glasses over there?\" He said as he charged for Kabuto with his swords in hand.<br>\r\n\"No you will not.\" With that the Crimson Maniac stopped. \"I made it that those high in Orochimaru's forces can't be killed by you.\"<br>\r\n\"This is so\u2026\" He then throw his swords to the ground but one pierced his foot. <br>\r\n\"Well, since you can't kill use then why not answer one question for me?\" Hebimaru asked.<br>\r\n\"You can have two and you already used the first one.\" He said.<br>\r\n\"Okay, I found that you survive wounds from your healing ability and you lived a long time from the Uzumaki DNA, but here is the real question.\" Hebimaru started.<br>\r\n\"And, go on and ask it you have my full attention.\" He said while he was trying to launch an arrow with a high grade explosive tag attached to it.<br>\r\n\"How do you live so long with out food?\" At this The Crimson Maniac let go of the string of the bow but shot it to the ceiling above him and then the ceiling fell on him. <br>\r\n\"You okay?\" Hebimaru asked.<br>\r\n\"One or two, which question do you what the answer to?\" He asked from under the rubble. <br>\r\n\"One.\" Hebimaru said<br>\r\n\"Shot me the bad way.\" He said. \"Alright just give me a second.\" With that The Crimson Maniac crawled out of the rubble and then stood up and as he started to heal he answered the question. \"I don't really know, I just don't eat much.\" He said while chewing under his mask and handling a giant roll of meat and a table of assorted foods in front of him. \"Needs salt.\" He the reached into a pocket and pulled a salt shaker and sprinkled the salt on his meat. <br>\r\n\"What do you say?\" Orochimaru asked Hebimaru.<br>\r\n\"Well looks like he knows nothing about his own abilities so it would be hard to recreate them.\" Hebimaru said. \"And by the looks of it we can't keep him complacent without letting him kill our forces.\"<br>\r\n\"What you mean as long as it is not you three snakes in the grass I can kill to my heart's content?\" The Crimson Maniac said. \"I have it the Jackpot.\" He then started to run off but then his head was cut off. He looked up to see Akagetsu was the one the did it. <br>\r\n\"Hey what is with the red masked freak?\" He asked.<br>\r\n\"You are one to talk.\"  The disembodied head said.<br>\r\n\"So you still live, cool.\" Akagetsu said.<br>\r\n\"Is that so.\" The head said as his body got up and slashed Akagetsu but he turned into water. \"You are no fun.\" He said as his body picked his head up and placed it back on his neck.<br>\r\n\"Well what do we do with him?\" Kabuto asked.<br>\r\nOrochimaru then walked up to him and then started to speak. \"You are going to work for me.\"<br>\r\n\"Okay.\" The Crimson Maniac said.<br>\r\n\"Good, but calling you The Crimson Maniac is too much of a mouth full so I will give you a new name.\" Orochimaru said. \"Until you tell use or we find out your name you will be referred to by Shinku.\"<br>\r\n\"Shinku, I like that name.\" He said.<br>\r\nShinku<br>\r\nCodename: The Crimson Maniac.<br>\r\nAge: Unknown.<br>\r\nRank: Unknown.<br>\r\nAppearance: Blood red and black full face mask, bright blue eyes, Red and black short sleeve top with a fishnet under shirt and long pants covered with pockets, Black gloves, two swords on his back.<br>\r\nVillage:  Freelance. Working for Orochimaru's Army.<br>\r\n\"Good, now I wish to see what you really can do.\" Orochimaru said as he lead Shinku to a underground battle field and then sent in thousands of highly skilled creations that make up his forces.<br>\r\nKabuto then turned towards Hebimaru and asked. \"Are you sure it was a good idea not to simply leave him where we found him?\" <br>\r\n\"He would have found us anyway so way fight it.\" Hebimaru said. \"You better go and tend to Lord Orochimaru's wound.\" With that Kabuto left. <br>\r\nAkagetsu then walked up to Hebimaru and asked. \"Why do you insist an playing the fool around them?\"<br>\r\nHebimaru then trust his restored hand and took hold of Akagetsu's neck. \"The more I act the role of the loyal servant the more room I am given to do my experiments.\" He then squeezed so tight that Akagetsu had to turn to water to get free. \"Now leave me, I have work to do.\" With that Akagetsu left the room and Hebimaru turned his attention to a giant tube that had a black haired boy that looked four years old floating in a strange fluid. \"Now moving on to the next stage.\" With that Hebimaru activated a device that sent a current of electricity into the tube and then the child's eyes opened to reveal two fully formed Sharigan. \"Good now to start.\" Hebimaru then turned monitors on, each showing either a recording or a live battle or training session. \"This will get you stronger, Katsu.\" With that Hebimaru left the lab.</span></div></div>",

When another volley came at them they all dodged and tried to get to cover. They got to cover behind some trees. <br>\r\n\"What is going on?\" Reichi asked.<br>\r\n\"I don't know.\" Kenta said. He then lifted his glasses and then activated his Byakugan. \"Two of them. One in the tree a meter in front of us. Oh now the other one was just there and now is gone.\" Just then a figure in a blue hooded cloak jumped down and charged at them. They each took a kunai but the figure them lift his right arm and then a blade came out from the side. He used it to force back the genin and to cut the straps of the scrolls. The genin managed to land and were ready to attack but then the other one, a big figure in a brown hooded cloak, jumped in to fight. With one punch he sent all three back. \"This is bad.\" Kenta said to himself. \"They both took too much from that punch. I have only one option.\" Kenta then got up and stared at the two bandits. \"Anezi, Reichi, can you two run?\" They both gave a nod. \"Then grab one of the scrolls and get out of here as fast as you can.\"<br>\r\n\"Right.\" They both said as they did that but the blue cloaked one jumped in front of them and then lift his right arm up and then launched a smoke bomb. <br>\r\n\"Where is he?\" Asked Reichi. <br>\r\nJust then the two of them got knocked out. Kenta saw both knocked out as the smoke cleared. \"Anezi! Reichi!\" Kenta said as he charged towards the Blue cloaked bandit. The brown cloaked bandit stepped in front of Kenta but he delivered a palm thrust and the brown cloaked bandit bent over in pain. Kenta then charged in and started to attack the blue cloaked bandit but he blocked his attack with his right arm and then delivered a kick to send Kenta back but he took hold of the bandit's leg. The bandit then throw Kenta off his leg with the force of a kick and sent him into a nearby tree.<br>\r\n\"You have spunk.\" The bandit said. He then picked up one of the scrolls and his partner picked up the other three and they were off.<br>\r\nKenta got up and checked on his teammates. \" Anezi, Reichi, you okay?\" He asked as he woke them up.<br>\r\n\"Did we get them?\" Anezi asked.<br>\r\n\"Not exactly, We better get back to the village.\" With that He took each teammate under one of his arms and then helped them back to the village. Once they got back to the village Kenta headed to his dad to inform him about the ambush.<br>\r\n\"I am glad that you and your team made it back in one piece.\" Naruto said. <br>\r\nJust then Haruto bursted into his dad's office and Akiza followed after him. \"Sorry to intrude but I heard what happened.\" He turned to Kenta. \"You okay?\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah I am fine.\" Kenta said.<br>\r\n\"If only we could find where they are?\" Haruto said.<br>\r\n\"Actually we can.\" Kenta said. \"I managed to mark one with a tracking device.\"<br>\r\n\"I am going after them.\" Haruto said. \"Don't try and stop me.\"<br>\r\n\"I won't.\" Naruto then turned to Akiza. \"Go with him Akiza.\"<br>\r\n\"Right.\" She responded. With that the two of them depart from the village in search of the bandits. Oh route Akiza asked Haruto. \"Haruto, what is this tracking device Kenta spoke of?\"<br>\r\n\"It is simply a tag that has the chakra of the one that placed it on the person.\" Haruto explained.<br>\r\n\"Well how can you sense the chakra?\" Akiza asked.<br>\r\n\"This chakra crystal reacts to the chakra in the tag and is drawn to it.\" Haruto said raising his wrist to reveal a crystal on a string.<br>\r\n\"So this how you will find them.\" Akiza said. They are now approaching the bandit's hideout. <br>\r\nMeanwhile in the hideout. \"That kid was skilled, I can't believe he did so well.\" Said the one with the brown cloak. \"Are you done yet with the scrolls?\"<br>\r\n\"I already broke the seal, I just was just thinking about something.\" The blue cloaked bandit said. \"The why that one genin fought seemed familiar.\" Just then there was a noise. \"What is that?\" The two bandit's then went to check the source of the noise.<br>\r\nJust then Haruto and Akiza snuck into the hideout and started looking for the scrolls with the weapons in them. \"Any sign of the scrolls?\" Akiza asked.<br>\r\nHaruto was looking through the walls with his Byakugan. \"I think I found them.\" Haruto said as he opened a door and they entered a room and the scrolls were on the table.\" Akiza ran to them but then Haruto spoke up. \"Akiza watch out.\" Haruto then took a kunai and then throw it as it intersected incoming senbons heading for Akiza.<br>\r\n\"Thanks.\" She said. <br>\r\n\"You're welcome.\" Haruto said. \"Who's there?\" Just then something came flying towards them. \"Get down.\"  Haruto said as he got near Akiza and pushed her to the ground to avoid what was coming at them. It then started to spin and headed back for them. The two Leaf ninja then dodged it it then spun around and hovered letting out a mist of water. <br>\r\n\"Water.\" Akiza said wondering. <br>\r\n\"Water Style: Mouth of the Serpent.\" Said a female voice out of no where and then the water droplets gathered together and formed into two water snakes that started to chase them. <br>\r\n\"I will not stand this.\" Akiza said. \"Haruto brace yourself. Fire Style: Warmth of the Sun Goddess.\" Akiza then formed flames around her fist and then punched the ground releasing a wave of heat that evaporated the water snakes and they disappeared.<br>\r\n\"Ten o'clock.\" Haruto said.<br>\r\n\"Right, Wrath of the Sun Goddess.\" Akiza then punched with her flaming hand and then launched a spiral of Flames at where Haruto told her to. A woman moved out of the way as she jumped off the high ledge. The object from before came to her and attached to a pack on her back and then launched a blast of steam as she jet out of the hideout. \"After her.\" Akiza said as she headed after her.<br>\r\n\"She never learns.\" Haruto said. \"Part of the reason I love her.\" He then picked up the scrolls and then carried them as he chased after Akiza. <br>\r\nOnce outside the hideout the brown cloaked figure came down towards Akiza. \"Thunder Slam.\" He was about the attack when.<br>\r\n\"Dramatic Entry.\" Someone then kicked the brown cloaked figure, sending him aside.<br>\r\n\"Tai, what are you doing hear?\" Akiza asked. <br>\r\n\"I happened to be returning from my mission when I heard of the attack on young Kenta's team, I know that Haruto would not let this go and you would be with him.\" Tai said. \"I will protect you with my life if I need to.\" Just then the blue cloaked figure appeared ready to strike with a naginata. Tai then turned around with his swords in hand and blocked and parried the attack.  \"Nice try.\" Tai said but then noticed that his arm was cut. He then way the blade that was from is puppet arm.<br>\r\nThe blue figure then charged in and struck Tai until he got close enough and placed his right hand to Tai's back. \"Static Surge.\" Tai was then shocked and forced to take a knee. The Blue cloaked figure then came at him but Tai slashed at him and forced him to go back. He then took his blade and blacked an incoming attack from Haruto with a kunai while he was holding all four scrolls. Haruto then let go of the kunai and jumped back and launched a kunai at the Blue Cloaked figure. The Blue Cloaked figure dodged but his hood got caught and then the two pick up a blade and charged at each other. Just as their blades came inches from each other the Blue Cloaked figure's hood slid back and revealed that it was Jiriyu of the Tanuki Gang.  \"So we meet again, thief.\" Haruto said. \"Safe to assume the other two are your partners.\"<br>\r\n\"As sharp as ever.\" Jiriyu said. \"But that is not important at this time, I have some information for the Leaf Village.\" <br>\r\n\"What information could you have?\" Haruto asked.<br>\r\nJiriyu then throw something to Haruto. \"I got that off a ninja we encounter.\" <br>\r\n\"This is a Sound Headband.\" Haruto said. \"Where did you get this?\"<br>\r\n\"A ninja that came to the area we were using as our hideout.\" Jiriyu said.<br>\r\n\"Tell me everything that you need to say?\" Haruto said.<br>\r\n\"I rather talk directly with the Hokage.\" Jiriyu said.<br>\r\n\"I can arrange that.\" Haruto said. \"But I will take time for use to get there.\"<br>\r\n\"Not a problem.\" Mar said as he got up and then summoned the Carriage. \"All aboard.\" </span></div></div>",

I want to thank him for taking my arm.\" Jiriyu said.<br>\r\n\"What is the information?\" Naruto asked.<br>\r\n\"You are not thinking of complying to this thieves demands are you?\" Asked Haruto.<br>\r\n\"Haruto that is enough.\" Naruto said. \"Now please speak Jiriyu.\"<br>\r\n\"Very well.\" Jiriyu then reached into his pouch and pulled out a photograph. \"They have a powerful new player.\"<br>\r\nNaruto picked the photo up and show the image of a man in a red mask with two swords. \"How did you get this picture?\"<br>\r\n\"Byo made camera that connects to her system.\" Jiriyu said. \"She just took a shot of the video feed. But that is not important, what is, is the fact that this guy has a strange ability to heal himself even from a fatal wound.\"<br>\r\n\"How can you say that for sure?\" They turned to see that Homura Mitokado and Koharu Utatane, two members of the village Council and advisers of the past Hokage walk in.<br>\r\n\"Not you two again.\" Naruto said. \"Why are you bring you two here?\"<br>\r\n\"Is it true you were going to give a simple thief the run of the village?\" Koharu asked. \"How do we even know his claim is true, It could be him in disguise.\" <br>\r\n\"We must place him and his cohorts into custody until we can verify this information.\" Homura said. With that the guards entered and grabbed Jiriyu. <br>\r\n\"Stop.\" Naruto said. \"Granny Tsunade did not like your interference and neither do I. However I have to agree, unless he can give use more.\"<br>\r\n\"There is, the reason I know that this man could be a new addition to Orochimaru's forces is because a small group of ninja just outside the village where we were staying at in our Safe-House.\" Jiriyu said. \"They were collecting soil samples and old discorded kunai and shuriken.\"<br>\r\n\"It is possible that they were trying to gather material for cloning.\" Haruto thought to himself.<br>\r\n\"Still not enough.\" Koharu said.<br>\r\n\"There is more.\" Jiriyu said. \"Our safe house is in the Former Land of Whirlpools.\" Hearing this shocked both the elders.<br>\r\n\"Why were you there?\" Naruto asked.<br>\r\n\"The land was abandoned and had no evidence that anyone would be trying to restore the government there so it is a perfect place to hideout.\" Jiriyu said.<br>\r\n\"Let him go.\" Naruto said. The guards did that. \"What do you two know about this red masked man.\" He asked the elders.<br>\r\n\"We don't need to stay here and be questioned. We did nothing\u2026\" Koharu started to say but Naruto interrupt. <br>\r\n\"I will only ask nice once and that was it.\" Naruto said.<br>\r\n\"Very well.\" Koharu said. \"We don't know much, there were those who used Uzumaki DNA to try and became immortal.\"<br>\r\n\"That is enough I get it.\" Naruto said. \"Now leave.\" They did that. \"Now we have more to worry about.\" Naruto said.<br>\r\n\"We should send a small team to search out there base.\" Haruto said.<br>\r\n\"Even I would agree to that how could we find him.\" Naruto asked.<br>\r\n\"This village does have the Inuzuka clan and their ninja hounds, if they have a scent they could find were they are.\" Jiriyu said.<br>\r\n\"We have been doing that using scents from the remains from each of our encounters.\" Haruto said.<br>\r\n\"Well I have something that could help.\" Jiriyu then look out a plastic bag that had a glove in it. \"I never told you how I know he has a massive healing ability, I used the Super Lightning Dragon Fist and pierced him and then Mar blow him up but he healed himself from nothing.\" <br>\r\n\"So his blood would be on this glove.\" Naruto said. \"I just hope it works. As for you, I will have to think about your requests. For now you and your friends will be placed under guard until I decide other wise.\" <br>\r\n\"Okay.\" With that Jiriyu started to leave but stopped and said. \"Just so you know, we could escape and rob you all of everything and you would not be the wiser.\" With that he was taken away.<br>\r\n\"What is wrong with you Haruto?\" Naruto asked.<br>\r\n\"It's nothing, I just confused.\" Haruto said.<br>\r\n\"Confused about what?\" Naruto asked.<br>\r\n\"He is a thief, one that seems to also be adept in killing but.\"<br>\r\n\"But what?\" Asked Naruto.<br>\r\n\"I sense that he can be trusted. I don't know what to do?\" Haruto said. <br>\r\n\"He came all this why with important information which could be of use.\" Naruto said. \"You look tried, go rest.\" <br>\r\n\"Right.\" Haruto said as he left but not to rest but to do some research.</span></div></div>",

He then added. \"Unless I ask you to come in.\"<br>\r\n\"You are just as a buzz kill as Kabuto.\" He said. <br>\r\n\"Are you here because you are bored or is there a reason?\" Hebimaru asked.<br>\r\n\"A little of both.\" Shinku said as he was playing with a test tube. \"Kabuto had asked me to come to get you for something and to meet him in Orochimaru's private lab.\"<br>\r\n\"Okay, I'm going.\" Hebimaru said as he placed the chemicals away and headed out the door. Just as he left Shinku dropped the test tube. \"Oh and be careful that vial contained a Oxygen-reactive acid.\" <br>\r\nShinku then looked to the floor and saw as hit was eating away at the floor. \"Oh\u2026\" Shinku then fell through the floor.<br>\r\nMeanwhile at outside Orochimaru's Lab, Orochimaru and Kabuto were waiting outside for Hebimaru. \"You summoned me?\" Hebimaru asked.<br>\r\n\"Yes, please enter.\" Orochimaru said. Once inside there saw that there was a giant tree root system. Near the top there was a tube that contained someone.<br>\r\n\"What is this place?\" Hebimaru asked.<br>\r\n\"This is how I am able to reborn myself with out searching out for strong ninja as often.\" Orochimaru said.<br>\r\n\"I see.\" Hebimaru said. \"So he used cells of the First Hokage to recreate the Zetsu clones and use them as bodies.\" Hebimaru then asked. \"I don't see why I am here?\"<br>\r\nWith that Orochimaru then activated the device and from the roots formed three Zetsu-like clones. \"That looks so gross. And I have seen things that would kill normal people.\" Shinku said as he appeared out of nowhere.<br>\r\nOrochimaru then said. \"Hebimaru I wish for you to modify this three using the Sage Transformation technique.\"<br>\r\n\"Okay.\" Hebimaru then took out a syringe and a vial. He then injected the contents of the vial into the three. \"I'm done.\" <br>\r\n\"That is good.\" Orochimaru said as he then charged at Hebimaru, who dodged and summoned a snake to ready itself to strangle Orochimaru.<br>\r\n\"Lord Orochimaru.\" Kabuto said and was about to intervene but then Shinki stabbed Kabuto. <br>\r\n\"As long as it is no a killing blow I can still attack.\" Shinki said.<br>\r\n\"So I was right, you were hiding in plain sight.\" Orochimaru said.<br>\r\n\"Guess so, what gave me away?\" Hebimaru said.<br>\r\n\"I had my suspicions from day one but that serum was the last straw.\" Orochimaru said.<br>\r\n\"Well then  what are we going to do?\" Hebimaru asked.<br>\r\n\"So me what you are able to do.\" Orochimaru said<br>\r\n\"As you wish.\" Hebimaru then let Orochimaru go and walked over to the three Zetsu clones. \"Summoning Jutsu: Impure World Reincarnation.\" At that the seal formula was formed and then three ninja were revived. \"So want to put them to have a test run?\"<br>\r\nBack in the Leaf Village we find the Tanuki Gang in their room and Mar was getting impatient. \"What is taking them so long?\"<br>\r\n\"Relax Mar, I am antsy to but we have to wait.\" Jiriyu said.<br>\r\n\"Well at least we are not in cells.\" Byo said.<br>\r\n\"That is all good and all but with out your computer you are not able to continue you search.\" Mar said.<br>\r\n\"That is a low blow Mar.\" Jiriyu said.<br>\r\n\"Sorry Bio.\" Mar said.<br>\r\n\"That is okay, we are just a little bit antsy.\" Byo said.<br>\r\nMeanwhile at a small village on the border of the Land of Fire and Land of Rice Fields (Land of Sound). Shinku and Hebimaru were making their way to to village. The two stopped a top a hill over looking the village. \"Okay, remember the plan.\" Hebimaru said to Shinku.<br>\r\n\"Right.\" Shinku said as he ran into the village. Once he got there he then stopped in the center of said village. \"Okay, What was the plan?\" Shinku asked himself. He then looked to his right hand. \"Ham, eggs, Milk wait that is my grocery list.\" He then looked to his left hand. \"Take scroll marked with the word Sound on it.\" Shinku did that. \"Place scroll on ground in front of you.\" He did that. \"Unroll scroll.\" He did that. \"Perform hand-signs to release what is in scroll.\" He then did the hand-signs. At that from the scroll shot out ten of Orochimaru's men, each had a camera. \"Okay get into position.\" They each got into position.<br>\r\n\"Now that the camera's are in place\u2026 Summoning Jutsu.\" With that he summoned three coffins appeared before him. They opened to reveal the three ninja he revived. <br>\r\n\"What is this?\" One of the revived asked.<br>\r\n\"You three are lucky, Lord Orochimaru has decided to give you three a rare second chance.\" Hebimaru asked. \"But you first must prove yourselves by killing everyone in that village.\"<br>\r\n\"With pleasure.\" Another of the revived said.<br>\r\n\"Good find a man with a red mask and he will give you your tools.\" Hebimaru said and the three of them left to the village.<br>\r\nA few hours later in the Hidden Leaf,  Naruto was in his office when one of the chunin ran into his office. \"Lord Hokage, a village located at the bounder with the Land of Rice Fields is under attack. One of them was a individual that matches the description of the masked man.\" <br>\r\n\"Send Team Konahamaru to deal with this.\" Naruto said. <br>\r\n\"Okay but Konahamaru Sabutobi is out on another mission.\" The chunin said. \"Who should we send as a forth.\" <br>\r\n\"I will handle this.\" Naruto said.</span></div></div>",

When they arrived they looked around for survivors. \"Looks like their are no survivors.\" Naruto said.<br>\r\nJust then kunai came flying towards them. They dodged them. \"I missed.\" They looked to see the man with the red mask. \"I guess I have to use something bigger.\" He then picked up a giant kunai that had explosive tags attached to the blade. \"Here it goes.\" He then throw it at them. <br>\r\nNaruto then jumped in front of the kunai and then performed hand-signs and then held his hand up and then the kunai turned around and come flying back at the man. \"This is going to\u2026\" He got caught in the explosion. They then went to were the explosion went off.\" Just as they arrived they saw that the body was reforming and healing. \"\u2026hurt\" He said as his head finished reforming.<br>\r\n\"So the story is true you can heal yourself.\" Naruto said.<br>\r\n\"So who told you that? It was the one armed man wasn't it.\" He said.<br>\r\n\"What my I call you?\" Naruto asked.<br>\r\n\"I am the Crimson Maniac, but the big snake calls me Shinku.\" He said. \"I guess that you are the current Hokage. Shame that you are just a shadow clone.\"<br>\r\n\"Well if I left the village without an escort of at least two top Jonin the council would go crazy.\" The Naruto clone said.<br>\r\n\"Well you are lucky, the little snake told me that I can't kill you because he needs something from at least two of you.\" Shinku said. \"Also that I take no pleasure in killing girls. Ok course I will if I must.\"<br>\r\n\"Small Snake, Hebimaru. Where is he?\" Haruto ordered him to tell.<br>\r\n\"Calm yourself.\" Naruto said.<br>\r\n\"Yeah, he was on the hill looking over the village last time I saw him.\" Shinku said.<br>\r\n\"What!\" Haruto was about to rocket off but then Ryousake stopped him. \"Ryousake what is wrong with you?\"<br>\r\n\"Hebimaru is not the type of person to fight himself if he has a tool to use.\" Ryousake started to say. \"Shinku is too random for him to be usable as a tool. Which means that the others that were with him are his preferred tools.\" <br>\r\n\"Very smart of you.\" Same a voice as Hebimaru appeared before them.<br>\r\n\"Coward, not showing your self to use your self, The Hokage has a reason but you.\"<br>\r\n\"Well I am not exactly doing nothing.\" Hebimaru said. He then performed hand-signs and three coffins shot up. <br>\r\n\"This jutsu it's the Impure World Reincarnation.\" Naruto was about to perform hand-signs but then Shinku appeared and slashed him and  but Naruto struck at him sending him back. \"This is bad. Listen to me, hold what ever comes out as long as you can.\" With that the clone disappeared.<br>\r\n\"I can't fight myself since I wish to see them in action and I wish that you two keep out of this.\" Hebimaru said to Shinku.<br>\r\n\"Okay.\" Shinku said. \"I just wish that I was able to do more killing.\" He said to himself.<br>\r\nWith that the three coffins opened. Out stepped three preteens, two boys and one girl. \"They are so young.\" Haruto said.<br>\r\n\"But look at the headbands they are wearing.\" Kei said. \"They were ninja loyal to Orochimaru.\"<br>\r\n\"Tell me who are they?\" Ryousake asked Hebimaru.<br>\r\n\"They are ninja that were used by Lord Orochimaru to attack the Leaf many years ago.\" Hebimaru said.<br>\r\n\"Dosu\u2026\" The one with the bandaged face looke up. \"\u2026Zaku\u2026\" The one with spiked hair looked up. \"\u2026Kin\u2026\" The girl looked up. \"Ready yourselves.\"<br>\r\nDosu Kinuta<br>\r\nAge: Deceased (14)<br>\r\nRank: Genin.<br>\r\nAppearance: bandages covering most of his face, leaving only his left eye uncovered. He also wore a large poncho with long sleeves, a snake patterned scarf around his neck, a straw raincoat protruding from the back of his scarf, and a large amplifier on his right arm for most of his attacks. His back was hunched, which makes him look smaller than he actually is.<br>\r\nVillage: Sound.<br>\r\nZaku Abumi<br>\r\nAge: Deceased (14)<br>\r\nRank:Genin. <br>\r\nAppearance: spiky, dark hair and dark eyes. He wore a beige shirt with two black stripes and three prints of the kanji for death down the front. His forehead protector had an attached happuri under the cloth rather than connected to the metal plate, he wore a snake patterned scarf around his neck.<br>\r\nVillage: Sound.<br>\r\nKin Tsuchi<br>\r\nAge: Deceased (14)<br>\r\nRank: Genin.<br>\r\nAppearance: very long black hair, almost reaching down to the ground, tied by a violet ribbon right near the end, and black eyes. wears a forehead protector, a pale green vest somehow similar to a flak jacket, and snake patterned pants and scarf.<br>\r\nVillage: Sound.<br>\r\n\"Remember they are resurrected ninja so even if you can talk them out of attacking they can have they emotions shut off and attack anyway.\" Ryousake said.<br>\r\n\"Got it.\" Both said.<br>\r\n\"I am to guess you are the leader of this group.\" Dosu said.<br>\r\n\"Good I know just to kill.\" Zaku said. Just then his arms went up and he then launched a Decapitating Airwaves attack.<br>\r\n\"Dodge it.\" With that Haruto, Ryousake, and Kei dodged the attack. Just then Kin appeared behind Ryousake and Dosu behind Haruto. They each took hold of their respective ninja. <br>\r\n\"What is going on?\" Asked Kin. Just then she and Dosu blow up.<br>\r\n\"What the what happened?\" Zaku asked.<br>\r\n\"Relax.\" Hebimaru said. \"As resurrected ninja you can recover from anything so even if you blow up you will form yourself back.<br>\r\n\"That is good to now but why them?\" Zaku then was forced to aim for a descending Kei. Just then Zaku's arms get slashed off. \"Who did that?\" He then looked to see Ryousake. \"But you and your teammate blow up.\"<br>\r\n\"That is where you are wrong.\" Haruto said as he finished sending a strike to destroy the clone of Hebimaru. At this Zaku felt control of his arms returning. \"Now!\"<br>\r\n\"Right.\" Ryousake then performed hand-signs and launched a fire ball at Zaku then destroyed him.\" <br>\r\nHaruto then applied a sealing tag. \"That is one down.\" Just then the seal melted. \"What happened?\"<br>\r\n\"Too bad you did not know that this three are made from special stuff.\" Shinku said. <br>\r\n\"Well I am not giving up.\" Just then a reformed Dosu charged and tried to punch Haruto. Haruto kept his distance. Kei was fighting off Kin.<br>\r\n\"I guess I will have to fight you, Zaku right.\" Ryousake said.<br>\r\n\"Then you are in trouble since I am clearly the most valued on of us.\" Zaku said as he readied his attack but Ryousake got close and then punched Zaku sending him back.<br>\r\n\"That guy is strong and looks familiar.\" Dosu said. Just then he got hit and his right side started to fade in color.<br>\r\n\"There with out that arm you are no threat.\" Haruto said.<br>\r\n\"Ninja Art: Super Beast Scroll.\" Kei then tied Kin with ink snakes. \"Too easy. Know let's see if I can get some information from you.\"<br>\r\n\"You are a fool there is no way you can do that.\" Kin said.<br>\r\n\"We will See.\" With that Kei entered Kin's mind.<br>\r\nIn Kin's mind. \"Here it is new memories.\" Kei then touched and scanned the memories. \"Interesting.\"  She then left. <br>\r\nOutside Kin's mind. \"So That is the story.\"<br>\r\n\"This is just so much fun to watch.\" Shinku said. \"Just wish I could get involved.\" He then looked to his side to see a black snake. \"Hi.\" The snake then jumped into Shinku's mask and then down into his mouth. \"What was that?\"<br>\r\nJust then Zaku got up and placed his hands up. \"What is this, Why am I using that technique at this time?\" He then used Extreme Decapitating Airwaves and leveled the area and then three coffins appeared and closed up on the three sound ninja. Soon after that Shinku was swallowed by a giant snake. <br>\r\nHaruto and Ryousake had managed to protect themselves and Kei. \"Do you sense them.\" Ryousake asked Haruto.<br>\r\n\"No, They got away.\" He said.<br>\r\n\"We have to get back to the village and so I could tell them the information I have gotten.\" Kei said. They then returned to the village. Once there Kei reported what she had seen. \"Apparently Orochimaru has managed to recreate the process of creating clones from The First Hokage's cells so to strenthen the body he uses to be immortal.\"<br>\r\n\"I expected as much.\" Naruto said. \"Jiriyu, you can come out now.\" <br>\r\nWith that Jiriyu jumped down. \"So what is your say of this matter?\"<br>\r\n\"You will set up a Safe-house outside the village and will have an Anbu presence, You are to inform us of any information you find understood.\" Naruto said.<br>\r\n\"Yes and while I am against the babysitter I will not deny it.\" Jiriyu said. With that he was off.<br>\r\n\"Now as for you three, I think you need some time off.\" Naruto said.<br>\r\n\"Alright.\" They said. With that they left.</span></div></div>",

Okay there was this one time at a party but that was it... I think that it was.\" Shinku said.<br>\r\n\"By doing that you will be able to access the three Resurrected ninja with out me having to be there.\" Hebimaru said. \"Also You can act as an antenna for me.\" He said to himself.<br>\r\n\"Well fine, I guess it is too late to change what was done so I will stop... What is that?\" Shinku asked as he ran over to the tube.<br>\r\n\"In this tube is one of my personal projects.\" Hebimaru said.<br>\r\n\"Yeah well what is it?\" Shinku asked.<br>\r\n\"A Bi-genetic Clone.\" Hebimaru said. Shinku then looked confused. Hebimaru then explained. \"A genetic clone like myself has the DNA of one person, but in here is a clone made of two genetic samples.\"<br>\r\n\"Is that so?\" Hebimaru turned around to find Kabuto at the doorway. \"So this is what you used Sasuke's DNA for.\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah it is.\" Hebimaru said.<br>\r\n\"Good work, he will make a good prototype for Orochimaru's new body.\" Kabuto said. <br>\r\n\"Sorry to disappoint you but he is not for that.\" Hebimaru said.<br>\r\n\"Then it is a was of resources.\" Kabuto said as he throw a kunai and hit a tube of a chemical. \"Can't stop me and the chemicals at the same time.\" Kabuto said as he headed for the controls for the Tube with the Bi-Clone in it. \"Say good bye.\" Just as he was about to activate the switch the tube broke and then the bi-clone jumped out and then took hold of Kabuto's arm.<br>\r\nThe clone then squeezed Kabuto's arm. \"Katsu, let him go please.\" Hebimaru said after stopping to leak of the chemicals.<br>\r\n\"Whatever.\" The clone, named Katsu let go of Kabuto. <br>\r\n\"Interesting, I need to do some test on you first.\" Hebimaru said as he lead the clone to give it a examination.\" <br>\r\nMeanwhile back in the Leaf, Team Seven was enjoying it's time off. They decided to spend the first day together. They were each in civilian clothes. Haruto was wearing a gray tee shirt with the Uzumaki Swirl on the front with red pants. Ryousake was wearing a long sleeve white shirt with a black jacket with the Uchiha crest on the back and a pair of dark blue pants. Kei was wearing a black top with short tan sleeves and a grey skirt that reached down to her knees and her hair was down. The three of them were laying on the ground in the shade of a big tree. \"Man it is so relaxing to just sit back and let your mind wander once in a while.\" Haruto said.<br>\r\n\"Just don't forget we may be relaxing now but we should still have our minds sharp just in case.\" Ryousake said.<br>\r\n\"Says the man how has his shoes off with his eyes closed.\" Kei said.<br>\r\n\"Kei your ability for tack has never changed.\" Ryousake said. <br>\r\nJust then they heard a commotion. They then went to find out what it was. They then saw Shina Uzumaki and Itachi Uchiha fighting each other. Haruto and Ryousake jumped in and took hold of there respective sibling. \"Okay Shina what is it this time?\" Haruto asked.<br>\r\n\"It is not what you think Haruto.\" Shina said.<br>\r\n\"She is right.\" Itachi said with his thumb in his mouth. \"We were having a play fight.\"<br>\r\n\"Why are you two doing that?\" Ryousake asked.<br>\r\n\"It does have to be with an ongoing argument we have been having.\" Shina said. \"I say that I am a better fighter then he is.\"<br>\r\n\"How does the two of you fighting solve that?\" Haruto asked. \"The two of you are around the some age so how can this prove if you are better or not?\"<br>\r\n\"Now don't be too quick to judge.\" Ryousake said. \"After all they may be young but they do come from top stock.\"<br>\r\n\"Top stock?\" Shina and Itachi said wondering what they were talking about.<br>\r\n\"Let's see what this two can do?\" Ryousake said.<br>\r\n\"How are they going to do that?\" Haruto asked.<br>\r\n\"Well since this two are still willing to fight then why not let them and just have a referee.\" Kei said.<br>\r\n\"That sounds like a good idea.\" Haruto said.<br>\r\n\"Right, Kei do your best.\" Ryousake said.<br>\r\n\"Me, why?\" Kei asked.<br>\r\n\"If me or Haruto do it we can't be impartial.\" Ryousake said.<br>\r\n\"Okay.\" Kei said. \"Are you two ready for this?\"<br>\r\n\"Bring it on.\" Shina then walked over but then tripped on her hair again. \"I am still ready to go.\"<br>\r\n\"Are you ready?\" Kei asked Itachi and he gave a nod and stepped up. \"Okay, ready and go.\" <br>\r\nShina started by charging with a palm thrust ready. When she got close she thrust but Itachi dodged. \"Again.\" Shina said as she turned and charged again but Itachi dodged again. \"This is hard.\" Shina then tried to kick but Itachi blocked it with his left arm. \"Got you.\" Shina then jumped and used her other leg to try to kick Itachi's head but Itachi pushed Shina's leg and then jumped back.\" Shina then got caught in her her. \"Hey!\"<br>\r\n\"Sorry Shina, but that is what you get for having such long hair and that size.\" Itachi said.<br>\r\n\"Why you.\" Shina said as she then got herself untangled and then charged at Itachi. She then attacked his right side. He caught the attack and saw it was her right hand. \"Got you.\" She then head-butt Itachi causing him to let go. <br>\r\n\"That hurt.\" Itachi said as he was rubbing his forehead and tearing. \"How did that not hurt you too?\"<br>\r\n\"Well, It is said that Uzumaki are hard headed.\" Shina said. <br>\r\n\"Why you.\" Itachi said as he took his thumb out of his mouth. He then ran forward and punched at Shina. She sidestepped but Itachi then kicked Shina but she blocked it.<br>\r\nShe then pushed back and then the two got ready to attack again but then Kei spoke up. \"Okay that is enough you two.\" <br>\r\n\"Why did you stop use, we were just getting started.\" Shina said.<br>\r\n\"That may be but I think that enough has been seen. You two are even.\" Kei said.<br>\r\n\"Alright.\" Shina said.<br>\r\n\"I can agree to that.\" Itachi said as he started to suck his thumb again.<br>\r\n\"Now you two remember you two are the children of strong ninja so what you each learn can be very dangerous so be careful.\" Kei said.<br>\r\n\"Okay.\" They both said.<br>\r\n\"Good. Now go and play nicely.\" Kei said.<br>\r\n\"Well know that that is dealt with let us get back to our rest.\" Haruto then laid back down and the other soon joined him.</span></div></div>",

The five down here are those how have both survived the process and has showed mastery of this new skills.\" Hebimaru said.<br>\r\n\"How deadly are they?\" Orochimaru asked.<br>\r\n\"Very.\" Hebimaru said.<br>\r\n\"They will be of use but for now continue increasing my forces.\" Orochimaru said.<br>\r\n\"Ok course.\" Hebimaru said. With that Orochimaru left. \"Foolish old man.\" He said.<br>\r\nIn the Leaf Village Haruto was called into the Hokage's office when there he saw someone else there with his dad. \"Oh Granny Tsunade, hey there.\" Haruto said.<br>\r\nTsunade<br>\r\nAge: 74 (looks in her late 30s).<br>\r\nRank: Hokage (Retired)<br>\r\nAppearance: brown eyes and straight, blonde hair waist-length with shoulder-length bangs framing both sides of her face that ties her hair into two loose ponytails, wears a grass-green haori with the kanji for gamble written in black on the back, inside a red circle. Underneath she wears a grey, kimono-style blouse with no sleeves, held closed by a broad, dark bluish-grey obi that matches her pants, blouse is closed quite low.<br>\r\nVillage: Leaf.<br>\r\n\"Your dad would call me that.\" Tsunade said. \"At least from you it sounds appropriate.\"<br>\r\n\"If I may ask, why are you here?\" Haruto asked.<br>\r\n\"Well you see, I have noticed your interest in seals.\" Naruto said. \"In fact the only thing that could take you away from training you body was studying seals. In fact, if I am not mistaken you have already mastered several sealing techniques.\" <br>\r\n\"Well I do my best.\" Haruto said.<br>\r\n\"And that best is a lot.\" Naruto said. <br>\r\n\"Haruto, you should understand that Orochimaru is likely to use Resurrected Ninja.\" Tsunade said. \"Because of that ninja with sealing jutsu are to be of use. But from what Naruto told me of what your team reported, normal seals are not useful.\" <br>\r\n\"Then what are we to do?\" Haruto asked. Just then The rest of his team entered the room.<br>\r\n\"So what is the mission?\" Konohamaru asked.<br>\r\n\"Okay, ready yourselves you are heading to the Land of Whirlpools, more pacific the site of the Village Hidden in the Whirling Tides.\" Naruto said.<br>\r\n\"Right.\" They said. With that they were off.<br>\r\n\"I hope they will be okay.\" Tsunade said.<br>\r\n\"So do I.\" Naruto said.<br>\r\nTeam Konohamaru made their way to the Land of Whirlpool. They were currently on a boat there. \"So what do you know of the Land of Whirlpool sensei?\" Kei asked.<br>\r\n\"Not much, I was there only once and that was with Naruto.\" Konohamaru said.<br>\r\n\"Well we are about to see for ourselves.\" Haruto said.<br>\r\nWhen they arrived they headed for the village. Once there they saw how massive the village was destroyed. \"So where do we start?\" Ryousake asked.<br>\r\n\"Split into teams and we met up at the temple at sundown.\" Konohamaru said.<br>\r\n\"Right.\" They said before they split up.<br>\r\nHaruto and Ryousake:<br>\r\nHaruto and Ryousake were searching what looked to be what remained of a library. \"Look at all this damage.\" Haruto said. <br>\r\n\"I heard that the Uzumaki clan was powerful but to do this to a village because of one clan, it is just so sad.\" Ryousake said. \"What if the Leaf was attacked because of the Uchiha?\"<br>\r\n\"Ryousake, calm yourself.\" Haruto said.<br>\r\n\"Your right, Haruto.\" Ryousake said.<br>\r\nKonohamaru and Kei:<br>\r\nMeanwhile Konohamaru and Kei were looking through what looked like there village's Ninja Academy. \"Looks like the education system was similar to the Leaf's.\" Kei said.<br>\r\n\"Well the Uzumaki founded this village and are a distant relation of the Senju Clan so it does make sense that some of the systems were the same.\" Konohamaru said. <br>\r\nThe groups finished collecting what they could find and met up again at the Temple. They then reviewed what they found. \"I didn't expect to find this much stuff here.\" Konohamaru said.<br>\r\n\"Yeah, that is what I don't understand.\" Ryousake said. \"Whoever did this would have destroyed the knowledge that made the Uzumaki so feared so why is there so much of it.\" <br>\r\n\"You are over thinking things.\" Konohamaru said. Just then Haruto got up. \"Where are you going?\"<br>\r\n\"I need some fresh air.\" Haruto said as he headed outside. <br>\r\n\"Something on your mind?\" Kei asked.<br>\r\n\"Yeah, it is seeing all this destruction. It is getting to me.\" Haruto said. \"Also I saw where Orochimaru's forces dug up the remains and the thought of how many have died here makes me sick.\"<br>\r\n\"Death is a part of war.\" Kei said.<br>\r\n\"I know that.\" Haruto said. \"But the amount of it and not just one clan but an entire village.\" Haruto then took a deep breath. \"Lets go back inside.\"With that they went back inside and got some rest. </span></div></div>",

The three met up with there boss. \"We have stolen the scrolls from the Leaf ninja as you have ordered.\" said the First of the group.<br>\r\n\"You are all fools, They let you take the scrolls.\" Their boss said.<br>\r\n\"What do you mean boss?\" The first one asked. <br>\r\nTheir boss then punched the air and then created a shockwave that caused the Leaf Ninja to scatter. \"So he found us.\" Konohamaru said. \"Who are you.\"<br>\r\n\"Hyao is the name.\" He said. Hyao is a low built man with dark green hair and black eyes wearing purple pants and armbands as well as a cloak. \"You are Konohamaru Sabutobi and they are your team. You all are going to die.\" <br>\r\n\"Is that so?\" Konohamaru asked. \"And how is that going to happen.\"<br>\r\n\"Boys get into position.\" With that the three men that took the scrolls stepped forward. \"Sound off.\"<br>\r\n\"Worenu.\" Said one of them. He had spiked black hair and had a dark yellow top and black pants. On his arms were a set of three blades as claws.<br>\r\n\"Sabura.\" Said the second one. He was bulky and long blond hair.\" He was dressed in a raggy brown jacket and pants.<br>\r\n\"Jurena.\" The third one said. He is a giant with short red hair. He wear a rusty brown tang top and pants. On his hands are red bands.<br>\r\n\"It does not matter who they are because they are going down.\" Konohamaru said.<br>\r\n\"You have that reversed.\" With that Jurena charged straight for them. <br>\r\nThey jumped out of the way and then throw kunai and shuriken towards him but when it hit they bounced off him. \"What the?\" Konohamaru said. With that Haruto took out smoke bombs and used them so they could try and retreat to regroup.<br>\r\nWorenu and Sabura then sniffed the air. They then ran and flushed the Leaf Ninja out of there hiding place. \"Those two smelled us out.\" Haruto said. <br>\r\n\"Now die.\" Worenu said as swiped his claw but then Kei intersected it with her sword.<br>\r\n\"Sorry but dying is not part of my plans.\" Kei said as she parried the claw and then slashed him but he then started to heal. \"I can handle him.\" She said.<br>\r\n\"Yeah well what about me?\" Sabura said as he swiped with is hand.<br>\r\nRyousake then blocked the attack. \"I am your opponent.\" He said with his Sharigan active.<br>\r\n\"It does not matter who you fight you will all be killed.\" Hyao said. Just then Konohamaru then appeared behind him and kicked Hyao to one side.<br>\r\n\"Good one?\" Haruto said but then Jurena charged for him again. Haruto managed to get out of the way but Jurena then grabbed his leg and then held him to his chest as he crashed into a tree.\" He backed off and Haruto fell to the ground. <br>\r\nJurena then picked Haruto up by the head. \"Puny Ninja.\" He then slammed him into another tree. <br>\r\nHaruto coughed out blood and then spoke up. \"Jurena, shouldn't you or your teammates be worried about your boss, even if it is as far as your meal ticket.\"<br>\r\n\"Two things that you should know before I kill you, one is that we may work together but I could care less about the others and I know that they feel the same.\" Jurena said.<br>\r\nElsewhere Kei was doing her best to fend off Worenu's attack and trying to fine a why to stop him even with his healing abilities. \"Now Ninja Art: Super Beast Scroll.\" With that Kei draw thousands of birds that flew up and then dived at speeds fast enough to slash at Worenu. But the wounds healed and he continued his attack.<br>\r\nMeanwhile Ryousake was fighting on even terms with Sabura in terms of taijutsu. He then Used fire jutsu. \"Fire Style: Phoenix Flower Jutsu.\" With that he shot flaming shuriken at Sabura. This sent him back but he got up and continued the attack.<br>\r\n\"See.\" Jurena said.<br>\r\n\"Good to know.\" Haruto said as he disappeared into a puff a smoke.<br>\r\n\"What!\" Jurena said.<br>\r\nHaruto then charged at him from behind and with him were thousands of clones. \"Take this. Big Ball Rasengan.\" With that the thousands of Harutos thrust there Rasengans into the giant and the explosion trapped Jurena. Haruto then touched Jurena and his body went numb. <br>\r\n\"Why can't I move?\" He asked.<br>\r\n\"I am skilled in the Gentle Fist art, therefore I am able to seal your chakra points, I sealed enough that your arms and legs can't support you.\" Haruto said. <br>\r\nBack with Kei. \"Give it up girly, You can't beat me.\" Worenu was about to strike but then Kei made a hand sign and then he stabbed himself with his claws. \"What is happening?\" Just then Ink snakes appeared and pulled him to a nearby tree.<br>\r\n\"I use mind ninjutsu so it was easy to take over your mind.\" Kei said. \"Now I am going to sever every muscle in your body.\" She then used Chakra scalpel to do so. \"I am sure that if you had the chance you could break out of this even with the amount of damage you have to heal but, not if you are out cold.\" Kei then placed a hand on Worenu's head and he passed out.<br>\r\nWith Ryousake. \"I will kill you.\" Sabura said as he charged at Ryousake.<br>\r\n\"I made an observation, you heal like your friend Worenu.\" Ryousake said.<br>\r\n\"We are not Friends.\" Sabura said but then he felt himself getting pieced by something. He looks to find that it was a blade made of lighting chakra.<br>\r\n\"But it is much slower of a healing ability.\" Ryousake said.<br>\r\n\"This will do nothing, Even with this type of wound I can still fight you.\" Sabura said. <br>\r\n\"I am aware of that.\" Ryousake's eyes then changed into a stronger form, the Mangekyo Sharingan. He then used a genjutsu and placed Sabura under.<br>\r\nBack with Haruto. \"By the way, what is the other reason that you and the others are not worried about your boss?\"<br>\r\n\"Because he is stronger then he appears.\" As Jurena said that Hyao got up and then took his cloak off revealing a network of tubes that lead from his back into his arms and legs. Hyao then pressed a button and then a liquid was sent from the back into his body and he started to change. <br>\r\nHe got taller and bulkier. His skin started to turn a gray hue finally his eyes turned into green in color. Then with a single punched sent Konohamaru flying. His three students jumped and caught him. \"You okay?\" Kei asked.\"I am fine.\" Konohamaru said. \"But what is going on with him?\"<br>\r\n\"Arrrr, who dears to face me?\" Hyao shouted.<br>\r\n\"He seems to be using a synthetic version of Sage Transformation.\" Haruto said.<br>\r\n\"How do you know that?\" Kei asked.<br>\r\n\"Because I have something similar but I would need time to use it.\" Haruto said.<br>\r\n\"Then we will give you the time needed.\" Konahamaru said knowing what Haruto is talking about.<br>\r\n\"Right, let's do it.\" Ryousake said as he got ready to attack.<br>\r\n\"Right.\" Kei said.<br>\r\n\"Okay, hold him off as long as you can.\" Haruto said as he sat cross legged.<br>\r\n\"Diiieee!\" Hyao then jumped and readied to attack but Konohamaru throw shuriken. <br>\r\n\"Shadow Shuriken Clone Jutsu.\" With that the shuriken he had thrown multipied. They hit Hyao causing him to stop his attack but he did not give in. He then let out a roar and then charged and them again. He then punched the ground but Ryousake punched the ground to cancel the shockwave. Ryousake then looked up and used Amaterasu to set Hyao on fire with black flames. Hyao the let a roar out and the flames where pushed away from his body. He then charged in. <br>\r\nKei then used Mind Transfer Jutsu. \"Hurry, I don't think I can hold him for long.\" Kei said in Hyao's body.\" The stress then got to Kei and she returned to her body. \"Oh no.\" She said when she returned to her body.\"<br>\r\nHyao then charged and pushed everyone aside and then went to punch Haruto but he then caught the punch. \"What is happening?\" He asked.<br>\r\nHaruto then looked at him to reveal his eyes have changed. They are now a light yellow color and his pupil were slited. Around his eyes were readish-orange marks. \"What happened to Haruto?\" Kei asked.<br>\r\n\"Haruto has entered Sage Mode.\" Konohamaru said.<br>\r\n\"Sage Mode I hear of that.\" Ryousake said as he deactivate his Mangekyo Sharingan and then closed his eyes. \"I trust that Haruto will win.\"<br>\r\n\"He will win.\" Jei said. \"He has to.\"<br>\r\n\"Die.\" Hyao said as he was about to stike but Haruto used a Palm thrust and sent Hyao back and he crashed into a tree. \"I will Kill you.\"<br>\r\n\"I guess I have no other choice.\" Haruto said.<br>\r\n\"I will take care of this.\" Ryousake said when he manipulated the flames to bind Hyao.<br>\r\n\"Let go red-eyed man.\" Hyao said. <br>\r\nHaruto then lift his hand over his head and then created a giant rasengan with blades on it. \" Sage Art: Wind Style: Wind Ranshuriken.\" With that he throw it at Hyao. Hyao broke free of the flames but was hit by the Wind Ranshuriken. It expand and Hyao feel to the ground and transormed back to his weaker state.<br>\r\n\"Are you okay?\" Kei asked Haruto.<br>\r\n\"I am fine.\" He said. \"Check on Hyao, we may be able to get information from him.\"<br>\r\n\"Right.\" Kei said.<br>\r\n\"What is with you Ryousake?\" Haruto asked him why his eyes were closed.<br>\r\n\"The Mangekyo Sharingan causes strain on the user's eyes so I am resting them until I can get them looked at.\" Ryousake said.<br>\r\n\"Well it looks like we have gathered all we could and looks like our friends here has found more for us.\" Haruto said. With that they gathered the scrolls and then left to return to the Leaf Village with their prisoners.</span></div></div>",

Just then he noticed Akagetsu and Kiira. Kiira was dragging two coffins behind him and the two were heading into for Hebimaru's Lab. <br>\r\n\"What are they up to?\" Kabuto asked. With that he and Orochimaru headed for Hebimaru's lab. \"Hebimaru, what are you up to now?\"<br>\r\n\"This is my buisness.\" Hebimaru said. \"I assure you that my plans are for the good of Orochimaru.\"<br>\r\n\"Is that so?\" Orochimaru said. \"How is that?\"<br>\r\n\"I am creating a new soldier of course.\" Hebimaru said. He then opened one of the coffins and abstract DNA from it. \"First I need to see if the DNA is salvageable.\" He said to himself. \"I Need to be left alone.\" Hebimaru said as he went to work.<br>\r\nOrochimaru and Kabuto left Hebimaru's lab. \"What is that boy up to?\" Orochimaru asked.<br>\r\nThe next day in the Leaf Village, Haruto and his team were called into the Hokage's office. Once there they say the other Leaf ninja from there year plus Koga and his team and their sensei. \"Good now that the last of the teams have arrived it is time for me to lay out the mission.\" Naruto said.<br>\r\n\"This must be a big mission to have four teams to complete it.\" Konohamaru said.<br>\r\n\"That it is.\" Naruto stated. \"I have received word of the location of several of Orochimaru's bases. That is way so many teams are needed.\"<br>\r\n\"So where are they?\" Koga asked. <br>\r\n\"Relax Koga.\" His sensei, Kenwaru Takanobi. He is a jonin ninja with long brown hair wearing a trench coat with black pants and a fishnet shirt.<br>\r\n\"Sorry sensei but I am just so pumped, Right Kinmaru.\" Koga said and Kinmaru gave an growl in agreement.<br>\r\n\"He is right Koga, you need to relax.\" Sechida said.<br>\r\n\"As I was saying.\" Naruto said. \"Now you are to go and meet with the contact that informed us about this bases.\" <br>\r\n\"So We are to met with the contact and they will inform us of the location of the bases then we will split up and infiltrate the bases?\" Nareki Yuki asked. <br>\r\nNareki Yuki<br>\r\nAge: 20<br>\r\nRank: Jonin.<br>\r\nAppearance: Long straight black hair in a pony tail, red eyes, headband around forehead, black sleeveless top with a short fishnet sleeve. under a green jonin vest and black pants.<br>\r\nVillage: Leaf.<br>\r\n\"Nareki it is not that easy.\" Konohamaru said.<br>\r\n\"I am aware of that.\" Nareki said. \"Konohamaru stop treating me like a child.\" She said to herself.<br>\r\n\"As I was saying, the contact is at a inn called the Blue Rose.\" Naruto said. \"Now move out.\" With that they left for the Blue Rose.<br>\r\nA week later the group arrived at the Blue Rose inn. They all then entered the inn and looked for the contact. As soon as the last of them entered the door closed behind them. \"What is going on here?\" Asked Koga. With that they each got into attack mode.<br>\r\n\"Relax Leaf ninja, this was done for privicy.\" They looked up to see who it was the spoke up.<br>\r\n\"Jiriyu.\" Konohamaru said. \"Are you the contact?\"<br>\r\n\"Yes and no.\" Jiriyu said. \"It was myself and my gang that found the locations. Have you forgotten that we are acting as agents of the Leaf.\"<br>\r\n\"Before we speak there is a question I have for you.\" Shikato asked. \"Why did you ask to meet here?\" <br>\r\n\"The Blue Rose has sentimental memories for me.\" Jiriyu said. \"But that is not important. What is important is what we found.\" Jiriyu said as he made his way down the stairs and then placed a map on a table. \"Around this village there is one main base that acts as a prison and four outpost that are used as labs. Including my gang we can have each team infiltrate and destroy one of the bases.\" He said.<br>\r\n\"That is a good idea.\" Konohamaru said. \"But from what I understand each of our teams have four members and yours has only three.\"<br>\r\n\"Nuki is one of use but I understand what you mean.\" Jiriyu said.<br>\r\n\"Well that is not too much a problem.\" Said the owner of the inn.<br>\r\n\"And who are you?\" Asked Kenwaru.<br>\r\n\"People just call me Sir.\" He said. This Sir had raggy purple hair and beard and is wearing red bandana around his forehead, a brown vest and white shirt with brown pants. <br>\r\n\"Well Sir, we thank you for the use of your establishment.\" Konohamaru said.<br>\r\n\"It is not a problem at all.\" Sir said as he moved out from behind the front desk with a walking stick in hand with a pinkish stone on the top. \"Friends of little Jiriyu are friends to me.\"<br>\r\n\"Sir, you don't call me that with guest around.\" Jiriyu asked. <br>\r\n\"Were are the other members of your gang?\" Haruto asked Jiriyu.<br>\r\n\"Nuki is here and there, as for Mar he is working on the carriage and Byo is doing last minute research to help use.\" Jiriyu said. \"You all must be tired, let me show you to your rooms.\" He then lead them to their rooms.<br>\r\nLater that night, Konohamaru was up to keep a watch when Sir approached him. \"You are tired youngster, you should be resting too.\" Sir said.<br>\r\n\"I guess you could be right.\" Konohamaru asked. \"Sir, answer me something. Why do you help thieves? Is it because you are their teacher?\"<br>\r\n\"I would expect nothing less from Hiruzen's grandson.\" Sir said.<br>\r\n\"So you know my grandfather.\" Konohamaru said.<br>\r\n\"Reputation only.\" Sir said.<br>\r\n\"So why did are you teaching others to steal, you clearly are not profiting from this so why?\" Konohamaru asked.<br>\r\n\"Tell me, the young Jonin is your cousin right and the daughter of Asuma Sabutobi?\" Sir asked and took Konohamaru's silence as confirmation to his question. \"Well I am to Jiriyu as whoever it was that acted as her father figure to her. Well it is getting late and I am old.\" With that Sir left to bed.<br>\r\nThe next day the five groups headed for their designated base. <br>\r\nMain base: Team Konohamaru.<br>\r\nLab 1: Team Nareki.<br>\r\nLab 2: Team Hanta.<br>\r\nLab 3: Team Kenwaru.<br>\r\nLab 4: Tanuki Gang.</span></div></div>",

They looked through them. \"This are all Physical tests.\" Hanta said. \"That is strange.\"<br>\r\n\"What is it sensei?\" Asked Saisemaru.<br>\r\n\"This records show that there was a high level of improvement in the abilities of the ninja involved.\" Hanta said.<br>\r\n\"These much improvement in such a short time at once is dangerous not just for the Leaf, but to the ninja themselves.\" Akiza said. <br>\r\n\"You are right but it looks like their has been a steady flow on how the ninja are proceeding after the increase.\" Tai said. <br>\r\n\"How could this possible?\" Akiza asked.<br>\r\n\"That is part of the reason we are here.\" Hanta said. With that they continued their search.<br>\r\nLab 3:<br>\r\nKenwaru was leading his team through the lab but they stopped when Koga and Kinmaru smelled something. \"That smell, it the smell of decay.\" Koga said.<br>\r\n\"You are right.\" Ayashi said. He then used his Byakugan. \"There seems to be remains all around.\"<br>\r\n\"Some of the kills are fresh.\" Sechida said. \"My beetles detects the fresh kill.\"<br>\r\n\"Well I don't sense a living thing but us.\" Kenwaru said. \"We better hurry and see if we can find anything before whatever did this arrives.\" With that they searched on.<br>\r\nLab 4:<br>\r\nThe Tanuki gang had infiltrated the Lab with ease. They knocked out and tied up three guards and took there clothes so they can move around with little detection. They soon found one of the labs and Byo then hacked into the computers to get information on what Orochimaru was doing here. \"This place seems to have various chemicals that are in use. They seems to be where they synthetics the Sage Transformation Serum.\" Byo said.<br>\r\n\"We Should destroy this place.\" Mar said.<br>\r\n\"No.\" Jiriyu said. \"We need to cause a panic so attention is not focused on their prison base.\"<br>\r\n\"I don't get, why are we helping the Leaf?\" Mar asked.<br>\r\n\"I have my reasons.\" Jiriyu said. \"Bio, I suggest you take samples so the Leaf can analyze the chemical to find a way to counter it.\"<br>\r\n\"Right.\" Byo said as she then preceded to retrieve the sample.<br>\r\nMain Base:<br>\r\nKonohamaru and his team made their way into the Prison base. They took out as many of the guards they could and then preceding down and examined the condition of the inmates. \"They all look too far gone to me saved.\" Konohamaru said with a heavy heart.<br>\r\n\"It is sad to say but we should just destroy this place here and now.\" Ryousake said.<br>\r\n\"How should we do it?\" Kei asked.<br>\r\n\"I could use the Nine-tail's chakra to take their lives all at once.\" Haruto said. \"Although this is not what I wish to do.\"<br>\r\n\"Do it.\" Konohamaru said.<br>\r\n\"Okay.\" Haruto then focused his chakra but the moment he summoned the Tailed Beast chakra wood shot up and restricted him. \"What is going on here?\"<br>\r\n\"Looks like someone or something is stopping you from using the Fox's chakra.\" Ryousake said. \"But who did it?\"<br>\r\n\"I can find out.\" Haruto then shut his eyes and then activated Sage Mode. \"I found him.\" He then broke out from the braces and then lead the others to the source of the Wood Ninjutsu. They found there why to a door.<br>\r\n\"Be ready, we could be in for a fight.\" Konohamaru said as they armed themselves and he opened the door.<br>\r\nWhile each of the teams were investigating the bases they were being watched by a far.</span></div></div>",

They entered the room to see a young man with his arms hooked into a pair of shackles that covered his hands and most of his forearms. His feet had a similar device on them. \"Who is here?\" The man asked. He looked up to see his guests. He sees the headbands. \"You are leaf Ninja?\" He asked.<br>\r\n\"Yes we are.\" Konohamaru said.<br>\r\n\"Are you here to kill me?\" He asked. \"If that is what you wish then I fear you have travel here for nothing.\" <br>\r\n\"What do you mean? Are you a reanimated ninja?\" Asked Kei. Just then the man let out a chuckle. \"What's so funny?\"<br>\r\n\"It is what you said. I am not a reanimated ninja but I am guilty of something much worse.\" He said.<br>\r\n\"And that would be?\" Konohamaru asked.<br>\r\n\"I am how Orochimaru is still alive.\" He said.<br>\r\n\"How is that possible?\" Konohamaru asked.<br>\r\n\"You are a clone of the First Hokage aren't you?\" Haruto asked.<br>\r\n\"You are partly right, The cells of Hashirama Senju where used in the process but they are not what made the majority of my body.\" The man said. \"The majority of my body was created by cloning a young genin who died many years ago. Orochimaru then abstracted DNA from me and my 'brothers' to make clones to use as body replacements.\"<br>\r\n\"What is your name?\" Ryousake asked. \"It is only right to know if you have a name.\"<br>\r\n\"I have been called Morimaru.\" The man said.<br>\r\nMorimaru<br>\r\nAge: 17-18.<br>\r\nRank: Chuunin.<br>\r\nAppearance: Long light brown hair with black streaks, dark eyes, wearing raggy top and pants.<br>\r\nVillage: Orochimaru Army.<br>\r\n\"Well Morimaru, while killing you would be one option, you seem to be more cooperative then other clones I have seen, and the fact you are a clone aside, we are not going to kill you.\" Konohamaru said.<br>\r\n\"I could tell that you are not the type of people that would attack an unarmed man but that is not why I said you will not be able to kill me.\" Morimaru said.<br>\r\n\"Stop being so negative.\" Haruto said as he cut down Morimaru. \"Wood did not rise up this time.\"  He said to himself.<br>\r\n\"Well If you are not going to kill me then take advantage of this and put the others down.\"  Morimaru said. \"The shackle forced my Wood chakra to react to Tailed Beast Chakra.\"<br>\r\n\"You know a lot.

Just then they head something.<br>\r\n\"What is that sound?\" Saisemaru asked.<br>\r\nThey soon got there answer. A creature made it's way towards them. Spirit Jackal: pointed ears, blue and black fur with dark red paws, yellow fur and chest and tail, black dreads. It had a pack on it's back.<br>\r\n\"What does it want with us?\" Akiza asked. The creature then placed the pack aside before moving forward and then took a stance and readied itself to battle.<br>\r\n\"We will take care of this thing sensei, you break the barrier.\" Tai said.<br>\r\n\"Okay.\" And Hanta then went to work on the barrier.<br>\r\nLab 3:<br>\r\nKenwaru and his team were examining the source of the sound heard by Kinmaru when something came over Kenwaru, Koga, Ayashi, and even Kinmaru. \"What is this, My legs just got weak.\" Koga said as Kinmaru was laying on his side.<br>\r\n\"And why is it that Sechida not effected.\" Ayashi said.<br>\r\nJust then something came out from the corner.

The pheromones this thing has been using has not only disabled her team but the male insects inside her have been sluggish against this thing. \"This thing is effecting all males human, canine, and insect. There must be something that I can do to beat this thing.\" She said. She then managed to get up close and was going to incase the creature in insects but then the creature shot flames from one of it's head jaws and destroyed them. The jaws then crunched onto Sechida. She got away but her jacket was torn. She took it off to reveal that under her coat she had on a loose fitting bright red and yellow top. The creature then charged both jaws and was about to attack with a ball of light. \"There must be something I can do.\"<br>\r\nLab 2:<br>\r\nTai and Akiza were attacking the creature called Spirit Jackal in taijutsu but it was too fast for them and went he got near to one of them it thrust it's front paw and then released a thrust of chakra. It had done this to Tai but he got out of the away and tried to kick it but the creature blocked the attack and then charged a sphere of chakra and launched at Tai and it hit him sending him back. \"Tai.\" Akiza yelled. Saisemaru then jumped and caught Tai. <br>\r\n\"Thanks bud.\" Tai said.<br>\r\n\"You're welcome.\" Saisemaru said. The creature then appeared at Saisemaru's side and attacked with claws that come out from his front paws. Saisemaru blocked with his blade. \"Tai now\"<br>\r\n\"Right.\" Tai then down his swords and attacked but the creature then summoned claws to his other paw and used them to block and then released chakra from it's hind paws and sent it self into the air and throw the chakra spheres at them and they hit.\" The two managed to evade most of the damage but were still hit by the attack.<br>\r\n\"I will not let you stop us.\" Akiza said as she jumped up and punched the creature and it sent it to the ground.<br>\r\n\"You did it.\" Tai said.<br>\r\n\"Yeah but it's skin it felt like it was steel.\" Akiza said. Just then the Spirit Jackal got up again and it looked tired.<br>\r\n\"Why won't it go down?\" Saisemaru asked.<br>\r\n\"I don't know, but all we have to do is hold him back until sensei is done.\" Tai said. With that the three of them charged in for another attack.<br>\r\nLab 1:<br>\r\nThe Judgement Beast had been attacking Nareki and her team. It has been charging at then and slashing at them. The new Ino-Shika-Cho trio had thought of a plan to stop it. They were putting the plan into action. Chokai attacked it to force the creature into Shikaro's shadow so then Inoko could use Mind-Transfer Jutsu and keep it still long enough for them to get out. Chokai attacked and the beast did jump back but then it's horn glow a black color and then it moved it's head and slashed at Shikaro causing him to undo his jutsu. It then looked at Nareki and then launched at her a Purplish Orb. It hit and did not seem to do anything but she then fell to her knees.<br>\r\n\"Sensei.\" Inoko said as she rushed to her. \"What did that thing do?\"<br>\r\n\"I fell ill but why?\" Nareki asked.<br>\r\n\"We have to get you to safety.\" Shikaro said. With that they throw a smoke bomb and then retreated. They found one of the sleeping quarters of the scientists there. \"Are you feeling better?\" <br>\r\n\"Yeah.\" Nareki said. \"What is that thing and how did it know where to find us.\"<br>\r\n\"If it can find us, then let's make use of that.\" Shikaro said as they put the new plan into action.<br>\r\nMain Base:<br>\r\nTeam Konohamaru have been fighting the Flame Hawk. \"The creature seems to be getting faster the longer we are fighting it.\" Ryousake said. The creature then made a uppercut and sent Ryousake flying. He then used the chance to use a Fire Ball jutsu but went it hit it did little damage.<br>\r\nKonohamaru used his staff to strike at the creature but it slashed and then used a flaming kick and sent Konohamaru back. \"Sensei.\" Kei was about to charge in but then Haruto spoke up.<br>\r\n\"Stay back, It is more important that we get Morimaru to the Leaf.\" Haruto said. <br>\r\n\"Taking me to the Leaf wound not cripple Orochimaru enough, It is not worth it leave me here and get yourselves out of here.\" Morimaru said.<br>\r\n\"I thought I told you to stop being so negative.\" Haruto said. \"You are not just one of Orochimaru's cloning experiments, you are Morimaru.\" Haruto then charged in and used Shadow Clone Jutsu. \"Now let's go.\" With that they then charged at the creature but the creature slashed and punched and then glow and charged at them sending them all back but Haruto and four clones were heading towards the creature each with a Ransengan in hand. The creature was about to kick but then wood pillars shot up and held the leg in place. Then the five Ransengan hit. \"Thanks Morimaru.\"<br>\r\n\"Don't thank me yet.\" He said. \"Blaze Hawk is just out cold.\" <br>\r\n\"Well then...\" Haruto said as his hand was shaking at the thought of killing a defenseless opponent. Just then Ryousake sent a lightning-formed blade throw the creatures skull. <br>\r\n\"There it I shut it's pain receptors down before taken it out.\" Ryousake said. <br>\r\n\"It had to be done.\" Haruto said to himself. \"Morimaru, how strong are the others.\"<br>\r\n\"They are each strong in their own right. But if you have faith in your friends things will work out.\" Morimaru said.<br>\r\n\"Thanks for that.\" Haruto said. <br>\r\n\"The Tailed Beast Chakra, I fear that it has been gathered by collectors and is now it the hands of Orochimaru.\" Morimaru said.<br>\r\n\"That is of little importance.\" Konohamaru said.<br>\r\n\"Right what is important is to find a way to free the others.\" Kei said.<br>\r\n\"There is a way, once the Guard Beast of the base is destroyed the barrier will fade.\" Morimaru said.

Do with is as you please but make sure it does not fall into the Creator's hands.\" <br>\r\nSaisemaru then ran towards the creature and slashed him. \"We will do our best.\" He said and the Spirit Jackal let out a smile. And then it died.<br>\r\n\"So what are we going to do?\" Tai asked.<br>\r\nSaisemaru then picked the pack up and looked in it and then closed it and said. \"We head out of here.\" With that they left.<br>\r\nLab 3:<br>\r\nJust as the attack was about to strike Double Jaws was then attacked by A two headed wolf. \"Koga, Kinmaru?\"<br>\r\n\"We are using the part of our minds not effected to act as one.\" Koga said is a growl.<br>\r\n\"Yes and I may not be able to move but I can stop it from moving.\" Ayashi said as he was holding on to the creature's jaws. \"Here is your chance.\"<br>\r\n\"Right and since my insects are either incapacitated or dead...

Byo was still wiped from trying to block the attack from before and Mar was taken out by a single beam. The Creature then looked to them and readied a gigantic electric sphere. It launched it at them. \"My leg still hearts from that attack. Their is no way that I can get everyone out of here. What can I do?\" Just then a purple haze approached. \"Could this be?\"<br>\r\n\"Purple Haze Gale.\" Then the haze shot up and knocked the attack back at the creature.<br>\r\n\"Sir.\" Jiriyu said.<br>\r\n\"So this is what has been causing you trouble.\" Sir said. Just then he hit Jiriyu with his walking stick.<br>\r\n\"What was that for?\" Jiriyu asked.\"You took to long if this was any other heist you would have been imprisoned or killed by now.\" Sir said.<br>\r\n\"Well sorry but that thing attacks from distance and it had a way of defending itself.\" Jiriyu said.<br>\r\n\"So attacks on the physical body don't work. Good thing I came then.\" Sir said. The creature then got up and was about to attack. \"Dreamtime Haze.\" The creature attacked. The attack hit but Sir appeared elsewhere. The creature then attacked again but after the attack hits then Sir appeared elsewhere.<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Sir was standing facing the creature attacking everything but Sir and the Tanuki Gang. \"Good now we can jet out of here... Ouch.\" Jiriyu said as he was hit again by Sir. \"What is it this time?\"<br>\r\n\"Always see an operation to the end. That is what I have taught you.\" Sir said.<br>\r\n\"Well I can't move at this time.\" Jiriyu said.<br>\r\n\"I guess I have to do everything.\" With that Sir charge forward and draw from the top of his stick a sword and stabbed the creature in the gut. \"Go in Peace.\" With that he twist the blade and pulled it out before cleaning it and placing it back in the walking stick. \"Now we can go.\" With that Sir lead the Tanuki gang out.<br>\r\nMain Base:<br>\r\n\"No all the Guard Beasts have been dealt with.\" Morimaru said.<br>\r\n\"How do you know?\" Kei asked.<br>\r\n\"I am a sensory type and the chakra from the Guard Beasts have faded.\" Morimaru said.<br>\r\n\"Then let's get back to the base and sort the information together.\" Konohamaru said as they left before destroying the place.<br>\r\nBack at the Blue Rose, the teams then gathered the information they have received. That includes Morimaru and the Egg. They decided to let the Leaf deal with this two things. After a day's rest the Leaf ninja and Morimaru headed for the village. They they handed Morimaru to Ibiki and the Egg went to Hana Inuzuka, Koga's aunt and a Veterinarian along with DNA samples of an animal origin retrieved.</span></div></div>",

We have a problem.\"<br>\r\n\"What is it?\" Naruto asked.<br>\r\n\"Someone stole the egg.\" Hana said.<br>\r\n\"What!\" Naruto said.<br>\r\n\"Don't worry I  have already sent the Three Haimaru Brothers to track the thief down.\" Hana said. She then cupped her ear. \"Seems like they found the thief.\"<br>\r\n\"Then let's see this thief.\" Naruto said as he and the senseis went and checked out the thief. Thief had short brown hair and was wearing a black outfit. \"Where is the egg?\" Naruto asked.<br>\r\n\"Like I tell you.\" The thief said.<br>\r\n\"Let me.\" Naruki asked.<br>\r\n\"Go ahead.\" Naruto said as they left the room. <br>\r\nAfter a few minutes there was a scream. \"Okay I'll talk.\" The thief said. A few minutes later he lead them to the location of where he hid the egg. \"I hid it here when I heard the dogs approaching.\"<br>\r\nKenwaru looked in the bush. \"I don't see it.\"<br>\r\n\"No I sware I hid it here.\" The thief said.<br>\r\n\"What is this?\" Kenwaru asked as he picked up a strand of long red hair.<br>\r\n\"I think we may have another thief.\" Naruto said. \"This one closer to home.\" Naruto then had the Anbu take the thief away. \"Follow me.\" Naruto then took them into the forest.<br>\r\n\"Why are we here?\" Kenwaru asked.<br>\r\n\"Shina, come out.\" Naruto said. <br>\r\nWith that Shina walked out from behind a tree. \"Hey daddy.\" She said.<br>\r\n\"Shina did you take a big egg?\" Naruto asked.<br>\r\n\"Yeah, Itachi and I were playing nearby and we heard someone. We hid ourselves and show the man with the egg and then him being chased by the dogs. We figured he was a bad man so we took the egg and was going to bring it. That was until.\" Shina said.<br>\r\n\"Until what?\" Naruto asked.<br>\r\n\"Itachi bring him out.\" Shina said.<br>\r\nWith that Itachi came out from behind the trees. \"It is okay, you can come out.\" Itachi said. With that a small blue dog like bipedral creature with pointed and floppy ears and big eyes and a tail walked out with him.<br>\r\n\"The egg glow and then hatched.\" Shina said.<br>\r\n\"That thing looks like a smaller version of the guard beast my team fought.\" Hanta said.<br>\r\nNaruto then bent down to Shina  and said. \"Shina, your friend has to come with us, until we can find if he is dangerous.\"<br>\r\n\"No he is our friend.\" Shina said but the creature then walked up to Naruto and they all then headed off.<br>\r\n\"What are we going to do?\" Itachi asked.<br>\r\n\"Want do you think we do we follow them.\" Shina said as the two of them followed them. <br>\r\nThey then sneak in as Hana was giving the creature a physical. \"There, that was not too bad.\" She then turned around. \"You two can come out.\" With that Shina and Itachi came out. \"Naruto knew you would not listen and follow.\" <br>\r\nJust then Naruto entered the room. \"So what would you say about our guest?\"<br>\r\n\"Well he has the potential to be dangous, but the same could be said of anyone. I say with the right guidence and watch he will be fine.\" <br>\r\n\"Does that mean he can be let free.\" Shina asked.<br>\r\n\"No, left to it's own it could fall into the hands of anyone.\" Hana said.<br>\r\n\"Don't worry.\" Naruto then placed a hand on the heads of the two kids. \"Between this two I am sure that the creature will be fine.\"<br>\r\n\"You mean it?\" Shina asked. Thank you.\" She the tryed to turn to hug her father but then got tied in her hair and was about to fall until Itachi and the creature caught her and untangled her. \"Thank you Itachi. You too... You need a name?\"<br>\r\n\"Mino.\" Itachi said.<br>\r\n\"Mino? I like it.\" Shina said. \"So What do you say?\"<br>\r\nThe creature nodded. \"Then it is agreed.\" Naruto said. \"He is your resposiblity.\"<br>\r\n\"Right.\" They both said and then left with Mino behind them.<br>\r\n\"Are you sure that was a good idea?\" Kenwaru asked as Naruto was watching the three running into the forest.<br>\r\n\"I have faith is Shina and Itachi is a good kid. Also Mino, the creature, he came to me so I would not have to agrue with Shina about the matter.\" With that Naruto headed off.</span></div></div>",

Hebimaru then sent them off.<br>\r\nMeanwhile in the Hidden Leaf Village Haruto was spending some time with Akiza. \"Wow that was a interesting story.\" Haruto said listening to Akiza's story. Just then as they were walking something was running towards them and pumped into Haruto. \"What the?\" Haruto said. \"What is this thing?\"<br>\r\n\"Could it be?\" Akiza asked.<br>\r\n\"What is it?\" Haruto asked.<br>\r\n\"That thing looks like the thing my team fought.\" Akiza said.<br>\r\n\"A Guard Creature.\" Haruto said. \"Did the egg hatch?\"<br>\r\n\"Mino!\" Yelled a voice.<br>\r\n\"Shina?\" Haruto said.<br>\r\n\"Mino? Where you go?\" Another voice said.<br>\r\n\"Itachi.\" Akiza said.<br>\r\nJust then the two arrived at the scene. \"Oh you found Mino.\" Shina said.<br>\r\n\"Mino? You named it?\" Haruto asked.<br>\r\n\"Yeah, Lord Hokage said that we are responsible for Mino so we named him and have been playing with him.\" Itachi said.<br>\r\n\"Yeah but Mino saw a butterfly and started chasing it.\" Shina said.<br>\r\n\"And you last sight of him?\" Haruto asked.<br>\r\n\"Well I tried to go after him but I got caught in my hair again.\" Shina said.<br>\r\n\"That hair has been giving you trouble.\" Itachi said. \"You really should take care of it.\"<br>\r\n\"How many times do I have to tell you I am not going to cut my hair.\" Shina said.

They then got a better look at the man. He was beat up and looked to be critically injured. \"Hey what happened?\" He asked. As he got near him to check him out. \"He is burning up.\" With that the guard got the man to the hospital while the other informed the Hokage about the man.<br>\r\nAfter Sakura finished examining and treating the man, Naruto came and asked Sakura about the condition of the man. \"So how is the man?\"<br>\r\n\"The injuries alone are major but here is the thing.\" Sakura said. \"The injury to the chest matches the entry sight of poison that induced fever.\"<br>\r\n\"There for making his body to over heat and dehydrate him.\" Naruto said.  \"This is bad. Where did this man came from?\"<br>\r\n\"Well I would only be guessing from the type of plants in his shoe threads, I would say he was running through the Land of Grass.\" Sakura said. \"We need to send a team that contains medical ninja skilled with poisons.\" <br>\r\n\"Why use so many?\" Naruto asked. <br>\r\n\"The moment I abstracted the poison it evaporated.\" Sakura said.<br>\r\n\"Do what you can about getting this man back on his feet so we can get more information before we do anything else.\" Naruto said.<br>\r\n\"I will do my best.\" Sakura said.<br>\r\n\"This can not be a convenience.

I am a ninja of the Grass and the town that I was stationed at to act as military presence was attacked. And last I know there are people dyeing.\" The man said. \"Please we need her medical skills.\"<br>\r\n\"You just stay still and let us take care of this.\" Sakura said. She then left outside with Naruto. \"What should we do?\" <br>\r\n\"I don't know.\" Naruto said.  Just then a hawk flew to the window and it had flown into towards them. \"What is with this hawk?\"<br>\r\n\"The mark on the scroll it is carrying, that is Akiza's handwriting.\" Sakura then open the scroll and read it. \"Looks like Akiza is already there and has started treatment.\" <br>\r\n\"I am sending Haruto and his team.\" Naruto said. \"Three medical ninja would be better then just one.\"<br>\r\nWith that Naruto sent Team Konohamaru to provide aid to Team Hanta. When they arrived they were shocked at the state of the town. \"Look at this place.\" Haruto said.<br>\r\n\"Let's get to work.\" Ryousake said.<br>\r\nThey entered the medical tent. \"Good you made it.\" Akiza said. \"I need the help.\" <br>\r\n\"Well That is why we are here.\" Kei said as she and Ryousake got themselves ready to tend to the injured.<br>\r\n\"I'll go look for survivors.\" Haruto said as he picked up a first aid kit. and left. <br>\r\nWith in three days they have finished there work but there was still many deaths. \"I am sorry for not being able to save them all.\" Akiza said.<br>\r\n\"Don't beat yourself up about this, the poison evaporated too quickly to be able to analyze, also you had the physical injuries to deal with.\" Said Ryousake.<br>\r\n\"Still I should have found a way.\" Akiza said.<br>\r\n\"You saved as many as you could, those who died, there was nothing else that could have been done but ease their passing.\" Hanta said.<br>\r\n\"Fine.\" Akiza said as they headed back to the Leaf.<br>\r\nBack at Orochimaru's base the Five Venom Claw where in a common area. \"That was a waste of my time.\" Kademu said. \"There was no challenge for me.\" <br>\r\n\"Come on Kademu, we got to spread our wings so to speak and got to have some fun in the process. I find that a win win.\" Moriya said hanging upside down on the ceiling.

Morimaru had a change of wardrobe. He now was wearing a teal top with dark netting at the collar, a opened dark gray jacket and black pants.

He then took a whip out and started to use it at high speed. Tai jumped back. \"You will not get away.\" With that he then punched the air and launched his slivers.  Tai then summoned his swords and used then to deflect the attack. He then got close to him and then kicked him in the head. \"That was useless.\" Kademu said. He then used his whip but then Tai countered it with a whip of his own.\"How?\" He then noticed his second whip was missing. \"You took one of my toys now you take something from you.\" <br>\r\n\"No you will not.\" Tai said. He then ran around and then used the whip to tie up Kademu. \"Now, Iron Shattering Fist.\" Tai then struck and took Kademu down.<br>\r\n\"You did it.\" Lee said.<br>\r\n\"Relax dad.

Pathetic.\" Moriya said. \"You are no match for\u2026 Unconfrontable Delusion Disturber, Moriya. So Anbu man, why don't you just walk away and you may live longer.\" <br>\r\n\"Ninja Art: Super Beast Scroll.\" With that the Anbu took a scroll out and draw ten snakes that came to life off the scroll and then headed for Moriya. <br>\r\n\"No you don't.\" Moriya said as he dodged the attack. The Anbu then throw shuriken at him but he dodged them to. The Anbu then charged and draw his sword and then throw it at Moriyu who caught it. \"You are just like everyone else, a fool.\" Just then a black suspense came from the blade and engulfed Moriyu's hand. \"What the?\" Just then the Anbu showed up behind Moriya and slashed at him with his sword. He severed his arm. \"Ah! My arm, wait ever will I do?\" Moriya said but then. \"Just kidding. Rapid Growth Regeneration.\" With that his arm grown back.<br>\r\n\"So he favors a far range attack pattern, dodges using the high of his position to his advantage, and can regenerate his limbs.\" The Anbu said. \"Moriya, I have found out your techniques so now you are not a threat.\"<br>\r\n\"You think so.\" Just then the severed arm shot at the Anbu and punched him in the face and then grabbed his throat. \"Using the last amount of chakra in the arm I can control it, sadly for you there is not enough to strangle you so You will be poisoned. Your body will be paralized to the point that your entire body shuts down, unless you get the antidote within five minutes you will die. Any last requests?\"<br>\r\n\"No I am fine.\" The anbu said as he stood up and removed the arm easily. The Anbu is Sai.<br>\r\n\"But how the poison?\" Moriya asked.<br>\r\n\"It is useless, the ink that came from that sword encased the arm.\" Sai said.<br>\r\n\"Well it does not matter, You will never beat me.\" Moriya said.<br>\r\n\"Why because your body has gecko DNA.\" Sai said.<br>\r\n\"How do you now that?\"<br>\r\n\"The fact that there is no chakra from your feet and you are still sticking to the surface.\" Sai said.<br>\r\n\"It does not matter. As you said I don't use chakra to move on walls so I can use chakra more then you can.\" Moriya said. Just then there were shuriken coming form all directions so he was forced to dodge in his up. He was then kicked to the ground. \"What how did that happen?\" Moriya then saw more Anbu surrounding him. \"What but how?\"<br>\r\n\"I volunteered to confront you one-on-one so to see your skills, as well as to distract you from my comrades.\" Sai said.<br>\r\n\"Why you, I will not stand for this.\" Moriya then started though a series of hand signs and then he summoned a giant wooden box around him and Sai. \"Now I will take you out one-on-one.\" Moriya had trapped Sai and himself inside a giant wooden box. The inside the box there are hundreds of pillars, slanted at various angles, along the ceiling. The ground had no cover to it. Moriya was barraging Sai with Shuriken and he tried dodging them. \"Come on stay still. You can't dodge forever so why waste time trying.\" Moriya said. \"You use ink in your ninjutsu so once you run out of that you are going to die like the fool you are.\" <br>\r\nSai then took out a single shuriken and then throw it and it hit Moriya in the leg and he dropped to the ground. \"Now.\" Sai then used Super Beast Scroll and draw a snake that wrapped around Moriya and then Sai Stabbed Moriya.

Good.\" Sorisa said. Sorisa then walked forward. \"Come on.\"<br>\r\n\"Very well.\" Hinata then lowered into her stance and charged in.

Leading the group was Ayashi. <br>\r\n\"Milady Hinata,we have taken care of her back up, you may now stop holding back.\" Ayashi said.<br>\r\n\"Why you little.\" Just then Hinata thrust towards Sorisa's head but it missed but it hit the strap on her face mask and it fell off and left a scratch.<br>\r\n\"Your fight is with me.\" Hinata said.<br>\r\n\"You scratched my face.\" Sorisa asid. \"How dear you.\" She then jumped back and kicked at all the Hyuga that came to help Hinata and took them down. She then stopped at a downed Ayashi and picked him up. \"You think you can just waltz in and stop me. Well you are wrong.\" Sorisa then turned to Hinata. \"What is this kid to you?\" She asked.<br>\r\n\"I am a member of one of the Hyuga Clan's Branch House.\" Ayashi said. \"I am merely doing my duty defending Lady Hinata.\" <br>\r\n\"Then you are not of use to me.\" She then took her index and middle finger and then struck Ayashi's neck.

The three of them then made there way to the woods. \"Ready?\" Haruto asked.<br>\r\n\"Ready.\" Ryousake said as he placed his hand on Haruto's shoulder. <br>\r\n\"I am as ready as I can be.\" Kei said.<br>\r\n\"Okay then here we go.\" Haruto then summoned Sage mode. \"Now Sage Style: Byakugan.\" With that Haruto activate Byakugan and then using Natural Chakra detected the integrality of the reanimated ninja. \"Got them. Do you feel them?<br>\r\n\"Yeah I do.\" Ryousake said as he activated his Mangekyo Sharingan and then got the images of the chakra in his mind. \"Amaterasu!\" Ryousake's left eye started to bleed.<br>\r\nIn the village itself. \"They were right.\" Morimaru said from the top of a building. \"Well I better do my part. Wood Style Sealing: Grand Oak Prison.\" With that said Morimaru managed to summon a wooden casket for each of the Reanimated ninja in his sight and then incase the ninja and then a seal formula bond the ninja in it. \"Looks like I managed to capture about five but I doubt it would be that easy.\"<br>\r\nIn the Hospital Lobby. \"Take this.\" Sakura said as she punched the reanimated ninja that she found had infiltrated the hospital as an injured man. The ninja was then sealed away using a sealing tag. \"The same trick was tried before, not again.\" Sakura then went back to treating the wounded.<br>\r\nIn the evacuation shelter. Kenta and his teammates were holding the reanimated ninja using chains. \"Hurry up we can't hold him forever.\" Anezi yelled.<br>\r\n\"Right.\" A chunin said as he sealed the reanimated ninja.<br>\r\n\"That did it.\" Kenta said. \"But it is not safe. We need to get everyone out of here.\"<br>\r\n\"Right.\" Another chunin said. \"Okay this way.\" He guide the civilians out of there. Unknown to them two young kids and there friend wandered off.<br>\r\nBack in the Woods. \"Good news, The sealing was a success.\" Kei said.<br>\r\n\"Good. Maybe I can get some rest before something else comes at us.\" Ryousake said.<br>\r\n\"Sorry but we are not that lucky.\" Haruto said.<br>\r\n\"Why is that?\" Ryousake asked. Just then a blast came flying towards them. They jumped out of the way to see who it was. They don't recognize the man that attacked them but he looked familiar. \"Who are you?\" Ryousake asked. </span></div></div>",

No interruptions from others.\" <br>\r\n\"I don't have a choice do I?\" Ryousake said. \"Okay.\" Ryousake then took out shuriken and throw them at Katsu. Katsu dodged them. Ryousake then made hand-signs and then throw kunai. They headed for Katsu. He dodged several of them but one scratched is arm and he felt a burning sensation from where the kunai hit.<br>\r\n\"That hurt.\" He said. He then looked to the wound to see that it was already sizzled close. Katsu then charged at Ryousake with his sword in hand but Ryousake blocked using a kunai. \"This is a joke.\" Katsu said as he pushed back. \"You are not fighting me seriously, why?\"<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" Ryousake asked.<br>\r\n\"You are not using your Sharigan. Is it that you think you are so much stronger then me that you don't need it.\" Katsu said. \"Well if you want fight me serious then I will just destroy your friends.\" Katsu then focused fire chakra to his sword and then slashed it towards Haruto and Kei. \"Now fight me seriously.\" He then charged and slashed at Ryousake but then his hand got cut and he stopped his attack.  Ryousake had cut Katsu's hand and then kicked him back.  <br>\r\n\"Haruto, are you and Kei okay?\" Ryousake asked as a yellow chakra came walking through the fire. <br>\r\n\"Yeah, we are fine.\" Haruto said as the yellow chakra disappeared and then there stood Haruto and Kei unharmed.<br>\r\n\"Good thing I have mastered using the Nine-Tails Chakra Mode.\" Haruto said.<br>\r\n\"Katsu, you are not worth my time fighting.\" Ryousake said. \"Why do you even wish to fight me?\" <br>\r\n\"You have noticed it too have you not?\" Katsu said. \"The more uses of the Mangekyo Sharingan the worse our eyes are affected. True I could always have Hebimaru make for me a 'brother' so to get his eyes to solve my problem but don't want just any pair of eyes, I what yours the eyes of the true son of Sasuke Uchiha. That is why you and I will and must fight.\"<br>\r\n\"I guess I have no other choose but to fight you, but if you what my best then give me yours.\" Ryousake said.<br>\r\n\"As you wish.\" Katsu said as he lowered his shirt to his waist and on his neck could be seen a mark.<br>\r\n\"That mark, a curse mark.\" Haruto said.<br>\r\n\"Right and with it I will unleash my full strength.\" With that Katsu under gone a transformation. His skin turned gray, a black mark appeared on his nose, his hair got more spiked, also from his back sprout a pair of webbed hand-like wings. The cornea of his eyes turned black and then he activated his Mangekyo Sharingan. \"I have unleashed my full power know it is your turn.\"<br>\r\n\"Very well.\" Ryousake said. Ryousake then moved his headband to his forehead and then activate his Mangekyo Sharingan.<br>\r\n\"Let's get this started.\" Katsu said as he charged in and ready to slash Ryousake but was sent back. \"What the? What was that?\" He asked and then he saw that Ryousake had stuck him with a single finger. \"What the?\"<br>\r\nRyousake then disappeared and appeared next to Katsu and then kicked him to the ground but he blocked it with his wing and the impact was lessened. Katsu then got up and charged at Ryousake again and tried to kick him but Ryousake blocked it and then use Chidori Spear to pierce one of Katsu's wings and cut it off and then kicked him to the ground. Ryousake then charged down with his Chidori Spear and stabbed Katsu through the chest. \"I am sorry for this, but you left me little choice but to kill you.\" Ryousake said to the body. He deactivated his jutsu and was about to leave but then his shoulder got set on fire by Amaterasu.<br>\r\nHe turned to see that Katsu had gotten up. \"How?\" Haruto asked.<br>\r\n\"You think you can beat me that easy.\" Katsu said to Ryousake. Just then Katsu formed a Susanoo. \"You are dead wrong.\" His Susanoo had a giant scythe. \"Now die.\" He then used the scythe to attack. The attack cause a dust to go up. \"He is gone, now I will kill you two before taking his remains to retrieve his eyes.<br>\r\n\"Is that so?\" Ryousake said as a chakra arm shot out and punched Katsu's Susanoo away. <br>\r\n\"But how?\" Katsu said but then saw Ryousake's incomplete Susanoo arm was covering with a arm guard. \"It does not matter that you can use Susanoo, I still will kill you.\" Katsu then Charged with his sword and slashed at Ryousake. But he then blocked it with a shield of black fire. \"What the? How dear you use my strength against me.\" <br>\r\n\"It is your fault.\" Ryousake said before he then got close to katsu and bite into his shoulder.<br>\r\n\"What is he doing?\" Kei asked.<br>\r\n\"I don't know.\" Haruto said. Both weirded out about this.<br>\r\n\"Get off of me.\" Katsu said as he pushed Ryousake away. As he was sent back he, as well as Haruto and Kei, noticed that Ryousake had healed somewhat. \"What is the meaning of this?\"<br>\r\n\"So I was right.\" Ryousake said.<br>\r\n\"What are you talking about.\" Katsu asked.<br>\r\n\"You said that you are a Bi-clone? I am to guess that means that your DNA is made up of the DNA of two individuals.\" Ryousake asked.<br>\r\n\"Yeah what of it?\" Katsu asked.<br>\r\n\"Well I am to guess that the other half of your DNA is that of Karin meaning you have her heal bite.\" Ryousake said.<br>\r\n\"It does not matter. I still am going to take you down.\" Katsu said.<br>\r\n\"No You will not.\" Ryousake said. <br>\r\n\"I will prove you wrong.\" Katsu then charged in.<br>\r\n\"Ryousake!\" Said Akiza as she arrived and then throw him something. It was a sword. <br>\r\n\"Thank you Akiza.\" Ryousake said as he sent chakra to the blade and then slashed Katsu and cut him in half.<br>\r\n\"How did you do that?\" Katsu said then before blacking out he saw the chakra around Ryousake's sword it formed into a larger blade, a single sided broadsword.<br>\r\n\"Are you okay?\" Akiza asked.<br>\r\n\"I am fine.\" Ryousake said. \"This man was 'born' of the blood taken from father and has the Mangekyo Sharingan.\" <br>\r\n\"That means!\" Akiza said.<br>\r\n\"Right.\" Ryousake said. \"Akiza, normally this is something I would trust to mom but she is needed for the others so, I need you to do this.\"<br>\r\n\"Here, are you sure.\" Akiza asked.<br>\r\n\"Yes.\" Ryousake said.<br>\r\n\"Well I better leave you three then. You will need an assistant.\" With that Haruto left. </span></div></div>",

And I can still complete my mission with only three.\"<br>\r\n\"So you have been operating behind my back.\" Hebimaru turned to see Orochimaru and Kabuto behind him. <br>\r\n\"Well what would you expect I am you're son.\" Hebimaru said.<br>\r\n\"So who are things going on so far?\" Orochimaru asked.<br>\r\n\"Things have reached a slight snag but I am dealing with that know.\" Hebimaru said as he walked over to the claw of revival. \"The claws can be used to restore life of a person but only one person per claw.\"<br>\r\n\"So three people, or a person three times.\" Orochimaru said.<br>\r\n\"Exactly.\" Hebimaru said. Just then Hebimaru lifted his hand and then a spike shot out and hit Orochimaru and pinned him to the wall.<br>\r\n\"Lord Orochimaru.\" Kabuto said as he charged at Hebimaru and took a kunai out but Hebimaru blocked the attack and then stuck Kabuto in the chest and he collapsed to the ground.<br>\r\n\"Hard to breath?\" Hebimaru asked. \"Good.\" With that two of Hebimaru's Curse creatures appeared and took Kabuto by an arm.<br>\r\n\"Why...don't...you...finish me...off?\" Kabuto asked hard to speak.<br>\r\n\"Because I want both of you to see my plan at work to the finish.\" Hebimaru said. \"Actually Kabuto you may enjoy this next part. Come Kaiju.\" With that a young man entered. <br>\r\nKaiju Tsukai<br>\r\nAge: 21 or so.<br>\r\nRank: Jonin strength.<br>\r\nAppearance: black hair and dark brown eyes, white shirt and red vest and light blue pants. Six small red and white orbs on his vest.<br>\r\nVillage: Orochimaru Army, serving Hebimaru.<br>\r\n\"You called me Master Hebimaru?\" Kaiju asked.<br>\r\n\"Yes it is time for you to make your move, and remember you primary targets.\"  Hebimaru said.<br>\r\n\"Right.\" Kaiju said before he left. \"Say your last goodbyes to this world, Tanuki Gang.\"<br>\r\nMeanwhile part way towards the Leaf the Tanuki Gang were moving to the Leaf. \"Are you sure of this Byo?\" Jiriyu asked.<br>\r\n\"Yes, while we were in the Leaf Village I planted my spy spheres and several of them were destroyed within the last twelve hours.\" Byo said.<br>\r\n\"Couldn't be that someone destroyed them because they are spying devices?\" Mar asked from the driver's seat.<br>\r\n\"Ten at the exact same moment in ten different locations. I don't that could be a convince.\" Byo said.<br>\r\nJust then something came towards the carriage and sent it flying. When it landed the Tanuki Gang exited the carriage. \"Okay, who did that?\" Mar asked as he looked around. Just then someone appeared before them. \"You did this, who are you?\"<br>\r\n\"My name is Kaiju Tsukai and I have been given two objectives. One happens to be the elimination of the Tanuki Gang.\" Kaiju said.<br>\r\n\"And who assigned you to do this?\" Jiriyu asked. \"After all it is only right to know the name of how wishes for use to be killed.\"<br>\r\n\"Hebimaru.\" Kaiju said.<br>\r\n\"Really, and how are you going to do that?\" Jiriyu asked.<br>\r\n\"I am glad you asked.\" Kaiju said. He then placed his hands together. \"Summon Haunted-Golem. Summon Psy-Star. Summon Magnet-Tron.\" With that three of the orbs on his vest glow and then three figures appeared in front of Kaiju.<br>\r\n\"What are those things?\" Mar asked.<br>\r\n\"You are aware of the general term for these things, Guard Creatures.\" Kaiju said. \"But let me introduce you to this three in particular. First, Psy-Star.\"<br>\r\nPsy-Star:<br>\r\nPurple starfish-like with ten legs. five front, five back. gold band with ruby jewel in center.<br>\r\n\"Then there is Magnet-Tron.\"<br>\r\nMagnet-Tron:<br>\r\nblueish gray body three eyes, the center eye is red. magnets as hands.<br>\r\n\"And rounding the group up Haunted-Golem.\"<br>\r\nHaunted-Golem:<br>\r\nlight and dark blue with brown bands on arms and legs, yellow glowing markings. <br>\r\n\"And with this three You don't stand a chance.\" Kaiju said.<br>\r\n\"You think so?\" Mar the charged at Kaiju.<br>\r\n\"Psy-Star Protect.\" The starfish-like creature moved in front of Mar's path and created a shield of chakra that place the attack. \"Now use Thunderbolt.\" Psy-Star then launched a lighting bolt at Mar and shocked him.<br>\r\n\"Mar.\" Jiriyu said as he ran in to attack.<br>\r\n\"Not so fast, Haunted-Golem, Mega Punch.\" With that the giant golem moved in and punched Jiriyu, sending him back. \"Now Magnet Bomb.\" With that Magnet-Tron released a magnetic bombs that head for all of them. And then exploded.<br>\r\n\"Ah!\" Byo shouted. And the three of them got sent back. She got up. \"I will not let my friends get hurt needlessly.\" Byo then ran through hand-signs. \"Water Style: Torrent Pressure.\" Byo then sent a high pressure force of water towards Magnet-Tron.<br>\r\n\"Magnet-Tron Zap Cannon.\" With that Magnet-Tron charged a orb of electricity and launched it at Byo's attack and overpowered the attack and then head straight for Byo. <br>\r\n\"This is bad.\" Byo said. Just then a kunai head for the orb and when they collide the kunai and orb of electricity bounced off each other and in different directions. Byo then looked to see who throw the kunai. It was Jiriyu. \"Thanks but how did you do that?\"<br>\r\n\"I simply charged the kunai with the same charge as the attack so the force of my throw was enough to knock both about.<br>\r\n\"But what if you did not use the right charge?\" Byo asked.<br>\r\n\"The kunai still would have taken the hit and lessoned the strength of the attack.\" Jiriyu said. \"Now to beat them. I will take that big one out first so we can then focus of the other two together.\" Jiriyu then throw electrically charged kunai at Haunted-Golem and  then slashed him with his naginata. He then summoned the blade from his prosthetic arm and slashed it but the giant did not move or flinch at the attacks. \"What the.\"<br>\r\n\"Focus Punch.\" With that Haunted-Golem gathered chakra into it's fist and it punched Jiriyu, sending him back.<br>\r\n\"If we can't get close then we will attack from a far.\" Mar said. \"Firework Blitzkrieg.\" Mar then launched fireworks at Haunted-Golem.<br>\r\n\"Hydro Pump.\" With that Psy-Star summoned water in front of it's jewel and then blast a force of water that took the fireworks out and hit Mar, sending him back.<br>\r\n\"How is this possible, the guard creature we fought before was strong but it's attacks were not this coordinated.\" Byo said. \"How is this possible?\"<br>\r\n\"I will tell you how.\" Kaiju said. \"You recall how the one known as Double Jaws caused only the males in there group that invaded it's  territory? As that implies that means that Double Jaws was female. Meaning there are males and females of each creature. Well that is not always the case. The three before you have no gender to speak of. That is why it is so easy to control.\" <br>\r\n\"But you must have a why to control them in the first place?\" Jiriyu asked.<br>\r\n\"Well each orb that you see on my vest has been synced to a particular creature but it is because I trained them myself that is how I control them. I trained this three to face each of you.\"  Kaiju said. \"So...\" Kaiju then grabbed hold of Nuki by his tail. \"...stealing one of the orbs will not help you control them.\" He then throw Nuki towards a tree and he hit it hard.<br>\r\n\"Nuki!\" Jiriyu said. \"How dear you!\"<br>\r\n\"Please. Earthquake.\" With that Haunted-Golem summoned an earthquake that was going to send the Tanuki Gang flying.<br>\r\n\"Water Style: Water Shield.\" Byo then summoned a orb of water around her and the rest of the gang. That is when she noticed that the water shield had worked better then she thought.  \"Jiriyu, Mar, can you two still fight?\"<br>\r\n\"You know it but that is strange hearing you say that.\" Mar said.<br>\r\n\"Well I know what we can do to win.\" Byo said. She then whispered the plan and both men gave a nod so to say they understand the plan.<br>\r\n\"Okay, let's go.\" With that the three of them charged at the Guard Creatures. They then switched.<br>\r\n\"What!\" Kaiju said.<br>\r\n\"Lighting Style: Super Lightning Dragon Fist.\" Jiriyu said as he punched Psy-Star.<br>\r\n\"Fury After Burn.\" Mar said as he punched Magnet-Tron and it then burned. <br>\r\n\"Water Style: Depth Charge Bomb.\" Byo then laughed several small orbs of water All around Haunted-Golem. She then throw a senbon and destroyed it causing it to explode, setting off a chain reaction. This took the three creatures out. \"How was that?\" She asked her friends.<br>\r\n\"That was great.\" Jiriyu said.<br>\r\n\"Yeah, you are more the brains, you have your own brawn.\" Mar said.<br>\r\n\"Thanks.\" She said to Mar.<br>\r\n\"Hyper Voice.\" With that the three of them got sent flying back by a blast of sound.<br>\r\n\"What was that?\" Jiriyu asked. Then they saw what it was.<br>\r\n\"Meet my strongest creature, Tri-Hydra.\" Kaiju said.<br>\r\nTri-Hydra:<br>\r\nThree heads, Hands are each a head, Blue body with black fur and three pairs of wings long tail and stubby legs.<br>\r\n\"You think I only brought those three with me, wrong are you.\" Kaiju said. \"Now I can kill you another time so. Tri-Hydra use Dragon Rush.\" With that Chakra around the creature took from of a dragon and it crashed into the trees causing them to fall onto the Tanuki Gang. \"At very less this will detour you. I better get going, I need to heal my Creatures so I will be at full power for the attack on the Leaf.\" With that he left.<br>\r\nAs soon as they were gone, Mar lifted the trees. \"Okay the Leaf is in trouble.\" Jiriyu said. \"We better get going to at least warn them.\" With that they headed for the Leaf. </span></div></div>",

He got past the barrier with little detection. Once there he met up with Kiira, Akagetsu, and Shinku. \"Okay, You know the plan.\" Hebimaru said.<br>\r\n\"Shinku was about to speak but then Hebimaru took hold of his shirt. \"Just slam your hands to the ground when I tell you to and then once the caskets open you may go and have as much fun as you wish. Just remember, Akagetsu, Kiira and my self are not to be touched. Understand.

Well that is what I have done.\" Just then a creature jumped out of the seal. \"Met my partner, Kimera.\"  <br>\r\nKimera<br>\r\nAge: Unknown.<br>\r\nRank: Nin-Chimera.<br>\r\nAppearance: Brown Lion Head and mane and tan front claws and torso, grayish white Goat hind legs and back end, and Black Snake as a tail. <br>\r\nVillage: Whirling Tides.<br>\r\n\"That thing, it is monstrous.\" Koga said.<br>\r\n\"Well time to finish this.\" With that Kachu's right arm now bore a seal and a seal appeared on the Lion's Head and it's eyes turned white and it let a roar out. Kachu then jumped onto Kimera and then placed his hand on it. \"Now Wind Style: Blazing Inferno.\" With that Kimera launched a blaze of fire from it's mouth and Koga and Kinmaru went in two different directions to get away from it. \"You are not getting away that easy.\" Kachu then had Kimura attack again and they dodged. They then relieved Kachu was forcing them apart. Koga then draw a kunai and charged in but Kimura pressed Koga down with his claw. At the same time Kinmaru was trying to attack Kimura from behind but then the snake tail bound Kinmaru. <br>\r\n\"Kinmaru!\" Koga yelled.<br>\r\n\"It is pointless. Kimera has two sets of eyes, and with me to enhance his jutsu you can't beat me.\" Kachu said.<br>\r\n\"Is that so?\" Koga said as he then took hold of Kimera's leg and then lifted him and tossed him away.\" <br>\r\n\"What but how did you do that?\" Kachu asked.<br>\r\n\"I promised myself that I would became stronger then my greatest rival, and to do that I worked day and night to build up my physical strength. While...\" Just then Kinmaru started to spin around and forced the snake tail to let go. \"...Kinmaru have done the same.\" Koga said as Kinmaru landed next to him.<br>\r\n\"Well it does not matter, unless you can defeat Kimera you can't seal me. Also this roof is too small for you two to fight using the famed Two Headed Wolf Jutsu.\" Kachu said.<br>\r\n\"Well there is always another way.\" Koga said as Kinmaru jumped onto Koga and Koga performed the needed Hand-signs. \"Ninja Art: Savage Beast Armor Jutsu.\" With that Kinmaru transformed into a suit of armor around Koga.<br>\r\n\"What is that?\" Kachu asked.<br>\r\n\"Savage Beast Armor is a technique only we use.\" With that he charged at them. \"Piecing Helix Fang.\" With that he spun around and created a twister in a twister and they went through both Kachu and Kimera. Kimera then disappeared. Koga and Kinmaru then returned to there original forms. \"Well that was easy.\" Koga said. Just then Kinmaru pushed Koga out of the way as Kachu was heading for an attack. \"Kinmaru!\"<br>\r\n\"Sorry but I am not doing this by choice.\" Kachu said as he was about to strike. Just then Kachu's arm was torn off and he was kicked back. \"What the. What is that thing?\"<br>\r\nThere standing on two legs was Kinmaru. \"This is Kinmaru's Were Form.\"<br>\r\n\"Were Form?\" Asked Kachu.<br>\r\n\"Yes, think of it as a Human Style Sage mode but with out Natural energy. This is when he takes on human-like form.\" Koga said. Then Kinmaru growled. \"One more thing.\" With that Koga charged in and slashed Kachu before placing a sealing tag on him. \"Kinmaru wishes to let you know that we are sorry for killing your partner.\" With that a seal formula appeared an Kachu and then his body turned grey. Kinmaru then transformed back. \"You okay?\" Koga asked and Kinmaru then walked away. \"Right work calls.\" With that they left.</span></div></div>",

He was about perform a powerful technique when someone interrupted his attack. \"I don't care that you are resurrected I will not let you destroy this village.\" Said Kenta as he appeared before the resurrected Hyuga. <br>\r\n\"Could it be?\" The resurrected Hyuga said as he looked at Kenta. Kenta then ran in and attacked wildly with his Gentle Fist. The resurrected Hyuga just side stepped and thrust his palm at Kenta but he dodged it and throw shuriken at the Hyuga but he moved his head and then they Hyuga delivered a thrust that sent Kenta back. Kenta soon got himself to his feet weakly. \"That proves my suspicions.\" The Hyuga said just then as he was being forced to attack someone blocked the attack. The two then jumped back and the resurrected Hyuga saw that it was a Hyuga that blocked his attack. \"Thank you for that, I wouldn't wish to attack the\u2026\"<br>\r\nThe living Hyuga interrupted. \"For warning, Kenta here does not like to be called kid, child, boy, or anything that infers that he is too young to do something. But\u2026\" He then turned to Kenta. \"I need you to stay out of this.\"<br>\r\n\"What why?\" Asked Kenta.<br>\r\n\"That attack you received, you are in too much pain that you will be in the way. And I he is too strong for you to beat.\" The Hyuga said.<br>\r\n\"And you can?\" Kenta asked.<br>\r\n\"I have the best chance of us but no I don't think I can beat him my self but I won't know until I try.\" The Hyuga said.<br>\r\n\"What is your name?\" The resurrected Hyuga asked.<br>\r\n\"My name is Ayashi Hyuga, no need to ask who you are. You are Neji Hyuga.\" Ayashi said. The resurrected Hyuga gave a nod to confirm Ayashi's claim.<br>\r\nNeji Hyuga<br>\r\nAge: 17. (Deceased.)<br>\r\nRank: Jonin.<br>\r\nAppearance: long, black hair, frame his face, standard Konohagakure attire with flak jacket, and the Alliance's forehead protector.<br>\r\nVillage: Leaf.<br>\r\n\"Neji Hyuga?\" Kenta asked. \"Why does that name sound so familiar?\"<br>\r\n\"Kenta, I suggest you stay there and keep a eye on this fight.\" Ayashi said. <br>\r\nHe and Neji activated there Byakugan. \"Byakugan!\" They both said making the necessary hand-sign. They then charged in and started to thrust and their attacks canceled each others out.<br>\r\n\"Wow, look at them.\" Kenta said as he activated his Byakugan and saw that they used the same amount of chakra as the other.<br>\r\nNeji then got a hand onto Ayashi. \"Eight Trigrams Mountain Crusher.\" With that he released a powerful air shell at close range that sent Ayashi flying.<br>\r\n\"Ayashi!\" Kenta yelled.<br>\r\n\"Eight Trigrams Palms Revolving Heaven\" Ayashi then started to rotate his body and then he head down to the ground.<br>\r\n\"Using the Eight Trigrams Palms Revolving Heaven to stop was a risky move.\" Neji said. \"What if it didn't work?\"<br>\r\n\"Well there is no victory with out sacrifice.\" Ayashi said.<br>\r\n\"That is well said.\" Neji said as his body moved into position. \"But how are you going to stop this. Eight Trigrams Sixty-Four Palms\"<br>\r\n\"That is simple.\" Ayashi said as he dodged the strikes, all of them. Ayashi then used Gentle Fist Art One Blow Body and Neji's body was then destroyed allowing Ayashi to get distance.\"<br>\r\n\"You dodged the Eight Trigrams Sixty-Four Palms and can use both the Eight Trigrams Palms Revolving Heaven and One Blow Body. Those are quite a group of feats. You must have trained hard.\" Neji said.<br>\r\n\"That is only because I have a strong training partner.\" Ayashi said.<br>\r\n\"Well that is one way of getting stronger.\" Neji said as he used Eight Trigrams Vacuum Palm but Ayashi dodged and thrust to attack and severed his arm. He then throw shuriken but Neji used One Body Blow to sent the shuriken back and they hit Ayashi. Ayashi just landed away and kept glancing at Neji. <br>\r\nAyashi then took out more Shuriken and then ran at Neji and throw the Shuriken. Neji sent the shuriken away again. Ayashi then jumped into the air and then ready to kick Neji. When the attack hit it shattered Neji's body. \"Eight Trigram Vacuum Heel.\" Ayashi said to himself as he made the attack. \"Kenta know.\"<br>\r\n\"Right.\" Kenta then took a kunai out and throw it into where Neji was and he was reforming around it. <br>\r\n\"That was a strong attack.\" Neji said and felt that he could not move. \"A sealing tag on that kunai. So that means that I will be gone soon.\"<br>\r\n\"I am still only a novice at best so that sealing tag may take a while.\" Kenta said.<br>\r\n\"It is okay, I wished to ask you something. Who are your parents?\" Neji asked.<br>\r\n\"Naruto Uzumaki and Hinata Hyuga. Wait now I remember why your name sounds familiar.\" Kenta said. \"You are my uncle.\"<br>\r\n\"Actually he would be your second cousin but I believe it would be the same type of feelings to you and the others.\" Ayashi said.<br>\r\n\"Others?\" Neji asked.<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I am the third in a set of four Uzumaki-Hyuga hybrids. But I am more Hyuga then Uzumaki since as of yet my Byakugan is the best.\" Kenta said. \"Before you go free again I should tell you that Grandfather, he said that my eyes are as powerful as yours.\"<br>\r\n\"Is that so? Good maybe you can do better then me.\" Neji said. He then looked to Ayashi and asked his something. \"Ayashi\u2026\"<br>\r\n\"I am from one of the Branch Houses.\" Ayashi said.<br>\r\n\"Oh.\" Neji said.<br>\r\n\"Neji.\" Ayashi said as he removed his headband. When Neji looked he saw that Ayashi was not wearing a curse-mark. \"Lady Hinata, she forced the removal of the practice of placing the curse mark on members of the Branch Houses.\"<br>\r\n\"Is that so.\" Neji said. \"Then what about this partner of yours?\"<br>\r\n\"I trained with Haruto, the eldest child of Hinata. I serve him but by choice.\" Ayashi said. <br>\r\n\"Why?\" Neji asked.<br>\r\n\"Because by proving that the Branch can serve the Main without fear of punishment of pain, We can truly be true.\" Ayashi said. \"One more thing I think you should know.\" Ayashi then made his way to Neji and whispered something into his ear.<br>\r\n\"Really!\" Neji said. He then let out a smile and then his body turned gray.<br>\r\n\"What did you tell him?\" Kenta asked.<br>\r\n\"Something that you are too young to understand.\" Ayashi said as he picked Kenta up and rushed him to get medical treatment.</span></div></div>",

He then headed for the cemetery. Before arriving there a wooden wall appeared in front of him. He turned around to find Morimaru and Konahamaru Sabutobi facing him. \"Who are you two?\"<br>\r\n\"I am Konohamaru Sabutobi.\" Konohamaru said pointing to himself. \"This is Morimaru, handiwork of the one that resurrected you.\"<br>\r\n\"Is that so?\" The Uzumaki asked. \"Well I have to say that he did better work then I would have thought.\" <br>\r\n\"What is your name?\" Morimaru asked.<br>\r\n\"Takeru Uzumaki, pleasure to find such strong shinobi still alive.\" Takeru said. <br>\r\nTakeru Uzumaki<br>\r\nAge: Deceased.<br>\r\nRank: Jonin.<br>\r\nAppearance: mid-length straight red hair, dark green eyes, wore a long-sleeved, dark blue outfit, the shoulders of which bore the crest of Whirling Tides, wore a forehead protector with his village's symbol etched into it and body armor.<br>\r\nVillage: Whirling Tides.<br>\r\n\"Takeru, are you doing this because of the jutsu or are you doing this of your own will.\" Morimaru asked.<br>\r\n\"Just because I am being forced to do this doesn't mean I can't enjoy myself while I can?\" Takeru asked.<br>\r\n\"You are sick to enjoy fighting people.\" Morimaru said.<br>\r\n\"I see, you have a strong ability that is too dangerous to be in this world so you are egging us to fight you and defeat you.\" Konohamaru said.<br>\r\n\"I guess that I can't fool a member of the Sabutobi Clan.\" Takeru said. \"So since that is the case\u2026\" Takeru then kicked the wood wall into splinters and then took hold of several of the splinters and throw them. <br>\r\nKonohamaru then deflected them. Takeru then started running to the cemetery. \"Stop.\" Konohamaru said as he and Morimaru ran after him. \"He started off quickly for the cemetery, but why?\" He asked himself.<br>\r\n\"Morimaru right, contain me and the Sabutobi in a wood Cage.\" Takeru said.<br>\r\n\"Do it.\" Konohamaru said as he ran and caught up to Takeru and then Morimaru encased the two in the cage. \"Okay, why did we do this?\"<br>\r\n\"I can seal a fragment of chakra into corpse to reanimate them, In this cage I will not be able to do that. Now fight me so I can't try and escape as easy.\" Takeru said.<br>\r\n\"Fine.\" The two then charged at each other and engaged in taijutsu. They pushed each other back but Takeru managed to take a kunai out of Konohamaru's hoister and then charged in again and Konohamaru retaliated with his staff in hand.  The two clashed again and again. Konohamaru then preformed hand-signs. \"Fire Style: Ash Pile Burning.\" With this he released a cloud of gunpowder.<br>\r\n\"This will not beat me.\" Takeru said. Then Konohamaru set the powder off and it explode.  When the cloud cleared there stood Takeru. His body was not being rebuild. In fact it looked as if there had been no damage at all.<br>\r\n\"What?\" Konahamaru said.<br>\r\n\"I told you that jutsu would not beat me.\" Takeru said. Just then a chakra appeared around him and it looked like it was armor. He then charged at Konohamaru and slashed at him but Konohamaru blocked the attacks. \"Well at least you are blocking my attacks.\" He said. \"I am able to make my body as strong as steel. That is why I can not be defeated by you.\"<br>\r\n\"Is there anyway to beat you?\" Konohamaru asked.<br>\r\n\"Sorry but no man has a chance against me.\" Takeru said. As he attacked and Konohamaru jumped back.<br>\r\nTakeru then charged in again. \"It is worth a try. Transform.\" With that Konohamaru transformed into something. When Takeru saw what his chakra receded and his body became voluble. Konohamaru then pierced him in the shoulder with a kunai with a sealing tag on it.<br>\r\n\"Good work with that attack.\" Takeru said. \"It was a secret of mine one that was only revealed at my death, my inability to attack a woman.\" He said as Konohamaru transformed back from taking the form of a beautiful woman with long brown hair. \"It seemed so real, who did you came up with this technique?\" <br>\r\n\"Actually it was created by the man that I called Boss. Naruto Uzumaki.\" Konohamaru said.<br>\r\n\"Of course, only an Uzumaki would be so creative.\" With that Takeru faded and was gone.<br>\r\n\"It is over, you can let me out of the cage.\" Konohamaru said as Morimaru undid the jutsu. <br>\r\n\"So what now?\" Morimaru asked.<br>\r\n\"We go to the next battlefield.\" Konohamaru said.

Well It is simple to take care of that.\" With that the two clashed again.<br>\r\nBack with Naruto and Jiraiya, the two were exchanging move after move with no clear winner yet. \"Naruto, if you are going to stop me do it fast.\" Jiraiya said.<br>\r\n\"I know that.\" Naruto said. \"Okay let's do it.\" <br>\r\n\"What was that all about?\" Jiraiya said.<br>\r\n\"Shadow Clone Jutsu.\" With that Naruto created two clones. \"Go.\" With that the clones charged in and did battle with Jiraiya. <br>\r\n\"What is he up to?\" Jiraiya then dispatched the clones and charged for Naruto.<br>\r\n\"I am sorry about this.\" Naruto said as he was holding up his Wind Rashuriken. He then throw it.<br>\r\nJiraiya then jumped out of the way. \"Naruto that was a feat but It is no use.\" Just then the Rashuriken disappeared and reappeared next to him and it hit him. The attack slashed Jiraiya in half and then fell to the ground. As his body was reforming he and Naruto talked. \"You can use the Flying Thunder God?\"<br>\r\n\"Yes, like my dad.\" Naruto said.<br>\r\n\"How?\" Jiraiya said.<br>\r\n\"When sealing Kurama, the Nine-Tails, in me he sealed his and my mom's chakra in me so that when I tried to control his chakra they could help.\" Naruto said.<br>\r\n\"I am sorry for not being in your life before you already became a ninja.\" Jiraiya said.<br>\r\n\"It is okay.\" Naruto said. \"This cursed Jutsu allowed me to see you one last time.\"<br>\r\n\"Well I think it is time.\" Jiraiya said.<br>\r\n\"I know.\" With that Naruto sealed Jiraiya away.<br>\r\nWith Sasuke and Yahiko. The two slashed each other and then Yahiko fell to the ground. \"So I last.\" Yahiko said. He turned around and then Sasuke was looking into Yahiko's eyes and he could not move his body.<br>\r\nJust then Naruto walked up. \"I see you won Sasuke.\" Naruto said.<br>\r\n\"You doubt me.\" Sasuke said.<br>\r\n\"Of course not.\" Naruto said.<br>\r\n\"Just finish me off.\" Yahiko said.<br>\r\n\"I will but not now.\" Naruto said. \"I have something I need to say to you first.\"<br>\r\n\"And what is that?\" Yahiko asked.<br>\r\n\"I am sorry for the loss of your friends.\" Naruto said. \"I don't expect your thanks but I needed to tell you that.\" With that Naruto took hold of Yahiko's hand and pumped fists with him.<br>\r\n\"Nagato entrusted our dream with you.\" Yahiko said. \"You are forgiven.\" With that Naruto sealed Yahiko.<br>\r\n\"That was nice of you.\" Sasuke said.<br>\r\n\"Thanks but much more is needed to be done.\" Naruto said and the two of them then headed off.</span></div></div>",

At this time she was seated looking at the Memorial Stone. \"Look at all this names on the list.\" She said. \"I wonder how many of this names are of those who dead because of the Nine-Tails Attack?\" She then stood up and said. \"How long have you been there?\" She then turned to see Haruto standing there. <br>\r\n\"Long enough.\" He said as he walked pass Kushina and looked to the stone. \"I despise it went a new name is added to this stone. If one dies they should  not need a stone to mark there existence in this world. Don't you agree?\"<br>\r\n\"I guess in some whys you make sense.\" Kushina said.<br>\r\nHaruto then started pass Kushina again before stopping. \"Can you still control your own actions?\"  Haruto asked.<br>\r\n\"Yeah I can.\" Kushina said.<br>\r\n\"Good now let's go.\" With that Haruto lead Kushina to Third Training Ground.<br>\r\n\"Why are we here?\" Kushina asked.<br>\r\n\"Well I thought that it only be right to fight is such a historical spot in the village.\" Haruto said.<br>\r\n\"Why is that?\" Kushina asked.<br>\r\n\"I will tell you later. First what is your name?\" Haruto asked.<br>\r\n\"The name is Kushina Uzumaki, and who would you be?\" Kushina asked.<br>\r\n\"I am Haruto Uzumaki. Hey there Grandma.\" Haruto said.<br>\r\n\"My grandson, who long has it been?\" Kushina asked.<br>\r\n\"Let me think, thirty-six years. Oh and before you ask, I am sixteen and then eldest child.\" Haruto said.<br>\r\n\"This is a lot to take in.\" Kushina said. \"I was a mother before I died and now I find I am a grandma.\" <br>\r\n\"Well Grandma, no Kushina, since we are to fight I think that we shouldn't get to close.\" Haruto said.<br>\r\n\"Do you talk to your other grandparents like that.\" Kushina asked.<br>\r\n\"It is only a grandfather but no. But he is still alive so fighting him would not be to the degree we will be.\" Haruto said.<br>\r\n\"Okay then, You should now that to beat me\u2026\" Kushina started to say.<br>\r\n\"Stop, I don't want your help as for as hints of your skills.\" Haruto said.<br>\r\n\"You remind me of myself a little.\" She then felt herself charging in and delivered a punch to Haruto. He blocked it, but he was sent back. \"I am stronger then I look.\"<br>\r\n\"That is an understatement.\" Haruto said. Just then Kushina delivered a kick to Haruto and he was knocked a side.<br>\r\n\"Are you not that strong?\" Kushina asked.<br>\r\n\"It has nothing to do with that but more of you are so strong.\" Haruto said. Kushina then delivered another kick but Haruto deflected the attack and made his own strike that sent her back but she then summoned her chakra chains and they wrapped around Haruto's leg and he was pulled with her. The two crashed into a tree.<br>\r\nThe both got up. \"That attack you did, your mother must be a Hyuga.\" Kushina said.<br>\r\n\"Right she is.\" With that Haruto cut the chakra chain with a chakra blade from his finger tips. <br>\r\n\"You love your mom and my son right?\" Kushina asked.<br>\r\n\"Yes I love both my parents. I also love my siblings.\" Haruto said.<br>\r\n\"Really.\" Kushina said as she charged in and kicked at Haruto but he jumped into the air to dodge. \"How many?\" Kushina launched a chain at Haruto to attack.<br>\r\nHaruto created a Shadow Clone to pull him out of the way of the chain and said. \"Including myself there are four Uzumaki children in the Leaf Village.\"<br>\r\n\"Really, what are there names?\" Kushina asked as she had the clone in the grip of the chain and used the clone to crash into Haruto but Haruto released the Clone so he got hit by only the chain. <br>\r\nHe landed on the ground and said. \"There is Naruko age fourteen, Kenta age twelve, and Shina age four.\" Haruto then charged in and struck Kushina, sending her back somewhat.<br>\r\n\"Why those names?\" Kushina asked as she charged in and released a barrage of punches and kicks. <br>\r\nHaruto dodged and/or blocked each attack and explained. \"Dad in his attempt at attention in his youth created a transformation jutsu that transformed him into the form of a busty young woman with out clothing to use on perverted ninja, well Naruko looked a lot like dad so they replaced the character of to in dad's name with the character ko.\" <br>\r\n\"That explains Naruko, what of Kenta?\" Kushina asked.<br>\r\n\"It was my grandfathers idea to call him that.\" Haruto said. <br>\r\n\"Okay.\" Kushina said.<br>\r\n\"You can guess that Shina is your namesake. In fact she has long red hair that she refused to have cut.\" Haruto said.<br>\r\n\"What about your name?\" Kushina asked.<br>\r\n\"As the first born I was born with the responsibility to do great things, so my name was to inspire me to sour to great distances.\" Haruto said as he broke through Kushina's attack and then formed a rasengan and thrust it into her gut. This also sent her back some distance. Haruto then ran to were she was. He saw that she was reforming her body. \"I am sorry for the damage that I have done to you.\"<br>\r\n\"It is alright, I needed that.\" Kushina said. \"Well I think if you are to seal me then this would be the\u2026\" Just then she felt something. \"What is going on?\" She asked as she felt chakra surging. \"The Nine-Tails but how?\" Just then Kushina had undergone a transformation and was in Version Two.<br>\r\n\"Version Two. But how?\" Haruto asked himself. Then it struck him. \"The chakra that was taken from me at the base.\" Just then Kushina charged at Haruto. Haruto then summoned his Nine-Tails Chakra Mode and used Chakra Claws to intersect Kushina.\"<br>\r\n\"What is that?\" Kushina asked.<br>\r\n\"This is Nine-Tails Chakra Mode, This is the result of someone who has complete control of Kurama's Chakra.\" Haruto said.<br>\r\n\"Kurama?\" Kushina looked confused.<br>\r\n\"Nine-Tails.\" Haruto said. \"Honestly, no wonder he is so dense.\" Haruto then throw Kushina into the air and then used Big Ball Rasengan and struck her with it. In a cloud of smoke, the nine tails of Kushina's extended and tied around his body and slammed him to the ground.<br>\r\n\"If you can get out do so and leave, I am about to use Tail Beast Bomb.\" Kushina said as she charged the attack up.<br>\r\n\"You think this will hold me down.\" Haruto then cut the tails and then jumped into the air. He then summoned a Wind Rashuriken and throw it at Kushina and it hit. After the attack hit Kushina was standing there as her body was reforming. <br>\r\n\"You are my grandson alright.\" Kushina said. \"If you are any indication for my son he has done well.\"<br>\r\n\"He has.\" Haruto said as he extended a chakra claw and it touched Kushina and he placed a seal on her.<br>\r\n\"Before being sealed, you never told me why this is so important an area.\" Kushina said.<br>\r\n\"Right and I did promise you that.\" Haruto said. \"Third Training Ground has another name. It is known as the Sannin Maker. You know why?\"<br>\r\n\"Now why?\" Kushina asked.<br>\r\n\"This training ground was used by two generation of Sannin. The Training area where my dad, your son started his career as a ninja at.\" Haruto said.<br>\r\n\"Is that so.\" Kushina said as she let a tear out. \"Thank you for humoring me by talking to me about yourself.\"<br>\r\n\"You are welcome, Grandma Kushina.\" With that Kushina smiled and then the seal was complete. Haruto then wiped his own tears and then looked to the sky. \"Hebimaru! I know you have been listening. Once we are done here you are next. That is a promise.\" Haruto said as he stuck his arm in the air.<br>\r\nMeanwhile elsewhere. Hebimaru was standing a top a tree and then said. \"I welcome the challenge, Haruto Uzumaki.\"</span></div></div>",

That is when Naruto spoke up. \"That is enough.\" Naruto yelled. \"This is what he wants. Orochimaru wishes to divide use but this is when we must stand together the most.\" <br>\r\n\"So what should we do?\" Asked one of the ninja.<br>\r\nNaruto turned and looked all around the room. \"A squadron will be sent out with the mission to locate and destroy Orochimaru's main headquarters.\" Naruto said.<br>\r\n\"Who are you sending on this mission?\" Asked another of the ninja.<br>\r\n\"I have already decided I will be sending the ninja that have had the most involvement with his latest activities.\" Naruto said.<br>\r\nAt this time elsewhere in the village the ninja that will be sent on this mission are readying themselves. As soon as they finished getting themselves ready they all met up at the main gate. First to arrive was Saisemaru Tanchikaki along with Rock Tai.<br>\r\nSaisemaru is wearing a black and green long-sleeved shirt and black pants, a white sash around his waist his sword hanging to his left side. He also had a dark gray armor on the consists of a chest plate, arm guards, and leg guards.<br>\r\nTai was dressed the same as he allows was but he had six smaller scrolls, three on each side, on the front of his vest and his arms were wrapped with bandages.<br>\r\nThe next to arrive was Koga Inuzuka and Kinmaru, as well as Sechida Aburame and Ayashi Hyuga.<br>\r\nKoga is wearing a long open black jacket with nothing under it but his gut was wrapped with bandages and black pants. On his arms were what look like black fingerless gloves.<br>\r\nKinmaru also had his gut wrapped with bandages as well as bandages on all four paws and he and a small pouch on his lower back.<br>\r\nSechida was in her normal clothing of a large collared shirt.<br>\r\nAyashi was wearing the standard uniform for the Leaf with arm guards.<br>\r\nThe next to arrive is the Ino-Shika-Cho trio of the generation, Inoko Yamanaka, Shikaro Nara, and Chokai Akimichi.<br>\r\nAll three are wearing the standard uniform but Chokai's vest is opened, Inoko had a tanto along the small of her back, and on Shikaro's back are two giant fans.<br>\r\nNext to arrive is Kei Yamanako.<br>\r\nShe wore the standard uniform but she had her sword on her back and had a large scroll on her back as well.<br>\r\nNext to arrive was Ryousake and Akiza Uchiha.<br>\r\nAkiza was dressed in the standard uniform but also had her black gloves on.<br>\r\nRyousake was dressed in the standard uniform but also had on a pale violet sash on with held his sword.<br>\r\nThen Morimaru arrive and he was dressed in the Leaf uniform as well.<br>\r\nThe final member arrived as Haruto Uzumaki.<br>\r\nHaruto wore the standard uniform but he wore a red long sleeve jacket with black flames along the base of it over his uniform wide open.<br>\r\nHaruto looked over the group. \"Okay friends, this is it, We now head out to find Orochimaru and stop his plans once and for all.\" Haruto said.<br>\r\n\"Not without use you don't.\" They turned to see the Tanuki Gang. They each were dressed slightly different. Jiriyu had a dark blue arm guard on his left arm and he was wearing a longer dark blue hooded cloak. Mar had a firework launcher on his back and his shoulders had armor on them. Byo was wearing a skin suit under her clothes and it looked that her backpack had been upgraded.<br>\r\n\"What do you want?\" Kei asked.<br>\r\n\"We want to help.\" Jiriyu said. \"If Orochimaru is successful then chances are there will be no one to still from anymore. Also it was one of his men that took my arm so there is that.\" <br>\r\n\"You are lucky that we need all the skilled fighters we can get.\" Ryousake said to them.<br>\r\n\"As I was saying.\" Haruto continued. \"I can't guarantee that we will come back alive but I will make this promise. No one will die with out a fight on my watch.\" With that everyone gave out a shout. Then let us leave. With that they left the village.<br>\r\nMeanwhile from atop a building in the distance, Naruto was seeing the young ninja off. \"Be safe Shinobi, you too thieves.\" With that Naruto went off.<br>\r\nAbout half way out the group stopped. \"Why are we stopping here?\" Jiriyu asked.<br>\r\n\"We are waiting for someone.\" Haruto said.<br>\r\n\"Who?\" Mar asked.<br>\r\n\"Us.\" The Tanuki Gang turned around and then saw it was the team from the Sand Village that tried to caught them.<br>\r\nThey also were dressed differently. They each wore the sand's uniform but they still had there personal touches; Akina's Gourd, Mentai's turban and sword, and Dakashi's mask and cap.<br>\r\n\"Why are you here?\" Mar asked defensively.<br>\r\n\"I asked for their help.\" Jiriyu said.<br>\r\n\"What! Why?\" Mar asked.<br>\r\n\"We need as much help as we can get so deal with it.\" Jiriyu said to Mar. Jiriyu then turned to Haruto and asked. \"How do we find them?\"<br>\r\n\"Ryousake would you answer that?\" Haruto asked.<br>\r\n\"Very well.\" Ryousake then took out a scent pad. \"This continues the scent of the poison stored in the claws from one of the poison users.\"<br>\r\n\"How will that be of use?\" Mentai asked. <br>\r\n\"Scouts tracked the path of the owner of the claws, Braco, in hopes he would lead them to the location of the base but all they found was Braco's body.\" Ryousake said.<br>\r\n\"And why is that of importance?\" Mentai asked.<br>\r\n\"Because he was missing the hand opposite to the one my father took the claws from which we assume they retrieved.\" Ryousake said.<br>\r\n\"Well, even if that is the case it is still a risk.\" Mentai said. \"Even if that is true we have no idea if that would help us find the base.\"<br>\r\n\"Even if we are not lead to the Main base it will lead use to one of the bases.\" Sechida said.<br>\r\n\"Not to disagree with my teammate but we have a problem.\" Koga said. \"The poison was stored in body to the Leaf so there is no way to back track the scent with. Kinmaru's sense of smell and mine may not be enough to find them with out a starting point.\" <br>\r\n\"Excuse me, but I may have some insight into where we can start searching.\" Morimaru said.<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" Koga asked.<br>\r\n\"First I should inform you that all the ninja revived the body used as their base were Pseudo-Zetsu clones. Orochimaru's attempt at creating Zetsu level of beings to use as new bodies.\" Morimaru said.<br>\r\n\"Your point?\" Shikaro asked.<br>\r\n\"Zetsu was born from cultivating cells of the First Hokage, I my body homes similar cells so I could read the bio-structure of the real body, but I need one of this bodies, alive or dead, to read.\" Morimaru said.<br>\r\n\"Would this work?\" Kei asked as she took the scroll of her back. \"I sealed a former Root Agent that was resurrected in here.\"<br>\r\n\"Are you that dump, bringing a resurrected ninja with you into battle, that is so stupid.\" Inoko said to her sister.<br>\r\n\"Actually that was smart.\" Haruto said. \"Can you read the cells while it is sealed?\"<br>\r\n\"Well I could try but I may only get as much as a general location.\" Morimaru said.<br>\r\n\"How general?\" Saisemaru asked.<br>\r\n\"The Nation, at least.\" Morimaru said.<br>\r\nKoga looked to Kinamaru and then they both looked to the others and Koga said. \"We can manage that.\"<br>\r\n\"Okay then let's do it.\" Haruto said.<br>\r\n\"Okay.\" Morimaru said as he took the scroll from Kei. \"I need you to crack the seal a little.\" <br>\r\n\"Okay.\" Kei said as she weaken the seal. At that Foo started to leave the scroll. Then Morimaru stuck his hand out and then a seal appeared on his hand and the same appeared on Foo. Then images appeared in Morimaru's head. <br>\r\n\"I got it.\" Morimaru said. \"Rebuild the seal.\"<br>\r\n\"Got it.\" With that Kei rebuilt the seal and Foo was pulled back into the scroll.<br>\r\n\"What did you see?\" Inoko asked not expecting anything useful.<br>\r\n\"The Land of Rice Fields.\" Morimaru said. \"Of course, that would be the last place one would look, in plain sight.\" <br>\r\n\"Well then let's go and find him.\" Jiriyu said. With that they all departed. </span></div></div>",

Met back here in one hour.\" Ryousake said and they left.<br>\r\n\"So what do we do?\" Mar asked.<br>\r\n\"We pay a friend of ours a visit.\" Jiriyu said. <br>\r\nThe Tanuki Gang made their way to a tavern called the Greasy-Sweet Lizard. Jiriyu entered the tavern and sat at the bar. \"Hello my may main man, What can I get you bro?\" The bartender/owner asked Jiriyu. The owner is a man with dark blue, slicked-back hair with a goatee dressed in a green suit with a red shirt on underneath. He has gold rings on his right ring finger. <br>\r\n\"You have done for yourself Dichima.\" Jiriyu said.<br>\r\n\"Jiriyu!\" Dichima looked left and right and then whispered. \"What you doin' here you cracker case?\"<br>\r\n\"Relax I need information and you are just the person that will know what I need.\" Jiriyu said.<br>\r\n\"Well this is one cat in the know of everything in this wide crazy under-stomach. What you need?\" Dichima said.<br>\r\n\"Info on the Big White Snake.\" Jiriyu said.<br>\r\n\"You and I need to have this rap session.\" Dichima said as he took out a cigarette case and took out one, placed it in to his mouth and lit it before giving it a puff. \"What you give me for my words?\"<br>\r\n\"You want more business?\" Jiriyu asked. \"If Orochimaru is gone then more people will came out and enjoy themselves.\"<br>\r\n\"I dig your view man. Okay, I will lay dirt on you.\" Dichima said. \"The skinny is that the Big White and Duel Head Snakes have been canned. The Little Snake has become big boss.\"<br>\r\n\"Is that so.\" Jiriyu said. \"Where is the snake's lair?\" <br>\r\n\"The snake use burrows to get from place to place but the main nest is always the same.\" Dichima then took out a piece of paper with directions on them and slipped it to Jiriyu. \"Take care bro.\"<br>\r\n\"Same to you.\" Jiriyu said as he took Dichima's hand and then he left.<br>\r\nOnce outside. \"Well.\" Mar asked.<br>\r\n\"Everything is perfect.\" Jiriyu said. With that they head for the rendezvous point.<br>\r\nA few minutes later Dichima closed his tavern and head out somewhere. Dichima was heading for the true location of the Orochimaru's base, The center base of the Hidden Sound Village. When Dichima thinks he is in the clear he got caught in a trap. \"What is down? Let me up.\" Dichima said.<br>\r\n\"As expected from a weak minded person as yourself.\" Byo said as the Tanuki gang stepped out and looked up at Dichima.<br>\r\n\"What is big deal with turning my world right side down?\" Dichima asked.<br>\r\n\"I know there are only two things that you care about truly, money and your own skin.\" Jiriyu said. \"How much are you getting for informing Hebimaru on our activities?\" <br>\r\n\"Enough, that is all I need to tell you, Cracker Case.\" Dichima said.<br>\r\n\"You have told use plenty.\" <br>\r\n\"Who said that?\" Dichima asked. Then walked out Haruto. \"You are working with the Greenies, not Greasy.\" Dichima said.<br>\r\n\"Don't worry we will not tell Hebimaru about your help in finding him.\" Jiriyu said.<br>\r\n\"Too late, he would have known the moment you danced your way into this land.\" Dichima said.<br>\r\n\"Well then that works for us.\" Haruto said as he and the Tanuki Gang left.<br>\r\n\"Hey Let me down from here bro.\" Dichima yelled.<br>\r\nA few minutes later the squad was already in position. Ayashi and Haruto are using there Byakugan to look into the base so to direct Jiriyu as he plants explosives to draw much of the enemy forces out of the village. Once Jiriyu returned it was time to move on the to next step. \"Okay Tanuki Gang, it is up to you.\" Haruto said.<br>\r\n\"Time to steal the show.\" Jiriyu said as he spun his pole-arm around. The Tanuki Gang then approached the entrance. \"Mar you are on.\"<br>\r\n\"Right time to release my firework masterpiece. \"Fire Style: Napalm Stream Explosion.\" At that the ground around the base entrance erupted and created an explosion that looked more like a wild blaze It then spread towards the entrance and then explodes. Several ninja left from the entrance before the explosion  and then were about to attack  but then a mist appeared around them.<br>\r\n\"What is this?\" Asked one of the ninja.<br>\r\n\"Mist made from my special mixture of water and poison.\" Byo said as she from the safety of here Backpack.<br>\r\n\"And now you are going to take a little nap.\" Jiriyu then sent lighting chakra to his prosthetic arm and then launched a light infused kunai into the mist which the water caused the lighting the be sent through the mist and shocked the ninja. \"You will either be paralyzed by my lighting or the poison of Byo's mist. Just then another unit of ninja from the sound arrived. \"Looks like we need to retreat.\" Jiriyu then launched several smoke bombs and then the ninja ran after the three intruders. As the smoke spread and the ninja left the shinobi of the Leaf and Sand ran into the base. Once inside they then head for a unoccupied room to ready themselves to continue the mission. As soon as they finished that they then headed out to look for the three targets, Orochimaru, Kabuto, and finally Hebimaru. <br>\r\nMeanwhile Hebimaru was informed about what had just happened. \"This is too covenant to be a coincidence.\" Hebimaru said.<br>\r\n\"Seems like the Leaf has made there counter move on you.\" Orochimaru said.<br>\r\n\"Orochimaru you misunderstand. I want this.\" Hebimaru said. He then made his way to Orochimaru's throne, Orochimaru's and Kabuto's cages hanging on either side as Hebimaru is watching all that is happening.<br>\r\nThe Shinobi have arrived at a room with several path ways. \"Which way should we go?\" Chokai asked.<br>\r\nHaruto and Ayashi looked around with their Byakugan. \"The walls are admitting a strange chakra.\" Ayashi said.<br>\r\n\"So Hebimaru knows we are here.\" Haruto said.<br>\r\n\"There is one way to kind him.\" Ryousake said. \"He and I both have signed a contract with the snakes of Ryuchi Cave. That should be enough to allow me to sense him.\"<br>\r\nJust then walls fell then separated the squad into smaller groups. \"Hey can you hear me?\" Haruto asked the others. They each answered in there own way yes. <br>\r\n\"It is too dangerous for use to face either of the targets with only a small group we will need to find a way to meet up again.\" Ryousake said. <br>\r\n\"Understood. All this pathways are likely to lead us to someone or thing that is to slow down or stop us so  we have to be careful meeting up again.\" Haruto said.<br>\r\n\"Right. Good thing Sechida already planted one of her insects one each of us.\" Koga said. \"At least we will be know if each other are okay are not?<br>\r\n\"Let's go and be safe.\" With that each group headed down one of the pathways.</span></div></div>",

The two sisters then hid themselves as a small group of Sound Ninja approached.<br>\r\n\"Search for the intruders and remember Master Hebimaru said to try and bring them alive.\" Said the sound captain.<br>\r\n\"Yes sir.\" The other sound ninja said.<br>\r\n\"Once they leave we will be able to get out the way they came.\" Inoko said. Just then the sound ninja were attacked and pinned to the ground by  Ink Lions.<br>\r\n\"Who is there?\" The captain said. Just then Kei dropped down in front of the captain. The captain then charged in to attack but then Inoko jumped out and kicked the Sound captain in the head.<br>\r\n\"Thanks sis.\" Kei said.<br>\r\n\"What were you thinking?\" Inoko said to Kei. \"Your lions won't last long enough to hold them forever and once they do get out then they will inform Hebimaru and take us to him and with out the others we don't stand a chance.\" <br>\r\n\"Sorry did you say something?\" Kei asked.<br>\r\n\"You were not listening again were you?\" Inoko asked. \"You are as dense as dad.\"<br>\r\n\"I am aware that they will get free.\" Kei said. \"That is why I attacked them. You and I are not strong fighters overall and Akiza is the better medic of us so she is the better choice to treat the other's wounds. Also with out Shikaro, Chokai, or both of them, you are not that useful in the field. Right now we are better suited as decoys. You understand sis.\"<br>\r\n\"I understand.\" Said Inoko. \"But you could have at least told me your plan telepathically.\"<br>\r\n\"Sorry but I needed to move before they started off and I couldn't risk you arguing with me, letting them get away.\" Kei said.<br>\r\n\"You are so dense.\" Inoko said to herself about her sister. \"So what are we going to do about them?\"<br>\r\n\"Well there is one thing that we could do?\" Kei said. She then told Inoko the plan telepathically.<br>\r\n\"Are you crazy?\" Inoko asked but then she agreed to go along with the plan.<br>\r\nMeanwhile down another path Tai, Koga, and Kinmaru have been fighting off the Sound Ninja sent to caught them while rushing through the pathway. \"There is no end to them?\" Koga said. \"Good that means we are getting close to Hebimaru.\"<br>\r\n\"Well these minions are giving use a good warmup but we need to save our strength for the real battle.\" Tai said.<br>\r\n\"Come on so we are facing a few small fries big deal.\" Koga said.<br>\r\n\"There they are.\" Said another bunch of sound ninja as they approach.<br>\r\n\"Looks like our warm-up isn't over yet.\" Tai said as he, Koga, and Kinmaru charged at the know group of ninja.<br>\r\nDown other pathway, Shikaro and Chokai had just traveled through the pathway and found themselves in a large room. \"What is this room for?\" Chokai asked.<br>\r\n\"Looks like this is where they 'train' their ninja.\" Shikaro said.<br>\r\n\"So you are as smart as they say.\" Just then Kiira dropped to the ground. \"So I have to take out a lazy brainiac and a at loser.\"<br>\r\n\"Something you should know, You never call me Fat!\" With that Chokai charged in to attack but Kiira blocked the attack. <br>\r\n\"You think I would anger you an not be able to take your punch.\" Kiira said. Just then he felt his body being restricted.<br>\r\n\"Shadow Possession Complete.\" Shikaro said.<br>\r\n\"You think so.\" Kiira said as he then underwent a transformation. His skin turned gray and he bulked up more. \"Now I will Kill you two.\" With that Kiira charged at them.<br>\r\nElsewhere, Ayashi and Sechida were searching for the way out of the pathways. \"Anything Yet?\" Sechida asked.<br>\r\n\"No not yet. What about you?\" Ayashi asked and Sechida shuck her head. \"We have to hurry and find the way out of here.\" <br>\r\n\"Stop worrying about Haruto, he is find.\" Sechida said.<br>\r\n\"I know that but I still worry.\" Ayashi said.<br>\r\n\"Everything will be alright just relax.\" Sechida said.<br>\r\n\"Thanks Sechida. I just needed to her it from someone I trust.\" Ayashi said.<br>\r\nMeanwhile down another pathway Akina and Dakashi were making their way down the pathway. Dakashi noticed a worry look on Akina's face. \"Something on your mind Akina?\" Dakashi asked.<br>\r\n\"It's noting much, I am just worried about Mentai.\" Akina said. \"He may not work well with the Leaf's Swordsman.\" <br>\r\n\"You make a good point Akina, but I think we should be more worried for ourselves.\" Dakashi said.<br>\r\n\"Why? We seem to be able to handle ourselves.\" Akina said as they approached a door that she entered. <br>\r\n\"You may be right again.\" Dakashi said as he entered the room through the door as well, leaving a hallway littered with sand covered and weapon covered sound ninja.<br>\r\nMeanwhile with Saisemaru and Mentai. The two of them have come across sound ninja and have been slashing them up. At this point the two were back to back. \"How many have you taken out?\" Mentai asked.<br>\r\n\"That last one makes ninety-five.\" Saisemaru said.<br>\r\n\"I had already taken that many out and now I am in the hundreds.\" Mentai said. <br>\r\nJust then  ten sound ninja attacked towards Mentai but Saisemaru then jumped in front of him and then slashed all ten ninja at once. \"Looks like I am catching up.\" Saisemaru said.<br>\r\n\"I am not getting out done by you Saisemaru.\" Mentai said as he to charged in and attacked sound ninja that were heading his way.<br>\r\nMeanwhile Ryousake and Morimaru were making there way down the Pathway they were in, taking out the ninja they encounter, they then reached a room. Before entering Morimaru said to Ryousake. \"Listen Ryousake, before we go in there I think I should tell you that once we go in there there is a high chance that we will be attacked by one of Branches.\" <br>\r\n\"Right the Branches.\" Ryousake said.<br>\r\nFlashback:<br>\r\n<i>\"So Hebimaru has made his move.\" Morimaru said to the entire group. \"This could be trouble for us. It is very likely we will have to deal with the Branches.\"<br>\r\n\"What are the Branches?\" Shikaro asked.<br>\r\n\"Hebimaru is not the type of person to to engage an enemy on his own, so he had recruited among Orochimaru's forces eight shinobi that serves him and him alone that are the most powerful.\" Morimaru said.<br>\r\n\"Who much do you know of the Branch.\" Mentai asked.<br>\r\n\"I only know of two members in detail, Akagetsu and Kiira, the Hawklings.\" Morimaru said.<br>\r\n\"Hawklings?\" Haruto asked.<br>\r\n\"They are clones of the male members of Team Hawk, Suigetsu and Juuro respectively.\" Morimaru said. \"They also Hebimaru's most trusted men.\"<br>\r\n\"Why is that?\" asked Inoko.<br>\r\n\"This two were assigned as Hebimaru's teammates. So Hebimaru had longer to manipulate them into serving him.\" Morimaru said.<br>\r\n\"So as they are his teammates that means it is safe to assume that they are as strong as Hebimaru.\" Jiriyu said.<br>\r\n\"We can't assume that they are just as strong as Hebimaru.\" Ryousake said.<br>\r\n\"Right, Hebimaru could be stronger.\" Morimaru said. \"Also since we are going in there if we are to face any of the Branches then the battle field is likely to be made for that member in particular.\"<br>\r\n\"Don't worry We will be careful in there.\" Haruto said. <br>\r\n\"Okay.\" Morimaru said.</i><br>\r\nFlashback End:<br>\r\n\"Don't worry Morimaru we will be ready for whatever they throw at us.\" Ryousake said as he turned the nob of the door and he and Morimaru entered.<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Haruto and Akiza had made there way through their pathway without any Sound Ninja attacking them. \"Something is off. Akiza said.<br>\r\n\"You are right, it is too quiet.\" Haruto said. \"Hebimaru would have sent someone to try and stop us. If no one has attacked us yet there must be a reason?\"<br>\r\nJust then as if by cue a wall dropped down and blocked their path. \"Looks like out you are right.\" Akiza said. Just then the floor under them started to move. They both got out of the way but when the floor stopped moving there was a set of stairs going down. \"Looks like this is an invitation.\" Akiza said.<br>\r\n\"Well it is not like we have much of a choice.\" Haruto said. \"Let's go.\" With that the two headed down the staircase. They were then ran through an opening they then exited into what looked like a giant arena. \"This again.\" Haruto said. Just then a cage door dropped, blocking the way they came in from. <br>\r\n\"Looks like this is where we are to fight.\" Akiza said.<br>\r\n\"Very smart of you to say.\" Said a voice.<br>\r\n\"Hebimaru, where are you?\" Haruto asked.<br>\r\n\"I am somewhere were I can enjoy this fight with out having to dirty my own hands.\" Hebimaru said. Just then the other gates opened and then several other ninja jumped into the arena. \"The individuals still conscious will be let free. All you have to do is take out the two Leaf Ninja before you.\" He said in a voice that sounded like Orochimaru. <br>\r\n\"Let's go.\" All the imprisoned ninja said as they attacked.<br>\r\n\"Looks like we have our fight.\" Haruto said.<br>\r\n\"Yeah it does.\" Akiza said. \"Let's take care of this.\" With that the two fought the imprisoned ninja off. </span></div></div>",

Trust me.\" Kei said telepathically from the body of the other sound ninja.<br>\r\nThey soon are approached by another sound ninja. \"You caught two of them, good.\" The sound ninja said. \"Follow me. Lord Hebimaru has arranged a special cell for them.\"<br>\r\n\"After you.\" Kei said.<br>\r\nThe sound ninja lead the two of them into a large room. \"Hey this doesn't look like a cell.\" Inoko said. <br>\r\n\"You are right...it is more like a grave.\" The Sound ninja said, the last part in a more sinister tone of voice. The sound ninja then pulled a giant scythe out and swung it at the two.<br>\r\nThey returned to their own bodies in time to get away but the two Sound ninja they were possessing were not as lucky. \"I told you that your plan would not work.\" Inoko said to Kei.<br>\r\n\"Not now.\" Kei said. \"Who are you?\"<br>\r\nThe Sound Ninja then took hold of his shirt and then pulled them off to reveal is true self. \"Everyone call me Shinigami.\" He said.<br>\r\nShinigami<br>\r\nAge: Unknown. <br>\r\nRank: Jonin Strength.<br>\r\nAppearance: mid-length white hair and black eyes, black hooded robes with a rope sash, black lower face mask on, Giant Scythe in his hands.<br>\r\nVillage: Sound.<br>\r\n\"Shinigami! We're in trouble, lets get out of here.\" Inoko said.<br>\r\n\"I doubt we could get out of her even if we wanted to at this point.\" Kei said. Shinigami then swung his scythe again but they dodged. Shinigami then continued to attack. <br>\r\n\"Stop moving already. The sooner you standby the sooner you will die.\" Shinigami said as he slashed at them again but they dodged. \"It is hopeless to dodge, I can keep this up longer then you can dodge my attacks.\" He then slashed again but they dodged. <br>\r\n\"He is right.\" Inoko said to Kei telepathically. \" This room does not give us much room to move about. There must be something we can do.\"<br>\r\nJust then Shinigami swung his blade and it was heading for Inoko but Kei then intersected it. \"Hey why are you not cut up?\" Shinigami asked.<br>\r\nKei was holding the Scythe back her sword. \"I will not let you hurt my sister.\" Kei said.<br>\r\n\"Why are you protecting me? After the why I treat you You should let me be killed.\" Inoko said.<br>\r\n\"You call me stupid. We are family so I would never let anyone hurt you.\" Kei said telepathically. \"Now hurry up and suppress his mind.\"<br>\r\n\"Right.\" Inoko said telepathically. \"Mind Transfer Jutsu.\" With that Inoko took over Shinigami's body. She then draw back the attack. <br>\r\n\"Thanks sister.\" Kei said as she picked Inoko's body up.<br>\r\n\"You are welcome.\" Inoko said in Shinigami's body. She then throw away his scythe. \"Okay go on.\" <br>\r\n\"Right.\" Kei then summoned ink snakes that bond Shinigami's body.<br>\r\n\"Okay now I will explore this guy's mind.\" Inoko said as Shinigami went into a trance and Inoko then started to examine his mind. Just then Shinigami's body started to move on his own. Inoko was then forced out of the body.<br>\r\n\"What have you done?\" Shinigami said as he got up and then broke out of the ink snake. He then grabbed his scythe and charged for Inoko but then Inoko and Kei blocked the attack with there swords. They then both slashed the scythe blade and broke it. \"My Scythe, How dear you!\" Shinigami said. He then bulled out another scythe. \"Just kidding.\"<br>\r\n\"How are we going to deal with this freak.\" Inoko said telepathically to Kei.<br>\r\n\"I don't know but we will think of something.\" Kei answered her back. The two then charged in to Shinigami and he jumped back. \"You saw that right?\" Kei asked Inoko telepathically. <br>\r\n\"Yes I did.\" Inoko answered back. <br>\r\nThe two then dashed at Shinigami. \"Just die.\"  He then started to swing his scythe but then dodged the attacks. Then Shinigami swung and got both of them. \"Finally got you.\" Just then the two turned to ink. \"Ink Clones.\" Just then Kei and Inoko appeared behind him. \"I will kill you.\" He then tried to swing but he then saw that his scythe was stuck in the wall. \"What?\" Kei and Inoko then both slashed his shoulders and cut then straight through. \"My arms. How did you now?\" <br>\r\n\"The way you swung your weapon was limited but forceful. Only possible with mechanical arms.\"<br>\r\n\"I will not stand for this.\" With that Shinigami took hold of a kunai in his mouth after biting through his mask. He then charged at them but then both slashed and decapitated him.<br>\r\n\"Say hello to the real Shinigami, Shinigami.\" Kei said.<br>\r\n\"You are so uncool at times.\" Inoko said. \"But that is way I love you sis.\" <br>\r\n\"Thanks.\" Kei said as the two headed out.</span></div></div>",

The room they entered consisted of a cross shaped path with a pool of water at each corner of the room. \"Water that could mean only one thing.\" Morimaru said. Just then water shot up from one of the pools and head straight for the two. <br>\r\nRyousake draw his sword and blocked the incoming attack and then the water turned and then landed in front of them. It then started to take form. It was Akagetsu's upper body. \"You are a strong one, Ryousake.\" Akagetsu said.<br>\r\n\"Akagetsu, why do you serve Hebimaru? I need to know this.\" Ryousake asked.<br>\r\n\"Fine you want to know. It is simple.\" Akagetsu then shot himself up and pulled his sword out and said. \"I love killing and by working for Hebimaru I will always have people to kill. And you two are going to be next...\" Ryousake took his sword to block but Akagetsu turned and head for the pool next to him and then shot up and attacked Morimaru. \"...traitor.\" <br>\r\n\"Morimaru.\" Ryousake said as he throw four kunai at Akagetsu but he deflected them and they each landed into one of the pools. He then ran to Morimaru. \"Good the wound was shallow. What do you mean by traitor?\" <br>\r\n\"Morimaru was our spy to Orochimaru's own spy network.\" Akagetsu said. \"It is he who arranged for the information of that led you to the attack on the Leaf.\" With that Akagetsu attacked again but the moment his blade hit Ryousake's body he was electrified. \"What but how is it that you were able to focused after learning someone you trusted betrayed you?\"<br>\r\n\"Simple. I never trusted him in the first place\u2026 Until know.\" Ryousake then swung his own sword and when it hit Akagetsu's body started to turn to steam. <br>\r\n\"Ah!\" Akagetsu said. He then tried to head for the pull but then he got electrocuted again. \"Ah! What is going on?\" Akagetsu said as he help his sword up.<br>\r\n\"Morimaru told the village all about his connections with Orochimaru and his network and he swore allegiance the the Leaf and I do trust him on that.\" Ryousake said. \"As for the water, I electrified it so you will not be able to use it to rehydrate yourself.\"<br>\r\n\"It doesn't matter.\" Akagetsu said as he reformed himself and then put on a black cloak. \"I will still kill you.\" Akagetsu then charged at Ryousake again and the two clashed swords. Akagetsu pushed back and then started a series of hand-signs. \"Water Style: Water Bullet Jutsu.\" With that Akagetsu shot a stream of water at Ryousake. <br>\r\nRyousake then formed Hand-signs of his own and used his jutsu. \"Fire Style: Fireball Jutsu.\" With that he shot a ball of fire ball and then two attacks intercepted and canceled each other out, creating a veil of steam. <br>\r\nAkagetsu then tried to attack in the steam but Ryousake blocked the attack and sent a stream of lighting through his blade into Akagetsu's, shocking him and forcing himself back. \"But how, the chakra in that steam would have made it impossible for you to detect me even with the sharigan.\"<br>\r\n\"You are right. But I was able to sense you.\" Morimaru said as he got back on his feet.<br>\r\n\"I took you out of with my attack, how are you able to move?\" Akagetsu asked.<br>\r\n\"It seems like my skills with wood jutsu was enough to allow me to take a wound like this and still be able to fight.\" Morimaru said.<br>\r\n\"Well it does not matter because I will still kill the two of you.\" Akagetsu said. He then charged at them. Ryousake then charged as well and slashed through both Akagetsu and his sword and cut the blade in two. \"Why can't I move?\" Akagetsu said as he laid on the ground.<br>\r\n\"In the moment before my attack hit I had already placed you under my Genjutsu.\" Ryousake said. \"You will not be able to escape that.\" He then turned to Morimaru and said. \"Let me heal you and then we can get out of here.\"<br>\r\nMorimaru made his way to Ryousake and was in the process of being healed. At this point Akagetsu was still in his own world in the genjutsu. Just then he made his way to one of the pools and then fell in. Just then Something emerged from the water. \"What is going on?\" Morimaru asked.<br>\r\nAkagetsu then rose up from the water in the form of a wave in the form of giant demon fish. \"Now You die.\" With that he charged at them but then Ryousake released his Susanoo. It looked like a giant warrior with four arms. Each arm had arm guards and its body was covered from head to waist with armor. Ryousake then held back Akagetsu's attack with his giant broad sword. \"Why am I getting so much weaker?\" Akagetsu asked himself.<br>\r\n\"You just jumped into a electrified body of water.\" Morimaru said. \"It is amazing that you are still awake at this time.\"<br>\r\n\"I Will not die.\" Akagetsu said as he pushed towards Ryousake. <br>\r\n\"You fool.\" With that Ryousake's broadsword lit up with a black fire. He then slashed throw the wave and once it hit the flames continued to burn.<br>\r\n\"I will never go down.\" Akagetsu said as he charged again but then Morimaru created a wooden box around Akagetsu. \"This will not hold me.\"<br>\r\n\"It is not to do that?\" With that Ryousake set the box on fire and then Morimaru created a second box around the first.<br>\r\n\"Okay, He is out cold.\" Morimaru said. With that Ryousake put the flames out and then Morimaru closed the second box off.<br>\r\n\"He may not be dead but in his current state he will not be able to get out.\" Ryousake said.<br>\r\n\"Even if he does the wood will absorb the water he tries to use.\" Morimaru said.<br>\r\n\"Well let's get going.\" Ryousake said as Morimaru picked the box up and placed it on his back.

Just then a small group of sound ninja were running towards them. <br>\r\n\"Looks like we spoke too soon.\" Ayashi said.<br>\r\n\"Wait the way they are moving, it is as if they are running from something.\" Sechida said. Just then a blast of heat hit them but they were far enough that they only felt some heat but the sound ninja were not that lucky. They were all burned to ashes. \"What did this?\" Sechida asked.<br>\r\n\"Not what who.\" Ayashi said. As he used his Byakugan.<br>\r\nJust then a man came into view. \"Who is that?\" Sechida asked.<br>\r\nThe man stopped and looked to them. \"So this two are the ones I will be burning.\" The man said. \"The name is Netsu.\"<br>\r\nNetsu<br>\r\nAge: Unknown.<br>\r\nRank: Jonin Strength.<br>\r\nAppearance: Red, yellow, and orange spiked hair, yellow eyes, red, yellow, orange jacket and pants.<br>\r\nVillage: Sound.<br>\r\n\"Netsu, why did you do this to your own men?\" Ayashi asked.<br>\r\n\"This? I was simply on my way here so to kill the two of you like how Lord Hebimaru instructed.\" Netsu said.<br>\r\n\"You, monster.\" Ayashi tried to charge in but the heat was too much and sent him back. \"What was that?\"<br>\r\n\"I don't know but clearly we can't bet close to him.\" Sechida then swarmed Netsu with her insects in hopes to find a weakness in his jutsu, but they all incinerated. \"No all my insects. I didn't see him use a single hand sign.\"  <br>\r\n\"It is pointless, Lord Hebimaru enhanced my already existing heat producing bloodline trait so I can increase the heat of the air around me to a point that it would burn what ever comes near me.\" Netsu said. \"I am afraid to tell you but you can't beat me since you can't get near me.\" Netsu then charged passed the two and then they got hit by a heated gust of air.<br>\r\n\"Ah!\" Sechida said as she was blasted back along with Ayashi.<br>\r\n\"Sechida, you okay?\" Ayashi asked.<br>\r\n\"Yeah. But what are we going to do?\" Sechida asked. <br>\r\n\"We may have a chance.\" Ayashi then placed something into Sechida's hand and then charged at Netsu.<br>\r\n\"It is pointless to resist.\" Netsu said as he got hit by Ayashi. \"How?\"<br>\r\n\"I am not only a Hyuga but I also am a Water chakra type so I can use the water in the air to reduce the heat.\" Ayashi said.<br>\r\n\"That is smart but it will make things worse.\" With that said the air got hotter. \"When I am asleep or my chakra is blocked the amount of heat produced reaches critical levels. That is way I work alone.\" Netsu then hit Ayashi but Ayashi then struck again and sealed away more chakra points. <br>\r\n\"Then I will seal them all so the heat can't escape.\" Ayashi said.<br>\r\n\"That won't help.\" Netsu then bear hugged Ayashi. \"Even if you seal it from coming out I can just store the heat in my body and then explode taking all of us with me.\" Just then Netsu started to heat up but then his grip loosened and he fell to the ground. \"What happened?\"<br>\r\n\"My insects fed on your chakra.\" Sechida said as she walked up to Ayashi.<br>\r\n\"But how, I destroyed all you insects?\" Netsu said.<br>\r\n\"Not all of them.\" Ayashi said. \"I found one that was still alive and then gave it to Sechida as I gave her time to create enough generations so they gain heat resistance.\"  <br>\r\n\"That is a smart move but not smart enough.\" He then ripped off his jacket to reveal explosion tags. \"I still will take all of you with me.\"<br>\r\n\"Earth Style: Colony Uprise.\" With that the earth below Netsu sucked him down and then a giant ant hill was formed. When the explosion went off the hill was destroyed but there was no other damage. \"You were cursed with such a skill and you wasted it.\" Sechida said.<br>\r\n\"Let's go we need to get you to safety while you repair your forces.\" Ayashi said.<br>\r\n\"Ayashi, thank you.\" Sechida said. With that Ayashi took Sechida somewhere to rest before continuing on.</span></div></div>",

The two were know standing in front of a giant door. \"There is a chance will encounter more resistance in there.\" Saisemaru said.<br>\r\n\"Just don't get in my way.\" Mentai said as they entered the room. After entering the room they took a quick glance around. The took was filled with large tubes. Each of the tubes had a person in them. \"What is Hebimaru doing with this people?\"<br>\r\n\"I don't know.\" Saisemaru said. <br>\r\n\"Well what do we have here?\" The two looked to see someone approaching them.<br>\r\n\"Who are you?\" Saisemaru said.<br>\r\n\"The name is Puraimu.\" The man said.<br>\r\nPuraimu  <br>\r\nAge: Unknown.<br>\r\nRank: Kage Strength.<br>\r\nAppearance: Long pale tan hair, gray eyes, white top and pants, black sash around was and a sword hanging on his side. a white bone-like mask piece on his chin that looks like a human's lower jaw. <br>\r\nVillage: Sound. <br>\r\n\"Well Puraimu, since you are hear you must have answers on what is with all the people in the tubes.\" Mentai said.<br>\r\n\"Why would I tell you anything?\" Puraimu asked. \"I mean you are too weak to take me on.\"<br>\r\n\"Why you!\" Mentai then charged at Puraimu and draw his sword to send a slash of wind to slash him but there was no damage. \"What?\" Mentai said. Puraimu then took his hand and thrust it forward. Mentai dodged the attack but part of his vest got hit and he saw that the thrust pierced it. \"If that had hit I would have been as good as dead. I need to try something else.\" Mentai then swung his sword multiple times to find a weak spot in Puraimu's defense. <br>\r\n\"Pathetic move to make.\" Puraimu then blocked each of the slashes with his arm.<br>\r\n\"He blocked my attacks with his arm.\" Mentai said. He zoned out until he heard Saisemaru's voice. <br>\r\n\"Mentai watch out.\" <br>\r\nMentai zoned back in when he saw Puraimu in front of him. Mentai tried to guard but it was too late he was struck in the gut. \"Weak Ninja. You are nothing compare to me?\" Puraimu said.<br>\r\n\"Is that so?\" Mentai said. He stood to his feet. Puraimu wandered how he survived his attack until he saw sand fall to the ground from his gut. \"The Sand Armor, a gift from the Kazekage.\" <br>\r\n\"Whatever.\" Puraimu then turned to Saisemaru. \"Hey way are you not helping him?\"<br>\r\n\"He asked me to not get in his way.\" Saisemaru said.<br>\r\n\"Whatever.\" Puraimu then held his hand out and charged a orb of chakra that he then launched towards Mentai.<br>\r\n\"I am still dazed from that last attack, I can't dodge this.\" Mentai said. Just then Saisemaru appeared next to Mentai and then after placing a hand on his shoulder the two disappeared and the Orb missed them. <br>\r\n\"I did not finish my thought, Puraimu. I didn't interfere until know because he asked me not to but... I also didn't think I was needed until know.\" Saisemaru said.<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" Mentai asked as he was kneeling on the ground do to the speed he had just been moved.<br>\r\n\"That orb was a Sen Blast Ball, a technique used by Hebimaru's Advance Curse Transformation users.\" Saisemaru said. He then turned to Puraimu and then in a demanding tone asked. \"Puraimu, how is this possible?\" Puraimu then pulled out from inside his shirt a piece of cloak. \"That cloak, it is from the uniform of one of my clan.\" He said to Mentai.<br>\r\n\"This cloak is what remained of a ninja that possessed a sword with special properties.\" Puraimu said. \"Between the time of the ninja's capture and his death, Lord Hebimaru developed a means to increase the strength of his Curse Creations.\" <br>\r\n\"And what is this means?\" Mentai asked.<br>\r\n\"I think I know.\" Saisemaru said as he glanced at first his blade then the blade around Puraimu's waist.<br>\r\n\"Right, we sealed our former selves into our Blades.\" Puraimu said. \"But how do you know about the inspiration for this process?\"<br>\r\n\"I am Saisemaru Tanchikaki, my clan are the last wielders of the power of Soul Cutters.\" Saisemaru said.<br>\r\n\"Is that so.\" Puraimu said as he charged at Saisemaru. Saisemaru slashed him and cut him. \"I see, only a power like mine can have a chance at harming me. Good to know.\"<br>\r\n\"I get it now, you are the first to be created successfully. Then I will also make you the last.\" Saisemaru said as he swung his sword and Puraimu raised his arm to block.<br>\r\n\"Soon I will not be the only one.\" Puraimu said as he swung his arm and Saisemaru jumped back to dodge. \"That's right, all you can do is dodge.\"<br>\r\n\"That is where you are wrong.\" Saisemaru then raised his sword and as he gathered chakra into it he then swung it and launched blade of chakra at Puraimu. When it hit it slashed Puraimu across the shoulder. <br>\r\n\"You cut me, no one has ever came close to doing that to me.\" Puraimu said. \"I will kill you all for that.\" With that he formed chakra orbs around his his and then started to shot them at high speed. Saisemaru dodged the attack and disappeared. \"Where is he?\"<br>\r\nSaisemaru appeared behind Puraimu and slashed at him as he turned. \"Give up. You can't win.\" Saisemaru said.<br>\r\nPuraimu caught himself and said. \"I will not give up.\" He then draw his sword and then charged in to attack. <br>\r\nThe two clashed. They then met blade to blade and then glared at each other. Saisemaru then asked. \"Why are you fighting for Hebimaru?\"<br>\r\nThe two pushed back and then there blades met again and Puraimu said. \"Lord Hebimaru created me like with all others. For that I serve him with my life.\"<br>\r\n\"So that is why you serve him, Still I can't allow such monsters to roam free.\" Saisemaru then swung his blade and when it hit it pushed Puraimu back. <br>\r\n\"That attack, it seems stronger somehow.\" Puraimu said. \"But how?\"<br>\r\n\"Looks like you noticed.\" Saisemaru said. \"Here is one more secret to Soul Cutters. They are an extension of the wielder's self.\"<br>\r\n\"So what about it?\" Puraimu asked. \"Just because that blade is part of you means nothing.\" <br>\r\n\"It has a lot to do with how my attacks seem to be getting stronger.\" Saisemaru said. <br>\r\nJust then the tubes with the people in them that decorated the walls all got slashed  open and the liquid in them started to flood the room. The three in the room jumped out of the way of the incoming fluids and then started to stand a top it. \"What happened?\" Puraimu asked looking around. \"How did this? It was you Saisemaru.\"<br>\r\n\"Sorry but it was me.\" Mentai said as he slashed behind him and cut the door they came in from and the fluid started to run out of the room, lowering them to the ground. \"I took advantage of fight to destroy your siblings.\" <br>\r\n\"I will not stand this.\" Puraimu said. \"He then disappeared and slashed at Mentai.<br>\r\n\"Gale Guard.\" With that Mentai used his wind chakra enhanced blade to block the attack.<br>\r\nSaisemaru then appeared behind Puraimu and then slashed him  with that both Saisemaru and Mentai jumped away from Puraimu's body. \"It is over.\" Saisemaru said.<br>\r\n\"Not yet.\" Puraimu said as he turned to face them.<br>\r\n\"His Steel Skin is strong enough that that was not a killing plow.\" Saisemaru said.<br>\r\n\"I will not be done in so easily by a weak little fool like the two of you.\" Just then chakra appeared around Puraimu.<br>\r\n\"This technique!\" Saisemaru said.<br>\r\n\"You know how your blade is known as a Soul Cutter, the blade I use has a name as well. It is known as a Returning Blade, know why?\" Puraimu asked. \"It is in this blade that my curse powers have been sealed in which I can access again and be even stronger.\"<br>\r\n\"I am not going to let you.\" Mentai said as he charged in to attack.<br>\r\n\"Mentai, watch out.\" Saisemaru said.<br>\r\n\"Slay, Asesino!\" With that chakra engulfed Puraimu.</span></div></div>",

But when he tried to get up is arm felt numb. \"My arm.\"<br>\r\n\"What did you do?\" Saisemaru asked he then got a look at Puraimu.

Get it the more we fight together the stronger we get.\"<br>\r\n\"So what? I will kill you before you can get strong enough to even scratch me.\" Puraimu said as he charged at Saisemaru but he then raised his blade and was pushed back.<br>\r\n\"There is more, you see I am not just any ninja.\" Saisemaru said.<br>\r\n\"Why you.\" Puraimu then charged at Saisemaru.<br>\r\n\"Saisemaru get out of the way our you will be killed.\"  Mentai yelled.<br>\r\n\"Bankai.\" With that Saisemaru's chakra engulfed him and then he raised his blade and it made contact with Puraimu's claw. Puraimu then jumped back. \"Chakura Bijuukibaken Kurokuama.\" Saisemaru's sword now was a red bladed Katana. Also his body now was shrouded with a cloak that looked like it was made of furry tails.<br>\r\n\"I don't care what type of change you made I will kill you none the less.\" With that Puraimu charged at Saisemaru but he disappeared and reappeared as he struck Puraimu with his sword he then was sent back. \"That was nothing.\"<br>\r\n\"Look again.\" Saisemaru said. <br>\r\n\"What how?\" Puraimu asked as he saw his arm bleeding but his armor intact. \"I will kill you.\" The two then clashed and exchanged blow for blow.

Saisemaru deflected the attack and then charged in and managed to stab Puraimu. \"I will not go down.\" Puraimu said as he charged chakra to his claws and then slashed at Saisemaru. The attack hit but Saisemaru's bankai took most of the attack. \"You are still too weak to beat me.\"<br>\r\n\"Is that what you think?\" Saisemaru said. \"If so then you are mistaking.\" Saisemaru then charged at Puraimu with his sword ready.<br>\r\n\"You fool.\" Puraimu said as he ready to attack again. <br>\r\nSaisemaru's cloak took most of the damage and he continued to charged in he swung his sword and launched a blade of chakra as he slashed at close range. \"Grand Hunter.\" The attack slashed through Puraimu.<br>\r\n\"How did you beat me?\" Puraimu asked.<br>\r\n\"My Bankai cloak not only shields me from damage, It also absorbs the chakra from my opponent's attack and convert it into my own for my attack.\" Saisemaru said.

He then took his kunai launcher and then fired it. Akina then used sand to covered the kunai and it head straight for Shuta and then crushed the launcher. He then fell the to ground. \"You are strong but strength is everything.\" He then summoned a second kunai launcher. \"But power does not hurt.\" With that he summoned a giant cannon that was pointed up. He then inserted the launcher into the cannon. He then squeezed the trigger and then then giant kunai were launched into the air and then as they fell they crated craters and cracked the ground. The two then jumped into the air. \"Got you.\" Shuta then pulled the kunai launcher out of the cannon and then fired two kunai at them. When they got near they blow up. When the smoke cleared Shuta thought he won but then a sand lance was through his chest as well as three puppets holding a blade to his back. \"You killed me.\" With that his head dropped and then they let him drop to the ground.<br>\r\n\"That was a close won.\" Akina said.<br>\r\n\"Yeah it was.\" Dakashi said as he picked his mask.<br>\r\n\"You know I don't mind the scars.\" Akina said.<br>\r\n\"Really, Well I don't want to scare other people.

The remaining sound ninja stepped out of the way so not to get in the way of the incoming ninja.<br>\r\n\"Who or what is that?\" Asked Koga.<br>\r\n\"You what to know who I am?\" Shinku asked. \"I will tell you.\" Shinku then placed his head on Koga's shoulder and screamed. \"None of your business!\" He then got readied to decapitate Koga when Tai acted.<br>\r\n\"Dynamic Entry.\" Tai then managed to kick Shinku in the head and sent him across the room.<br>\r\n\"Thanks for the save.\" Koga said.<br>\r\n\"Don't thank me yet.\" Tai said.

The two hit and tore Shinku in half. \"Recover from that!\" Koga said.<br>\r\n\"Why should I?\" Shinku said as then his lower half ran towards Koga and started to kick using the knife in the shoe to slash him up.<br>\r\n\"What is with this crazy guy?\" Koga asked.<br>\r\n\"Hey who are you calling crazy?\" Shinku's top half said in Koga's face but then he got stabbed in the back by his own foot blade. <br>\r\n\"Hey you know you have a knife in your back?\" Koga asked.<br>\r\n\"ReallY?\" Asked Shinku as he placed his two halves back together and his healing ability bond the two together. He then reached and pulled the knife out. \"No big deal.\" He then throw it away and it hit one of the sound ninja in the room in the forehead. \"Direct Hit.\" He said.<br>\r\n\"He is really un stable.\" Koga said to himself. <br>\r\n\"Well back to the dirty work.\" Shinku said as he picked his swords up and ran for Koga. <br>\r\nKoga ready himself for the attack but Tai moved in front of Koga with his swords in hand and clashed with Shinku. \"Sorry but three have a greater chance then just two to winning against this type of opponent.\" Tai said.<br>\r\nKoga and Kinmaru charged Shinku with piercing fang and they hit. \"You have a point.\" Koga said.<br>\r\nTai then slashed at Shinku and then said to Koga. \"I know I do.\" <br>\r\n\"Those two are weird, tight wolfie?\" Shinku asked Kinmaru and Kinmaru bit Shinku's hand off. \"Ah! My hand my beautiful hand. What will I ever do without my hand?\" Shinku asked in one of his tangents. Just then as he held his stub of a hand out, it shot out a strange yellow liquid towards the three. They dodged out of the way and then show as the floor that the liquid hit start to melt.<br>\r\n\"Acid.\" Tai said. \"Kinmaru drop it.\" <br>\r\nWith that Kinmaru spat out the hand and it then reattached to Shinku's wrist. \"Thank you.\" Shinku said.<br>\r\n\"What is with this man?\" Koga asked.  <br>\r\n\"We need to think of a way to end this.\" Tai said.<br>\r\nKinmaru then started to growl. \"That may work but we would need to go full out with this one.\" Koga said.<br>\r\n\"I don't speak or understand canine but I think I know what he is thinking.\" Tai said. \"Let's do it.\" With that said Kinmaru charged in first.<br>\r\n\"Here puppy, come here.\" Shinku said. Then as Kinmaru got near Shinku pulled out a giant scroll. \"This is for biting me you bad dog.\" He swung it down but Kinmaru entered his Were-Mode and swat the scroll back at Shinku. It hit him in the face and revealed that a metal club was wrapped by the scroll. \"Puppy you have grown so much.\" Shinku said as he was being held by Kinmaru in Were-Mode. <br>\r\nKinmaru then let out a growl. \"Right.\" Tai said as he  charged in and kicked Shinku into the air.<br>\r\n\"I can fly!\" Shinku screamed. Tai then appeared above him with Leaf Shadow and then wrapped him with his arm wraps before pushing off and then took two scrolls out and then used Twin Rising Dragon and hit Shinku with a barrage of weapons. \"Ouchy.\" Shinku said as his body was covered with weapons of various types and sizes. Still wrapped in the wraps Tai then tossed Shinku into the air. <br>\r\n\"It is all you.\" Tai said to Koga.<br>\r\n\"Right. Shadow Clone Jutsu.\" With that Koga created two clones. \"Now Combined Beast Transformation.\" He and his clones then transformed into a giant three headed Wolf. \"Now, Tail Chasing Fang Fang Rotating Fang.\" With that Koga rotated chasing his tail, ripping Shinku to shreds. <br>\r\n\"Pinata-man has arrived.\" Shinku said. He then reformed. \"Up and rapido.\" He then charged in with his swords in hand. Just then his body blow up and slathered them with his guts.    <br>\r\n\"Gross.\" Koga said as he transformed back.<br>\r\n\"Well it worked.\" Tai said. \"Sorta.\"<br>\r\nJust then the guts and chunks of flesh gathered to one location and then they spun around to form a twister. When the twister faded there stood Shinku unharmed. \"Ta da!\" He then faced the three and said. \"That was uncool, blowing me up like that. I wanted to do that.\" He said laying and the floor, acting like a baby. He got up and said. \"Now the real fun will begin.\"<br>\r\n\"Not if we don't let you.\" Tai said as he stood before him and then when Shinku attacked he missed. <br>\r\n\"No that is not right.\" He said as he then attacked again but again he missed and then he got hit. \"Hey!\" Shinku attacked again but he missed and was hit several more times. \"You are boring me.\" He then tried to go at Koga but Tai hooked Shinku with his foot and then slammed him down back in front of him. That is it I will Kill you all.\" With that he started to bulk up and his top and gloves ripped to pieces. \"I will kill all of you with Chain Reaction. Using my chakra...\" Tai then attacked him and at that Shinku returned back to his normal muscle mass. \"Hey I was saying something.\" Shinku then but a shirt and gloves on that had the same amount of damage as before his show of strength. <br>\r\n\"You want to fight me?\" Tai said sluggish.<br>\r\n\"Well If you want it.\" Just then as Shinku took a step his body went stiff and he fell to the ground. \"I can't move, this is not an act I really can't move. Why can't I move?\" <br>\r\n\"While you were being thrown around and torn to pieces each part of your body got marked with a seal that, combined with the rest, act to make you immobile.\" Tai said.<br>\r\n\"Okay, And unless I am torn about to the same level the seal can not be broken.\" Shinku said. This surprised Tai and Koga. \"I lived in a village with seals masters for some time I catch on to some things. How did you dodge me until the seal came into effect?\"<br>\r\n\"As a boy I once accidentally took a sip of my mom's sake, that is when it was found that I, like my dad can use Loopy Fist, I have perfect memory so I am able to remember the sensation of being drunk so I can us Loopy Fist at will.\" Then to himself he stated. \"But I still get a major headache after.\"<br>\r\n\"So what now?\" Shinku asked.<br>\r\n\"Others could try and free you either on purpose or accidentally trying to kill you so...\" Tai said as Kinmaru in Were-Mode lifted Shinku over his shoulder and then went to his normal stated, relocating him to his back. \"...Will have to take you with us.\" With that they headed to find the others.</span></div></div>",

Just then one of the gates opened up and out walked their next opponent. \"Haruto Uzumaki, Akiza Uchiha, let me introduce you to Uzu.\" <br>\r\nUzu<br>\r\nAge: Unknown.<br>\r\nRank: Jonin Strength.<br>\r\nAppearance: Blue Swirl Mask, short red hair, body wrapped in bandages, black pants, Tan Jacket with gray top under. Sword on his back.<br>\r\nVillage: Sound.<br>\r\n\"So what is he? A clone, a curse creature? Spill, what is he?\" Akiza asked.<br>\r\n\"I don't see anything special with his chakra.\" Haruto said. \"But looks can be deceiving. Uzu, do you speak?\"<br>\r\n\"Yes I do.\" Uzu said.<br>\r\n\"Before we fight tell me, what reason do you serve Hebimaru?\" Haruto asked.<br>\r\n\"My reasons are my own.\" Uzu said. Uzu then draw his sword out and charged at Akiza.<br>\r\n\"Akiza.\" Haruto yelled. <br>\r\nAkiza managed to block that attack with a kunai. \"That was a nice block but it will not help you much.\" Uzu said as he placed his free hand on his blade and sent chakra into it and his sword started to cut through the kunai. Uzu then add force the the blade and then as it was slashing through Akiza jumped back to get away from the blade. \"You dodge well as well.\" <br>\r\n\"An Opening.\" Haruto said to himself as he throw shuriken at Uzu. Uzu then jumped out of the away. Haruto then charged in with a kunai in hand and charged at Uzu. Uzu then clashed with his kunai with his sword. Uzu sent wind chakra into his blade but it did not cut the kunai. <br>\r\n\"So you use Wind Chakra as well.\" Uzu said as he swung his sword but Haruto blocked and counter using his kunai. The two then separated and looked to be winded. \"So you are good.\" Uzu said. <br>\r\n\"He hasn't seen anything yet.\" Haruto said to himself.<br>\r\nJust then Akiza then shouted. \"Uzu!\" Out of reflex he turned around to see Akiza in the air performing hand-signs. \"Take this Fire Style: Rising Dragon Nova.\" With that she charged in and hit Uzu with her punch. the bandages around his body set on fire and the force of the punch was enough to crack ribs. Akiza then landed next to Haruto.<br>\r\n\"That was a nice move but what if he blocked it?\" Haruto asked.<br>\r\n\"You said it yourself he had no special properties.\" Akiza said. \"Come on we should go and find the others.\" Akiza then started off running but then someone appeared and struck her.<br>\r\n\"Akiza!\" Haruto yelled. <br>\r\nAkiza looked to see that Uzu was still standing. \"How is it that you are not dead?\"<br>\r\n\"That is my business.\" Uzu said as he was about to slash her but Haruto managed to get between them and deflected the attack and then took hold of Akiza and rushed himself and her far from Uzu.<br>\r\n\"You okay Akiza?\" Haruto asked.<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I am fine.\" Akiza said.<br>\r\n\"Good.\" Haruto then turned to Uzu. Uzu placed his right hand on his left shoulder and then sent chakra through it and the fire was blown from his arm. With the fire gone Haruto show scars and burns on his arm. Also with his byakugan, Haruto show that the ribs have moved back into place and chakra was being used to keep into place and suppress the wounds to his internal organs. \"He is holding himself together with chakra.\" Uzu then pick his sword back up and  charged in to attack. Haruto blocked the attack and knocked Uzu's sword from his hand. Uzu then throw a punch that Haruto blocked and then delivered a kick that Uzu caught and then Haruto spun to deliver a kick to Uzu's face but he leaned back and pushed Haruto away. Uzu then pulled out kunai and throw them at Haruto but Haruto deflected them using his Gentle Fist art. Haruto and Uzu then land on there respective sides and then charged at each other with a kunai in hand and then clashed. \"Holding yourself together with only your chakra must be a hassle while in the middle of a fight.\" Haruto asked.<br>\r\nThe two then clashed with their kunai again and Uzu said. \"I have been thought this for some time and I got use to it.\" Haruto then got a slash in on Uzu's right arm and he then jumped back clenching the arm. \"A clean cut, good work.\" Uzu said as he placed his hand over the wound and then used chakra to suppress the bleeding. He then charged in and started to attack Haruto but Haruto fought back and got Uzu in a deadlock. \"So what are you going to do? I may be unable to get an attack through but the same can be said for you.\"<br>\r\n\"Is that so?\" Haruto asked. Just then another Haruto appeared above Uzu with a Rasengan in hand.<br>\r\n\"Nice attack but.\" Uzu said as he was about to dodge but then he felt something take hold of his legs. He looked to see a pair of arms holding his legs. \"Smart.\" Uzu said to himself. He then got hit by the rasengan. After the attack hit both the Haruto that used the rasengan and the pair of arms disappeared. The attack caused his mask to fall off and as it hit the ground it shattered. He got up and his face was revealed. When he stood up the face surprised Haruto.<br>\r\n\"How is it possible, your face.\" Haruto said. Save for the red hair and the few facial scars Uzu looked just like Naruto Uzumaki, down to the whisker-like birthmarks. \"What trick is this?\" Haruto asked.<br>\r\n\"Does my face offend you this much?\" Uzu asked. \"Sorry but I can't help the way I look.\" Uzu then rushed for Haruto and as he was charging he grabbed his sword and ran in to thrust the blade through Haruto. But Akiza knocked Haruto out of the way and got hit in the shoulder. <br>\r\n\"Akiza!\" Haruto said as he regained his footing. He then charged in to thrust at Uzu but he dodged. Haruto then grabbed Akiza. \"This wound is bad.\" <br>\r\n\"She got in the way I am not at fault but fell free to still fight me with the same amount of emotion.\" Uzu said.<br>\r\n\"It is alright, this wound is nothing to me?\" Akiza said.<br>\r\n\"Stop lying.\" Haruto said. He then entered his Nine-Tails Chakra Mode. \"I am not skilled at medical ninjutsu but hopefully this can help.\" Haruto then transferred the Nine-Tails chakra to Akiza and a one-tailed cloak surrounding her.<br>\r\n\"Thank you.\" Akiza said as she then started to heal herself using the nine-tail chakra to accelerate the process.<br>\r\n\"Now as for you, Uzu.\" Haruto said as he turned around to face Uzu. \"Let's dance.\" With that Haruto charged at Uzu at high speed. Uzu did his best to block the attack but was still sent back.<br>\r\n\"You have gotten stronger.\" Uzu said. \"This chakra seems to be the Nine-Tail's.\"<br>\r\n\"You seem to be well informed on such things.\" Haruto asked as he throw a punch and Uzu blocked it. \"How is that?\" <br>\r\n\"I have my ways.\" Uzu said as he took his sword and slashed it but Haruto used a chakra arm to caught the blade and then Haruto formed a rasengan and then thrust it into Uzu's chest sending him back. \"That was a good attack.\" Uzu then fell to his knees. \"What did you do?\"<br>\r\n\"I used a Gentle Fist thrust with that Rasengan to shut of the chakra points in your chest.\" Haruto said.<br>\r\n\"That was a good move but, I will have to kill you even if my own life is forfeit.\" Uzu said as he gathered chakra to his fist and was ready to charge at Haruto. \"Wind Tunneling Fist.\" <br>\r\n\"I will not let that happen.\" Haruto then held his and out and then shout a chakra claw the pierced Uzu's chest.<br>\r\n\"This will not stop me.\" Uzu said.<br>\r\n\"I know that.\" With that chakra engulfed Uzu and then he disappeared.<br>\r\n\"You okay?\" Akiza asked.<br>\r\n\"Yeah.\" Haruto said as the Nine-Tail Chakra recede. \"Now let us go.\" With that they headed off.<br>\r\nMeanwhile with Hebimaru. He was seated in Orochimaru's Throne room. \"Looks like your Ace has been dealt and been beat.\" Kabuto said.<br>\r\n\"Looks can be deceiving.\" Hebimaru said. \"Plus, who said I dealt my Ace out?\" With that Hebimaru got himself off the throne and then headed out with the two in the cages being carried after him.<br>\r\nMeanwhile elsewhere, Uzu was waking up. \"Where am I?\" He asked as he sat up. <br>\r\n\"Calm down, I just finished healing your wounds but the damage is still intense so it will take time to heal.\" Akiza said.<br>\r\n\"How am I even alive?\" Uzu asked.<br>\r\n\"I sealed you in to another dimension using my chakra claw.\" Haruto said.<br>\r\n\"Why did you do that?\" Uzu asked. \"I am your enemy?\"<br>\r\n\"True but, I have questions for you.\" Haruto said. \"Starting with who are you really?\"<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" Uzu asked.<br>\r\n\"Your face, it looks just like my dad's but you are too young. How is that possible?\" Haruto asked.<br>\r\n\"You are talking about Naruto Uzumaki right?\" Uzu asked. \"Well okay to answer you question, I am a clone.\"<br>\r\n\"Impossible, there is not way that Hebimaru gained my dad's DNA.\" Haruto said. Just then Uzu laughed. \"What is so funny?\"<br>\r\n\"I never said I was a clone of Naruto Uzumaki. I was created using DNA for Minato Namikaze and Kushina Uzumaki, mixed together and this is the Product of the mixture.\" Uzu said. \"Another thing Hebimaru did not make me, Kabuto under Orochimaru's orders did.\"<br>\r\n\"Okay next question, why were you fighting for Hebimaru?\" Haruto asked. <br>\r\n\"Still haven't found it out yet. I am not fighting for Hebimaru but against the Sound from the inside.\" Uzu said.<br>\r\n\"Why?\" Haruto said.<br>\r\n\"At the time the Sound lacked the acceleration agent to speed aging so I had to be raised from youth.\" Uzu said. \"Orochimaru left me in the care of a childless couple. I became their son but when I was old enough that I could be trained, I was taken from them and to make sure I could not return they were killed.\" Uzu said.<br>\r\n\"He is that cruel?\" Akiza asked.<br>\r\n\"He is that and worse. He he had me train till there was no one left for me to fight at a time.\" Uzu said.<br>\r\n\"So why are you fighting for Hebimaru?\" Haruto asked.<br>\r\n\"I wish to get close enough to him to take him out, him and his father.\" Uzu said.<br>\r\n\"Well you are not going anywhere yet.\" Akiza said. \"This wounds are too sever.\"<br>\r\n\"I understand.\" Uzu said. \"I will not get in your way so you can just leave me here.\" <br>\r\n\"Okay.\" Haruto said and he and Akiza left to try and meet with the others.</span></div></div>",

In this room they found the rest of the team have already arrived. \"Looks like we all made it here.\" Koga said.<br>\r\n\"What a sweet reunion.\" Shinku said.<br>\r\n\"Shut up.\" Koga said in a yell. \"Why did we have to bring him with us again?\" <br>\r\n\"He is crazy but he still has information of on Hebimaru.\" Ryousake said. \"So why would you serve Hebimaru?\"<br>\r\n\"Why tell you? What could you offer me to make me talk?\" Shinku asked.<br>\r\n\"Candy.\" Ryousake said holding a piece of candy in his hand.<br>\r\n\"He placed a seal on me that makes it that I can't kill members of the higher ups of the Sound Village, which includes himself so I serve him because he allows me to kill anyone else that I wish.\" Shinku said. \"Oh and there is a snake in me that has a fragment of his chakra in my body so chances are that he now knows where you all are.\" Just then three Sen-Balls were coming towards the group. Kinmaru then transformed into his Were-Mode and then throw Shinku in the way of the attack and he took all three blasts. \"Ouchy.\"<br>\r\n\"Man I hate it when he ruins the surprise.\" Hebimaru said walking towards the group. On either side of his was a Curse creature carrying a cage. In each cage was one of two people. The one on the right had Kabuto, the one on the left held Orochimaru himself. There was a third one in front of Hebimaru. \"But you figured that I had done something to him right Ryousake?\" <br>\r\n\"A loose wire like Shinku in your ranks, some precaution had to be made.\" Ryousake said. \"So what are you going to do? You are not the hands on type.\"<br>\r\n\"You are right, I am not.\" Hebimaru said. Just then the Curse creatures that were each holding the cages were drained of there body fluids and then out of each of their bodies shot out a black snake. The Snakes then head for Morimaru.\"<br>\r\n\"Morimaru! Watch out!\" Haruto said. <br>\r\nMorimaru dodged and tried to fight the snakes off but then got by and then head into the casket containing Akagetsu. Water then shot from the hole and then it collected the remains of Shinku and then Shinku reformed back on his feet and then the water reformed into Akagetsu. \"Surprise!\" Shinku said.<br>\r\n\"Looks like round two is to begin for me.\" Akagetsu said. \"Shinku, loan me one of your swords.\"<br>\r\n\"Sorry no can do, I don't loan my blades to anyone.\" Shinku said.<br>\r\n\"No big I have a few swords from them to choose from.\" Akagetsu said. Just then he held his hand out and then in his hand landed a sword. \"This will do for now, thanks Lord Hebimaru.\"<br>\r\n\"No problems.\" Hebimaru said as he jumped on top of the remaining Curse creature and sat on his shoulder. \"Just take take them out and have fun. Oh and Akagetsu I resend you from Shinku's seal.\"<br>\r\n\"Good now the party will really begin.\" Shinku said as he charged in and then started to slash at everyone. The all kept on their feet and dodged Shinku's attacks to the best of their abilities.<br>\r\nRyousake, Saisemaru, and Mentai were rushing in to attack Shinku but then Akagetsu jumped in and blocked both of their path. \"Sorry but you three are not going anywhere.\" Akagetsu said. \"You three are the best in using swords so you three will have the best swords to choose from after I kill you.\"<br>\r\n\"How do you expect to do that.\" Mentai asked as he charged in and swung his blade to attack with a wind slash.<br>\r\n\"This is how.\" Akagetsu then swung his sword and created a blade of wind. When they collided it left moisture behind.<br>\r\n\"What is that?\" Mentai asked.<br>\r\n\"A way to your end?\" Akagetsu then charged in and swung his blade. Ryousake ran in and blocked the attack but felt a chill. \"Too easy.\" Akagetsu then readied a punch but Saisemaru appeared, blocked the punch and kicked Akagetsu back. \"That was not nice.\" <br>\r\n\"So is trying to act all high and mighty.\" Saisemaru said.<br>\r\n\"Well I am stronger then you.\" Akagetsu said.<br>\r\n\"You thinks so?\" Saisemaru asked. \"That is cute.\"<br>\r\n\"Why you!\" Akagetsu then charged in and slashed but Saisemaru then caught the blade with his free hand. \"What! Is what I would say if I didn't already expect you would do this.\" Just then Saisemaru's hand got slashed.<br>\r\n\"Saisemaru, what happened?\" Mentai said as he and Ryousake charged in and sent Akagetsu back. \"What did he do to you?\"<br>\r\n\"Your hand, it has been exposed to low temperatures.\" Ryousake said. \"How is that even possible?\"<br>\r\n\"Know you die.\" Akagetsu said as he charged in to attack. Just then Akagetsu got kicked in the head and it bursted into water. Ryousake, Mentai, and Saisemaru used this the chance to retreat to a better distance. Akagetsu reformed his head and then shouted. \"Okay who is the dead man that just attacked me?\" He was a little stunned to see that it was Kei that attacked him.<br>\r\n\"Are you okay Saisemaru?\" Kei asked with out looking at him.<br>\r\n\"Yeah.\" Saisemaru said as he was warming his hand up. \"I will be fine.\"<br>\r\n\"Good to hear.\" Kei said. <br>\r\n\"Akagetsu has a trick that he has been holding off on.\" Ryousake said. \"We are going to have to find out just what that is before he is defeated.\"<br>\r\n\"Not likely.\" Akagetsu said. \"One more person will not change a thing as I still will win and kill all of you.\"<br>\r\n\"Not if we have anything to do with it.\" Saisemaru said as all four bared their blades for battle.<br>\r\nMeanwhile the rest of the group are doing their best to stop Shinku's 'fun.' \"Keep on your toes we can't let him get close enough to attack us.\" Koga said as he and Were-Mode Kinmaru were dodging in coming shuriken from Shinku.<br>\r\n\"We know that but it is not like we can simply ask him to stop.\" Shikaro said jumping back.<br>\r\n\"Why not?\" Tai asked as he deflected the incoming attack. \"I mean he may be convinced to help us.\"<br>\r\n\"How do you expect to tempt him to do that?\" Chokai asked as he was dodging an attack.<br>\r\n\"If he wishes to kill for fun way not ask him to kill Hebimaru, Orochimaru, and Kabuto for us.\" Inoko suggested.<br>\r\n\"That won't work.\" Shikaro said. \"He is not the type of person that listens to others. Also do you not remember that there is a seal that prevents him from killing his superiors. But...\" Shikaro then managed to block a slash from Shinku. \"Shinku, do you like being told who to fight against?\"<br>\r\n\"Are you kidding me?\" Shinku asked in a serious tone. \"Of course I hate it.\" He said with his eyes tearing. \"But what am I to do? The seal prevents me form killing the hire ups.\" <br>\r\n\"Here me out.\" Shikaro said as the two pushed each other back. \"Hebimaru is the one that placed the seal right?\"<br>\r\n\"Right.\" Shinku said.<br>\r\n\"Also he over through Orochimaru right?\" Shikaro asked.<br>\r\n\"Yes, go on.\" Shinku said as he placed his hand on his chin.<br>\r\n\"Well if Hebimaru is in charge doesn't that mean that Orochimaru and Kabuto no longer hold the title as your boss.\" Shikaro said. \"And chances are that you could accidentally kill Hebimaru in the cross fire.\"<br>\r\n\"You are right.\" Shinku said as he stabbed himself in the hand. \"Stay right there I  will kill Orochimaru and Kabuto for sure and then  I will be back to kill the rest of you.\" Shinku said as he skipped away like a happy school girl.  \"It is not my style really but this could bring the biggest chance at victory. Shinku then reached into his pouch and then pulled out a giant kunai and then stuck it into the ground. It was then revealed that there were explosion tags on the kunai. He then worked to the kunai a wire and then unraveled a line of it out. He then took out a match box and then took out a match. \"This will do the trick. He then lit the match but as he got it close to the wire but the match went out. \"That is strange?\" He tried again but the some thing happened. He tried again but it was the same. He took the last match. \"One more try.\" He then lit the match and then moved the wire to the match. It lit up. \"Finally.\" The wire lead the fire to the kunai but it lead it his back and then he show that the kunai was stuck in his back. \"Oh...\" With that the explosion went off. When the explosion went off Shinku was standing there, his clothes were in shreds. \"Not cool.\" He said.<br>\r\n\"So Shinku, you know that you will not do that again right?\" Hebimaru said.<br>\r\n\"Yeah of course. For know.\" Shinku said the last part quietly.  \"Well at least I can have my fun.\" He turned around to see that the entire group was gone. \"Hey where you all go?\" He then ran around looking for where they were.</span></div></div>",

Ryousake and Kai got out of the way but that freed Akagetsu inn time that he used his sword to create his own chakra blade strike to redirect the attack.<br>\r\n\"He attacked with ice, but how?\" Ryousake said.   <br>\r\n\"Did you notice?\" Kei asked.<br>\r\nRyousake then started thinking and then remembered what it was that Kei must have mentioned. \" You mean that the jewel on the glove he his wearing glow right before his body froze? Yes I did.\" Ryousake then faced Akagetsu and in a demanding tone asked. \"What is with that glove you are wearing?\" <br>\r\n\"So you finally noticed.\" Akagetsu said as his body turned back to it's former state. \"You want to know about this?\" Akagetsu asked as he held his right hand up to show he was sporting a light blue glove with a light green jewel in it. \"One of Lord Hebimaru's side projects. You how about the primary chakra types. Fire, Wind, Lightning, Earth, and Water.\" They each gave a nod at that statement. \"You also should know that an average a ninja has only one of this chakra types unless they have a bloodline trait or if you train yourself to do that but with out a bloodline trait at most two are the limit.\"<br>\r\n\"Your point?\" Mentai asked.<br>\r\n\"Lord Hebimaru has found a way to harness the elements and allow one to use said element.\" Akagetsu said. \"The jewel in the glove I wear is from the element of wind.\" <br>\r\n\"That does not explain your use of ice.\" Mentai said.<br>\r\n\"You are such an idiot. I am naturally a water chakra type. By mixing the chakra together I can form Ice chakra.\" Akagetsu said.<br>\r\n\"Well that still does not explain how your attack canceled mine.\" Mentai said as he charged in.<br>\r\nAkagetsu blocked the attack and said. \"The reason is simple.\" Both sword users were then sent back. \"You are a wind chakra user but it is a hot wind. Thanks to the Ice chakra I perfected the use of my wind is cold. The two attack simply intersect and the temperature cancel them out.\" <br>\r\n\"So to put it simply hot and cold can't be used against each other.\" Kei said.<br>\r\n\"Exactly.\" Akagetsu said as he charged in to attack Kei but Ryousake then intercept the attack and then countered with his sword. \"It is useless, None of your attacks will work on me.\" Just then all four of the ninja stabbed Akagetsu. That will not beat me.\" Akagetsu then froze himself.<br>\r\n\"No we got you.\" Kei said. Just then they all charged chakra to their blades.<br>\r\n\"What is going on?\" Akagetsu asked as he felt his body start to get weaker.<br>\r\n\"Looks like our attacks do work on you.\" Saisemaru said. \"First I drain your chakra...\"<br>\r\n\"...while I melt the inside of your body to turn it back to water...\" Mentai said.<br>\r\n\"...and I shock you.\" Ryousake said as he sent a chidori into the blade.<br>\r\n\"Fool I will recover from this.\" Akagetsu said.<br>\r\n\"No thanks to my involvement.\" Kei said. She then broke her blade. \"The metal of the blade will attract to lightning. Do you see where I stabbed you? In your chest, more pacific your heart.\" <br>\r\n\"No!!\" Akagetsu yelled as his just then his head drops.\" <br>\r\n\"It is over, Akagetsu.\" Ryousake said.<br>\r\n\"There is till one problem before we deal with Hebimaru.\" Kei said as she picked up Akagetsu's blade.<br>\r\nMeanwhile back with Shinku. He was till looking around to find the group of ninja so he could kill them. \"Ninja! Where are you?\" Shinku asked.\" Please come out and play with me.\" He then heard Akagetsu screaming. He looked to see he was dead. \"Poor Akagetsu, I know him well.\" He said wearing a fluffed collar as he held up a skull that had the same hair as Akagetsu had. \"Oh well, since I can't find the others I will just play with you four.\" He then tried to run off but then his body felt like it was stopped in place. \"What the?\"<br>\r\n\"Shadow Possession complete.\" Shikaro said. <br>\r\n\"How did you do this?\" Shinku asked.<br>\r\n\"That is not all.\" Dakashi said as he then attacked with his puppets. A puppet encased Shinku and then other shot hits limbs and head as knives and then pierced the first puppet.<br>\r\n\"This is not going to stop me.\" Shinku said in a mocking tone.<br>\r\n\"Actually it will.\" Haruto said. Just then the chest of the puppet opened and then Haruto delivered a Gentle Fist Strike to Shinku.<br>\r\nJust then the wounds from the knives did not heal. \"What have you done to me?\" Shinku asked.<br>\r\n\"I sealed your chakra points so now you can't heal yourself.\" Haruto said.<br>\r\n\"That is it! I am going to kill you for real and then I am going to have Hebimaru revive you so I can kill you all over again.\" Shinku said. Just then Shinku started to cough up blood. \"What is going on with me?\"<br>\r\n\"Oh did I forget to mention to you something about the snake that I used to connect to you? You see it has been biting you with it's poisonous bites.\" Hebimaru said. \"Without your healing ability you will soon be dead.\"<br>\r\nShinku then got free of the puppet and asked. \"Why did you do this to me?\"<br>\r\n\"You were too powerful, I couldn't risk you finding away around the seal like you had done today.\" Hebimaru said. <br>\r\n\"I will kill you, even if it is with the last of my strength.\" Shinku said.<br>\r\n\"I doubt that.\" Hebimaru said. Shinku then charged at Hebimaru. Just then Hebimaru opened his mouth and then swallowed Shinku whole.<br>\r\n\"He just ate him.\" Chokai said. \"That is gross.\" <br>\r\n\"Coming from a Akimichi that is saying something.\" Hebimaru said as he took a napkin and cleaned his face with it. <br>\r\n\"You are a monster.\" Haruto said. \"We are going to stop you.\" <br>\r\n\"And don't think that you are safe Orochimaru, Kabuto, The two of you are going down as well.\" Akiza said.<br>\r\n\"My are we confident.\" Hebimaru said. \"Well let's see if you can do that.\" Just then Hebimaru jumped off of the curse creature he was a top of and then the Curse Creature charged in to attack. Just as the curse creature as getting near a gold naginata pierced his neck. \"What the?\" Hebimaru then looked up to see the Tanuki Gang. <br>\r\n\"Miss us?\" Jiriyu asked.<br>\r\n\"Good timing.\" Haruto said.<br>\r\n\"You annoying thieves have not reason to get involved in this. Now die.\" Hebimaru said. Just then something charged at the Tanuki Gang, forcing them to scattered.<br>\r\n\"Who or what is that?\" Jiriyu asked. <br>\r\nThe thing then landed in-front of Hebimaru. \"That is good work Dosu.\" Hebimaru said.<br>\r\n\"Dosu, that is then name of the reanimated Sound genin.\" Haruto said. \"But he looks different.\" Dosu now had two built in melody arms and his skin was grey.<br>\r\n\"And that is not all.\" Hebimaru said. \"Zaku, Kin.\" Just then two more creatures appeared. Zaku had air funnels all around his body. Kin had bells attached to the ends of her hair. Both how had gray skin.<br>\r\n\"What have you done?\" Ryousake asked.<br>\r\n\"Well when I first revived them I did something to make them undead Curse creatures.\" Hebimaru said. \"Now attack.\"  With that the three creatures attacked.<br>\r\n\"I will not stand for this.\" Haruto said as he entered his Nine-Tails Cloaked form and then extended three chakra arms that he used to seal the creatures away.<br>\r\n\"What the!\" Hebimaru said. \"You did that fast.\"<br>\r\n\"I will not stand for this Hebimaru.\" Haruto said.<br>\r\n\"None of use will.\" Ryousake said.<br>\r\n\"Well looks like my hand has been forced.\" Hebimaru said. \"I guess I will just have to deal with you myself.\" Hebimaru then attacked. </span></div></div>",

Don't confuse me jumping back as me surrendering.\" Hebimaru then formed hand-signs. He then clapped his hands together and then several openings opened and then Sound ninja dropped to the ground. \"I just need help to take you all out.\"<br>\r\n\"This will not stop us.\" Haruto said. \"Right guys?\"<br>\r\n\"I speak for everyone saying that he is right.\" Ryousake said.<br>\r\n\"Well if you what be the try and get me.\" Hebimaru said as he launched two giant snakes that engulfed the cages with Orochimaru and Kabuto in them receptively and then ran off.<br>\r\n\"You are not getting away.\" Haruto said as he, Ryousake, and Kei fought their way through the sound ninja and made it to the doorway that Hebimaru left through. They turned to face the others.<br>\r\n\"After him we will deal with this guys and caught up with you.\" Shikaro said.<br>\r\nThe three of them looked around to see that the others all agreed with what Shikaro said. \"Okay, Team Seven after him.\" Ryousake said. With that they ran to caught Hebimaru.<br>\r\n\"Are you sure those three can handle this on there own?\" Jiriyu asked as he was back to back with Shikaro.<br>\r\n\"They may have their quirks, truth is we all have them but they are by far the best team of our generation. They are Team Seven.\" Shikaro said. <br>\r\n\"Good to know.\" Jiriyu said. \"But all the same let take out this small fries and head out to help them.\"<br>\r\n\"Can't say that better myself.\" Shikaro said.<br>\r\nMeanwhile Hebimaru was running to his lab. He then started to inject himself with a series of chemicals. \"One more then I will be all set.\" Hebimaru said as he finish injecting himself. \"Now the finishing touch.\" Hebimaru then picked up a nearby kunai. He then moved it to his chest but then he found that he was impaled by a sword. He turned around to find who it was. \"Uzu, you are still alive.\" <br>\r\n\"Yes I am. I couldn't leave until I was sure that Orochimaru and Kabuto was out of commission. You gave me the best chance for that.\" Uzu said.<br>\r\nJust then Team Seven arrived at the scene. \"Uzu, what are you doing?\" Haruto asked.<br>\r\n\"Sorry Haruto but I couldn't take the chance that you failed to stop them.\" Uzu said as he pulled the sword out of Hebimaru. \"I had to be done.\" Uzu then turned around. Just then Hebimaru got back to his feet.<br>\r\n\"Uzu, Watch out.\" Haruto yelled.<br>\r\nHebimaru then punched at Uzu and he was sent back but Haruto and Ryousake managed to caught him. \"You okay?\" Haruto asked Uzu. <br>\r\n\"Yeah fine.\" Uzu said to Haruto. He then turned towards Hebimaru. \"How are you still alive? I stabbed you in the heart.\"<br>\r\n\"Actually I have to thank you for that, saves me the moral impact of taking my own life.\" Hebimaru said. \"Before you got here I had just finished injecting myself with several cocktails of chemicals, the final thing I injected was a special type of poison.\" <br>\r\n\"Braco's Fang Claws.\" Ryousake said.<br>\r\n\"Exactly.\" Hebimaru said. \"Both there is a reason that I had to be killed.\" Just then Hebimaru started transformed.<br>\r\n\"What is going on?\" Kei asked.<br>\r\n\"I don't know but there is one thing I do know.\" Haruto said. \"Run!!\" With that the four ninja started off back down the pathway. <br>\r\nMeanwhile the others have just finished beating the Sound ninja when Haruto and the others came running through a door. \"Haruto what is wrong?\" Akiza asked.<br>\r\n\"Something big.\" Haruto said. Just then something bursted out from the door and then extended through the ceiling, causing it to be destroyed.<br>\r\n\"What is that thing?\" Jiriyu asked.<br>\r\n\"That is Hebimaru.\" Morimaru stated. \"He is using the Eight Branch technique.\" <br>\r\nThere before them was Hebimaru transformed. He was in the form of a giant white serpent with eight heads and tails. \"Look at that thing.\" Jiriyu commented.<br>\r\nJust then one of the mouths opened. From it Hebimaru appear from the mouth. \"Leaf Ninja, also the ninja of the sand and the Tanuki gang, even you traitor, you witness my true power.\" Hebimaru said. The mouth closed and then all eight heads shot out at the group but they dodged them.<br>\r\n\"Those heads are fast.\" Haruto said to himself. <br>\r\n\"You can say that again.\" Haruto heard Inoko's voice say in his head. \"Sorry for not asking but I have linked all of us mentally.\"<br>\r\n\"That is okay.\" Haruto said in his mind. \"So any one have any ideas?\"<br>\r\n\"I do but we will have to work as one.\" Shikaro said.<br>\r\nThe all understood and then went into action. One of the serpent's head shot towards Haruto. Haruto then caught the head by the mouth with a chakra claw as he used his Nine-Tails Clock. As the other heads were heading for various members of the group Haruto then summoned more chakra claws the hold the moth shut. Just then another head was heading for him directly. \"I missed one.\" Haruto said. Just as the head was about to strike Akina used her sand to create a giant sand claw and held the head down. \"Thanks Akina.\" Haruto said.<br>\r\n\"You are welcome.\" Akina said.<br>\r\n\"Now.\" Shikaro said as Chokai, Tai, Akiza, and Mar made there way behind Hebimaru's Eight Branch and each took hold of two tails a person.<br>\r\n\"You are not going to hold me for long.\" Hebimaru's voice said just then a giant chakra broad sword stabbed Hebimaru in the back and then slashed his back and then chopped off all Eight Heads in one swing. <br>\r\n\"Good work Ryousake.\" Haruto said to Ryousake as he was using Susanoo. Haruto then turned to the others and said. \"Don't relax yet.\" Haruto said.</span></div></div>",

He has grown about ten inches. He now had a more define muscle mass. He is also only wearing dark pants. His body looked like it was covered by scales and markings around his eyes.<br>\r\n\"What is this?\" Mentai asked.<br>\r\n\"Sage Mode.\" Haruto said.<br>\r\n\"Like Lord Naruto and you?\" Kei asked.<br>\r\n\"In a way yes but there is more to it.\" Haruto said.<br>\r\n\"He is right.\" Ryousake said. \"If it was just Sage Mode then His body would not have bulked up.\"<br>\r\n\"It does not matter because...\" Tai then charged in to attack. While doing that he said to himself. \"... he stands no chance against me.\" Tai then delivered a kick but Hebimaru caught it with ease. This shocked Tai.<br>\r\n\"How foolish.\" Hebimaru said as he took hold of the leg and tossed him to the ground hard.<br>\r\n\"Tai!\" Koga shouted. \"Let's go Kinmaru.\" With that he and Kinmaru in Were-Mode charged in to attack. Hebimaru jumped out of the way of their attack and as they land he then summoned two snakes form his hands that shot at them. they dodged but were grazed by the attacks. \"You okay buddy?\" Koga asked Kinmaru. Just then Hebimaru appeared behind Koga and delivered a chop to the back of his neck. <br>\r\n\"You are next pup.\" Hebimaru said. Kinmaru then charged at Hebimaru but he simply summoned a snake from his arm and it wrapped around the Wolf. Just then two sword slashes came flying towards the snake and cut it.<br>\r\n\"Good work Mentai.\" Saisemaru said to Mentai.<br>\r\n\"You too.\" Mentai said in replying.<br>\r\n\"You two are going down.\" Hebimaru said as the palms of his hands opened up and two swords came out of them and then he grabbed them and slashed at the two swordsmen who blocked them but Hebimaru's attacks got through and slashed both men. They jumped back to recover.<br>\r\n\"How did he do that?\" Mentai asked.<br>\r\n\"I heard that Orochimaru owns a Grass Cutter Sword that can not be blocked.\" Saisemaru said.<br>\r\n\"Hebimaru must have somehow transferred the effects to those two swords.\" Mentai said.<br>\r\n\"You two are not getting away that easy.\" Just then two snakes appeared from Hebimaru's shoulders. \"Viper Shot.\"  With that the snakes shot chakra infused poison darts at the two.<br>\r\nJust then a Sand wall appeared in front of them. \"Lady Akina.\" Mentai said.<br>\r\n\"You okay?\" She asked and the gave a nod. \"Good I am taking over.\" She then charged in to attack.<br>\r\n\"Nice try.\" With that two new snakes appeared and then shot the same attack but they got through.<br>\r\n\"How?\" Akina asked herself before getting hit. She then felt that the darts were moist. \"Water?\"<br>\r\nHebimaru then tried to attack but he then found his body was insnared by shadow.<br>\r\n\"You are not going anywhere.\" Shikaro said as he was forming a triangle with Inoko and Chokai.<br>\r\n\"This will not work.\" Hebimaru said as three giant snake then shot up from under ground and each attacked one of the three. \"See none of you can beat me.\" Just then he felt his arm getting pierced. He looked to see that it was Jiriyu's naginata. At that the three snakes disappeared. \"You dirty thief.\" Hebimaru then stuck Jiriyu, sending him back as Mar caught him. \"What a waste of chakra.\" The four snakes that were attached to his shoulders then attack towards Jiriyu and Mar. Just then Dakashi appeared in front of them and then summoned out a puppet that destroyed the snakes. \"My snakes? How dear you!\" Hebimaru then charged in to attack.<br>\r\n\"I don't think so.\" Dakashi said as he removed his mask and then summoned out four more puppets and then they each attacked.<br>\r\n\"Your puppets are not enough to beat me.\" Hebimaru said as he dodged the attacks and then summoned Eight snakes and then they turned from white to a dark Gray color. They each then launched a chakra orb. When they hit they cause an explosion sending everyone back. The smoke cleared and when it did everyone was in a chakra claw. \"You are so annoying.\" Hebimaru said.<br>\r\n\"Is that so?\" Haruto said. \"Well annoying or not you are still going down.\"<br>\r\n\"Please, You may have saved the lives of your team but they don't stand a chance against me and neither do you.\" Hebimaru said.<br>\r\nJust then Hebimaru was slashed at by a giant chakra broadsword. \"Who said he was fighting you alone.\" Ryousake said.<br>\r\nHebimaru survived the attack but has a deep scar across his chest. \"You bastard!\" Hebimaru said. \"You are getting on my nerves.\" Hebimaru then summoned a giant snake from his body and had it charge at Ryousake. The snake was close to Ryousake but then a chakra claw took hold of the snake and then strangled it. \"I will kill you.\" Hebimaru said. \"I will Kill every one of you!\" Hebimaru said as he summoned out thousands of Snakes that all shot out to attack in every direction.<br>\r\n\"I will not let you do that.\" Haruto said as he used Gentle Fist with his chakra claws to destroy the snakes.<br>\r\n\"No.\" Hebimaru said.<br>\r\n\"That is not all.\" Ryousake said as he summoned black flames and set Hebimaru on fire.<br>\r\n\"You fool, you fool, You Fools!\" Hebimaru shouted as the force of the chakra sends the flames off his body.<br>\r\n\"He is this powerful.\" Ryousake said. \"But how?\"<br>\r\n\"You are so weak compare to me.\" Hebimaru said. \"Even Orochimaru feared my power. That is why he sealed away my true strength. I had to die for the seal to disappear. Now You all will do the same and like me you will be coming back, as my undead army.\" With that Hebimaru lifted the sword in his right and and then stabbed the ground with it. As soon as that happened the entire cave collapsed.<br>\r\n\"Their is not much time to act.\" Haruto said to himself as he and Ryousake managed to perform hand-signs.</span></div></div>",

Now time to gather the remains.\" Hebimaru said but just as he took a step forward a spear of electricity pierced his chest and a wind chakra enhanced chakra claw slashed at his head forcing the Snake ninja the stumble back. \"What but how?\" Hebimaru asked. Just then he got his answer. Behind Haruto and Ryousake were a giant toad and snake respectively. <br>\r\n\"Thanks for the save, Gamaten.\" Haruto said.<br>\r\n\"As always I always have your back Haruto.\" Gamaten said as he placed the ninja that he was holding to shield them to the ground gentle.<br>\r\n\"So you summoned me.\" Stated the giant snake. He was dark purple in color with black strips along the length of his body.<br>\r\n\"Why wouldn't I? After all you and I are friends Naga.\" Ryousake said.<br>\r\n\"Traitor, how dear you betray the contract with Orochimaru that I now safe keep.\" Hebimaru said.<br>\r\n\"Ryousake, he is right I fell the contract from with in him.\" Naga stated.<br>\r\n\"Why is that important?\" Haruto asked looked at Ryousake and the giant snake.<br>\r\n\"Orochimaru wears the snake contract in the form of a tattoo on his left arm.\" Ryousake said. \"Which means that Orochimaru is still inside him alive.\"<br>\r\n\"Really?\" Haruto asked. \"I don't know if that is a good thing or not.\" He said.<br>\r\n\"Actually for our purpose it my be a good thing.\" Kei said as she while up to her teammates.<br>\r\n\"Kei, you okay? Good. What about the others?\" Haruto asked.<br>\r\n\"They are fine. Lucky for us all in addition to learning medical ninjutsu, Lady Sakura also entrusted Lady Katsuyu to me and Akiza. She is finishing the remote healing of everyone.\" Kei said.<br>\r\n\"So everyone is okay. Good.\" Haruto said. \"Now their is one thing that needs to be done.\" <br>\r\n\"Right.\" Ryousake said. \"I you know what to do.\" <br>\r\n\"Right.\" Haruto said as he then closed his eyes. He then opened them the reveal that he has entered Sage Mode while using the Nine-Tails chakra that is in his system.<br>\r\n\"What will that do?\" Hebimaru asked. Just then Haruto charged at high speed towards Hebimaru and delivered a thrust to his chest, sending him back. \"What happened?\" He asked as he was in mid-air. Just then Haruto appeared next to him and kicked Hebimaru into the air. \"How is he so fast?\" Hebimaru asked as he was flying up. Haruto then appeared again behind him and then delivered a kick that sent him straight to the ground. <br>\r\nHaruto then appeared on the ground and entered a stance. \"Now. Eight Trigram Sixty Four Air Palm Destroyer.\" Haruto then launched a series of air palm strikes. First two, then four, and so on until he reached the Sixty fourth and then after finishing the attack Haruto quickly entered another stance. \"Now Gentle Step: Twin Lion Strike.\" With that Chakra formed around Haruto's palms in the shape of lion heads and Haruto then thrust both hands into Hebimaru, sending back once more and had him skid on the ground to a stop.<br>\r\nHebimaru soon forced his way to his feet. \"Foolish move. You think I wouldn't have found a way to counter a Hyuga's attack.\" Hebimaru said as he then started to caught up blood. He then took a step forward. \"See nothing.\" Just then Hebimaru felt a shock of pain. He then fell to his hands and knees and then started throwing up blood. \"What! Why? Why am I spiting this much blood? And why is it that my body aches so much?\" Hebimaru asked himself as he forced himself back to his feet again. Just then a snake shot out from his body and then opened it's mouth and something shot out of it. <br>\r\n\"You fall me Hebimaru.\" Said what shot out from the snake's mouth. What spoke was a giant snake made up of a multitude of smaller snakes, with long and spiky black hair, a scaled face with snake-like teeth and a long tongue, black eye markings, and a pointed chin.<br>\r\n\"What is that thing?\" Asked Haruto shocked at the sight before him.<br>\r\n\"Orochimaru.\" Hebimaru said.<br>\r\n\"What that is Orochimaru? But how?\" Haruto asked.<br>\r\n\"He experimented on himself over the years so to allow him to take over a new body.\" Ryousake said.<br>\r\n\"As smart as your father.\" Orochimaru said. \"Now if you will excuse me I will punish my son.\" <br>\r\n\"Will you go back in the shadows until you are satisfied with what you have now?\" Asked Ryousake.<br>\r\n\"For a time yes, but only until I regain my full strength.\" Orochimaru said.<br>\r\n\"Good to know.\" Ryousake said as he then formed a hand sign and then Orochimaru fell to the ground.<br>\r\n\"What is happening to me?\" Orochimaru asked as the snakes that made up his body started to die. He then looked to see that he was stabbed by a Susanoo sword.<br>\r\n\"In your current state you can easily be killed. Also with my medical knowledge I am able to counteract with the poison your body produce.\" Ryousake said.<br>\r\n\"Don't worry Orochimaru, I will punish your son for you.\" Haruto said as he faced off against Hebimaru as the snake form of Orochimaru disappeared and in it's place laid a pile of dust that was the Snake Sannin.<br>\r\n\"I still don't understand how he got out?\" Hebimaru said.<br>\r\n\"I did it.\" Haruto said.<br>\r\n\"Is that so, well thank you because now that he is no longer in my body it is going to be easier for me to use Sage Mode.\" Hebimaru then charged in at Haruto but then fell to his knees again.<br>\r\n\"You are too injured to continue.\" Haruto said. \"Surrender and we will merely imprison you.\" He said as he turned his back to Hebimaru.<br>\r\n\"I will never surrender to the likes of you!\" Hebimaru said as he charged in again with a chakra infused hand.<br>\r\n\"Haruto!\" Everyone of his friends shouted.<br>\r\n\"Haruto, Die!\" Hebimaru said as he got near to Haruto ready to strike. Hebimaru was about to strike when he felt something strike his chest. He was shocked to see Haruto's hand inches from his chest. \"Looks like we are in a stalemate.\" Hebimaru said. He then said to himself. \"Are we would if I didn't have enough chakra stored to strike with at Sen Bomb Ball.\"<br>\r\n\"Grand Rasengan.\" Haruto said as formed a rasengan with tail beast chakra and Natural chakra and thrust it into Hebimaru's arm.<br>\r\n\"What!\" Hebimaru said as he got the full force of the attack. Hebimaru then stood facing Haruto. His body looked back to normal. \"I hate you the most. You are everything I hate.\" Hebimaru said.<br>\r\n\"I take that as a honor.\" Haruto said.<br>\r\n\"You would.\" Hebimaru said as a black liquid come out of his mouth and then he fell to the ground. <br>\r\n\"That was a close one.\" Haruto said as he started to fall back changing back but he was caught by someone.<br>\r\n\"There there hero, I got you.\" Jiriyu said.<br>\r\n\"You still here? Good.\" Haruto said.<br>\r\n\"Haruto.\" Akiza said as she ran to him.<br>\r\n\"I am fine Akiza.\" Haruto said.<br>\r\n\"Still we should get back to the village as soon as we can.\" Akiza said.<br>\r\n\"What ever you say.\" Haruto said. With that they head for the Leaf Village.<br>\r\nA month has passed since that mission and everyone has healed. The sand ninja had returned to their village a week after the mission end and now the Tanuki Gang were heading out of the village. At the gate, Naruko was there waiting. \"So you leaving?\" She asked.<br>\r\n\"Yeah, with the sound gone there is no reason for us to be here anymore.\" Jiriyu said as he and his team made their way out of the gate.<br>\r\n\"I was hoping we could work together more.\" Naruko said.<br>\r\n\"Sorry but I have had my full of doing free work.\" Jiriyu said. \"Maybe this trinket will make it worth it.\" He said holding up a necklace.<br>\r\n\"My necklace. Give it back.\" Naruko demanded.<br>\r\n\"Sorry no can do.\" With that Jiriyu and his gang were off.<br>\r\n\"Why that thief.\" Naruko said. She then headed back home. Once there she head to her room and then saw her window open and on her end table was her necklace with a note. She read the note.<br>\r\n\"Maybe next time. <br>\r\nLater,<br>\r\nJiriyu of the Tanuki Gang.\"<br>\r\n\"That no good thief.\" She said.<br>\r\nMeanwhile elsewhere in the Village, Haruto was laying down looking up to the sky. \"Now this is the like.\" Haruto said.<br>\r\n\"I agree.\" Ryousake said from next to him.<br>\r\n\"Same here.\" Kei said from next to Ryousake. \"So what know?\" <br>\r\n\"Well, I have to get home and get ready since I have plans for later with Akiza.\" Haruto said as he got up to his feet and the others sat up. Haruto was part way when he turned and said. \"Ryousake, why don't you stop acting like your father and ask Kei out already.\"<br>\r\n\"Haruto!\" Ryousake said as he got to his feet and started after him.<br>\r\n\"You are only angry because you really like her.\" Haruto said as he started off with Ryousake after him and Kei following him. All three having smiles on their faces.</span></div></div>",

The story of Naruto sensei and the story of Naruto's children and their generation. (I say children and their but that does not necessarly mean Naruto has more then one kid.)
