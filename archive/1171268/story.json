One by one, the prisoners were taken away by the guards and taken to their new owners to serve as slaves. After two long days, it was Kendall's turn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHoping that his master would be merciful, Kendall muttered a prayer to the gods as the guards took him away. He went up the stairs of the dungeon into the courtyard where he met a tall woman, about 5' 7'', in an orange velvet dress with knots, spirals and intricate key patterns woven into the sleeves hanging from her wrist and along the neckline and hem of her dress with silver threads. She had fire-colored hair and grayish blue eyes. The guards said, \"You have been assigned to her. She is your new mistress,\" and then left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come with me,\" she said softly. Walking behind her, you entered into her study. Then she pointed to an alcove, with a chair and a plate of beef stew and a mug of beer set on a small table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've set aside some of my leftovers for you to eat. I hope you enjoy them!\" she exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHappy that he had found a kind mistress, Kendall went into the alcove to eat and drink. The stew and the mug of beer were deeply satisfying after the stale bread and filthy water served in the dungeon. After he ate, he arose with satisfication, from having a good meal. Then he began to feel dizzy. Then the sensation of shrinking began as he shrank to the size of an imp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Help me, I've been bewitched!\" shouted the unfortunate Kendall. Yet his mistress merely grinned as she approached him. \"The experimental potion worked!\" crowed Ena. Bending down she picked up the shrunken Kendall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she held him in her fist, Ena continued, \"You know there is so much fun I can have with you, little man. I can show you off to my friends as a pet, lock you up and take out my bad moods on you and play games with you. If you bore me, I can squish you like a bug or feed you to one of this castle's attack dogs!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, a woman in a red velvet dress with knots, spirals and intricate key patterns woven into the sleeves hanging from her wrist and along the neckline and hem of her dress with gold threads entered the study. She had red hair and green eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, Gale, how are you doing?\" asked Kendall's captress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rather well,\" Gale replied, \"How did you get that imp in your hand?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKendall shouted, \"I was a normal-sized man until this crazy woman shrank me. Help me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGale's eyebrow arose. \"You shrank him?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" said Ena, as she explained how she did it. Gale reacted by...</span></div></div>",

And why have you not mentioned this 'Tykulmi'elmoh' before now?

But once she sees the results of my experiment, she will be overjoyed.  Think, legions of enemy soldiers reduced to mere pets at our feet!\"  She raised Kendall in one hand as if to emphasise her point, the gentlest of squeezes wringing a grimace from the shrunken man.  \"In fact, I go to display my findings forthwith!  Care to join me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, you go ahead.  I would not wish to distract at all from the moment of your triumph.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have it your way.  When next we meet, I shall be elevated above all others!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCackling like a witch, Ena closed the door behind her, and Gale slumped against a pillar.  That had been close.  She had to be more careful with what she said, so as not to give herself away.  Thus far she'd been very careful about not using future knowledge, but she was getting careless if she was making pop-culture references before medieval bumpkins!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe examined herself in Ena's mirror, half expecting it to spring to life like something from Snow White.  But no, it merely showed her her own face, her elegantly coiffeured-hair keeping its shape.  It still seemed odd to be seeing herself without the glasses, but that would definitely be a giveaway to the fact that she had travelled hundreds of years back in time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was a secret she had to keep.  None of these primitive screw-heads could know of her true origins, lest it ruin the chances of accomplishing her mission.</span></div></div>",

The two women talked about securing long-distance trade between their two kingdoms. When they finished, Deirdre picked Brian up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd like you to have this little man as a gift.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrian was mortified. As a young prince, he had spent time in Gosgerov wooing the young Princess Natalya. Then when he was unsatisfied by the small dowry offered by her father the king, Brian broke off his relationship with Natalya. As he told a sobbing Natalya, \"You are only worth the value of your dowry!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeirdre knew about this being Natalya's friend and was now grinning as Brian protested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! No! No!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a satisfied smirk, Natalya put Brian in the pocket of her gray fur coat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It has come to my attention that there is trouble at home. And so--though I deeply regret it--I must leave immediately.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatalya then hugged Deirdre again. The two women then walked out into the snow. Once outside, Brian decided to bail. Throwing himself out of Natalya's pocket, he ran away from the vengeance of his ex as soon as he landed on the ground. Unfortunately for him, he was not dressed for the snow nor did his small stature help him retain heat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatalya noticed as soon as she heard the thud of Brian hitting the ground. She was about to reach down to pick Brian up when Deirdre stopped her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let him run; he won't get very far.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd indeed it was not long before Brian succumbed to the cold, shivering on the ground and curled up into a fetal position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeirdre and Natalya walked to where Brian had fled in two easy strides.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-h-help m-m-me!\" chattered a shivering Brian.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Say that Deirdre is the Queen of Mektlacaugh and that I own you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Deirdre is the Queen of Mektlacaugh and you own me, Natalya!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww, you must be very cold, wittle man,\" cooed Natalya, as she wrapped Brian in a handkerchief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now you'll be nice and warm!\" she exclaimed, as she put the handkerchief with Brian in it in her coat pocket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This time I'll prevent your foolish escape attempts,\" she said in a rather nurturing voice, as she made sure this time to button shut the flap of her coat pocket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere should the story go from here?</span></div></div>",

He was lying face down and struggled upright to gain a sitting position, as a man might in a hammock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Out of the frying pan\" he muttered to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe rummaged in his own pockets - empty.  His gaolers had been <i>very</i> thorough in relieving him of his possessions.  He stared around his new surroundings and mentally noted the inventory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA folded kerchief, doubtless made of a fine material but the size of a heavy tarpaulin to a man of Kendalls reduced frame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd a key that would be small to a human - perhaps for a trinket box or small safe.  It bounced alarmingly as Gale walked and Kendall struggled backwards to maintain a distance between himself and it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as Kendall was starting to feel sea sick, the movement abruptly stopped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVoices.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your majesty.\" Gales voice.  Kendall winced as he dropped and then rose again.  A curtsey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gale.  I trust you have everything you need?\". Kendall froze.  The queen's voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do now your majesty.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good day Gale, remember your promise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes ma'am.\" Another curtsey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe motion started again. Stairs Kendall guessed, then a passage way, a door opened and closed, stopped again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGale reached into her pocket and plucked Kendall out. She placed him on top of a tall chest so that he was on a level with her. She looked him over carefully, Kendall stared back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were in what Kendall took to be Gale's personal chambers, every bit as grand as those belonging to Ena.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First things first\" said Gale and began to remove her dress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKendall considered his circumstances. He was on a tall chest - could he jump and run? He'd heard that a mouse could fall a great distance and survive - would the same be true for him in his shrunken form?  Somehow he couldn't bring himself to try the jump from the chest. He turned his attention to Gale who was now stripped to her nether clothes and was rummaging in a cupboard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe re-emerged clutching a silver dish and a large glass phial.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Need to undo the pimple curse before it takes hold\" she explained over her shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKendall grimaced inwardly.  Any other time he'd have been delighted to watch a woman in her nether clothes; he didn't even want to <i>think</i> about the size of his fruits now!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGale emptied the phial into the dish, muttering under her breath. She then proceeded to wash her face, neck and shoulders from the dish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you undo the curse on me too?\" asked Kendall, his voice reedy and high to his own ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I ______________________________\" replied Gale with a smile.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I will become the unstoppable hero that will save two dozen realms from Deirdre and her evil forces.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSerosa objected, \"No, your family needs to be restored to normal height. And then all of us, every adult not needed to protect the children, must form an army. That army will be the large and mighty champions needed by us and by the two dozen realms threatened by the sorcery of Deirdre and her coven.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGale then made a counter-objection to which Serosa made a counter-counter-objection and on it went until</span></div></div>",

And now, about the story itself:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor years the rival kingdoms of Connalk and Mektlacaugh have fought over the disputed Valley of Thogmond. Both kingdoms have raided each other's villages in the region, capturing cattle, gold and slaves. The Queen of Connalk is winning a string of victories through employing a coven of witches to supplement her army. In one of her army's successful raids, the peasant militiaman Kendall was captured and handed over to the sorceress Ena as a slave. Ena slipped an experimental potion into her new slave's beer mug, shrinking him to the size of an imp. Now the unfortunate Kendall hopes that Ena's colleague Gale will save him before he dies due to one of Ena's twisted games!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen adding to the story, don't have Kendall restored to his normal size or killed, at least for eight chapters. Even if Gale saves him, it will take time to find an antidote to Ena's experimental potion! Also if Gale restores Kendall's size, there is still the issue of whether Kendall can be released seeing as he is a captured soldier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharacters<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeirdre is both the Queen of the Kingdom of Connalk and one of the kingdom\u2019s tallest women at 6\u2019 tall. Her formal dress is a dark green velvet dress with emeralds embroidered into the fabric. Two emeralds are embroidered into the corner of each of the wrists of her dress, plus an emerald on the each side of the sleeves hanging from her wrist. While these emeralds are small, bigger emeralds are embroidered along the neckline and hem of her dress. She has long black hair and black eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEna is a tall woman, about 5' 7''. Her formal clothes is an orange velvet dress with knots, spirals and intricate key patterns woven into the sleeves hanging from her wrist and along the neckline and hem of her dress with silver threads. She had fire-colored hair and grayish blue eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGale is taller than Ena at about 5\u2019 9\u201d. Her formal clothes is a red velvet dress with knots, spirals and intricate key patterns woven into the sleeves hanging from her wrist and along the neckline and hem of her dress with gold threads. She had red hair and green eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKendall is a peasant militiaman captured by the raiders of the Army of Connalk. He\u2019ll take risks but only after thinking through on what to do next. He has spent all his time in his home village in the Valley of Thogmond. His parents and most of his relatives from their generation have died from a combination of old age, malnutrition and overwork like many of their fellow peasants. His younger relatives have fled from his home village due to the successes of the Queen of Connalk. He himself is 20 years old and cannot afford a wife, even if he had a lover\u2014which he does not because he is somewhat shy and unassuming.<br>\r\n</td>",
