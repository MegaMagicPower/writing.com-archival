Something about that name was oddly familiar, but she gave little to no thought about it; at this point, her guts were stronger than her brain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she enters the restaurant, a nice soft jingle played in the background, only obscured by the sound of teenagers yelling and people talking on their sits. Nothing out of the ordinary for these kind of places.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe rushes to one of those electronic kiosks where people are gathered to make her order:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's see... two cheeseburgers, three sets of jumbo fries, two large sodas, ehm... f-five BigFox? Hmmm... maybe this is a little bit too much food, I'm really hungry, but I'm not sure I'll eat all of these.. two sets of chicken nuggets and a cesar salad\" She ended her train of thought with a bit of hesitation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe brought all the food to her table; it looked like she was waiting for some friends to show up to eat for her. It couldn't be farther from the truth. She couldn't wait to dig into the greasy warm food, but she'd look like a pig to the rest of the clients, they were already giving her some weird looks. But, red like a tomato and sweating like his boss, trying not to lose control of her own actions, she can't take it no more and starts to dig into the food. Stuffing burger after burger, helping it go down with the large soda and refilling her mouth with the jumbo fries. Moaning inbetween meals as she feels her stomach fill. She hadn't enjoyed eating that much in a very long time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was about to finish the meal when she was forced to stop by a sudden pressure on her gut; her uniform, it was at it's limit. Her now round belly was being restricted by the tight clothes she was wearing. She came to her senses, turning bright red. Her embarrassment was only fueled by a loud burp that came out of nowhere; and the worst thing, she still wasn't satisfied; she wanted to stuff her face with more food, break her dress and let her stomach spill out</span></div></div>",

Just going to a restaurant, throwing himself into his fridge and pantry? That all seemed contradictory to getting in shape. All that stuff was bad for you, right? He turned his head to the TV to relax a bit. After a couple of hours, he was starting to forget the whole idea. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUltra Supplement Market dot com!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe booming voice of an ad jolted him out of indifference. He was paying close attention to the TV now. A shirtless lion with rippling muscles stood tall in the center of television screen, staring Haida down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHave you ever wanted to get into shape but didn\u2019t know where to start?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaida sat up now and leaned closer to the screen. This was the information he needed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHead over to Ultra Supplement Market dot com and find the vitamins and minerals you need to build up your new rockin\u2019 bod!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe camera panned from the lion to a fox that was just as built as the lion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBefore I went to Ultra Supplement Market dot com I was a lanky dork!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA \u201cbefore\u201d picture of the fox flashed on the screen. Haida gasps. That fox used to look almost exactly like him!  And yet that fox was before him now with a washboard stomach and huge biceps. Haida jumped from the couch and took off towards his room to grab his laptop before the commercial ended. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaida quickly started up his laptop and entered the address from the ad. Finding a page that was basically what the address described. A large marketplace of various nutritional powders, vitamins, and mineral capsules. What was he looking for? The fox on TV said something about bulking powders. Haida looked them up to find a lot of them. There were low carb and \u201cmeal replacement\u201d powders that were quite expensive. On the lower end of the price spectrum, there were mixtures of various vitamins and minerals that contained 3,000 calories per serving. This was closer to Haida\u2019s price range.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c3,000 calories\u2026 how many calories were you supposed to get in a day again? Probably less than that\u2026\u201d he thought aloud. \u201cAnd some of them come in flavors like vanilla or chocolate, but that doesn\u2019t seem right. Then again, this is in a fitness store. Eating 3,000 calories of a vitamin and mineral blend is probably different than 3,000 calories worth of microwave noodles.\u201d Satisfied with this justification, Haida placed an order. His order would arrive in two days, just in time for the weekend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next two days of work were uneventful. He came in, did his work, talked with Retsuko and Fenneko, then went home. He never discussed this plan with Fenneko in the meantime. And she just assumed that he had given up another plan to win Retsuko over without really trying once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Haida came home from work that Friday, a box was waiting for him. He cheered to himself and placed the box on the coffee table. Ripping it open to reveal it\u2019s contents, two huge plastic jars filled with the supplement powder. He wrapped his arms around one of the jars and took it to the kitchen. \u201cSo, if I\u2019m understanding correctly. I mix this into a shake to drink after meals. Then once I\u2019ve done this for awhile I start working out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a sizable takeout dinner, Haida returned to the powder in the kitchen. Making a shake as best he could, perhaps using more protein powder than the recommended serving size. Though the shake came out looking pretty sorry, Haida seemed to mostly get it right. \u201cHey, this is actually pretty good!\u201d the hyena said upon taking a sip. He quickly finished the shake up, and felt immensely full. \u201cWell, this might be easier than I thought.\u201d He slept easy after that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day was a typical Saturday for Haida, aside from fitting the shakes into his schedule. He hung out at home most of the time, as he didn\u2019t have a lot of friends outside work. Sunday was largely similar. Though Haida helped himself to an extra shake or two. Finding that they were actually really good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaida woke up on Monday morning, with the weekend having come and gone, he started to prepare for work and found himself having some difficulty with it. First, it took him a bit of going to get his shirt buttons done up. The bottom two just did not seem to want to go through the holes. But without thinking much on it, he sucked his gut in and managed to get buttoned up. Then the button on his pants gave Haida some trouble as well, but not quite as much as the shirt, all it took was a bit of gumption to get that. After a quick breakfast and an after breakfast protein shake, Haida went to the bathroom to brush his teeth and freshen up a bit before work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaida jumped back when he saw himself in the mirror. With a second chin and two soft cheeks staring back at him, it was impossible to ignore that he had gotten fat. He lloked down to see his softer belly hanging over the waistband of his pants and straining against his work shirt, he figured that he had to have gained at least 20 pounds. \u201cAlright\u2026 no big deal. Must be time to start hitting the gym. I\u2019ll just\u2026 get there after work.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Huff!* *Puff!* Haida ran for the train. Perspiration had pooled under his armpits and he found himself gasping to catch his breath while his heart pounded against his chest. But he caught his train at least. Even if it was more crowded than ever before and it wasn\u2019t a pleasant ride. In addition to being cramped, he could practically  feel the eyes of other passengers traveling over him. But Haida knew that this wasn\u2019t going to be the worst part of his work day. That would be getting through the day without Retsuko noticing that he had gained weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Crrrk* the office chair automatically lowered itself when it\u2019s occupants more burdensome weight filled the seat. Fenneko\u2019s laughter filled Haida\u2019s ears. He winced. \u201cWhat\u2019s\u2026 all this?\u201d she asked, clearly still bemused, making a motion as though she were going over the curve of a belly. \u201cI-I\u2019m working out! We talked about this!\u201d Fenneko blinked. \u201cYou\u2019re still doing that?\u201d Haida nodded, his second chin swaying. \u201cOf course\u2026 even if Retsuko doesn\u2019t notice me for the effort, I think I should still try and improve myself.\u201d Fenneko was clearly still amused, but listening. \u201cRight\u2026\u201d Haida continues. \u201cBut still\u2026 could you help me avoid Retsuko. You know, keep her occupied, maybe go somewhere else for lunch.\u201d Fenneko laughs again. \u201cI can try. But  I can\u2019t guarantee she won\u2019t notice all of you.\u201d Haida\u2019s fuller cheeks turned an indignant dark red. He couldn\u2019t find a comeback, so he shut up and started his work. Knowing that Fenneko meant it, even if she joked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the day went on, the plan was going well. Haida kept his distance, and he didn\u2019t run into Retsuko. He kept his head down and poured himself into his work so much that most of his other co-workers didn\u2019t notice either. However, he may have raised a few eyebrows at lunch. When Haida finished his meal and found that he was left unsatisfied, he remembered that he left the protein powder at home. He knew that maybe he should avoid it. But after taking in so many calories, his capacity had increased so much. Haida couldn\u2019t help but head for the vending machines and scrounge up a small fest of snacks. The glutting went surprisingly unnoticed, as everyone mostly kept to their own table. However Haida\u2019s overeating overburdened his already out stretched shirt and he found an oval of soft flab parting the space between two buttons and exposing itself. Haida hurried back to his desk, hoping that no one noticed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that being his only mishap, Haida was feeling pretty good as the end of the day approached. He kept an eye on the clock while finishing up his work and packing up.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

One moment she was being bossed around like always, the next moment she was throwing her stack of papers into the air, announcing that she was quitting in the most epic way thought possible, storming out of the building like some slave that was set free after years of captivity. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo one knew what to say or think after this. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite being overlooked and treated like a robot by everyone, there was a cold void after Retsuko left that could not be filled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey tried to find her, to talk some sense into her (though, they highly doubt that she would be hired back by her literal pig of a boss, who was facing his own existential crisis after someone stood up to him like that for the first time in all of his life), but Retsuko was impossible to find; her phone was dead and she was not home in her cramp apartment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaturally, they turned to her best friend, Fenneko, but she was just as clueless as they were.
