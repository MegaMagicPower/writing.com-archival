Small for your age, shy, quiet, and scrawny, you were picked on by other orphaned children growing up, and have sorely regretted the lack of a mother to protect and comfort you. After you grew into adolescence, you were finally able to leave the stifling orphanage and decided to go wherever the wind beckoned, doing odd jobs for farmers, merchants, the occasional lord, and anyone else who could use an extra hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring your travels you glimpsed many children far luckier than you. While some were born to poor parents, and others to those of more comfortable, if not luxurious means, you considered them all far more fortunate than yourself because they all could look forward to their mother's loving caress, even under the worst of circumstances. In contrast, all you ever received from any woman was a polite thank you for services rendered, if not apathetic indifference to your very existence. This was especially apparent on the exceedingly rare occasions when you encountered a woman from the nobility. Stunningly beautiful yet so often cold and arrogant, they barely seemed to look at \"the help,\" especially someone as meek and awkward around women as yourself. Your only escape from this lonely, itinerant lifestyle was at night, when you collapsed exhausted under a tree, or, if you were lucky, in a farmer's barn or the floor of an inn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMany a night as you slept under the stars, you sought refuge in dreams about the kind of mother you desperately wished you could have. Large, full breasts were, of course, mandatory, as were a tall height, full lips, smooth, soft skin, a slim waist, wide, child bearing hips, toned thighs, a generous butt, and dainty, well formed hands and feet, though other features changed each night. Sometimes, she was a blonde with fine hair that glittered like beaten gold, and blue eyes that shimmered with motherly love, like a placid morning lake, kissed by the earliest rays of the dawn. Other times, however, she was a brunette a red head, or had jet black hair, thick, and luxuriant, accompanied by brown or green eyes that twinkled mischievously like the gems you often saw being sold by street peddlers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer personality changed as well, night after night. Some things were constant, of course; she was generally doting and affectionate, cooing as she cuddled with you, stroking your hair, whispering in your ear, smothering you with kisses, and (though you were embarrassed to admit this, even to yourself) unashamedly servicing your hardened member as you greedily suckled at her breasts. Sometimes, she'd give you a bath, soaping you up in a tub of warm water, thoroughly scrubbing your ticklish armpits, feet, and knees as you giggled, while she paid special attention to your genitals and butthole. Occasionally, you would misbehave, not truly of course, but just to see how she would react. In some dreams, she would react with mock annoyance, subjecting you to a merciless tickling session, playfully counting your ribs with her long, painted nails, licking your soles, nibbling your toes, or blowing raspberries on your bellybutton. In others, however, (and this was even more embarrassing) she would respond with a sultry smirk, pulling you over her firm thighs, trapping your member between them, and subjecting your defenseless buns to some delightfully naughty spanking with her soft, delicate palms, as she \"accidentally\" fondled your genitals, buttcrack, and butthole with her nimble fingers - for your own good, of course.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlas, even the grandest dream must yield before the grim intrusion of the real world, and today was no different. Your latest nocturnal reverie ended with a jolt, as an irritated innkeeper kicked you awake. He had allowed you to stay the night after helping fix his roof,but wanted you gone before his customers awoke. Glaring at his ugly mug, you reluctantly stumbled out of the Inn at the Crossroads. As its name suggested, this inn was located in the center of the Riverlands, and therefore most of the other Seven Kingdoms were within a few weeks travel. Glumly rubbing the bruise made by the inkeeper's boot, you wondered which direction to go in search of work. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShould you go North? Ruled by House Stark, and home to several other prominent Houses like the Forresters, Whitehills, and Glenmores, the people of this harsh, cold kingdom could use some to help bringing in the harvest in preparation for winter, or bringing in the daily catch of fish at the port city of White Harbor. Even further north of that is the Wall that separates the Seven Kingdoms from the savage wildling people, and the prospect of going there both terrifies and intrigues you...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr you could go West to the Westerlands. Ruled by the wealthy House Lannister, the people of this rocky kingdom could use some assistance digging gold out of their many mines. West of the Westerlands lie the Iron Islands, populated by the fierce and piratical Iron born. They might be able to use your help in their iron mines.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoing South would be another option. South of the Riverlands are the kingdoms of the Stormlands, Reach and Dorne, ruled by Houses Baratheon, Tyrell and Martell respectively. The Stormlands is known for its windswept coasts and forests, the Reach for its fertile soil, and Dorne for its sweltering desert climate. You might be able to hunt in the Stormlands' vast forests. In contrast, the Reach could use your help bringing in their bountiful harvest, and the people of Dorne would surely appreciate some help digging wells. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the East lie the Vale, ruled by House Arryn, and the Crownlands, ruled by the King of Westeros from his capital of King's Landing. The Vale is a cold, hilly kingdom, and yet is known for its agricultural output, and you could probably find work harvesting it. And if all else fails, well, there's always work to be had in the capital, if you aren't choosy about what you're willing to do. Of course, just because you go to the capital doesn't mean you have to stay there. Offshore from King's Landing in the Narrow Sea lies the mysterious island fortress of Dragonstone, the ancient citadel of House Targaryen. Like the far North, Dragonstone too is a mysterious place that few dare venture to. Who knows what you could find if you had the courage to visit?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen again, why stay in Westeros at all? To the East, across the Narrow Sea lies the continent of Essos, home to the Free Cities, the Dothraki Sea, and gods know what else! You've heard rumors of monsters, sorcerers, and other mysterious things in Essos, though you've never had the chance to go there. Why not travel to Maidenpool, a seaside town in the Riverlands itself, and sign up to work on a merchant ship that'll take you to Essos? Who knows what job opportunities are available there? Then again, it might be safer to stay in Westeros, where things are familiar...</span></div></div>",

It is by far the largest of the Seven Kingdoms, and the old families in Westeros originate from there.

Also, people will be looking for ways to stay warm, which would include huddling up with others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn that note, the women in the North are quite remarkable.

The Baratheons have occupied the Iron Throne for the past decade and a-half. It matters not to you who rules the Seven Kingdoms; all you want is the comfort of an older woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEddard of House Stark, the Lord Paramount of the North, was King Robert Baratheon's closest friend growing up. Not long ago, the king rode all the way to Winterfell just to ask Lord Eddard to be Hand of the King. He did this after the death of his previous Hand, Lord Jon Arryn, who had been their mentor when they were boys.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLord Eddard may be absent from his homeland, but that does not mean the hospitality of the North went with him. As such, you turn to northern end of the crossroads and urge Aerion forward. There you begin the long ride to the northern half of the continent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight now, we must address how far we are into the canon story line.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Recently, Lord Eddard Stark was executed - some say \"murdered\" - by the order of King Joffrey Baratheon. Lord Eddard's eldest son, Robb, and his vassals had already been waging a war against the Westerlords, who were sworn to Joffrey due to his Lannister blood. The realm is effectively at war with itself now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou do not particularly care which side wins. After all, these political matters are none of your concern. Even so, since Robb Stark and most of his bannermen are currently south of the Neck, there are a lot fewer people currently in the North as a result.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat implies that the North may have a lot of opportunities for work. It also implies that many of the women in the North are in need of male companionship. Thus, you have two good reasons for heading up that way. And so you do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou ride Aerion northward for a couple weeks, never straying too far from the Kingsroad. Before long, you arrive at the swamps of the Neck. It takes you and your horse another week to traverse through them. Once you emerge, you find yourself at Moat Cailin. As of now, you are officially in the North. The sudden decrease in temperature is proof of that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou have a few choices on where to go from here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could make for the Wolfswood in the northwest region. Ironwood trees are in abundance in that part of the North, and there are plenty of families who would give you related opportunities for work. Those include House Glover, House Forrester, House Whitehill, and House Glenmore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother option is to go to the Wall. Although the Night's Watch is composed solely of men, you might be able to head north and try to ingratiate yourself with the wildlings. You have no quarrel with the Free Folk; they may be willing to accept one such as you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe possibilities do not end there. There are plenty of other places in the North you can visit, such as Hornwood, Barrowton, Bear Island, White Harbor... or even Winterfell, the ancestral home of House Stark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere do you ultimately choose to go?</span></div></div>",

Therefore, you figure the Wolfswood would probably yield your most ideal prospects.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt also helps that there are plenty of beautiful women in the Wolfswood, as well. According to what you have heard, anyway. You may be disinterested in politics and nobility, but you make it your business to learn of the whereabouts of the foremost beauties of Westeros. The Wolfswood houses several.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere is Lady Elissa Forrester, the wife of Lord Gregor of Ironrath, and a mother of six. She is from the Crownlands originally. With the exception of her brother Ser Malcolm, her entire family died during Robert's Rebellion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere is Lady Elaena Glenmore of Rillwater Crossing, the oldest daughter of the current Lord Glenmore. There is talk of a betrothal between her and Lady Elissa's firstborn son, Rodrik. Nothing has been finalized yet, though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere is Lady Gwyn Whitehill, the only daughter of Lord Ludd of Highpoint. She is not at all like her father and brothers, who are recognized by many for their arrogance and cruelty. You heard she was once involved with Lady Elissa's second son, Asher Forrester. That affair ultimately got him exiled from his house. Apparently, he was now somewhere across the Narrow Sea, making a name for himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere is Lady Sybelle Glover of Deepwood Motte. Formerly a member of House Locke, she is now married to Robett Glover, and she has two children by him. While her husband and his elder brother Galbart are fighting in the south, she is managing Deepwood Motte in their absence. A wife can get fairly lonely whilst her husband is away, even with her children for company.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIs there any house you are inclined to favor over the others?</span></div></div>",

Your expertise in that field would definitely benefit them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore notable than that, however, is the current Lady of House Forrester. Although Lady Elissa has given birth to six children - three of which are older than you - some have said that she still has the figure and complexion of a woman half her age. You have also heard a few men mention that they envy Lord Gregor for having such a lovely wife.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith her husband and eldest son in the south and her second son across the Narrow Sea, Elissa Forrester must be feeling rather lonely at present.

In light of House Forrester's fate in Telltatle's Game of Thrones, it may be ideal to change a few things around so that you do not end up suffering the same fate as the other occupants of Ironrath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWould you prefer to do things differently or keep them the same?</span></div></div>",

Just assume they perished fairly early on in the War of the Five Kings. Ideally, they could have fallen at the Green Fork or the Whispering Wood.). At any rate, since Gwyn is the only Whitehill left (other than her brother Ebbert, who is at the Citadel, and therefore, cannot inherit anything), she has assumed responsibility as the Lady of Highpoint and head of her family.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFurthermore, unlike her father and brothers, Gwyn is genuinely interested in repairing the hostilities between House Whitehill and House Forrester. She is currently in the process of striving towards that objective. As part of their reparations, Lady Elissa has arranged for both Ethan and Ryon to be fostered at Highpoint as Gwyn's wards. She is taking MUCH better care of them than her father did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that Ludd is dead, House Whitehill no longer holds any resentment towards Asher for his fling with Gwyn. As such, Elissa has already sent her brother Malcolm to Essos to retrieve Asher. They may return much sooner than in canon, and they can come back with Beshka (and maybe Amara, too).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt present, Talia is the only one of Lady Forrester's children who was with her at Ironrath at the start of the game and is still there with her mother right now. However, suppose that when you arrive, Mira is there, too. Do not worry too much about why. Maybe Margaery has given her leave to visit her family or something like that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBetter yet, maybe Margaery happens to be visiting the North just for the pleasure of it, and she is a guest of the Glenmores or the Forresters. This could take place sometime before her wedding to Renly. Sure, she never visited the North in canon. She never even had a reason to visit it (other than House Tyrell's connections with House Glenmore), nor did she ever show any interest in visiting it. Still, we ARE taking liberties here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow does all this sound?</span></div></div>",

Honestly, it is not very big or all that great, but it still looks much nicer and far more accommodating than any other building you've ever been inside of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuncan Tuttle leads you to the main hall, where Lady Elissa Forrester is sitting in a chair in front of a fireplace, knitting. Two girls are seated in chairs beside her. One appears older than you; the other younger. You assume they are her daughters Mira and Talia respectively. They may have been talking before you showed up, but when you and Duncan enter, they fall silent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuncan has you remain at the entrance of the room. Then he approaches the three ladies, bows his head to them, and states \"Please forgive this interruption, my ladies.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is no bother, Duncan,\" Lady Elissa assures the castellan, \"I'm certain you have a good reason for it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe castellan nods his head and gestures for you to come forward. You slowly walk over to him, and you bow to the three females of House Forrester.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLady Elissa Forrester is definitely in her forties. Even so, her beauty has not faded with age. Her tanned face and skin are almost totally free of wrinkles, her long light brown hair is braided in an elegant pattern, and her curves are quite obvious, especially around her bosom. The blue and gray dress she is wearing accentuates them nicely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn terms of apperance, Talia Forrester can almost be regarded as a shrunken version of her mother. She looks almost exactly like Lady Elissa. She has the same face, the same light brown hair braided in the same style, the same lips, the same nose, and even the same dress. The only major difference is that Talia does not have much of a chest. Her curves have yet to come in, it seems.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMira Forrester seems to take after her father more. Although her hair is braided the same as her mother and sister, it is a shade of dark brown instead. Her skin is a little paler, her lips are more supple, and her forehead is a little larger. You have heard she is working as a handmaiden for Lady Margaery of House Tyrell. As to why she is here now... maybe she is on leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA beautiful woman and two beautiful girls are gathered in front of you. This makes being ill worth it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This young man claims to be well-acquainted with the ironwood industry,\" Duncan tells his lady and her daughters, \"He is here to inquire about the possibility of employment with you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smile softly, and you open your mouth to confirm what Duncan has said. However, all of a sudden, you feel an itch in your nose. You quickly turn away and place your left bicep over the lower half of your face. You sneeze into your arm multiple times in rapid succession.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce you finally stop, you sniff again, turn back to the Forrester ladies, and tell them in a slightly raspy voice \"I beg you to excuse me for that. I seem to have misjudged the climate of this country. Even so, what your castellen has told you is true, milady. I am invested in the ironwood trade. I would be most honored if you would consider allowing me to work for you. If you wish, I could provide a list of my qualifications.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens now?</span></div></div>",

For now, Brynden, you must get off your feet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are confused. \"Why do you say that, milady?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are not well,\" Lady Elissa points out. She then turns to her castellan and orders him \"Duncan, fetch the maester. Tell him to meet me in my bedchamber.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bearded man seems surprised. \"Is that necessary, my lady?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLady Elissa glares at him incredulously. \"Can you not see that he is sick? He should not be negotiating for a job. He should be resting.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well, my lady,\" the castellen firmly declares, bowing and exiting the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce he is gone, the Lady of Ironrath turns to her daughters and tells them \"Mira, Talia, please help me with our guest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Mother,\" the two Northern girls reply in unison, standing up. The two of them go to your sides and each one gives you a helping hand. You are thankful for their assistance; by now, you are so exhausted, that you feel you may collapse at any moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three Forrester ladies then escort you to the bedchamber of the Lady of Ironrath. When you get there, you wonder why they brought you there of all places. The maester's office or a vacant guest room may have been more practical.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen again, they probably have their reasons. At least they seem genuinely concerned for your well-being.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat do the ladies do now?</span></div></div>",

You turn to her and mutter \"I may have misheard you, milady. Did you just... ask me to strip?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I said that we are going to undress you,\" she corrects you. There may be a difference, but the result is fundamentally the same. At any rate, Lady Elissa and her girls begin to remove your attire, starting with your leather armor. Once the breastplate is off, Elissa says \"It has been snowing since dawn. If you have been riding all day, you've gathered quite a bit of it. Even your armor is soaked. It will do you no good to stay in your cold and damp attire. You will only get more ill for as long as you do not change out of it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou cannot really argue with that. It would be better to take off these wet, dirty, and uncomfortable clothes. By now, Mira has already removed your gauntlets, and Talia has already removed your greaves. Their lady mother proceeds to unfasten and pull off your doublet. Now you are in your boots, tunic, and breeches. Somehow, those have gotten soaked, as well. Were you really in the snow for THAT long?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Forrester ladies do not stop there. They swiftly strip off your boots, tunic, and breeches. Now you are in just your smallclothes. You are uncertain about being this naked in front of them. However, it turns out they plan to go even further.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Settle down on the bed,\" Lady Elissa instructs you, gently moving you towards it. Once you are laying on the warm sheets, Lady Elissa moves to take off your smallclothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis is where you finally protest. You declare \"Milady, I am very thankful for your concern, but I do not believe it would be appropriate of me to appear completely naked in front of you. I am certain your daughters are of a like mind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are wrong. Lady Elissa and her girls just chuckle at your anxiety. The Lady of Ironrath then smiles and says \"Worry not, Brynden. You will not be nude for very long. I have something for you to wear. Something very thick and soft.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wonder what she could be talking about. But at least she does not plan to keep you totally naked for long. So, you allow her to take your damp smallclothes off of you. Your crotch is left exposed, and you involuntarily cover yourself down there. Mira and Talia just giggle some more. How could they possibly be alright with this? Moreover, how could their mother think this is acceptable?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile you are reflecting on this, Lady Elissa proceeds to get out the aforementioned article of clothing she had in mind for you.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Lady Elissa walks over to a closet, opens it up, and pulls out a large bag. She brings this bag over to the bed and sits down beside you. She then takes out a large piece of white cloth and begins to fold it in a certain manner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt quickly dawns on you that she is holding a large cloth diaper. You are taken aback by that realization, and you want to protest. You ask her \"Are you suggesting that I wear a nappy, milady?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No,\" Elissa Forrester responds, \"I am saying that you WILL wear a nappy. Mira, Talia.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that, the two daughters of Ironrath each grab one of your arms and legs and holds them down against the bed. Evidently, Lady Elissa will tolerate no resistance or disobedience, much to your dismay. You are going to be diapered, whether you like it or not. There is little you can do to go against her wishes; her girls have your limbs immobilized.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough you are slightly shorter than the average man, you are not usually weak. Over the course of your life, you exercises regularly to keep your strength up. You have built up quite a bit of muscle as a result.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNormally, you would easily be able to break free of Mira and Talia's grip. Alas, certain other factors have rendered you incapable of that. Namely, there is the fact that you have been on the road for several weeks, and you spent the whole day riding. Thus, you are very tired. There is also the matter of your cold, and the fact that you are still a little chilly. With all that together, you are practically helpless against these two girls and their mother. You could not fight back even if you wanted to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's when you wonder... do you REALLY want to? After all, being cared for by three very beautiful highborn ladies might not be so bad. Being diapered may be a small price to pay. Furthermore, to be fair, you DO feel quite weak right now. You barely even have the strength to get up to go to the privy. As such, the diapers might actually be a good idea. It would certainly be better than ruining the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, you decide to give in. You announce \"If you believe this is for the best, milady, I won't argue the point. I'll let you put me in a nappy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a good lad,\" Lady Elissa says approvingly. She then takes three more things out of the bag: a jar of powder, a jar of cream, and a container of pins. While Mira and Talia continued to hold you down (in the event that you suddenly change your mind, you assume), their lady mother proceeds to diaper you. She applies a healthy amount of powder and cream to your private area, and she rubs them in thoroughly. Your member threatens to rise a couple times. You use every remaining ounce of strength you have to keep it under control. Once your crotch has been prepared, Lady Elissa slips the cloth diaper under your bottom. She pulls the front up between your legs, brings up the sides, and pins them in place securely. She then inspects your diapered crotch to ensure that it is adequately padded, and that the nappy is on properly. After this, she pats your diaper and tells you \"Please understand, Brynden, that I AM doing this for your own good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do understand, milady,\" you assure her. To be honest, the diaper is surprisingly enjoyable to wear. It envelops you in a strange feeling of security and comfort. It also presses up against your manhood. If someone was to rub against it... just the thought makes your member twitch a bit. Thankfully, the diaper is so thick that it does not give away your excitement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMira and Talia release your arms and legs, and they both sneak a few pats at your padded crotch, too. They snicker when you blush in embarrassment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, there is a knock on the door to the bedchamber. It turns out to be Ortengryn, the maester of Ironrath. Obviously, he is here to tend to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight now, you are in nothing but your new diapers. Do the Forrester ladies give you something to wear over your padding before the maester comes in?</span></div></div>",

At the same time, the older girl helps her mother to raise your upper body up a little on the bed. As you rest your back against the pillows, the maester enters the bedchamber.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe is many years younger than Duncan Tuttle, yet he has an even longer beard than the castellan. He also has the look of a man from the Vale. There is a gentle smile and a caring expression on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You summoned me, my lady?\" the maester says to Elissa, as he follows Talia over to the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Maester Ortengryn,\" the Lady of Ironrath confirms. She places a hand on your shoulder and announces \"This boy arrived less than an hour ago. He seems to have fallen ill. I would like you to examine him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaester Ortengryn nods his head, continues to smile, and states \"As you wish, my lady.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this moment, Lady Elissa and Mira are seated on either side of you. Mira gets up to make way for the maester, and he takes her place at your right side. He then proceeds to give you a short medical examination.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe measures your pulse, your heartbeat, and your breathing. He also gazes up your nose and uses a very small stick to take a nasal specimen. Then he presses his hand on your forehead to check your body temperature. He handles you very carefully, as though you are made of glass. Because of that, you feel as though you can trust this man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully, he does not go so far as to examine your private section. At least you are spared THAT much dignity. Interestingly, he says nothing about your padding. You are certain he has noticed it, but he does not seem bothered by it. It is almost as though he regards it as perfectly normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that you think about it, it IS a bit odd that they would just happen to have diapers large enough to fit someone your age. That makes you wonder; could someone else at Ironrath wear nappies? Maybe even one of Lady Elissa's children?</span></div></div>",

She does not even have stockings or smallclothes on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn spite of that, you cannot deny that she is absolutely gorgeous. Her arms and chest are toned from adapting to the hostile Northern climate. Her thin waist complements her wide hips. Her womanly curves are utterly flawless. Her skin is free of hair and freckles. There is not a blemish anywhere on her body. Most of all, her breasts are even larger than they appeared to be when she was dressed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll-in-all, Lady Elissa is a vision of beauty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo top it all off, the pose and expression she is throwing your way comes off as a little seductive.

Although I survived, I was saddened by that loss. My husband and children helped me to cope.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are taken aback. \"Then your new family filled the void left behind by your old family?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Indeed,\" says Lady Elissa, giving you another loving hug, \"Perhaps I may be able to do the same for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow do you react to that?</span></div></div>",

You had even considered the possibility that Mira, who is slightly older than you, wore them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut apparently, none of those are the case. It turns out Lady Elissa herself is the one who wears them. You never would have guessed that, except maybe in one of your fantasies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You wear nappies?\" you ask, checking to ensure that you have not misheard her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" the Lady of Ironrath shamelessly admits, \"But not because I need them or anything of the sort,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then why DO you wear them?\" you ask curiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLady Elissa smiles and explains: \"It started when I was pregnant with my son Rodrik. You see, many expectant women have weaker bladder control. My case in particular was extreme; I lost it almost completely. This happened every time I became pregnant. As a solution, each time I was with the child, the maester recommended that I wear nappies until I gave birth. Only he and my lord husband know of this. And now, you, too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are amazed that she would entrust you with such a secret. Her reason for wearing diapers is actually a valid one. However, there are certain details that do not add up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How old is your son Ryon?\" you inquire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's about to witness his seventh nameday,\" Elissa replies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you planning on having any more children?\" you ask next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, there is YOU,\" Elissa tells you with a wry grin, stroking your cheek and making you blush, \"But if you mean children from my own womb, I do not have any such plans.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then why do you still have the nappies?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because I LIKE them,\" Lady Elissa reveals, much to your surprise. She explains: \"By the time I was carrying Mira, I came to discover that I somehow enjoyed wearing nappies. It mostly has to do with the way they press up against my womanhood, as well as how bulky, soothing, and cumbersome they feel. They are comfortable, reassuring, and stimulating all at once.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou cannot really argue with that. Truthfully, your own padding has a similar effect on your manhood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do not wear nappies all the time,\" Elissa informs you, \"Just every once in a while, usually when my husband and I have gone a long time without becoming intimate. You might think of them as a substitute for relieving tension.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat actually makes sense, though you are loath to admit it. You gaze at Lady Elissa's nude figure once more, and not just to admire it this time. You try to imagine how that gorgeous body would look with a thick layer of white cloth wrapped around the loins. You can partly imagine it, and you partly cannot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile you are staring at Elissa's body, she suddenly asks you very seriously \"Would you like to see me in a nappy, Brynden?\"</span></div></div>",

The body appears to belong to a woman, and she is lying face-up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou have no idea who that woman might be, but it occurs to you that she might be alive. Even if the chances are slim, you are unwilling to turn a blind eye.

As such, your only feasible option is to try to treat her yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou examine the wound in her throat a little more closely, and you realize she is not actually cut too deep. You have enough knowledge of treating injuries that you may be able to mend her wound on your own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou quickly bring the wounded woman to your campfire; Aerion shies away from the scent of blood. After placing her down just a few feet away from the fire, you draw your dagger and hold the blade over the fire. When it is hot enough, you lightly but firmly press it against the cut in the woman's neck, effectively cauterizing the wound.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce that is done, you are able to stitch her neck up. You figure that the flesh will be able to repair itself on its own within a couple weeks. You can be certain of that because you once received a similar wound in your chest, which you also treated yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the woman is out of danger, you can breath a sigh of relief. Still, you cannot help but wonder who she is. You can always speculate, but you ultimately decide to just wait until she wakes up, and then ask her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou bring her into your tent, and then you gently strip off her wet clothes.

The woman is still asleep, but she looks as though she is going to awaken at any moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou decide to slip out of the tent, get dressed, and make breakfast. You figure that should be the first order of business, as the woman looks as though she has not eaten in at least a few days. Plus, you have no idea what state of mind she will be in when she comes around. You may as well try to get on her good side by providing some services.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy now, the campfire has gone out. You quickly start it up again, and you place a skillet with some eggs and sausages on top of it. While everything cooks, you get dressed. Once you have your underclothes and light armor on, breakfast is finished. You feed Aerion some oats and apples, and then you bring the eggs and sausage inside the tent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as you reenter your sleeping space, the woman stirs. With some difficulty, she manages to open her eyes and sit up a bit. You come to her side and help her into a more comfortable position. \"Take it easy, my lady. You shouldn't overexert yourself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looks at you in surprise, and she tries to back away. She asks \"Where am I? How did I get here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're in a tent along the Trident,\" you say, \"I found you floating in it last night, and I fished you out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why?\" she says suspiciously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because I couldn't very well have left you out there,\" you reply in a very straightforward tone, \"No one deserves to be cast aside like that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe is surprised by your humility and kindness. A moment later, she presses her hands against the front of her throat, and she feels the cut in it, along with the stitches you put in. She asks \"Did you... do this, too?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I did,\" you reply, \"And you may wish to keep on hand on that blanket, my lady. There is nothing else beneath it covering you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looks down and realizes that she has no clothes on, and she hastily pulls the blanket over her nearly-exposed breasts. She glares at you and mutters suspiciously \"Why am I naked?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I needed to check you for additional injuries, and your clothing was too wet to sleep in,\" you explain, \"Worry not; I hung it out last night. It should be dry by now. I'll get it for you after we eat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well,\" she says, though she clings to the blanket. You cannot blame her; no woman wants to be exposed in front of strangers, even if they appear friendly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman is too weak to hold anything, so you proceed to feed her yourself. With some difficulty, she manages to swallow about a third of the eggs and sausage. You help yourself to the rest of the food, and then you retrieve her clothing for her. She asks you for help dressing, as she is also too weak to lift her arms very much. Apparently, she has already concluded that she can trust you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she is dressed, you say \"Now, I believe I should introduce myself. My name is Brynden. I am a man of many trades.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe remarks \"You look a bit young to be a man just yet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose,\" you mutter, \"Might I ask your name, my lady?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe hesitates a moment, and then she reveals \"Catelyn Stark.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are flabbergasted. Sitting before you was the elder sister of Edmure Tully, as well as the wife of the late Lord Eddard Stark and the mother of his children. Including King Robb, who had been murdered at the Twins not three days earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou promptly kneel before her and declare \"I offer you my deepest condolences for your losses, my lady. And... I offer you my service, for whatever it is worth. House Frey may be the overlords of the Riverlands now, but I have lived in this region all my life, and I refuse to acknowledge the leadership of anyone other than the Tullys.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe is impressed and touched by that. She grins softly and says \"Thank you, my boy. That means more to me than words can convey. But are you certain you wish to do this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course,\" you insist, \"I am not about to abandon a lady in her hour of need.

She leans forward, wraps her arms around you, and pulls you into a hug. You tenderly hug her back, being careful not to squeeze too tightly.

Anyway, I am about to break camp. You can help if you'd like, but please do not strain yourself. Otherwise, your stitches may open up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I understand, darling,\" she tells you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile you take down the tent and pack up it and the rest of your supplies, Lady Catelyn tends to Aerion. The horse seems to take a liking to her fairly quickly. That is good; if this relationship is going to work, you'll need them to get along.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce you've gathered all your supplies, Lady Catelyn helps you load it onto Aerion. You then gesture to the saddle and say \"You should ride him, my l- Mummy. You are in no condition to walk great distances just yet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe cannot argue that, but she does say \"There seems to be room enough to fit us both, sweetheart.

Like the rest of the house, it looks practically untouched.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere is a changing table on one side of the room, stocked with diapers, pins, and changing materials. On the other side of the room is a crib, which appears to be large enough to hold a grown person. There is also an assortment of toys and other supplies meant for babies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are surprised to see all this here. Lady Catelyn, however, seems pleased. She comments \"This is perfect.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean, Mummy?\" you ask in confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turns to you, smiles, and says \"Since I am now your mother, I can raise you from the very beginning. That should mean I use everything that comes with caring for babes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are stunned when you realize what she is implying. You assume \"You mean... you wish to make use of this nursery?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I want you to be my babe,\" she confirms, speaking in a tone that would allow no argument or objection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Does that include nappies?\" you ask, though you can imagine the answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Naturally,\" she replies simply. She then tugs on your hand and instructs you \"Now come on. We should get started right away.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough you have mixed feelings, you do not wish to shatter Lady Catelyn's hopes. Besides, after everything she has endured, she deserves a chance to relieve motherhood. Besides, it is not as though it is a selfish wish or a harmful one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou allow Catelyn Stark to lead you over to the changing table. Then she helps you out of your clothes until you are fully naked. You blush and attempt to cover yourself, but she pulls your hand away and says \"It is alright. You have seen me naked; now I see you naked. We will be seeing each other naked often from now on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou realize just how true that is, and you gradually move your hands away. Lady Catelyn helps you onto the changing table. She then grabs a pair of cloth diapers, folds them together, and slides them underneath you. She proceeds to apply some powder and lotion to your groin. The sensation of her hands along your privates is quite stimulating, but you keep from getting hard. Once she is finished, she pulls the padding up between your legs and pins it up on both sides.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe is not finished just yet, though. She proceeds to take out another pair of diapers, fold them up, and slide them under you as well. She pins them on over the first pair, effectively layering you in multiple diapers. She must wish to make certain you do not leak. If so... there is no doubt she means for you to USE these diapers. Not that you can complain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce you are padded, Catelyn Stark helps you to your feet, pats your padded bottom, and kisses your forehead. You have to admit; the nappies are quite comfortable and soft.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So... what now, Mummy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiles and replies with...</span></div></div>",

You mutter nervously \"Shouldn't I put on a little more before we go out, Mummy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do not believe that will be necessary,\" Lady Catelyn argues, \"It is still quite warm outside; it is unlikely you would feel cold.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is not the issue,\" you claim, gesturing to your diapers, \"I feel quite under-dressed, and the only article I AM wearing is traditionally worn by someone much younger than myself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe merely shakes her head and says \"Do not let it bother you. We have not seen anyone else all day, and I doubt anyone will still be on the road at this time of day. Besides... you are my babe, and when it is warm, babes do not need any clothes other than their nappies. You must get accustomed to being dressed this way, honey.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt is obvious to you that she is not going to flex on this subject. So, you reluctantly agree to go out in just your diapers. You take Catelyn's hand, and the both of you head out. Your padding is so thick that you have no hope of walking normally. Instead, you move with a very pronounced waddle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you arrive outside, Catelyn sits down on the porch. She has you sit on her lap, and she cuddles you close.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn spite of your initial skepticism about being dressed like a baby in public, you have to admit that you kind of like the thrill of wearing just your diapers outside. It makes you feel rebellious and daring. Plus, the diapers ARE a bit of fun to wear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Catelyn Stark lounge on the front porch and observe the Sun as it drops over the western horizon. Every now and then, Catelyn plants a soft kiss on your forehead or cheek, and you sigh in bliss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn hour later, the Sun has vanished in the distance completely. After that, Lady Catelyn looks to you and declares \"Alright, sweetie. Now, it is time for dinner.\"</span></div></div>",

I am quite experienced in feeding from the breast. Of course, I have never nursed someone as big as you, but that makes little different. Just relax, and trust in your mummy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer gentle tone and delicate words win you over. You decide to turn all control over to Lady Catelyn. She smiles at how compliant you are being, and she pulls your head closer to her chest. You latch onto her nipple and begin suckling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first, nothing comes out. Then, about ten seconds later, a little milk starts to flow into your mouth. It gradually increase in volume over the next few minutes. You close your eyes and savor the experience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatelyn begins humming a lullaby, and she cradles your body close to you. The sensation of suckling on her breast is starting to excite you. You feel yourself getting hard in your diapers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLady Catelyn must have noticed, as you hear her chuckle and say \"It seems my baby enjoys being fed by Mummy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blush at that statement, but she strokes your head and mutters in assurance \"It is alright. It is perfectly natural for a boy your age. You can rely on me to handle those problems in the future.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe implication of that statement causes the bulge in your nappies to rise a little more. You are sorely tempted to reach down and rub your padded crotch, but you do not wish to risk displeasing your new mother. So instead, you just continue drinking her milk and clinging to her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you fed, she comments \"If the choice had been mine, I would have continued raising all my children in this fashion. Alas, they had to grow up. That is one thing I disliked about the North; children are expected to grow up faster there than everywhere else in the realm.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat would explain why Northwomen are said to be the most caring mothers in the Seven Kingdoms; since they have less time to raise their children, they tend to cherish their children's upbringing all the more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter about twenty minutes, you have drained both of Catelyn's breasts. She then lifts you up, places your chin on her shoulder, and pats you on the back. You let out a soft burp, to which she says \"Good boy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe takes a moment to fix her dress, and then she gets to her feet. She helps you stand up, and she leads you back into the house.</span></div></div>",

Although the problem might not have been as obvious to some, you realize what is wrong almost immediately. Lady Catelyn had been drifting down a river unconscious for almost a full day, and her throat had been cut beforehand, causing her to lose a lot of blood. There is no possibility she could have recovered from that THIS quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is all my fault,\" you think aloud, \"We shouldn't have spent the whole day riding. We should have stopped to rest more often.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is alright,\" she assures you, \"What matters is that we got here together.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shake your head, say \"It is not alright,\" and then you lead her into the master bedroom.

You must be an odd sight: a teenager in nothing but diapers tending to a grown, fully-clothed woman. \"You must take it easy for now, Mummy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is unnecessary,\" she insists, \"I am the mummy, and you are the babe. I am the one who should be taking care of you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know,\" you tell her, \"But Mummy should also take care of herself, otherwise she won't be fit to support herself OR her babe. Please, let me look after you. Just for tonight, so you can regain your strength.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatelyn Stark looks as though she wishes to protest, but she hesitates before refusing. After reflecting on your compromise, she decides to accept it. \"Very well. If you insist. But promise me that come tomorrow, you will let me treat you the same.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I promise,\" you assure her, \"In return, please promise me that between now and sunrise, you will not get out of this bed for ANY reason.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I could TRY not to get up,\" your new mother remarks, \"But suppose nature calls, and I need to use the privy.

If you wear these nappies, you will not even have to get up for the privy. Please, Mummy... just let me do this for you. I want you to get better.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLady Catelyn Stark finds herself at a loss for words. It would seem she is touched by how much you care, as well as how compelling an argument you make. So, she smiles gently and remarks \"Alright. If you believe it is for the best, I will not protest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smile and nod in approval.

Of course, you do not wish her to catch a chill, so you fetch a blanket from a nearby closet, and you spread it over her, saying \"Make sure to keep warm.

I'll attend to the house in the meantime.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe simply nods and gets comfortable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou spend most of the evening going around the place and seeing to some everyday household chores. You place more wood in the fireplace to fuel the fire, dust some of the surfaces, sweep the floor, and put away the clothes (both yours and Lady Catelyn's). All the while, you are clad in just the thick, cloth nappies your new mother put you in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt one point, you go outside to give Aerion some supper. Even then, you do not put any more clothing on. You boldly waddle over to the stable with some apples and carrots, which you feed to your beloved horse. Aerion seems unaffected by his master's sudden, odd change in apparel. Then again, why wouldn't he be? While he is very intelligent and faithful, he is still just a horse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou have to admit that wearing nothing but your diaper outdoors really is surprisingly exciting and fun. But you remind yourself to be cautious. If anyone other than Catelyn Stark or Aerion saw you like this, it might not bode well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Aerion is fed and watered, you waddle back into the house. Then you make some supper for yourself and your new mother. Although the breastmilk was quite nourishing, you'd prefer to have something solid to complement it. So, you make a simple rabbit stew. Once it is ready, you divide it into two bowls, and you take them to the master bedroom, along with some napkins and a pair of spoons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou help Lady Catelyn sit up a little, and you give her one of the bowls and spoons. You place one of the napkins on her lap. Although she is a little weak, she manages to eat by herself. She does spill a bit every now and then, but luckily, her napkin catches most of it. At one point, a bit of stew gets on one of her breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou get a mischievous idea, and you lean forward and lick the stain off of Catelyn's breast. She giggles at the sensation, and says \"Thank you, sweetie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou just smile back. You feel as though it should be YOU thanking HER.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she is finished with her dinner, she turns to you and asks \"Would you like me to feed you yours?\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I once visited the Islands when I was even younger.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"By yourself?\" she says, skeptically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod firmly, and you tell her \"Yes, by myself. Everywhere I've gone in the last ten years, I've gone all on my own. That is how long I have been without family or friends. That may not impress you as much as it would impress most others. The Ironborn are infamous for overcoming hardships, after all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It IS impressive for a greenlander,\" she remarks, suddenly a little more interested in you. She smirks and remarks \"And here I thought those who lived on the mainland were weak and incapable. If you've gotten by all on your own, you must be an exception. But even so... a wise man once said 'words are wind.'\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you wish me to prove my worth, milady, I will do so,\" you declare, \"I will not be dead weight; I can be useful.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That will not be necessary,\" she assures you. She holds her hand out to her vessel and announces \"You may come aboard.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grin and say \"I thank you immensely.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe grins back and remarks \"Before I let you join us, I would like to know your name first.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Brynden,\" you reveal, \"This is my horse, Aerion. Might I bring him with me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course,\" she replies. She then extends her arm out to you. You slowly reach out, take her hand, and shake it. She tells you \"My name is Asha Greyjoy, captain of the Black Wind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are astonished. This enticing beauty before you is the daughter of Lord Balon Greyjoy? Even so, you don't say anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crew of the Black Wind help you load Aerion into the cargo hold. Once he is secured, Lady Asha leads you back to the upper levels.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, where will I be staying for the voyage?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will take you there now,\" she tells you.</span></div></div>",

Mainly, your setting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou find yourself seated in a soft wooden chair. Your hands are behind your back, and there is a soft clinking sound coming from behind you, which suggests that your hands are shackled together. Your feet seem to be shackled together, as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother thing that has changed is your appearance. You have been stripped of most - if not all - of your clothing. Your chest, arms, and legs are now totally bare. You are uncertain if the lower half of your torso is bare, as well. Either it is and you are sitting on some soft cushion, or it is not and you are wearing... something strange.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, you notice a bit of movement in the cabin. Someone is lying on the bed. As your eyes adjust to the darkness, you realize it is Asha. She gets up and lights a candle on the nightstand. That is when you notice that HER appearance has changed, too. All she seems to be wearing is a low-cut nightgown, which barely contains her breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter lighting the candle, Asha grins at you and saunters over to your chair. You have mixed feelings to this sensuous display. You stammer \"M-milady, w-w-what is the m-meaning of this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsha chuckles and says \"You need not fret. I am trying to help you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou raise an eyebrow and ask \"Help me with what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You grew up alone, correct?\" she presumed. As you nod to confirm, she explains \"It is always tragic when one has no one to turn to. Even the Ironborn treasure family and community. That is why you are here. I am going to give you the attention you were denied your whole life.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How so?\" you ask, now more curious than frightened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsha does not answer right away. Instead, she decides to show you. She picks up the candle and brings it closer to the chair. She then takes her free hand, and brings it down to your crotch.

I have always refused. Most highborn women may already be married with at least one child by my age, but I am more interested in captaining this vessel, managing my crew, and fighting alongside them. I often jape that my axe is my husband and my dirk is my suckling babe. However...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pauses here. After about ten seconds of silence, you beckon her to continue with \"Well?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looks you in the eye and resumes with \"Recently, I have been giving some thought to having a family of my own. But I am keeping those wishes a secret; if my lord father and lady mother caught wind of it, they would waste no time selecting some suitors for me. The man I wed will be one of MY choosing, not theirs. However... I desire a man who could be both my husband... AND my babe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow you understand a little more. Gesturing to your diapered crotch, you assume \"And you picked me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, for now, I am simply <i>considering</i> you,\" Asha explains, \"You and I only met this morning. That is hardly enough time to decide if marriage is practical. But so far, you are a more promising candidate than anyone else I have considered.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you do this to ALL the candidates?\" you ask, snickering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" she tells you, placing a hand on your padding, which excites you a bit,  \"Most of the others were far less composed and reasonable than you. Yet you seem surprisingly dignified. Could it be you actually like the nappy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will admit I was startled at first,\" you tell her, \"But now that I know you're not trying to humiliate me, this is not so bad. This nappy is actually rather comfortable. It's much softer than anything I've ever worn. I could do without the shackles, though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Those are just a precaution,\" she claims, \"In case you reacted unfavorably. They came in handy with several of your predecessors. But they won't be needed with you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then you'll take them off?\" you ask hopefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In a bit,\" she tells you, \"But first...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then stands up and lifts up the hem of her nightgown, revealing...</span></div></div>",

Second, to answer your question, I am wearing a nappy simply because I enjoy doing so. Captaining a ship is very fulfilling for me, but it can also be quite stressful and exhausting. I've found that nappies are a surprisingly efficient way to relieve some of that stress and exhaustion.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How often do you wear them?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only when I am alone in my cabin,\" Asha answers, \"You are the only other person who knows of this particular interest of mine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about the other 'candidates' who came before me?\" you point out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As I said before, most of them did not react favorably to being put in a nappy,\" she informs you, \"None of them ever found out that I wear them, too.

On you it looks... enticing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat seems to please Asha. She smiles, looks down at your diapered crotch, and says \"You seem to wear them quite well, too. In fact... what say we have a bit of fun with them?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What type of fun?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that, Asha lifts up her nightgown and pulls it over her head.

She might even be sexier in just a diaper than naked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsha leans forward and kisses you softly on the lips. You welcome the kiss and return it.

You nuzzle it for a few seconds, and then you start planting a string of kisses along the soft material. You then do some exploring with your tongue, and you search for her womanhood. When you elicit a soft moan out of her, you know you've found it. You trace that spot with your tongue, and her moaning gradually gets louder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe has you stop well before you can bring her to climax. She pushes you back and sits on your lap. Now her diapered crotch is on top of yours. You can feel your member getting hard within your own diaper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsha places another kiss on your lips, and then she sits up so that her breasts are level with your eyes. She mutters deviously \"Do you like what you see?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"V-very much,\" you stammer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsha chuckles and tells you \"Then treat them well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe presses her large bust against your face. She is practically smothering you with her chest. You lick and suckle at her nipples. Nothing comes out, but that is not really the point. You just want to savor those breasts. Your cock continues to harden within your diaper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, you are so hard that Asha is elevated on the chair by another inch. She smirks and says \"You seem plenty excited already. But keep it together; we're just getting started.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsha then places her hands on your shoulders, and she begins grinding her padding against yours. The sensation of your diaper and her diaper rubbing against each other is unbelievable. It is almost too invigorating for words. Asha grinds against you at a slow but steady and even pace. Overtime, she gradually gets more and more vigorous. Now both of you are moaning in arousal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou do not know how long this goes on for, but it feels like hours. Every moment is pure bliss, and you wish it could never end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlas, it must end at some point. Eventually, it does. You and Asha hit climax at the same time, and you orgasm into your diaper. You can actually feel your seed spreading throughout your padding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth you and Asha are left panting heavily. It takes you a couple minutes to recover. Once Asha regains her breath, she stands up, waddles over to the nightstand, and picks up the key to your shackles. She proceeds to release you from your restraints.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was... incredible,\" you mutter breathlessly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, it was,\" she agrees, helping you to your feet. \"Now, the night is still young.

She gradually sits up and stretches, giving you a nice view of her gorgeous figure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning, darling,\" she tells you sweetly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning, captain,\" you say in response. Although you are more intimate with her than anyone in her crew, you still cannot help but be formal when addressing her. She does not seem to mind; it reasserts her authority in her heavily male-dominated society.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsha reaches down and brushes her hand against the front of your diapers. She announces \"Looks like I've a wet nappy to change.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIndeed; your padding is soaked with both urine and... cum. Given all the time you've spent with Asha in bed, you tend to stain your diapers more with the latter than the former.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsha proceeds to change you. After removing your wet diaper and cleaning your private area, she pins you into a fresh new diaper. You've become accustomed to wearing them outside her cabin. Luckily, no one else has found out about them so far. You plan to keep it that way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou follow Asha's lead and check her nappy, too. She is mostly dry, except for a spot above womanhood. That was simply the remnant of her own climax from last night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou help Asha out of her diapers, but you do not put her into a new one. She only wears them in her chambers. Outside, she wears regular smallclothes. You cannot really complain; she is an Ironborn captain and a highborn lady. She has the right to wear whatever she pleases.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Asha then get dressed. As you slip your tunic and breeches over your diaper, you look to Asha and ask \"Where are we off to now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pyke,\" she tells you. You know she means the castle. Still, it must be confusing; having a fortress and an island that go by the same name. \"If you want, I could introduce you to my father. Or you could just get some rest while I see to business here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou think on that. It would be an honor to meet the head of a Great House, but you are not certain how Lord Balon Greyjoy would react to a lowborn boy associating with his independent daughter.

Some of the things you've heard of him are not pleasant at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, the Mad King has never troubled you personally, so you do not let his true nature concern you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you follow the eastern road atop Aerion, you think about where you should go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf you follow this road all the way to the end, you will enter the Vale and ultimately end up at the Bloody Gate. Once behind the Bloody Gate, your safety is all but guaranteed, and you could find work and shelter at the Eyrie, the ancestral home of House Arryn. However, first you need to venture through miles of dangerous terrain. The area between the crossroads and the Bloody Gate is crawling with many clans of wild men and unsavory beasts such as shadowcats. Furthermore, you have no way of knowing if the Knight of the Bloody Gate will allow you entrance. You would definitely be taking a gamble if you choose that path. On the other hand, Lord Jon Arryn, the current Lord Paramount of the Vale and Warden of the East, is known to be an accommodating and hospitable person. That gives you some degree of hope.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother option is to only follow the eastern road until you reach the border between the Riverlands and the Vale. Once there, you can turn southeast, towards the Crownlands. From there, you have options aplenty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour two most promising prospects would be Dragonstone or King's Landing. The island stronghold where privacy is guaranteed, and the capital city, where work is in abundance. On a side note, Queen Rhaella Targaryen is located at the former, and her daughter-by-law, Princess Elia Martell, is located at the latter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith all that in mind, what will be your destination?</span></div></div>",

That does not really surprise you, given parts of Westeros' recent history.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the last year, the Seven Kingdoms have been at war. From what you've heard, it began when Prince Rhaegar Targaryen abducted Lady Lyanna Stark of Winterfell. Her elder brother, Brandon Stark, then made a rash and daring attempt to rescue her by riding to King's Landing and demanding Rhaegar's head. That act of recklessness ultimately resulted in the deaths of Brandon, his father Lord Rickard Stark, and all his companions and their fathers. All those deaths were ordered by the Mad King.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat in turn led to Eddard Stark and his allies rising up against the Targaryens. Lord Robert Baratheon of the Stormlands is the leader of that faction. For that reason, the war is now known as Robert's Rebellion. The rebels consist of the North, the Riverlands, the Vale, and almost the whole of the Stormlands. The loyalists consist of the Crownlands and the Reach. Until recently, Dorne, the Iron Islands, and the Westerlands have been neutral. Not too long ago, however, the Iron Islands and the Westerlands decided to declare for Robert, too. That was only after Robert killed Prince Rhaegar at the Battle of the Trident. Since the rebels' victory was all but guaranteed by then, the Ironborn and the Westerlords chose to align with him. Cautious, but cowardly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, you do not feel you have any place to judge them. They are nobles; you are a commoner. Furthermore, you personally have gone out of your way to avoid getting involved in the fighting or the political disputes so far. Because of that, you have gotten through the whole Rebellion without a scratch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you reach the gates, you are relieved to discover that despite the heightened security, they are still allowing the smallfolk entrance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce you are inside King's Landing, you wonder where you should go.</span></div></div>",

There is no guarantee you would be able to get inside, but you could at least try.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou proceed to ride up to the Red Keep. On your way there, you notice that the streets are surprisingly bare. You encounter maybe a score of people. You wonder why that is. It cannot be due to a curfew; it is barely afternoon. It could not be because the city was evacuated; otherwise, the guards would not still be posted on the walls. It could not be because King Aerys ordered the streets cleared; if that was the case, EVERYONE would be inside. No one would dare to disobey an order of the Mad King's, after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou decide not to trouble yourself with the lack of activity in the city. You simply continue onward towards the Red Keep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you get to the top of Aegon's High Hill, you hear what sounds like shouting. It sounds faint and far-off, almost as though it is coming from outside the city. You peer over your shoulder towards the source of the commotion, and you see thousands of men in the distance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn Aerion around and squint your eyes to get a better look. Soon, you realize those men are part of an army, and not just any army. Even from this distance, you recognize the crimson banners of House Lannister. They are marching this way!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first, you think they will lay siege to King's Landing. Then it occurs to you; Aerys might not know that the Lannisters have sided with the rebels. He may think they are coming to reinforce him. If so, a siege won't be necessary. They'll be able to enter the city without difficulty. Once that happens... it would be open season on the city's inhabitants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel as though you could not have picked a worse time to enter King's Landing. Although you have been neutral in the fighting so far, you know the Lannister soldiers would not care about that. You are not about to take up arms against them, and by the time you reached one of the gates, they would likely be pouring in from all sides. Your only option is to take shelter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut where will you go?</span></div></div>",

Aerion is a different matter, however. You are not going to abandon your horse; the risk that he would be captured or killed by the Lannister soldiers is far too great. With that in mind, the only places you could go are the whorehouses, and as infamous as the King's Landing brothels may be, you cannot see them allowing an actual animal inside. Actually, there might be some who would, but the likelihood is almost negligible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou decide your only choice is the Red Keep. You are already upon the grand building, anyway. You pass through the gate. To your good fortune, the guards do not even try to stop you for frisking or questioning. You suppose they must have greater concerns than the whereabouts of a commoner and his horse. If so... entering the Red Keep should be no problem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure enough, you and Aerion get inside without much hassle. You are safe for the moment, but that could change. If you want to ensure the continuation of your survival, you will have to act fast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou get two ideas of what you can do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst, you could head to the throne room and try to slay King Aerys Targaryen yourself. He may not have that many guards with him, and if he is as mad as people claim, he would be mentally incapable of opposing you. If you ended the Mad King's life, the Lannisters might hail you as a hero.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSecond, you could head to the Maidenvault. Princess Elia Martell and her son and daughter would be there. Although Crown Prince Rhaegar is dead, his widow and children are still alive. Knowing Tywin Lannister, he would order their deaths, too. If you get to them first, maybe you can get them out of the Red Keep and out of King's Landing. That would at least get you in Dorne's good graces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo... where will you go?</span></div></div>",

You are aware that Jaime Lannister himself is guarding the King, and while you are quite skilled with a blade, your swordsmanship is hilariously inferior to Ser Jaime's. Plus, while you are not looking solely for personal gain, the Martells are more likely to show appreciation for your actions than the Lannisters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMost of all, even if you actually did manage to kill Aerys and headed to the Maidenvault immediately afterwards, the risk that you would be too late to save Princess Elia and her children is too high. Although you have been alone for so long and no one ever went out of the way for your sake, you cannot bring yourself to allow any harm to come to an innocent woman and her babes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThus, you begin searching for the Maidenvault. It takes you a little while, as you have never been inside the Red Keep before, and you are unfamiliar with its layout. You cannot just ask the servants for directions; they would be under no obligation to answer you. If anything, they may try to obstruct or stop you. So, all you can do is rely on instinct and your own judgment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter riding for about ten minutes, you manage to locate the Maidenvault. Unfortunately, the only way up there is by a spiral staircase. As such, you are forced to leave Aerion behind. As you climb off your horse, you rub his muzzle and whisper \"I'll be back soon.\" He snorts as though he understands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou rush up the spiral staircase, and you sprint to the chambers designated for the Crown Prince and her family. Once you are there, you lightly knock on the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt is answered about ten seconds later by a beautiful woman of twenty-six years. She is a couple inches taller than you, her long, black hair is straight and goes past her shoulders, her skin is slightly tan (as expected of her Dornish heritage), and her face is smooth and flawless. Despite her being taller than you, she has a somewhat petite frame. She is clad in a flowing gown of light colors, which reveals an ample amount of cleavage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who are you?\" Princess Elia Martell asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou promptly bow your head and declare \"My name is Brynden, Your Grace. I beg your forgiveness for this hasty request, but I must ask that you come with me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnsurprisingly, she is unwilling to comply. She asks suspiciously \"Why should I? Did the king send you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no one sent me,\" you inform her, lifting your head up, \"I serve no one but myself. That is why I came here; because I chose to. Your life is in danger. As are the lives of your son and daughter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTHAT has caught her attention. She seems uneasy now, and she asks a little nervously \"What do you mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tywin Lannister's forces are almost upon us,\" you tell her, \"Aerys believes they are here to assist him. But in actuality, they are here to seize the city and kill the remaining Targaryens. There is no way I can prove the truth of that claim; all I can ask is that you take flight before the lions come for you and your children.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily, Princess Elia does not take too long to make up her mind. \"It would not surprise me if Lord Tywin ordered my death and my children's deaths. It would not be the first time he has wiped out an entire family. And even if that is not his intention, I have been a prisoner of the Red Keep for months on end. I would rather take a chance with a total stranger like you than put up with my insane father-by-law and the ruthless Lord of Casterly Rock.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou understand her reasoning, and you smile. You tell her \"Then get your children and come with me. And please, hurry. Every second we delay is a second the Lannister forces get closer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPrincess Elia nods and heads back into the room. A minute later, she reappears. She is wearing a cloak, and in her arms, she is holding her son Prince Aegon and her daughter Princess Rhaenys. She also has a large bag slung over her shoulder. You assume those are supplies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hastily lead Princess Elia and her children back downstairs. You help her onto Aerion, and then you climb on behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, where are we off to?\" Elia queries.</span></div></div>",

If it was just me, I could probably find some way to blend in with them and get through their ranks. But with you and your children, that is no longer any option. Our only other means of escape is by the harbor. We're going there now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I understand,\" Princess Elia says to acknowledge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore long, you return to the front of the Red Keep. You have Princess Elia draw up the hood of her cloak so that no one will recognize her. After that, you rush towards the gate. This time, the guards try to stop you, but you gallop straight past them without a second thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou discover you left the Red Keep just in time. The Lannister forces have already entered King's Landing, and they have begun pillaging the castle town. Luckily, they are nowhere near the Red Keep or the harbor at this time. Even so, you need to hurry. Princess Elia gives you directions to the harbor, and you follow them accordingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout ten minutes later, you arrive in the harbor. It is almost as abandoned as the castle town. Because of that, most of the ships are currently unattended or unmanned. However, to your relief, a vessel with a Dornish captain is present, and the whole crew is already accounted for. When Princess Elia reveals herself to the captain, he immediately agrees to give her and her children asylum and passage out of King's Landing. At first, he is reluctant to do the same for you and Aerion, but the princess insists, and he gives in and lets both of you aboard, too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce you, your horse, the princess, her children, the captain, and his crew are all onboard, the vessel swiftly pulls out of the harbor. Nobody tries to stop you, again to your relief. As you sail out into Blackwater Bay, you can still hear screams coming from the city. You frown in sadness. You are glad you were able to save Princess Elia and her children, but you feel for all the innocent people who were left behind. Still, there is nothing to be done. You could not have possibly saved all of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyway, you have more immediate concerns.

She does not say anything more than that. You do not feel the need to press her for further clarification, as it is probably none of your business.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt any rate, Princess Elia orders the captain to sail for their homeland, and he acknowledges and executes the order. Thus begins the long voyage south.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou note that this vessel is not especially large. Living space is a little tight. Each member of the crew has to room with at least two others. In fact, the captain is the only one who has his own quarters. However, he relinquishes those quarters for Princess Elia and her children, and he instead sleeps in the officers' cabin with the other officers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDue to his size, Aerion has to stay down in the cargo hold. You are content to sleep down there with him, but the princess insists that you deserve better than that, and she offers to share the captain's cabin. It only takes you a few seconds to accept her offer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you get to the captain's cabin, you discover there is only one bed. A quite large bed, but still only one. It goes without saying that the princess and her children will sleep there. When it's time to turn in for the night, you'll just find yourself a corner of the room and settle down there. You are used to that routine, after all. Of course, the princess may have other ideas... Even so, you are not going to give your hopes up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the time-being, your greatest concern is finding a way to pass the time. For now, you sit on a chair against the wall and read a book. It is a fairly interesting book about the legendary Nymeria Martell. SHE certainly seems like someone who would have made a fine motherly figure. If only you could have been around then!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh, well. You suppose you'll find a way to make do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile you read, Princess Elia tends to her children. Based on the smell, eighteen-month-old Aegon has soiled himself. Fortunately, the odor does not linger for very long; Princess Elia swiftly undresses her son, changes him into fresh nappies, and puts the soiled ones into a bag. After that, she turns her attention to three-year-old Rhaenys. She lifts up her daughter's dress and asks \"How are you, sweetheart?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment, you happen to look up from your book. You discover that Rhaenys is diapered, too. That is surprising; normally, a girl her age would already be trained to use the chamber pot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm dry, Mummy,\" the little girl claims proudly. Her mother checks her padding, anyway. After pressing her hand against the front of Rhaenys's diaper, Elia grins and announces \"Yes, you are. Good girl.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRhaenys giggles at her mother's praise. Meanwhile, you turn your attention back to your book. Before you can keep reading, though, Princess Elia says \"Alright, you two; feeding time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn response, you gaze up again, and Princess Elia is in the process of removing her top. Your eyes widen in shock. Has she forgotten you are here? Or maybe she doesn't care if you see this much of her? You knew Dornish women were less reserved about showing their bodies than most other women, but still...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyway, Princess Elia takes Rhaenys and Aegon in her arms, and she brings each of them up to one of her breasts. They both latch on and suckle hungrily. So, she really breastfeeds them at this age, too? That is... intriguing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou try to go back to reading your book, but it is difficult to focus. The sounds of the Targaryen children nursing off their mother and the slight gasps she makes are very distracting. The latter is also a little enticing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFifteen minutes later, Princess Elia finishes feeding her son and daughter. She burps both of them, and then she lays them on the bed and begins to tickle them playfully. They giggle in enjoyment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou have hardly moved at all since this began. Before, you did not know what to think. Now... you simply find yourself incredibly envious of Aegon and Rhaenys. You let out a sigh of frustration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomehow, Princess Elia must have heard your sigh. She stops tickling her children, looks up at you, and asks in concern \"Is everything alright, Brynden?\"</span></div></div>",

I am still greatly lacking.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" the Dornish princess asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hardly have any memories of my real family,\" you reveal, \"As such, I have often yearned for one. Specifically, I have longed to have someone whom I could call mother. Someone who could nurture, care for, love, and treat me as though I was her own son. So far, I have had no luck in that pursuit, but I am as determined as ever. Still... seeing the way you interact with your own children... it made me somewhat jealous of them. They have everything I have ever wanted. That is the reason for my sigh. If that disgusts or appalls you, I am truly sorry. I'll leave this room right away.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stand to gather up your belongings, but before you can move an inch away towards your pack, Princess Elia beckons you \"Brynden, come here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tentatively approach the bed, and you sit down on the spot Elia pats. Unable to look her in the eye, you mutter nervously \"Yes, Your Grace?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElia Martell pats your shoulder and tells you in a gentle tone \"I am sorry you had such a difficult childhood. No one should have to face the world alone. It is perfectly natural of you to desire a mother's love. That type of treatment is what gets children through troubled times and challenges. It even helps to prepare them for adulthood. The fact that you have gone this lone without such a person in your life is admirable, but tragic at the same time. Therefore...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pauses here, and you manage to look back up at her. You ask in interest \"Therefore?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few seconds later, she continues with \"What if... I was to treat you the same way as Aegon and Rhaenys?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are surprised and delighted at the same time. Hoping you did not mishear the princess, you stutter \"A-are you serious?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElia firmly nods her head and declares \"I owe you my life. And my children's lives. This the very least I could do to repay you. I can also tell you are a good person. You are not the sort of individual who would take advantage of another's kindness. You deserve to be loved. So, if I can help you live out your fantasy of having a proper mother... let me do it. Please.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat do you do?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You do not need any time to reflect upon Princess Elia's proposal. Almost immediately, you smile, look her in the eye, and tell her \"I would be delighted, Your Grace.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPrincess Elia smiles back, clearly pleased with your decision. Then she raises a finger, waves it disapprovingly, and says sternly yet warmly \"From now on, you are to call me 'Mummy.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As you wish... Mummy,\" you remark, blushing a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very good,\" Elia mutters in approval. She then stands up, pulls you to your feet, and declares \"Now, the first thing to do is to get you dressed appropriately. Let's get you out of those clothes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou do nothing to protest or resist. You ARE somewhat curious as to what sort of apparel Princess Elia has in mind for you. You see no reason to worry, though. As a mother of two Elia, Martell must know what she is doing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Dornish princess reaches up to the clasp of your cloak, unfastens it, and removes it. After folding it up and setting it aside, she helps you out of your leather armor. Your boots, gauntlets, greaves, and breastplate are quickly removed, as is the doublet you wear underneath. Now you are down to your tunic and breeches. She pulls those off of you, too, leaving you in just your smallclothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPrincess Elia has you remove your smallclothes, as well. Now you are totally naked in front of you. Your hands reflexively rush to cover your groin, but she assures you \"No need to be embarrassed. Just lie down and wait for Mummy to dress you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou obey her and settle down on the bed. You watch Princess Elia as she picks up the large bag she brought along with her. She pulls out a pair of thick white cloth diapers, and she begins folding them together. You murmur in astonishment \"Are those... for me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course,\" Elia confirms, \"I am raising you as though you were my own babe. All babes wear nappies, and since you are supposed to be a babe, you should be in nappies, too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A-alright then,\" you mutter. You are a little uncertain about being diapered, but you do not want to upset your new mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry,\" Princess Elia tells you soothingly, \"You'll enjoy them, I promise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then lifts your lower body a little and slides the pair of diapers under your bottom. After setting you back down, she gets out some powder and cream, which she applies to your private parts and rubs in thoroughly. Her rubbing excites you greatly, and it causes your manhood to become erect. She just giggles when you get hard, and she coos teasingly \"See, Brynden? I told you you'd enjoy them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are unable to counter her, mostly due to how excited you are and how right she actually is. Princess Elia does not allow you to orgasm just yet, though. Instead, she pulls the front of the diapers up over your member, forces it down into the padding, and pins the diapers shut on both sides.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPatting the front of your diaper, Elia announces \"There we go. Nice and secure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAegon and Rhaenys have been playing on the floor all this time. Elia picks them up and places them on the bed between you and her. She tells them \"Rhae, Egg, meet your new brother, Brynden.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAegon does nothing more than babble incoherently. Whereas Rhaenys smiles and waves a bit, saying \"Hi...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi,\" you return, waving at the cute girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Aegon is still too young to notice unusual things, Rhaenys is already somewhat observant. She points at your diapers and asks \"Are you a babe?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blush furiously at that. Elia chuckles and tells her daughter \"No, sweetheart. He is not a babe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But he is in nappies, Mummy,\" Rhaenys points out, \"Only babes wear nappies.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome might say she raises a good point. Still, shouldn't she have noticed you are much too big to be an actual baby? Then again, she is still only three. She does not have the most pristine powers of deductive reasoning just yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this time, Elia is wearing her flowing gown of pastel colors. Rhaenys is wearing her little girl's dress and diapers. Aegon is wearing his swaddling clothes and diapers. You... are wearing only your diapers and nothing else. But if it is just your new \"mother\" and \"siblings\" who see you like this, you feel it is alright.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens now?</span></div></div>",

You must look quite babyish right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you reach your new mother, she wraps you in a warm hug. You are given a moment to savor her delicate embrace. Then, all of a sudden, she smirks wickedly, brings her hands down to your chest, and begins tickling you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough you are pretty good at withstanding pain and enduring hardship, you have always been quite ticklish. Immediately after the princess starts tickling, you burst out laughing. She chuckles in amusement at your reaction. \"So, Baby Brynden is a ticklish one? Well then...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElia Martell then moves her hands to your sides. Unfortunately for you, your sides are especially sensitive spots. You laugh even harder when she tickles you there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou attempt to struggle free, but Elia has a firm hold on you. She coos softly \"Don't try to resist, sweetie. Let Mummy show you how much she cares.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel this is a strange way to display one's adoration. Even so, you are unable to argue or fight back. You are at this beautiful Dornishwoman's mercy. All you can do is continue laughing and squirm around in your diapers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt one point, Rhaenys crawls over to your legs, and she begins tickling your feet. That only makes you laugh harder than before. Rhaenys giggles and says \"This is fun, Mummy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElia smiles at her daughter and continues her assault on your sides. Eventually, she stops, but only to start tickling you someplace else. This time, she tickles your chin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough, you are laughing so hard you almost cannot breathe. Fortunately, Elia pauses every now and then so you can catch your breath. But no longer than that. Once you have had an opportunity to breathe, she resumes tickling you relentlessly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is a good thing I put you in nappies,\" Elia whispers into your ear, continuing to tickle you all over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are compelled to agree. If she keeps this up just a little longer, you are going to end up soaking the padding around your waist. If that happens, you hope she will not wait too long to change her. You have no desire to sit in a wet diaper for an extended period of time. Then again, you probably have no say over when you are changed. Plus, Princess Elia diapered you less than twenty minutes ago. She may not change you so soon after.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens?</span></div></div>",

Furthermore, Rhaenys also stops tickling your feet when she sees her mother stop. The pressure on your lower body lessens significantly after this, and you keep from soaking your padding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou spend the next few minutes lying perfectly still, struggling to regain your breath and your composure. Elia Martell tenderly wraps her arms around your torso and holds you close to her chest. You rest your head against her large breasts, which work well as cushions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt one point, Princess Elia reaches down and rubs the front of your diaper gently. You let out a small gasp and stiffen a little, but at this moment, you are too tired to get very excited. Anyway, the princess only rubs you for about ten seconds to check your padding. Once she confirms there is no wetness, she withdraws her hand, wraps it around you again, and kisses your temple, saying \"Excellent. You're still dry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, was it simply coincidence that she stopped tickling you just before your bladder gave out? If so, you are lucky she happened to stop when she did. You are not quite ready to use your diapers for their intended purpose just yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter lying in silence for a few minutes, Elia Martell asks you \"Are you hungry, Brynden?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A little,\" you admit. Truthfully, you have not eaten since this morning, before you entered King's Landing. Looking back on that, you are amazed that earlier that same day, you had been by yourself with only Aerion forc ompany. Was that really just half a day ago?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile you are lost in thought, Princess Elia casually slips out of her bodice, exposing her two luscious breasts. She then turns you in her lap so that your head is facing them, and she tells you sweetly \"Help yourself, darling.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou instinctively latch on and begin to suckle. A small stream of milk quickly starts flowing out into your mouth. It is warm, rich, and delicious. You drink it all down eagerly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile you nurse, Elia strokes your head, your chest, and your diapered crotch. Every now and then, she whispers something into your ear, telling you how good of a baby you are and such.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, you manage to drain both her breasts. She then places your chin over your shoulder and lightly pats your back, causing you to expel a loud belch. She then wipes your chin and kisses your forehead. Smiling, she tells you and her children \"Alright, you three. Time for bed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPrincess Elia then sets you down on the bed, gets up, and proceeds to undress fully. She exchanges her elaborate, colorful flowing gown for a simple, thin nightgown, which still shows off a good amount of cleavage. She then strips Rhaenys and Aegon down to their diapers, and she checks them again. This time, Aegon is dry, but Rhaenys is wet. Elia takes a couple minutes to change her daughter into a fresh diaper. Then you and she climb under the covers of the bed. She lies down to your left, with Rhaenys on your right and Aegon on her left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt does not take long for all four of you to drift off to sleep. For once, you go to bed totally at ease, feeling as though you finally belong somewhere. For once, you have an actual family.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the way, where in Dorne is your ship's intended destination?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The next morning, you discover that you wet your nappies in your sleep. You know this for two reasons: your crotch feels damp, and you wake up to Princess Elia changing you. As she pins you into a fresh pair of diapers, she bides you good morning. She then proceeds to breastfeed you again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you nurse from the Dornishwoman's lovely bosom, she tells you that the ship is bound for Starfall. You are a little confused to learn that; House Martell's ancestral home is Sunspear. Furthermore, Sunspear is located on the east coast of Dorne, meaning the ship is currently closer to it than any other settlement in Dorne. Whereas Starfall is all the way on the west coast of Dorne. It would take more than twice as long to get there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPrincess Elia must sense your confusion, for she explains the situation a moment later. As she continues nursing you and lovingly caressing your face and body, she reveals that what the world has been told about her husband is a lie. In other words, Princess Rhaegar Targaryen did not kidnap Lady Lyanna Stark; she left with him willingly, as they apparently loved one another. In fact, Elia herself gave Rhaegar her blessing to take Lyanna as his second wife.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAround the time the Rebellion began, Lyanna discovered she was pregnant. For her safety, Rhaegar moved her to the Tower of Joy in Dorne, and he left her with three of his Kingsguard for her protection. Princess Elia's main concern now is to get to Princess Lyanna before she gives birth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sea voyage to Starfall takes about a month to accomplish. You spend most of that time in the captain's cabin with Princess Elia and her children, your new \"brother\" and \"sister.\" You are in diapers for almost every moment, except for when Princess Elia bathes you. Whenever you leave the captain's cabin - which is not very often - you are allowed to put clothes on over your diapers. But whenever you are inside, the only apparel you are permitted is your padding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough you had mixed feelings about being diapered at first, you quickly come to enjoy the security, warmth, and comfort associated with them. The best part is that once a day, when Aegon and Rhaenys are sleeping, you have some \"quality time\" with Princess Elia. That usually involves her teasing you, spanking you, tickling you, or rubbing you off until you climax. Before long, you find yourself soaking your diapers with cum more often than with urine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a long but pleasurable month at sea, you arrive at Starfall. After having your diapers changed and getting dressed, you disembark the vessel with your new mother and siblings. Soon after you step onto the docks, the four of you are greeted by another woman. She is around Princess Elia's age, and she is notably tall for a Dornishwoman. Her skin is tan, though slightly less tan than the princess's. She has long black hair, red lips, and violet eyes. Those eyes are what really stand out to you. There is something sensuous about them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPrincess Elia embraces the woman tenderly. Then she introduces you and her to each other: \"Ash, this is Brynden, the boy who saved me, Rhae, and Egg from the Lannisters. He is also my new 'son.' More on that later. Brynden, I would like you to meet my best friend, Lady Ashara Dayne.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had heard of Ashara Dayne. She was the sister of Ser Arthur Dayne, the Sword of the Morning and the deadliest of King Aerys' Kingsguard. She was also one of the most renowned beauties in the Seven Kingdoms. Still, the reports of her beauty hardly do her justice. Secretly, you think she is even more beautiful than Princess Elia. You do not say that aloud, though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElia Martell then tells Ashara Dayne of her plans to recover Lyanna Stark. Apparently, Lady Ashara is already fully aware of the truth surrounding that issue. She gives Princess Elia some guards and horses to get her to the Tower of Joy. She also lends her Starfall's maester, in case Princess Lyanna experiences complications while giving birth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRhaenys and Aegon will be staying in Starfall until their mother returns. You, however, have the option to join Princess Elia on her journey. Your new mother tells you that if you would rather not go with her, you could stay at Starfall instead. Since she is already looking after Rhaenys and Aegon, Lady Ashara would look after you while the princess is away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat do you choose?</span></div></div>",

All of the noble houses are unquestionably loyal to their liege lord, the smallfolk are kept fed and relatively happy, the terrain allows for impenetrable defenses, there is no shortage of paying work, and they have no notable conflicts or rivalries with the other eight regions of Westeros. In fact, the Vale was the only region that had remained completely neutral during the recent War of the Five Kings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only real downside is that most of the women from the Vale are not especially noteworthy in appearance. But you can accept that. After all, beauty means nothing if a loving and caring personality do not complement it. Besides... there are bound to be some attractive women there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt any rate, you have Aerion follow the road to the east. Within a few hours, you arrive at the border of the Riverlands and the Vale. Based on maps and what you've heard from fellow travelers, it is about a day's ride to the Bloody Gate if you move at a leisurely trot. Some have gotten there in as little as half a day if they gallop straight there without stopping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou decide to go with the latter approach. You are already accepting a huge enough risk by entering the Vale through the west by yourself. You are unwilling to risk your life or Aerion's any further by being too slow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully, you have not done much riding in the past few days, and Aerion had plenty to eat and drink before you left the inn. With that in mind, you should be able to reach the Bloody Gate without tiring him. You just hope you are not overestimating his tenacity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter taking a couple minutes to prepare yourself, you strike the reins and urge Aerion to proceed. He breaks into a gallop, and the two of you enter the Vale. All you can do at this point is pray that the gods will watch over both of you for the next twelve hours.</span></div></div>",

The seventh, eighth, ninth, tenth, and eleventh. Eleven whole hours elapse without any dangers presenting themselves to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are honestly quite amazed that nothing has interrupted your ride so far. It is almost as though the western mountains of the Vale are totally devoid of all life. It could be possible that they actually are. On the other hand, you have been focused on the road for the majority of your ride. You have only stolen occasional glances at your surroundings. Thus, it could be possible that the mountain clansmen and beasts of the Vale were somewhere above you, and you just did not notice them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the same, you choose not to question your good fortune. The first eleven hours of your journey may have passed without any type of calamity, but you know full well that all it takes is one second for your circumstances to change for the worse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first half of the final hour of your trek proceeds much like the rest. After that, the Bloody Gate is finally within your field of vision. Even from this distance, you can tell that it is heavily guarded. The sentries do not appear to have noticed you yet, but soon enough, you are certain they will. After all, the Bloody Gate has withstood every invasion that ever fell against it. It could not have lasted so long if the men guarding it were negligent in their duties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you are just ten minutes away from the Bloody Gate, you finally encounter an obstruction.

You manage to remain mounted on him, but only by clinging tightly to his halter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Aerion lowers his front legs, he is still very restless. You can see why. The mound of black fur turned out to be a shadowcat. A very hungry-looking and feral shadowcat, at that. You quickly think about what to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are armed with a sword and a dagger; both made of relatively good steel. You also have a bow and quiver of arrows strapped to your back. You are fairly decent with all of those weapons. However, you do not have much experience fighting with them while mounted. With Aerion in his current frightened state, you doubt you would have much success at fending off the shadowcat on horseback. And you are not about to dismount. You know better than to engage a predator like the shadowcat alone on foot. Aside from that, you are not about to take a chance that Aerion might bolt away without you, or - worse yet - that the shadowcat will attack him instead of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the end, your only feasible option is to bolt for the Bloody Gate. You strike the reins again and direct Aerion towards the structure. You leave the shadowcat in the dust, but the beast does not give up so easily. It chases after you, intent on catching its prey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith each passing minute, you get closer to the Bloody Gate. Every few seconds, you glance over your shoulder. The shadowcat is gaining on you. Your heart is racing and your breathing slows greatly, but you do not give in to fear.

You hear a couple of them shouting. While you cannot make out what they are saying, a couple are pointing down the road in your direction. They must perceive the shadowcat as a threat. Hopefully, they are not so quick to make the same ruling about you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere are a few archers on either side of the Gate. They have already notched arrows to their bows and pulled back the strings. They appear to be aiming for the shadowcat. Unfortunately, based on positioning, you are obstructing their view of the beast. If only you were another foot to the left or right; then at least a couple of the archers would see it clearly. But you cannot get Aerion to get any direction other than forward, so that is out of the question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you are practically within spitting distance of the Bloody Gate, you look back one last time. The shadowcat lunges upward and directly at you. Its claws and fangs do not touch you, but the impact of its body weight against you is enough to throw you from your saddle. You land on the ground hard, your head slamming against a boulder. That is enough to severely disorient you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shadowcat then turns its attention to you, and it approaches you slowly. Although you are unable to move or speak, your vision has not yet been impaired. You can quite clearly see the shadowcat advancing towards you. It means to make a meal out of you, and you are powerless to stop it. What a dismal turn of events THIS has been.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, to your vast relief, just before the shadowcat can pounce, it is hit in the head and body by half a dozen arrows. It stumbles for a moment, and then it collapses onto its side, dead. The men on the Bloody Gate have saved your life. If only you were in a position to thank them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy now, your vision has begun to blur. You struggle to remain conscious, but the damage from that blow has been done.

You are still a little dizzy from hitting your head, but otherwise, you've regained your senses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first thing you notice is the change in your surroundings. You are no longer on the road outside the Bloody Gate. In fact, you are not outside at all. You are indoors, and you are lying on a large, soft bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou quickly realize you are not alone, either. A pair of arms is wrapped around you. You slowly gaze upward, and you are staring into the eyes of a young woman. She appears to be in her early thirties, and she has auburn hair and red lips. There are a few wrinkles on her cheeks and forehead, but other than that, she has a very wonderful face. When she notices your eyes are open, she smiles and says \"At last, you're awake.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough your present circumstances are much preferable to what they were when you passed out, you cannot bring yourself to relax just yet. You have many questions, and you are not even certain what order you should be asking them in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou decide to start with the most obvious one: \"My lady... might I ask your name?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe nods and says \"I am Lysa Arryn, formerly of House Tully, Lady of the Eyrie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are familiar with that name. Lysa Tully was the younger daughter of the late Lord Hoster Tully, the Lord of Riverrun and Lord Paramount of the Riverlands and Trident. He had married his younger daughter to the late Lord Jon Arryn, the elderly Lord Paramount of the Vale. You had heard that Lord Jon was over forty years older than his wife, and their marriage had not been a happy one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOut of courtesy, you proceed to introduce yourself: \"My name is Brynden.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLady Lysa smiles at that. \"My beloved uncle has the same name.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIndeed, Ser Brynden Tully - known as the Blackfish by some - was Lord Hoster's renowned younger brother. You heard somewhere that he had been Knight of the Bloody Gate for several years before he joined his other niece - Lady Catelyn Stark - in the War of the Five Kings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat brings you to your next question: \"Am I in the Eyrie?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are,\" she confirms, \"You are miles above the surface of the world. As long as you are here, you will be safe from the troubles outside.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are relieved to hear that, but then you remember something important. You mutter worriedly \"What about my horse, Aerion? What happened to him?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He is well,\" Lady Lysa assures you, \"Of course, we could not bring him up here, but he is being tended to at the stables located at the base of the mountain.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank the gods,\" you say. You were concerned that Aerion may have run away or gotten left outside the Bloody Gate. He is precious to you; he is your only true friend in the world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have you any more questions?\" Lady Lysa Arryn asks<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just one,\" you respond, \"Why am I here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that, she looks you in the eye and answers you with</span></div></div>",

My son, Robin, was the only one among them who lived past birth. I always yearned for more children. By happy coincidence, Robin now yearns for a younger sibling. Alas, his father died before I could give him one. Even so, I have other ways of fulfilling my wish and his.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou quickly realize where she is going with this. \"So, you decided to use me for that role?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Correct,\" Lysa Arryn claims, \"Let me tell you why I chose you. You were able to make your way through the mountains outside of the Bloody Gate all on your own. Only someone as strong as an Arryn could have managed such an incredible feat. Also, you are quite young, and you do not have the look of a noble. Assuming you knew the risks when you entered the Vale alone, it is unlikely you had any family or friends you were leaving behind. That is what the maester concluded.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your maester is right,\" you reveal, \"I came to the Vale looking for work, and I would be content to stay here, as I am alone in the world.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not any longer,\" Lysa counters, giving you a hug, \"From now on, you will live with me and Robin as my younger son.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA thought occurs to you. \"How old is Robin?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eight,\" she replies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are surprised. \"I am almost twice that age.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know,\" Lysa tells you, \"But Robin insisted on a younger sibling.

At this moment, she begins to remove the covers and push them down the bed. It is only now that you realize that you are topless. For that matter, so is she. As it happens, all she is wearing is her smallclothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer breasts have been pressing into your back for the last few minutes. Now that you actually see them, you realize they are even larger than they felt. They are round, perky, and supple. Just a few seconds after gazing upon them, you feel your manhood twitch and get hard. However, something prevents your manhood from becoming erect. Something rather soft and thick around your loins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn to your front and look down. That is when you see that your legs are bare, but your privates are not uncovered. A thick, white layer of padding has been wrapped tightly around your crotch and bottom. It only take you a couple seconds to identify it as a clean, white cloth diaper, pinned securely in place. As of now, that is the only article of clothing you are wearing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are alarmed to discover this. You turn back to Lysa and ask nervously \"Why am I wearing a nappy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe just smiles kindly and explains \"There are two reasons. Firstly, you were unconscious for several days. This was the easiest way to keep you from soiling yourself or the bedding whenever you relieved yourself. Secondly... they are necessary to get you into your new role.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes widen in shock. \"But I do not need nappies! I know perfectly well how to use chamber pots.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As of now, the chamber pots are off-limits to you,\" Lady Lysa mutters sternly, patting the seat of your diapers, \"I expect you to use these for their intended uses. You need not fret; I will change you whenever you require it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt appears she is allowing no room for argument. As much as you would like to protest, doing so would not get you anywhere. You ask \"What else would this involve?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Breastfeeding, of course,\" Lysa reveals, \"I still feed Robin from my breast; it is only natural that I do the same for you. And before you claim to be too old for that, you should know that you've already been doing it for these last few days. It was the only way we could give you sustenance.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou have mixed reactions to that. You have often dreamed about nursing from a beautiful woman. To discover that you were going to be doing it a lot - and that you had already been doing it for a short while - excited you. The tent in your diapers grew a little bigger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLysa notices your padded erection, and she smiles and pats it, causing you to gasp softly. Keeping one hand on your nappy, she says \"You will be treated as a babe for the most part. But when it is just the two of us by ourselves, I would be happy to treat you in a more 'adult' fashion.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat alone has officially won you over. You announce \"Alright, I agree. I'll be your second son and Robin's younger brother.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLady Lysa Arryn smiles and kisses you on the forehead, saying \"Thank you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, there is a knock on the door to the bedchamber, and a young boy's voice calls out \"Mummy, may I come in?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, sweetheart,\" Lysa calls out, \"You are just in time; your brother is awake.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately, the door swings open, and a young boy - obviously Robin - enters.

You quickly realize his lower half is not naked; he actually is wearing smallclothes. However, his smallclothes seem rather bulky and cumbersome. When he reaches the bed, you discover that they are not smallclothes at all. Down there, he is wearing the same article as you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other diapered boy climbs onto the bed, and he crawls towards you and his mother. His thickly padded bottom is raised high in the air. You cannot help but stare at it in confusion. You wonder if this is customary for all Arryns, or if Lady Lysa just prefers to treat all her children like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEither way, one thing is for certain: you and Robin are in nappies, and you are expected to wear and use them until further notice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin smiles up at you when he reaches you, and he wraps his arms around your chest. He is not a very strong child. In fact, he looks rather sickly and weak. Even so, his hug is certainly warm and caring. You do not wish to upset him or your new mother, so you decide to return it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLady Lysa comes up behind you and joins in the hug, enveloping you and her true son. Despite the awkwardness of the situation, you cannot deny that this is a very reassuring and pleasant sensation. Perhaps this is what it really means to be loved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the hug, Lady Lysa turns you and Robin towards her. She announces happily \"Time for a nappy check.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe reaches down with both hands. She places the right one against the front of Robin's padding, and she places the left one against the front of yours. Robin giggles at being checked, whereas you have to struggle not to get too excited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few seconds later, Lysa Arryn smiles and says \"Good; you're both still dry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat is a relief. Although you have apparently been using your diapers in your sleep for the last few days, you are not quite certain you are ready to do the same while you are conscious. Of course, you do not really have a say in the matter. Soon enough, you will be forced to wet and mess them.

Mummy,\" you remark, hesitantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLysa then gets out of bed, still in just her smallclothes. You expect her to summon some maids and get garbed in a formal dress or something similar. Yet she does not. Instead, she simply slips on a nightgown, and over that she pulls on a thick woolen robe. Lastly, she dons some soft slippers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are bewildered by her casual, informal dress. You had heard that nobles always wore formal attire outside of their bedchambers. Then it occurred to you that Lady Lysa was not like the average highborn. After all, adopting a boy she did not know, keeping her children in diapers, and breastfeeding them past infancy... you wonder just how many eccentricities she has.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Lysa is clad in her nightly apparel, she walks over to you and Robin with her arms outstretched. She takes Robin's left hand in her right and your left hand in her left. She merrily announces \"Let's go, darlings!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three of you swiftly leave the bedchamber. Normally, you would try to resist. After all, you were still quite underdressed. All you had on was your diaper. Robin was in a shirt and a diaper, but his padding was fully exposed. However, he did not seem bothered in the least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you leave Lady Lysa's bedchamber, the guards posted outside accompany you and your new mother and son down the hallways. They do not seem perturbed by the way any of you are dressed. That strikes you as odd. Do they simply not care what a person wears up here in the Eyrie? Actually, since the Eyrie is rather secluded from the rest of the Vale and the Seven Kingdoms, privacy and discretion are all but guaranteed. In fact, if Lysa had chosen to go out in only her smallclothes with her breasts exposed, perhaps no one else would have batted an eyelid. That's not very likely, but it is a possibility...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt any rate, it appears your apprehension was groundless. So you simply remain silent and allow Lady Lysa to guide you and Robin to the maester's office.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you get there, you discover that...</span></div></div>",

All nine men who served as Lord Paramount in each of the nine major regions of Westeros are all dead now. A couple of those regions are currently without an official leader, and some have disputed rulers. Although the war has ended, Westeros is still in great disarray. Especially since Jon Snow has been declared by his family's vassals as the new King in the North, and Daenerys Targaryen and her dragons have landed on Dragonstone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat is no concern of yours, though. You have no family and no one you can really call a close friend, and you have always had to struggle to get by. As such, the war had not affected you as greatly as it had affected most other people in the Seven Kingdoms. The world had been more dangerous, yes, but you were used to danger. In fact, your rough childhood and difficult upbringing had helped you to survive where so many richer, grander, and higher born persons had perished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you enter King's Landing, the first thing you notice is the stench. The city indeed reeks strongly of piss, shit, and many other foul odors, just as rumors have suggested. You hope it will either go away, or that you will quickly get used to it. Most likely, it would be the latter situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour first priority is to find some work. There are plenty of shops all throughout Visenya's Hill and the Hill of Rhaenys. Any one of them might offer employment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr, alternatively, you can ride up to the Red Keep, located at the top of Aegon's High Hill. With all the threats to the realm, there is surely an increased demand for guards to protect the Queen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat do you do?</span></div></div>",

You might try your luck there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thank you, ser, but I've no taste for that line of work,\" you inform him, \"I've lasted this long on my own by staying off the front line.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Some might call that a craven's tactic,\" the captain mutters, \"But I would call it prudence.

About ten minutes later, you arrive in the Grand Maester's office, below the rookery. There are no guards on duty. Just two young women, who appear to be maids. They smile warmly, but say nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door is closed, and you knock on it softly. You hear a voice from within say \"Enter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou carefully push open the door and step inside. An old man in the grey robes of a maester is seated at a desk. Unlike the typical maester, he does not have a chain of many metals hanging from his neck. But that is immaterial to you.

Your answers will determine whether or not the job will be yours.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I understand,\" you tell him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQyburn then gives you a lengthy interview. It lasts for over an hour. He asks questions about your background, about your accomplishments, about your travels, and about everything else that would be worthy of some note. As well as some things which you would regard as trivial or insignificant. You are completely honest in your answers, and you give very descriptive responses. You would dare not lie or invent things in front of a member of the Queen's inner circle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the end of the interview, Qyburn smiles again and says \"A great many young men have applied to this position, my boy, but you are by far the most appealing candidate. The position is yours, if you desire it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smile back and declare \"Yes, milord. I graciously accept.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou still do not know what the position is, but if it involves being near the Queen, it must be worthwhile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very good,\" says Qyburn.

You worry she may be cross with you for not obeying her order to get into the crib straightaway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully, your worries turn out to be for naught. Instead of chastising you, raising her voice to you, or doing any other disciplinary action, she smiles sweetly, steps closer to you, and wraps you in a gentle hug. This sudden show of affection surprises you. You are not certain if that is because the queen is the one showing it, or because you simply are not accustomed to this sort of treatment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhatever the case, you gradually raise your arms and hug your new mother back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Queen Cersei finally pulls away, she is still smiling. She then pats your diapered bottom and says \"You should have told Mummy in the first place, sweetie. Now that you're all clean and in your nappies, I would be happy to get you something to eat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smile at that and say appreciatively \"Thank you, Mummy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe just grins again and takes your hand in yours.

She notices your astonishment, and she tells you soothingly \"Do not fret, my dear. In addition to being excellent maids and attendants, these two are experienced wet nurses, as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look back at Dorcas and Senelle, and they both nod their heads to confirm Queen Cersei's declaration. They say in unison \"We live to serve you and your mother, milord.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"V-very well,\" you say uncertainly. Cersei Lannister notes your apprehension, and she lovingly pats your padded bottom again to ease you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You shouldn't feel uncomfortable,\" she tells you, \"These two will only be breastfeeding you for the first few days of our new relationship. Once you have settled in, we can try putting you at my breast, instead.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blush at that, but you nod your head, trying not to get too excited at the prospect of suckling the royal teats.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Think of these two women as your secondary caretakers,\" Cersei advises you, \"As much as I would prefer to keep you by my side all day long, that will not be possible, as I have a kingdom to rule. I can afford to spend mornings and evenings with you, but afternoons are when I am occupied with my royal duties. Thus, during the middle of the day, Dorcas and Senelle will attend to your every need. They will feed you, change you, play with you, wash you, sing you lullabies, and even <i>relieve</i> you when you are tense. They will also discipline you if you misbehave, so see that you do not act up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou slightly cringe in fear, but then you nod again and remark \"Yes, Mommy. I'll be good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCersei smiles once more and hugs you again. Then she takes your hand and leads you over to the maids. You nervously cross the bedroom to the young women, waddling in your thick, bulky diapers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you get closer, you realize that both Dorcas and Senelle are not much older than you. They could be in their late teenage years; twenty or twenty-one at the most. While neither of them is as beautiful as the queen, they are both fairly pleasing to look at.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you and Cersei are within reach of the maids, she turns to you and asks \"Who would you like to nurse you tonight? Whoever you pick, the other shall nurse you tomorrow morning.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou think about who to select. Dorcas is the larger in height, which suggests that her milk would be more nutritious. Meanwhile, Senelle has the larger bust, which suggests that her tits would carry more milk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich do you pick?</span></div></div>",

You waddle beside her, holding tight to her hand. After Senelle fixes the top of her dress, she and Dorcas follow their mistress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are still a little nervous about sleeping in this bed that somewhat resembles a cage, but you decide not to protest. After all, the Queen DID say it would just be for the first night. Soon enough, she would probably allow you to share her bed. That would make a couple nights in a crib worth it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you reach the crib, Cersei lowers the bars to it. Then she and the maids help you into it. It is large enough that you can stretch out without bending anything, and the mattress is quite comfortable. It is a little cold and drafty, though. Thankfully, the Queen has accounted for that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you place your head on the soft pillows, Dorcas and Senelle hand Cersei Lannister some thick, soft blankets. The Queen proceeds to cover you with them, and she tucks you in securely. When she is finished, you are bundled up nice and warm. You are pleased by that. Winter has just begun, and you could not imagine going to bed in just a diaper unless you had sufficient heat from another source.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter tucking you in, Cersei leans over and places a tender kiss on your forehead. She tells you softly \"Sweet dreams, Baby.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smile and whisper softly \"Good night, Mummy.\" She smiles back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDorcas and Senelle then raise the bars of the crib and secure them in place. You are effectively trapped, but you do not mind. You are too warm, cozy, and tired to protest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe queen's maids then help her prepare for bed, as well. They go off to the other end of the room, and they help her out of her clothing. As tempted as you are to stare, you decide to look away, out of respect. Soon enough, you are certain you'll be able to see the queen's whole body. You do not want to risk damaging the relationship you've already developed by peeping on her without permission.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA couple minutes later, the queen has exchanged her long, flowing dress for a slightly less modest nightgown and robe. She looks just as beautiful in the latter as she did in the former. By now, you are convinced that Cersei Lannister would look gorgeous in just about anything!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQueen Cersei tells Dorcas and Senelle \"You are dismissed for the night. Should I or my baby require anything of you before morning, I will summon you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe maids bow to the queen, and they exit the bedchamber, leaving you and Cersei alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCersei decides to stay up a while longer. She pours herself a glass of wine, sits down on her couch, and begins to read a book. You, on the other hand, choose to get some rest. Given how you are diapered, swaddled, and stuck in a crib, you do not have many other options. Aside from that, you've had a long day, and you have a feeling tomorrow will be just as eventful. So, with little difficulty, you drift off into a peaceful slumber.</span></div></div>",

Fortunately the bed itself is dry when you search for wet spots with your hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly you feel a hand press against your behind. Surprised, you look over your shoulder and see the Queen, just awoken, but already looking sexy, rubbing your padded behind.<br>\r\n\u201cGood morning baby. I see you are adjusting fast.\u201d She smiles and ring a bell on her nightstand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeconds later Dorcas and Senelle come into the room and bowing in front of the queen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe baby needs new nappies, \u2026. But I think at first you should nurse him Dorcas.\u201d The queen says with a suppressed laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wonder why until you see two little wet spots on the maids dress.<br>\r\n\u201cI am very sorry my queen, normally I would not come to you with these\u2026 stains, but I changed already two times this morning\u2026\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt is fine, nurse him.\u201d Cersei says, stopping the maid's flow of words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly the maids help you out of the crib and you find yourself at another woman\u2019s breast within 10 hours. Again, the taste is great. Slightly different, but not worse. Dorcas nipples are not as sensitive as Senelle\u2019s, but she also moans slightly as you drink from her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe queen sits in front of you again, and looks pleased and\u2026 aroused?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter you are done, Queen Cersei gets up and says:<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

As Dorcas pulls the top of her dress back on, Cersei takes you in a hug and pats your back. In effect, you let out a slight belch, which makes you blush. She tells you gently \"It is alright; it's natural part of feeding from the breast.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe queen then takes your hand in hers, and you rise to your feet next to her. She leads you over to the changing table, and you lay down on the surface. Dorcas and Senelle stand behind their mistress as she attends to your wet diapers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe unfastens the pins, pulls down the front, and takes the padding out from under you. She briefly looks over it, and she chuckles and comments \"Completely soaked. Senelle must have fed you well last night.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and the named maid both blush at that. The queen passes the drenched diapers over to Dorcas, who sets them off to the side with the intent to wash them later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSenelle hands the queen a towel, which she uses to wipe your moist groin. Your morning wood is still at full shaft, and the blond woman's delicate touch doesn't help it go down any.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What a big boy you are,\" Cersei coos, causing the maids to giggle and you to blush again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDorcas gives Queen Cersei a new pair of diapers, and she carefully lifts your ankles up and places them under you. After she sets your bottom down on the fresh padding, she coats her hands with more cream, and she rubs your private area with it, just as she did last night. She pays especial attention to your manhood. It only takes about a minute for you to go off into her hand, which she indifferently holds out to Senelle to clean.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you recover from your second orgasm at the queen's hands, she finishes the diaper change. Once the cream is applied, the queen spreads a small amount of powder on your crotch, and she rubs that in, as well. Finally, she pulls the front of the thick padding up between your legs. Holding the center in place with one hand, she uses the other to bring up the sides and fasten them in place with pins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There we go,\" the queen announces happily, patting your padded crotch, \"Baby's all clean and dry in his new nappies.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou cannot help but grin. This time yesterday, you never would have thought you would be diapered by Cersei Lannister, the Queen of the Seven Kingdoms herself. Nor did you think you would find nappies so nice. Yet here you were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Queen helps you back to your feet, and she says \"Now that the Baby's changed, I should get changed as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this time, she is still in her nightgown. Obviously, she cannot see to her royal duties dressed like that. As such, she has to get into something more appropriate for holding court.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight then, a thought occurs to you... will she let you see her get ready?</span></div></div>",

How could you possibly help her get ready? While you have a bit of experience in most lines of work, you have none in fashion, let alone dressing and undressing nobles. But then you realize the implication behind that statement; the queen is going to let you see what is beneath that nightgown of hers!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou simply nod your head and say \"As you wish, Mummy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiles in approval, and she escorts you over to a door on the far side of the room. As always, Dorcas and Senelle follow close behind. You are able to walk a little more straight than you did last night. Perhaps you are starting to get accustomed to moving around in diapers. You still have a waddle in your step, but it is a little less pronounced than it was yesterday. You find you do not really mind the waddle anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the way to the door, both of the maids sneak a couple pats at your diapered bottom. You do not mind that either; you find it rather affectionate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you reach the door, Cersei opens it and urges you inside. It turns out to be her clothing closet. It is about half the size of her bedchamber, and there are scores of gorgeous gowns hanging along the walls. Almost every piece of the lower half of the walls is covered by clothing, except for three spots which are covered by full-body mirrors. Light is provided by a skylight on the ceiling and roof, but there are a few sconces on the upper half of the walls for holding torches when it is dark outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing all this elaborate apparel suddenly reminds you how the only thing you are clad in is a thick layer of padding, wrapped around your loins. It makes you feel a little self-conscious, but only a little.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"So, Baby,\" says Queen Cersei, turning to you, \"What should Mummy wear today? I'll let you decide.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou spend a couple minutes browsing through the selection, and you ultimately come across a gorgeous gown made of bright crimson silk and golden velvet. Those happen to be the colors of House Lannister. More than that, the gown has a low-cut bodice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about this?\" you suggest, pointing out the gown in particular.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe seems pleased with your pick. \"Excellent choice. Dorcas, Senelle.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that, the maids step forward. You waddle back a couple steps to give the women some space. The queen lifts her arms, and the maids pull her gown off her in one fluid motion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, you see the queen naked. Her physique matches her face; absolutely flawless and stunning. Her breasts are even bigger than they appeared at first. Even Dorcas and Senelle do not have such a fine bust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel a quiver in your nappies, and you struggle to keep it under control. This is a very rare privilege; to be present when the Queen is changing. You do not wish to ruin it by making her uncomfortable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour worries may be unfounded, as she looks over at you and gives you a sultry grin. You almost swear she makes a seductive pose at one moment. But the moment passes, and Dorcas and Senelle fetch the dress you picked and proceed to dress the Queen. You just watch on, dumbfounded.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You gaze over at Queen Cersei and mutter \"Say, Mummy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, darling?\" the Queen remarks, as the maids help her into her smallclothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I came to King's Landing on a horse,\" you tell her, \"A destrier named Aerion. He's been with me for years, and he's a faithful mount. I turned him over to the royal stables before I entered the Red Keep. I want to ask... what will become of him?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He will cared for,\" Queen Cersei assures you, as the maids get her into a corset, \"The royal stables have enough room for him, I promise you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are relieved to know that. For the longest time, Aerion has been your only true friend in the world. You would hate to have to part with him after all your travels together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about the rest of my belongings?\" you ask, \"Mainly, my weapons and armor.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We've put all of them in storage,\" the queen tells you. Now that the corset is on, Dorcas and Senelle get her into a petticoat. \"You will not be needing those any time soon, anyway. You're wearing the only clothing you'll need.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou flush at that. \"Does that mean I am confined to this room?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Certainly not,\" the queen remarks. Now it is time for the dress. As Dorcas and Senelle help her into it, she tells you, \"You can go wherever you please in the Red Keep, so long as Dorcas, Senelle, or I accompany you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But won't everyone else in the Keep be... surprised by my lack of clothing?\" you argue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You shouldn't fret about modesty,\" Queen Cersei advises you. Now she is fully dressed, and she slowly approaches you. Once she is in front of you, she reveals in a very calm voice \"Not long ago, the entire populace of this city saw me naked. Yet I still have their respect, and no one has challenged my claim to the throne.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are surprised, but not by the news that the queen had been in public nude. A while back, you had heard that Cersei Lannister had been forced to do a walk of penance by the High Sparrow. Apparently, that actually HAD involved her being naked as a way for her to show that she had nothing to hide. You can imagine it must have been a harrowing experience for the queen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow the High Sparrow and all his followers were dead; burnt to death in the Great Sept of Baelor. The Queen, meanwhile, was at the height of power. If that experience had troubled her, it no longer did now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shyly look up at the blond woman and say \"I understand, Mummy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe grins and places a kiss on your cheek. Then she steps back and asks \"What do you think?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing her in that dress, you are amazed by how well it suits her figure. If possible, she may actually be more beautiful fully-clothed than naked. You never would have imagined such a thing until today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You look beautiful,\" you declare. She smiles once more and hugs you appreciatively, rubbing your thickly padded bottom affectionately. While you are still somewhat opposed to going around in just your nappies, it would still be preferable to going around completely naked. If the queen could do the latter, you can certainly do the former.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now then,\" the Queen says, after the hug ends, \"You've already broken your fast, but I still need to break mine. Before that, however...\"</span></div></div>",

You then hold your hand out to Senelle, and you tell her \"You first, Senelle.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shorter but bigger-busted maid takes your hand and steps forward.

Now the lower half of her body is fully naked. You notice she is shaved down there, which will make this process a little easier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou lean down to one of the shelves of the changing table, and you take out a pair of thick cloth diapers, along with some pins, powder, and cream. Although Dorcas and Senelle are both a few years older and several inches taller than you, the diapers look as though they will fit both maids.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou proceed to put your maids into padding. You have never put a nappy on anyone before, so Dorcas and Senelle have to guide you through the process a little. Luckily, it is not too difficult to learn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter applying a layer of powder and cream to Senelle's nether regions, you slide the pair of nappies under her. You pull them up firmly between her legs, bring up the sides, and pin them shut securely with the pins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter making sure the diapers are on properly, you help Senelle back up. You then announce \"Alright, your turn, Dorcas.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe taller but smaller-bust maid obediently climbs onto the changing table.

Here you are, standing in nothing but a diaper, diapering your maids, who are supposed to be babysitting you right now. You wonder what Queen Cersei would think of this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter helping Dorcas back up, you affectionately hug her and Senelle. During the hug, your hands slide down their backs, and you gently pat and squeeze their diapered bottoms, causing them to blush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the hug ends, you look at the maids. They are in just their diapers and their tops, which do nothing to conceal their padding. You are still in only your own diaper. This is perfect for what you have planned. You announce \"Alright, now that we're all appropriately dressed, let us have some childish fun together.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you suggest?\" asks Dorcas.</span></div></div>",

At first, you hesitate a bit, fearing that maybe you misheard or misunderstood her. Plus, as enticing as the blond woman's offer sounds, you are already full from suckling on Dorcas' breasts. You mutter nervously \"I... I don't think I could drink any more right now, Mummy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is alright,\" Cersei assures you, \"It has been over ten years since I last nursed my own children. As such, my breasts ran dry long ago. However, Maester Qyburn has provided me an elixir that will allow me to produce milk once again. It should be working by this afternoon. Qyburn tells me the lactation process will be accelerated if you go ahead and suckle on my breasts now. Aside from that, I wish to see if you are as skilled with your tongue as the maids claim.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou cannot argue with any of those points. Of course, even if you tried or wanted to, you are certain you would risk angering or displeasing the queen. Flushing slightly, you pull away from Dorcas, who fixes her dress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you approach Cersei Lannister, she removes her nightgown. Underneath that, she is wearing nothing. Not even any smallclothes. Yet she does not seem the least bit embarrassed or shamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen again, you HAD heard that not too long ago, the Queen had been required to walk through the streets of King's Landing naked. If that was true, then she would probably have no qualms about being nude in front of her new \"son.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour thick diapers had not prevented you from getting your usual morning wood when you woke up. The sight of the queen's gorgeous body only causes your manhood to press even more against your wet padding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you settle down into the queen's lap, she guides your mouth to her nipple. You latch on and begin to suck. As expected, nothing comes out. Still... the experience is amazing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou start out just sucking with your lips. Then you part your teeth and let your tongue come forward. You rub it around the queen's nipple as you suckle. It has the intended effect on her; she begins to moan in arousal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the midst of this, the queen brushes your hair out of your face, and she observes \"You're a very handsome boy, you know. Despite growing up on the road, your face could fool others into thinking you were highborn.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou appreciate the compliment. Truthfully, you have always thought of yourself as average looking at best. If this voluptuous blond woman calls you \"handsome,\" that must be worth something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you continue to suckle, the queen traces one of her hands along your arms and chest. Thanks to Dorcas and Senelle, your entire body has been rid of hair, and everything below your ears is still smooth to the touch. Queen Cersei comments \"These are some fine muscles you've built up, too. You must be strong.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou lightly nod along. Although you are slightly shorter than the average man, you like to think you possess a little more strength than the average man, too. That strength proved useful in the past many times.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou begin to suckle a little more vigorously. That causes Queen Cersei to moan louder. In turn, her moaning causes the tent in your nappies to grow even more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, the queen notices the bulge in your diaper, and lets her free hand glide down to the front of your padding. She lightly presses her hand against it, causing you to moan in pleasure. After that, she begins rubbing your diapered crotch sensually. You are tempted to pull away, but she holds you close and whispers \"Don't stop, Baby. Let Mummy handle everything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo you keep suckling on Cersei's nipple. Overtime, her moaning gets louder, and the louder she gets, the more firmly she rubs your padding. You start humping into her hand. Dorcas and Senelle just stand by, watching their mistress pleasure her son. And vice versa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin a couple minutes, you find yourself on the verge of your climax. Do you reach it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(For both of the below options, you can have it so that Cersei is brought to an orgasm, as well. You don't have to do that if you do not want to, though; just something to think about. Keep in mind, this is Cersei we're talking about. Her libido is almost unmatched in this franchise.)</span></div></div>",

Dorcas remarks \"Very well. We'll be the captive maidens, and you'll be our knight in shining armor.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean our knight in thick nappies,\" Senelle jokes. You blush a bit, and the two maids get a laugh at your expense. But you think of a way to get them back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know this is just a game, but why don't we try to strive for authenticity?\" you propose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How so?\" asks Dorcas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You remember those ropes you used to tie me to the queen's bed yesterday?\" you remark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" says Senelle, \"What about them?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Could you get them?\" you request.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe maids hesitate at first, but they obey. They reach under the queen's beds and remove the four ropes from the previous day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good,\" you say in approval, \"Now, both of you; put your hands behind your backs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDorcas and Senelle do as they are told. You step behind them, set aside two of the ropes, and use the other two to bind the maids' hands behind their backs. They do not resist, though they do seem a little nervous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Relax,\" you tell them softly, \"I won't tie it too tight; just enough to make sure you can't wiggle free.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, Dorcas and Senelle have their hands securely tied behind their backs. After that, you have them stand with their backs facing each other. You use the third rope to bind their already-bound hands together. This ensures that they will not be able to slip their hands under their legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you pick up the last rope, you have them sit down on the bed. You wrap this rope several times around their waist, forcing them to keep their backs to each other until you release them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter checking the knots, you mutter \"You're almost a perfect pair of damsels in distress. One thing missing, though. But what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou know that if two women really were being held prisoner, their captors would likely cover their eyes to keep them from seeing their surroundings, or cover their mouths to keep them from calling for help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich do you do?</span></div></div>",

Why do you ask?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRather than answering, you waddle over to the cabinet, kneel before it, and open up the top drawer. You manage to find two long, thin, black pieces of silk.

You instruct them \"Close your mouths.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey do, and you proceed to pull one of the pieces of silk over each of their mouths.

The chances of that may be slim, but it could not hurt to check.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt is well-known that Lady Ellaria and Prince Oberyn have a very open relationship. Since they are not married, they often partake in orgies, where they get involved with other members of both sexes.

You concentrate for a moment, and you realize it is a small group of riders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey appear to be armed, so you place your hand on the hilt of your sword, but you do not draw it. You do not wish to give them reason to attack you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore long, the riders are upon you. There are four of them in total. Interestingly, all four are women. Dornishwomen, based on their complexions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe oldest of them appears to be in her late thirties or early forties. Nevertheless, she has to be among the top five most beautiful women you have ever seen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other three are all in their twenties. One of them is carrying a spear, another is carrying a whip, and the third is dressed like a septa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt occurs to you that these must be Ellaria Sand and the three eldest Sand Snakes (Oberyn Martell's daughters). From what you recall, the one with the spear must be Obara, the one with the whip must be Nymeria, and the one dressed like a septa must be Tyene. They are Ellaria's stepdaughters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe four gorgeous but deadly women gradually surround you and Aerion. They do not appear hostile, but you remain on your guard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good day, miladies,\" you tell them courteously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And to you,\" the oldest woman returns. She sounds friendly enough. \"What brings you to these parts?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am looking for work,\" you claim. That is partly true. You are also looking for some motherly attention, but you decide not to mention that for now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not a Dornishman,\" the spear-wielder observes, \"You've come a long way south for work.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I like to leave no stone unturned,\" you say plainly, \"I am a man of many trades. Maybe I could be useful.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe you could,\" the oldest woman remarks, looking you over. It is as though she is implying you'd be useful the way a man is useful to a woman. You hope that is the case. \"My name is Ellaria. These girls are Obara, Nymeria, and Tyene. What is your name?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Brynden,\" you tell her. You gesture to your horse and added in \"This is Aerion. He's been my faithful companion since I was a lad.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then how old are you?\" asks Nymeria.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Six and ten,\" you say, \"I will be seven and ten soon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aren't you a little young to be traveling alone?\" Tyene notes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've been doing it most of my life,\" you state, \"My family died when I was very young. I've been on my own almost as far back as I can remember.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe women seem slightly dismayed by that news. Ellaria's horse trots forward, and she says \"I am sorry for your loss. No one should have to go through life alone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I agree,\" you comment, \"Alas, I have gotten by this far. While I manage well enough, there are still times when I yearn for some company.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy now, Ellaria's horse is right next to yours. She smiles and leans forward. Without any warning whatsoever, she places a kiss on your lips. You are surprised and delighted at the same time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Consider that your greeting to Dorne,\" she tells you. You wouldn't mind be \"greeted\" more than that. \"Follow us; we'll take you to Hellholt.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou comply with her instructions. However, as you near the seat of House Uller, you start to feel lightheaded and disoriented. At first, you think it may be sunstroke. But that is unlikely. Before long, you feel as though you are gradually fading out of consciousness. You brace yourself against Aerion, and you pass out<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wake up...</span></div></div>",

Whenever a lone rider comes to Hellholt, I always rub my lips with an potion that knocks one out. When I kissed you, I administered the potion into your body. Once the victim passes out, we decide what to do with them next. Sometimes we throw them in a dungeon, send them back to where they came from, or - if the victim is a known enemy - we cut their throats.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what are you going to do with me?\" you ask nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You needn't worry,\" she assures you gently, \"My people and I are not going to harm you.

YOUR stay, however, may be longer than usual.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why is that?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because you are in dire need of some tender loving care,\" Ellaria explains, \"Living a solitary life as a orphaned nomad... it is almost too sad for words. As such, I mean to provide you with the love and attention you were deprived of.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou begin to wonder if you are still asleep.

One, when you lost consciousness, I knew it would at least be several hours before you woke up again. There was a chance you might have relieved yourself before then, so the nappy is a useful precaution. Two, all your clothing - including what you had on when I met you - seemed very starched and scratchy. That includes your smallclothes. I thought a nappy would be a comfortable change. Three... I want to make you my own son. The best way to do that would be to start from the very beginning, back when you actually were in nappies.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll three of those points are very good.

Plus... if you really were going to be babied, you may as well go all-out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEllaria reaches down and gently places her hand on the front of your diaper. You feel through manhood quiver beneath the padding. A few seconds later, she announces \"Excellent.

After all, whenever you need to be changed, it would always be myself or one or your 'sisters' who does it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour cock begins to harden once more beneath your diaper. Ellaria notices this and pats it lightly. She comments \"Such a big boy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA moment later, your stomach growls a bit. You remember that you have not eaten since this morning. Thankfully, Ellaria is ready to provide. She slips out of her nightgown, leaving her in just her smallclothes. Then she takes you in her arms again, holds your head up to her right breast, and urges you to take it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hesitate a little, but you manage to latch onto her nipple and begin to suck. Within moments, rich, warm milk starts flowing into your mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Ellaria breastfeeds you, you feel as though you are in pure bliss.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The year is 299 A.C. Currently, the noble houses of Westeros are at war. The war began only recently after the death of King Robert Baratheon, but it has already spread throughout the entire realm. It is being called the war of the Five Kings. Those five kings are Robb Stark (for the North and Riverlands), Balon Greyjoy (for the Iron Islands), Renly Baratheon (for the Reach and part of the Stormlands), Stannis Baratheon (for the rest of the Stormlands and part of the Crownlands), and Joffrey Bartaheon (for the rest of the Crownlands and the Westerlands). At present, the Vale and Dorne are the only two of the nine regions that are neutral or have not declared for anyone yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince you headed south, you can only choose between three of those nine places.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDorne would likely be the safest, given Prince Doran Martell's reputation for avoiding conflict and relying more on patience, reasoning and sound judgment. Plus, Dornish women are renowned for their beauty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Stormlands would be a little riskier, given the conflicting loyalties of its nobles. Still, you would be able to see firsthand what both of the remaining Baratheon brothers were up to, and after a while, you could decide if you would throw in with either of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, in terms of popularity and strength, Renly seems to have the greatest odds of triumphing over the other kings. With that in mind, you suppose your best opportunities to find work (and a caring motherly figure) would lie with following the late King Robert's youngest brother. At present, Renly is in the Reach with the whole of his forces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere will you go?</span></div></div>",

Storm's End was currently held by Renly, but Stannis was willing to seize the castle, even if by force.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLastly, you heard a rumor that Balon Greyjoy was planning to launch a campaign against the North.

Evidently, the rumors of the Reach's beauty were not embellished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you are less than a day's ride from Bitterbridge, you finally happen across another party. This one is quite large. There are at least thirty men, all of whom are gathered protectively around one woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who goes there?\" one of them calls out to you, placing a hand on the hilt of his sword. He does not draw it, but you do not doubt he will if he deems it necessary. Most of his companions seem to be of a like mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHoping to avoid a hostile confrontation, you calmly call out \"No one of importance, I assure you, good ser. I am but a humble traveler, roaming the land and searching for work wherever I can.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sound believable enough. At least you hope you do; that IS the truth, after all. Thankfully, the mounted men seem a little less wary of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is your name?\" the woman asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Brynden, milady,\" you inform her. You note her auburn hair, her eyes, and her complexion. You ask \"Forgive me my impertinence, but would you happen to be Lady Catelyn Stark?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman's eyes widen a little in surprise, but she lightly nods her head. One of her soldiers asks suspiciously \"How do you know that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Although I have been all over the Seven Kingdoms, I am originally from the Riverlands,\" you reply, bowing your head respectfully, \"I can easily recognize one with the coloring of the Tullys of Riverrun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Lady Catelyn lightly grins at that. \"I see. May I ask what you are doing out here all on your own?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As I said before, milady, I am looking for work,\" you inform her, \"With the war going on, my options have expanded greatly. I concluded that my best prospects might lie with King Renly, so I am on my way to Bitterbridge to visit his camp. No offense meant to your son or those that follow him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No offense was taken, my boy,\" she assures you, \"Since you are no one's sworn vassal, you are free to align with whomever you please. However, might I ask how old you are?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Six and ten,\" you inform her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLady Catelyn is surprised. \"Then you're younger than my eldest son,\" she remarks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat amazes you. You are younger than King Robb? The auburn-haired lady says \"You are not even a man grown, yet you are traveling all by yourself?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's correct, milady,\" you confirm, \"Please, do not let it trouble you. I've lived this way for the past eight years, and I've gotten by just fine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That may be,\" says Catelyn, \"But the realm was not at war for the last eight years. Now, it is dangerous for grown MEN to be wandering the land alone. For a growing lad such as yourself to do the same...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou simply shrug at that. You've always been good at avoiding dangerous encounters. The only ones you ever got involved in were the ones where you had an excellent chance of emerging triumphant. Still, Lady Catelyn seems genuinely concerned, and only a scoundrel would put a lady in such distress. You say \"Might I ask what you believe I should do instead?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We are on our way to Bitterbridge, as well,\" Lady Catelyn informs you, \"If you wish, you may join my company until we get there. Then you can decide where you'd like to go from there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are astonished by her kind offer, but you do not accept it straightaway. You wonder; would it really be alright to accept her hospitality, even if only for a day? After all, you had not really done anything to earn it. Then again, it is not as though you would be imposing on anyone.</span></div></div>",

Two knights clad in full-body armor are going at each other in earnest. A young black-haired man with a matching beard is seated on a throne, observing the duel. Beside him is a gorgeous woman with a thin waist, brown hair, and... a larger-than-average bosom. That must be his queen, Margaery Tyrell. Thousands of spectators are crowded around the circle, cheering them on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLady Catelyn decides not to interrupt the duel. You and she just watch it play out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, the taller, more muscular knight wins. As the loser struggles back to his feet, he pulls off his helm. Based on how closely his features resemble the queen's, you figure he must be her brother, Loras Tyrell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe winner's helm is removed, as well, and you discover it is a woman. Renly acknowledges this woman's victory, addressing her as Brienne of Tarth, also known as Brienne the Beauty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(This next choice you pick may be a little canon-divergent. Is Brienne still as homely as she is supposed to be in the books and show, or is she actually quite beautiful instead?)<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Her face - though currently a little red and covered in sweat - is free of all blemishes. Her toned, enormous figure compliments her face very nicely. You can hear a lot of the surrounding spectators make comments on her desirable appearance. You just stay silent and admire her beauty quietly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRenly orders for Brienne of Tarth to approach him and kneel. She does as she is told, and he proceeds to reward her for her victory. He knights her and incorporates her into his Rainbow Guard, which is his equivalent of the Kingsguard. Each one of the Rainbow Guard is draped in a cloak a different color. For Brienne, the color is blue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Brienne the Blue is standing beside her king, Renly finally turns his attention to his guests. He beckons Lady Catelyn and her retainers to come forward. You consider staying back and blending into the crowd, but Lady Catelyn gestures for you to accompany them. You comply, and you have Aerion ride alongside her horse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you, Catelyn Stark, and her thirty-so men are in the center of the dueling ring, Renly smiles and declares \"Welcome, all of you, to the Reach. I am Renly Baratheon, King of the Seven Kingdoms. This fair maiden beside me is my bride and queen, Margaery Tyrell.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt appears you were right about the girl; she IS Renly's queen. She blushes a little at her husband's praise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLady Catelyn dips her head respectfully and declares \"Good day to you, my lord. I am Lady Catelyn of House Stark, and I come on behalf of my son, Robb Stark, the King of the North.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hear someone call out \"There is only one true king of Westeros!\" In response, several other people start yelling similar things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few seconds later, Renly gestures for silence, and once everyone quiets down, he stands and announces \"Greetings, Lady Catelyn. Might your vassals introduce themselves, as well? I would know who all has gathered before me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As you wish, Your Grace,\" Lady Catelyn remarks. She sounds reluctant to call him that, but does so grudgingly. Each of the men who accompanied her to the Reach proceed to give his name, as well. You manage to remember a few, such as Wendel Manderly, Lucas Blackwood, Robin Flint, and Perwyn Frey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, all twenty-five of Lady Catelyn's guards have given his name to King Renly. Right now, you are the only one who has not spoken. You wonder if Renly will ask you to introduce yourself, as well. You do not think it likely. After all, given your poor clothing, your unclean appearance, and the way you hold yourself, you really stand apart from Lady Catelyn and her men.</span></div></div>",

Still, you remain calm and announce \"My name is Brynden, if it please you, Your Grace.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRenly nods in approval at the manner of your introduction. \"Are you part of Lady Catelyn's honor guard, as well?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alas, I am not, Your Grace,\" you tell him, \"I am not among Lady Catelyn's vassals.

Are you for Robb or for myself?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou choose your words carefully: \"I am for whichever man proves himself just and worthy to be the king.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRenly seems impressed. \"That is a very good answer. Your sentiment is one I share. Fealty is something that must be earned, not given out freely. All these people who surround you... they have deemed me the most suitable man to rule them. They trust in me. They have faith in me. What would convince you to do the same?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are a little perplexed by that question. \"I do not mean to sound impertinent, Your Grace, but why would you care so much for MY fealty? I am just one mere commoner.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A single person's choices and actions can make all the difference in a war,\" Renly debates, \"Tell me; where were you before you came here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was in the Riverlands, Your Grace,\" you answer him, \"After spending a few days in the Kingswood, I came here from the east. Although it is not my place to say, you may elect to head back the way I came.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRenly is intrigued by that. \"How do you mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRecalling what you heard at that inn, you tell the black-haired man \"I have heard that your brother, Lord Stannis, means to lay siege to Storm's End.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA wave of silence passes over the area. It lasts a full minute, and it ends when Renly asks \"What?\" He sounds uneasy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's the word going around the Riverlands, Your Grace,\" you tell him. Apparently, Renly had no idea what his elder brother was up to. This may have been a chance for you to curry favor with him. You then look to the woman beside you, and you tell her \"On that note, Lady Catelyn, you may wish to send a raven to King Robb or your other sons in Winterfell. I just remembered also hearing that the Ironborn may attempt to invade the North, as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPredictably, Lady Catelyn and her vassals are stunned. Some of Renly's soldiers are equally taken aback.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of a sudden, Queen Margaery chuckles and tells her royal husband \"Isn't THIS interesting, my love? This young man seems to be better informed than us or anyone in our company.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or maybe not,\" Loras counters his sister, eying you warily, \"For all we know, he could be a spy from Stannis or Joffrey, sent to mislead or misinform us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have every right to assume the worst of me, good ser,\" you mutter calmly, gazing around at the gathered masses, \"Most of you did not know me before today. You have no reason to trust or believe in anything I say. I myself am not too confident in the accuracy of what I've told you; it amounts to little more than gossip and rumors.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nevertheless,\" Lady Catelyn mutters, \"If the Ironborn were to attack us, now would be the ideal time to do so. The North is only sparsely defended.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I would not put it past Stannis to make an attempt on Storm's End,\" Renly mutters, \"He has always longed for it, ever since the day Robert named me its master.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are we going to do, Your Grace?\" Brienne asks. She and every other person there who has sided with Renly look to their king for guidance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sits thinking for a few minutes, and then he announces \"We have lingered in the Reach long enough. It is past time we stirred. Even if the information supplied by young Brynden here turns out to be false, we would still be in a position of strategic advantage over Stannis and Joffrey. So, all of you, get your rest tonight. For tomorrow, we march!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis is met with a chorus of cheers all around the dueling ring. Soon, the crowd begins to disperse, and everyone goes their separate ways.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the area clears up, Renly Baratheon looks to Catelyn Stark and tells her \"I appreciate your coming all this way to treat with me, my lady. I assure you that you did not come this far for naught. I am more than willing to discuss the possibility of alliance on the march, if you would accompany us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well, Your Grace,\" Catelyn concedes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As for you...\" Renly mutters, turning towards you, \"Who are you, really?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just what I claimed to be, Your Grace,\" you inform him, \"A simple traveler who looks for and takes work wherever he can find it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's plenty of it here, if you are interested,\" Renly offers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grin and say \"I am very much interested, Your Grace.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRenly seems pleased.

Such elegant accommodations like these are hardly befitting for one such as I.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The king has decreed otherwise,\" Brienne mutters, \"If you wish it, I could relay your dissatisfaction to His Grace.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no, please do not,\" you hastily tell her, \"I will accept these lodgings, even if they are above one of my standing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do not think so low of yourself,\" Brienne advises you, not unkindly, \"I know what it is like to doubt one's sense of worth, but you must not let it hinder your true capabilities.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you say so, milady,\" you mutter. After climbing off Aerion and securing him to a rail outside, you enter the pavillion. Brienne enters right after you. The interiors impress you. There is a bed, a table, some chairs, and even a tub.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would you care for a bath?\" Brienne offers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, yes,\" you reply straightaway, assuming you would be bathing yourself, \"I haven't taken one in over a week.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, I will have the maids fetch hot water,\" Brienne tells you, \"But first... would you like some help getting undressed?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow do you reply?</span></div></div>",

So, you gaze up at Brienne and tell her, somewhat nervously \"Ummm... certainly. As long as you've no problem with it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrienne merely grins and tells you \"I assure you, there is no problem at all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou have always been a little shorter than the average man. This woman is clearly much taller than the average woman. The difference in height alone is enough to make you realize how odd this setting is. Still, Brienne IS very beautiful, and despite her prowess in battle, she looks as though she has a gentle touch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs it happens, she does. You find that out a moment later, when she begins to undress you. She starts with the outermost layer, which is your leather armor. She removes your breastplate, greaves, gauntlets, and boots. After that, she removes the doublet you wear underneath. Now you are in your tunic and breeches, which she removes as well. Now, you are in just your smallclothes. Thankfully, she doesn't remove those.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, you go ahead and get settled in the tub,\" she instructs you, \"I'll be right back with the maids and the hot water.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou anxiously nod in acknowledgment, and you walk over to the tub and climb in. You still keep your smallclothes on, as you do not wish to expose your private parts just yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout ten minutes later, Brienne returns with three maids. Each of them is carrying a bucket of steaming hot water. The maids catch a glimpse of you, blush, and giggle. At being seen half-naked, you blush, too. Brienne then dismisses the maids, and she brings the six buckets over to the tub. She then asks very seriously \"Would you like me to wash you?\"</span></div></div>",

Only if you do not mind, though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't,\" she assures you. She then unfastens her breastplate and sets it on the ground. Then she slips off the layer of chainmail she is wearing underneath. She then removes the rest of her armor until she is down to her own tunic and breeches. The tunic must be a little small for her, given how her large breasts strain against it. Her nipples are clearly visible through the tunic, as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why are you undressing, too?\" you ask, bewildered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do not wish to risk getting my armor wet,\" Brienne informs you, \"It would be bad if rusted somehow. Besides... the tourney is over, and I am not guarding my king. There is no reason for me to be in armor at the present.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That makes sense,\" you mutter in agreement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrienne then starts to pour the contents of the buckets into the tub, alarming you. As she empties each one in quick succession, she remarks \"You may wish to remove those\" and gestures to your smallclothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou meekly nod your head, turn your back towards her, and remove your smallclothes. You blush furiously and sink into the water. It is almost scaling hot, but not nearly boiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrienne proceeds to wash you up. As she washes your hair, you say \"May I ask why you are doing this for me, my lady? A maiden as beautiful and as strong as you shouldn't trouble herself with such a menial task.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, Brienne blushes from being addressed as \"beautiful.\" It is as though she is unused to that label. Then she tells you \"You may think so, but I do not mind. Any task King Renly gives me, I accept with eagerness. Aside from that... I enjoy caring for those younger than myself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou suppose those are both good reasons. \"In any case, thank you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are quite welcome,\" she tells you. After rinsing your hair, she scrubs your chest and back next. She notes how toned your arms and chest are. \"You seem to be in excellent physical condition.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I try to be,\" you tell her. Despite your below-average height, you have a very strong physique, which you have built up and consistently maintained throughout your life in order to survive all on your own. Although there is no chance you are as strong as Brienne, if SHE is impressed by your muscles, that might say something about your chances with women.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrienne does your arms and legs next, and she insists on washing your bottom and groin, as well. Somehow, she talked you into letting her. Then again, it may not have taken as much convincing as one might think. You notice she seems impressed with what is... down there. She can feel how stiff you get from her touch. Luckily, you don't go off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce you are totally clean, Brienne helps you step out of the bath, and she towels you off vigorously. Once you are dry, she helps you dress in a fresh pair of breeches and a new tunic, and over that, she puts you in a soft, silken robe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There we go,\" she says proudly, \"Now, it is almost noon. Would you care for something to eat, or would you rather get some rest?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat do you decide?</span></div></div>",

Still, you wanted to enjoy this treatment while it lasted. You had a feeling it would end soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the late evening, when everyone is about to settle down for the night, Lady Brienne tells you that you have a visitor.

It is a soothing gesture, and it quickly calms you down. Lady Catelyn tells you softly \"Now, get some rest.

You stammer \"G-g-good morning to you, Y-your Grace.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMargaery continues to smile and calmly says in response \"Good morning to you, as well, Brynden.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou keep your head bowed for a little while longer.

Is there anything you require of me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only for you to rise and prepare for the day,\" the queen tells you, \"After breakfast, Renly will be riding straight for Storm's End. He will be taking the vanguard and all of his cavalry with him. He would like you to join them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If the king commands it, I shall oblige,\" you state, trying to sound formal. You swiftly get up from your bed and look around for your clothes. Your armor and doublet is still on the ground by the foot of the bed, but your tunic, breeches, and smallclothes are nowhere to be seen. It is possible the maids came when you were sleeping and took them to be washed. Luckily, those were not the only regular clothes you owned. You have more in your supply pack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou begin to approach the entrance of your tent, but Queen Margaery stops you and asks \"Where are you going?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To fetch my supply pack off my horse,\" you answer her, \"I need a change of garments, and that's where they are.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You should have said so,\" Margaery remarks, grinning again. She calls out \"Brienne, would you get Brynden's supply pack from his mount and bring it in here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Certainly, Your Grace,\" you hear the female knight's husky yet feminine voice reply from without. Less than twenty seconds later, she enters the tent. She is dressed in her armor and blue cloak once again, and she is carrying your supply pack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you graciously take the pack from Brienne of Tarth, you turn to Queen Margaery and ask \"By any chance, will you be joining the march, Your Grace?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No,\" she tells you, \"If effort to reach Storm's End before Stannis, Renly is only setting out with his fastest units. The bulk of his forces will set out in a few days, and all non-combatants - including myself - will be in that company.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wish you safe travels,\" you bid the queen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You, as well,\" Queen Margaery returns, \"Now, once you are dressed, Lady Brienne will escort you to my and Renly's tent. We would like you and Lady Catelyn to break your fast with us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As you wish,\" you say to acknowledge. After the queen leaves, Brienne proceeds to help you out of your sleepwear and into a fresh tunic and breeches. She then helps you into your doublet and leather armor, as well. Just like last night, her touch is motherly and gentle. A bit of contrast to her strong and somewhat intimidating appearance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe leads you to Renly and Margaery's tent, where you break your fast with Lady Catelyn. You notice Lady Catelyn, Lady Brienne, and Queen Margaery all seem somewhat invested in whether or not you are eating enough. That could be do to your slightly short stature.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce you've eaten the morning meal, you return to Aerion, mount him thusly, and depart for Storm's End with King Renly, Lady Catelyn, her retainers, Lady Brienne, and the whole of Renly's vanguard and cavalry.</span></div></div>",

As you rapidly approach the eastern shore, you spot the Baratheon stronghold of Storm's End in the distance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt has been a long couple weeks. You have spent most of that time in the presence of Lady Catelyn, Lady Brienne, and King Renly. Since you have been in the eastern half of the Seven Kingdoms for the last year, you talk to them about how the war has impacted that half of the realm. So far, the Stormlands and the Crownlands are relatively untouched, whereas the Riverlands have suffered the worst damage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou have also told King Renly about your idea of a possible working alliance between him and King Robb. What you did was propose to Renly that he allow Robb to retain his title of \"King in the North\" so long as he swore not to rebel against Renly's forces and to continue their trade and diplomatic relations with the rest of the Seven Kingdoms from before the war began. He could also acknowledge Renly as the true King of the realm, and the two kings could work together to resolve conflicts that occurred between their two nations.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Renly was uncertain about this proposal at first, he took a week to think about it carefully. The day before you arrived at Storm's End, he told you that your proposal actually did have merit. As of now, he still has not agreed to allow Robb to remain the King in the North for good, but he and his advisors will think on a way to make such an arrangement work. You hope they reach some form of compromise. After all, if Renly's forces combined with Robb's, the war would likely end much sooner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyway, once you arrive at Storm's End, Renly has his forces set up camp once again. You are given the same pavilion from before, much to your delight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLady Brienne and Lady Catelyn tend to spend just as much time with you as they did at Bitterbridge, with the former helping you dress, undress, and bathe and the latter tucking you in at night and lulling you to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few days of waiting, Lord Stannis Baratheon arrives on the scene. At a glance, you can tell that the older Baratheon's forces are much smaller than the younger's. Renly's vanguard and cavalry alone greatly outnumber the entirety of Stannis's units. The Lord of Dragonstone does not stand a chance if it actually comes to battle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNevertheless, as soon as he arrives, Stannis calls for a parley, which Renly agrees to. Lady Catelyn agrees to come along so that she can speak for King Robb. Interestingly, Renly invites you to attend the parley, too, even though you have no official status.</span></div></div>",

In fact, your presence may actual be somewhat detrimental to Renly's image, as it may lead Stannis to incorrectly assume that you represent most of his young brother's soldiers. You explain this to Renly, and thankfully, the king understands your decision.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore noon, King Renly and Lady Catelyn head out to the parley, taking several of their guards and vassals with them. Lady Brienne is one of those who accompany them. You have no one but Aerion to keep you company for the duration of the parley. Normally, you would not mind that. However, after having these courteous highborn hosts for the last two weeks, you strangely find yourself a little hollow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily, the feeling does not last long. Renly, Catelyn, and their retainers return after less than an hour. Apparently, the parley did not go well. No blows were exchanged; only words. But no one was left satisfied by the end of it. Despite everyone's best efforts, they were unable to reach a compromise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvidently, it would come to battle after all. Renly tells you \"Stannis has left us no choice. Tomorrow... I must fight him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou notice he sounds sorrowful. That is actually a little reassuring. As vain and haughty as Renly may be, he still appreciates the value of family.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater that night, Renly summons you and Lady Catelyn to his tent. When you two get there, Lady Brienne is helping him into his armor <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRenly tells you his plans for tomorrow. He will have you, Lady Catelyn, and her men abstain from fighting, but he wants all you to observe the battle. He claims the purpose is so that you all can witness what he is capable of, as well as what he does to those who oppose him. You hope that is not a threat. Given how relations between Renly and Catelyn have been improving for the last fortnight, it probably is not. Still, a serious king does not make idle threats.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust when Brienne finishes dressing Renly in his armor, you abruptly feel quite cold. Lady Catelyn appears to feel the same, and the light seems to dim slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight then, something enters the tent. You have no idea what it is, but it is black and gaseous. You suddenly feel as though you are in the presence of danger. However, the black entity does not come toward you. It is moving towards Renly!</span></div></div>",

He falls to the ground just before the black entity can stab him. The entity DOES manage to inflict harm onto you, though. Its blade grazes your side. Although the blade appears to be made of shadow, the sharpness is quite real. So is the pain. But you pay no mind to the pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe entity does not attack you again. Instead, it turns away from you, and it moves towards Renly again. Lady Brienne draws her sword and slashes at the entity, but her blade goes right through it.

You raise the torch and plunge it into the entity's center. The effect is immediate; the entity lets out a high-pitched shriek and begins to dispel. Once it has dispelled completely, it emits a force. The force is so strong that it throws you off your feet. You hit your head when you land on the ground, and despite your attempts to remain conscious, you quickly pass out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere are you when you regain consciousness, and who is with you?</span></div></div>",

Instead, you are lying down on your own bed in your tent. You are securely under the covers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFurthermore, you are not alone. Queen Margaery Tyrell is seated in a chair beside you. Two girls who are about her age are standing behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your Grace,\" you acknowledge her presence, moving to sit up out of respect. However, Margaery stops you from rising.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't get up,\" she urges you, \"I would hate for you to overexert yourself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou would hate that, too. As you settle back down, you ask \"How long have I been unconscious?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Almost five days,\" Margaery informs you, \"Much has happened in that time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Was there still a battle?\" you ask nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" the queen reveals, \"Fortunately for everyone, it did not last very long. When Stannis's forces saw how hopelessly outnumbered they were, they were quick to capitulate. Most of them came over to our side. The rest fought to the bitter end, or surrendered when their commander was captured.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, Lord Stannis is in custody?\" you assume.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Indeed,\" Margaery replies, \"Both him AND his Red Witch, who was responsible for what happened in Renly's tent.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then you know of that, too?\" you inquire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course,\" says Margaery, \"The thing that attacked you and my husband was a shadow assassin conjured by Melisandre. Its goal was to kill my husband, and it would not have stopped until it completed its goal, or something else stopped it first. On that note... Renly told me about how you saved him at great risk to yourself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm just glad I was able to stop that monster,\" you mutter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So am I,\" Margaery declares, smiling, \"Renly and I are indebted to you. We could never properly thank you for what you did. But we found a way to begin. That is why I took charge of caring for you these last few days.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are stunned. \"Well, I thank you for your concern, Your Grace.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You need not thank me,\" is all Margaery says in response. After a pause, she asks \"Do you think you can sit up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose,\" you mutter. Margaery then leans over and helps you sit up. As your blankets fall off your torso, you realize your chest is bare. You hastily grab for them and exclaim \"Why am I naked?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMargaery chuckles at that and says \"Well, we had to remove your tunic in order to treat your injury. Besides, you're not naked. Let me show you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then takes your blankets and pulls them all the way down to your feet. Indeed, you are not fully naked.

You turn to the queen and ask \"Why am I in a nappy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You were out of commission for five days,\" one of the handmaids, who had been silent up until now, reminds you. She is tall with dark hair and pale skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other handmaid nods and says \"This was the only way we could handle your... expulsions.\" She is a little shorter, with sandy blonde hair and slightly tanner skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth of them are beautiful. Not as beautiful as Margaery, but still enough to turn heads. At any rate, you are quite embarrassed to be in just a diaper in front of the three of them. Gazing down awkwardly, you mutter \"And you two are...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you don't know,\" Margaery remarks, \"Brynden, permit me to introduce my handmaids: Mira Forrester of the North and Sera Durwell of the Reach. They have been helping me care for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... thank you,\" you mumble softly, still unable to look any of the girls in the eye. They giggle at your embarrassment. Just then, another thought occurs to you. You look up at Margaery and ask \"Just HOW have the three of you been caring for me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To be precise, it was not just the three of us,\" Margaery tells you. She then turns to the front of the pavilion and calls out \"He's awake!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you turn to the entrance, Lady Catelyn Stark and Lady Brienne of Tarth step inside. Now you are in front of five very beautiful woman in nothing but a diaper. You feel an overwhelming desire to crawl into a hole. Alas, you have nowhere to go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLady Catelyn sits down in a chair on the other side of the bed, and she says \"I am glad to see you are well, Brynden.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As am I,\" Lady Brienne comments, standing behind the Lady of Winterfell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you both,\" you mumble quietly. \"So... the five of you have been tending to me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is correct,\" Queen Margaery confirms, \"To answer your earlier question, we have been feeding you, cleaning you, and changing you routinely. Any other questions?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How have you been cleaning me?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe queen informs you \"Mira, Sera, and I took wet washcloths and rubbed your body down twice a day. We also took the liberty of shaving all the hair off your body, except for what's on your head.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gaze down at your body, and sure enough, there is not a single hair anywhere down there. Your toned arms, legs, and chest are totally smooth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about feeding?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We could mostly just give you liquids such as honey and water,\" Margaery reveals, \"Luckily, Lady Catelyn was able to provide another form of sustenance.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCurious, you turn to Catelyn Stark. She flushes a bit and places a hand on her upper chest, right on her bosom. You quickly realize what she is implying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Milady...\" you mutter in shock, \"Did you feed me from your...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe just nods and says \"I have not fed my own children from the breast in years. But I can still produce milk, and I was able to find a use for it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf you blush any harder, your face may go permanently red. A highborn lady actually breastfed you in your sleep. You only wish you could have been awake for it. You then say \"What about... changing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All five of us took turns changing your nappies,\" Margaery informs you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry you had to do such a repulsive chore,\" you murmur apologetically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You do not have to apologize,\" Mira assures you, \"We enjoyed it. Especially Sera.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other handmaid has her turn to blush, and she mutters in annoyance \"Mira...!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't try to deny it,\" her fellow handmaid teases her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSera sighs and mutters \"Alright, maybe I did. But how can you blame me. I mean, you saw the SIZE.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only way you could get any redder now was if you caught a horrible sunburn. That is what you assumed, anyway. Without any warning, Queen Margaery reaches out and says \"On that note, let's see if you need to be changed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe places her hand on the front of your diaper and rubs it a bit, startling and exciting you at the same time.

Eventually, she declares \"It seems he has relieved himself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wonder if there is any end to your embarrassment. First, you found yourself nearly naked in front of the queen and her handmaids. Then, you discovered you were naked except for a cloth diaper. Then, two highborn ladies entered the pavilion, increasing the number of women to five. Then, you heard about how the five of them had been looking after you for the last five days. Now... it was not enough for you to be in a nappy in front of them. It turns out you are in a wet one, too!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet in spite of the increasing level of embarrassment you feel, none of the five ladies seem the least bit bothered. If anything, their behavior suggests that what they are doing and how they are treating you is totally natural.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrienne, Catelyn, Mira, and Sera snicker a little when Margaery announces the condition of your padding. However, these chuckles do not sound derogatory. Still, they deliver another blow to your self-esteem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Must you laugh at my expense?\" you mumble quietly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We are not laughing at you, Brynden,\" Margaery tells you gently, placing a soft hand on your arm. The other women stop snickering right away. \"We are just laughing at your embarrassment. There is no need for it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Indeed,\" Brienne agrees, \"We are not seeking to humiliate you, milord. Your feelings are very important to us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatelyn nods and remarks \"After everything you have been through, you deserve to be loved and cared for.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou reflect on that, and then you say \"In that case... thank you all. I am grateful for everything you've done for me. However... I would like to get out of this wet nappy, if you do not mind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course,\" Margaery assures you.

Mira, Sera, get the supplies.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two handmaids then reach under your bed and pull out a bag. From the bag, they take out a thick towel, a few containers, and a package, which they hand to their mistress. Margaery takes the towel, spreads it out on the surface of the bed, and tells you \"Lie down here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou scoot down the bed and set yourself down on the towel. Once you are there, Margaery proceeds to change you. She starts by undoing the pins on your diapers, and then she pulls down the front, exposing your privates to the cool air. You move your hands to cover your groin, but Mira and Sera take ahold of your arms and force them by your sides. Margaery gently scolds you with \"No need to feel ashamed. Each of us has already seen that part of you several times.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite her attempt to pacify you, you are still uneasy. Even so, there is nothing you can do to protest or resist. So you choose to just submit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter pulling out your soaked diapers from under you and placing them off to the side, Margaery takes a washcloth and wipes your groin and bottom. Soon, the odor of urine is eliminated, and your privates no longer feel moist. Your manhood begins to quiver a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQueen Margaery then reaches into the package and pulls out a fresh pair of cloth diapers. You feel the need to ask \"Why are you putting me into new nappies, Your Grace? Weren't you just having me wear them because I was unconscious?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is true,\" Margaery admits, \"But until you are well enough to stand, you should stay in bed. Aside from that... I've come to enjoy changing your nappies. So have the other ladies here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat surprises you. You look around at Lady Brienne, Lady Catelyn, Mira, and Sera, and all of them nod to confirm the queen's claim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLady Margaery then has you raise your lower body and she slides the new pair of nappies underneath. Once you settle back down on them, she opens the two containers. One holds a type of powder, which she sprinkles onto your crotch and rubs in firmly. Again, you start to get hard at being handled in such a way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other container holds a type of cream, which Margaery spreads onto her hands and applies to your crotch and bottom thoroughly. She pays especial attention to your manhood, which is starting to become fully erect. She just giggles at that, and she continues to stimulate. It is as though she is teasing you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a couple minutes of being fondled by the queen, you ejaculate into her hands. She does not mind at all. She just wipes her hands on another towel, and then she proceeds to finish diapering you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, Your Grace,\" you mutter softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For the stimulation or the nappy change?\" Margaery asks as she pulls the front of the diapers up between your legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Both, I guess,\" you reply. As Margaery begins to bring the sides of the diapers up and pin them, you say \"But won't the king be displeased if he finds out about this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you needn't worry,\" Margaery assures you, \"He already knows. But he approves.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He does?\" you mutter in shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMargaery finishes pinning your diaper up, and then she nods her head and tells you \"I don't know if you are aware, Brynden, but my husband is far more interested in my brother than he is in me. I would know because they have spent the night together several times. I have not spent even one night with my king.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had heard rumors of King Renly's preferences, but you had never been certain if they were believable. If his own queen could attest to them, however...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, if the king approves, then I have no issue, either,\" you declare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMargaery is patting the front of your padding to ensure that it is on properly and securely. After confirming that, she smiles, plants a soft kiss on your diapered crotch, and says \"Excellent. Because I plan to keep you in nappies for quite a while longer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou do not know if you should be ecstatic or afraid. Maybe a little of both.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

She then turns around and exits the tent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If the king is coming to see me, shouldn't I get dressed?\" you suggest, pointing out how all you are wearing is your freshly changed diapers. You already feel plenty awkward being in just your nappies in front of five beautiful, fully-clothed women. To appear in front of a king in such a state... that is absolutely out of the question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it would take too long to get you fully dressed before Renly arrives,\" Lady Catelyn states.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Indeed,\" Margaery agrees. She then goes over to the table, picks up a neatly folded garment, and holds it out, saying \"I hope you'll be content with this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou realize it is the silk robe you've been wearing at night or when you have leisure time. Although it is thin, it covers your entire body except for your hands, feet, and head. You declare \"That will do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Marvelous,\" says Margaery. Mira and Sera then pull you to your feet, and they have you turn your back to Margaery. The queen approaches with the robe, and she drapes it over your shoulders. You slip your arms through the sleeves, and then you pull it close over your padded crotch. Mira and Sera tie the sash for you, even though you are capable of doing that yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are glad to have the robe on, but the bulge of your diapers is quite visible beneath it. When you try to walk around the tent, you move with a pronounced waddle. The girls and Lady Catelyn giggle at that, making you blush yet again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later, Lady Brienne returns with both King Renly Baratheon and Ser Loras Tyrell. Once the king enters, you begin to bow. Renly, however, stops you and urges you \"Please, Brynden; do not lower your head to me. If anything, it should be me bowing to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That would hardly be appropriate, Your Grace,\" you point out as respectfully as possible, \"Regardless of all else, you are still a king.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Even a king does not forget his debts,\" Renly argues, \"If not for you, I would most certainly have been killed. Worse yet, my soldiers would have been without a leader, and my queen would have been without a husband. Instead, I have triumphed over my elder brother, and my forces are that much stronger as a result. You may have altered the fate of all Westeros through that one heroic deed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are astonished. You never would have thought you would ever have such an impact on the Seven Kingdoms. That just went to show there was no telling where fate would lead you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am honored by your praise,\" you tell Renly sincerely. After a pause, you ask \"Is that all you wished to tell me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, there is more I wish to discuss,\" Renly replies. He gestures to the table and says \"Sit down; I may be here a while. Lady Catelyn, Margaery, join us, please.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Lady of Winterfell and the queen move their chairs over to the table and sit back down there. You and Renly take the remainng two chairs. Your padding presses into your bottom as you settle down. You realize that you are about to have a conversation with a king, his queen, and another king's mother whilst diapered. You try not to reflect on that too much; it would just distract you.</span></div></div>",

I thought to include you, Brynden, because you seem to have the realm's best interests at heart, as you suggested the possibility of an alliance between Robb Stark and myself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"On that note, may I ask if you have you given that alliance any further thought, Your Grace?\" you say curiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, I have,\" Renly admits, \"That is the main issue. You see, although this may be the War of the Five Kings, only three are still fighting. I have captured my brother Stannis, and Balon Greyjoy has conceded.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He has?\" you mutter in surprise. You would not have thought the Ironborn would give in so soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Indeed he has,\" Lady Catelyn confirms, \"I wrote to Winterfell after you told me of the possibility that the Ironborn would invade the North. In response, the Northmen who stayed behind were able to fortify their coastal towns and holdfasts. As a result, the Ironborn were pushed back quite easily. They barely even set foot on our shores before they were retreating back to their ships.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Theon Greyjoy even had the gall to try to take Winterfell,\" Queen Margaery adds in, \"Luckily, he was solemnly defeated. He and his sister Lady Asha were apprehended by Ser Rodrik Cassel. When 'King' Balon learned that his children were captured, he surrendered unconditionally.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then the Ironborn are no longer a threat?\" you assume hopefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is correct,\" says Lady Catelyn, placing a delicate hand on your shoulder and smiling, \"All because of you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou flush a bit and shrug your shoulders, as though you are not certain whether or not to agree.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRenly then tells you \"As I was saying, the only kings left are myself, Robb Stark, and my 'nephew' Joffrey. I have no quarrel with Robb, I am certain he has none with me, and he has an even greater reason to want Joffrey dead than I do. Therefore... I have decided to entertain the concept of an alliance with the Starks. I will even allow Robb to continue to call himself the King in the North. Provided that he does two things for me first.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What would you require of my son, Your Grace?\" Lady Catelyn asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRenly answers her with \"First, he will publicly acknowledge me as the rightful king of the Seven Kingdoms, and he will make no claims on any land south of the Neck. Second... he will help me seize King's Landing from the Lannisters.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Those are both reasonable requests,\" you casually remark, shifting a little in your seat. Your padding is still pressing against your crotch and bottom firmly, and you remain very aware of your diapered condition.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I agree,\" says Lady Catelyn, \"Even so, Your Grace, I must ask; why would you need my son's help to take King's Landing? With the soldiers and ships you acquired from Lord Stannis, you have the means to accomplish this task on your own.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is correct, my lady,\" says Renly, \"Truthfully, I believe I COULD take the city with my own forces. However, if the realm is to survive with two kings, we must prove that these two things are capable of cooperating with one another to attain the greater good. Furthermore, if Robb's reason for fighting truly is for his father's justice, then I would see just how determined he is to succeed in this righteous goal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Those are some fine points, Your Grace,\" you comment, \"If two men who called themselves 'king' worked together to bring down a tyrant, I believe the smallfolk would - on the whole - come to respect both of them, regardless of their origins.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Since you grew up among the smallfolk, I trust in your judgment, Brynden,\" Renly remarks. He then stands up and declares \"I will write to King Robb and tell him what we've discussed here. Once he agrees to my terms, I shall arrange to meet with him so that we may combine our forces and march on King's Landing. If we are fortunate, within a month or two, King's Landing will fall out of the Lannisters' hands.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wish you the best of luck, Your Grace,\" you tell the black-haired man. \"Is there... anything else you require of me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only for you to continue to rest up and regain your strength,\" Renly responds, grinning a bit, \"I am certain you have no issue with that order. While I personally prefer the company of Loras, I know most other men would be delighted to be left in the care of five very beautiful women.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLady Brienne, Lady Catelyn, Queen Margaery, Mira, and Sera all blush a little at being addressed as such. You just scoff and say \"I quite agree, Your Grace.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKing Renly and Ser Loras then exit the pavilion, and you are left alone with your five female caretakers.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens now?</span></div></div>",

She has you sit up against your pillows, and she asks \"Comfortable?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very,\" you answer her, flashing a grin. Indeed, the soft bed and soft pillows combined with the soft thickness of your diapers is quite comfortable to say the least. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMira, Sera, and Brienne return about ten minutes later. Lady Brienne is effortlessly carrying a small cauldron of stew. Mira and Sera have a loaf of bread, a platter of fruit, a jug of water, and enough bowls, spoons, tankards, and napkins for six. The three of them set everything down on the table, and Lady Catelyn proceeds to distribute portions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough you feel well enough to feed yourself, the ladies insist that they feed you instead. This time, the duty falls to Mira and Sera.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter both of them receive their portions of food and water, they each move one of the chairs to either side of your bed. Then they place your napkin on your chest like a bib, and they begin to feed both themselves and you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLady Catelyn and Queen Margaery sit in the remaining two chairs at the table, where they eat. Lady Brienne is also at the table, and she manages to eat while standing. While they have their lunch, all three of them closely observe you and the handmaids.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMira and Sera take turns feeding you stew, bread, fruit, and water. Each time one of them feeds you, the other has a bit of her own lunch, and then they switch roles. This becomes a quite effective pattern.

You tell the handmaids \"Thank you for lunch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is no trouble, ser,\" Sera tells you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Quite so,\" Mira agrees, \"We'd be happy to feed you anytime.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you take a minute to savor the aftertaste of that wonderful meal, Margaery asks you \"Would you like something other than water to wash it down with, Brynden?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are a little confused. \"Such as what?\" They had brought nothing else to drink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe queen just smirks, turns to the oldest woman there, and mutters slyly \"Lady Catelyn?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn response, the Lady of Winterfell turns towards you, grins suggestively, and makes a subtle gesture towards her cleavage.

Of course, the present circumstances are quite different from all those times. You were unconscious back then, and you did not really have a say in the matter. For a teenage boy to suck on the tit of a woman... especially when he was not related to that woman in any way...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, you would be a fool to pass up this opportunity. It is something you have literally dreamed about quite often.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure you would not mind, milady?\" you ask Lady Catelyn, wanting to be considerate of her feelings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course not,\" she assures you, \"It has been years since I last nursed my own children. The milk will just go to waste if YOU do not drink it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, you cannot have that, now can you? \"Very well. I would actually love to have some.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can tell Lady Catelyn is pleased by your decision. She gets up from her chair and walks over to the bed. Mira and Sera get up, and they help Lady Catelyn out of her cloak and bodice. She ultimately removes her top altogether, and she is standing before you with her huge, supple breasts fully exposed. You feel your member twitch in your diaper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLady Catelyn sits down on the bed beside you, and she gently wraps her arms around you and pulls you close. She has you lie on her lap, and brings your mouth up to the nipple of her right breast. You hesitantly latch on. She seems to notice how tense you are, and she urges you \"Just relax. Trust in me as though I was your birth mother.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh, how you wish that was actually true! You settle down, close your eyes, and begin to suckle. Within seconds, sweet, warm milk flows into your mouth. It surprises you at first, but as you become accustomed to the sensation, you drink the heavenly fluid slowly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough your eyes are closed, you can hear and sense the other ladies gathering around the bed. Either you are no longer embarrassed by all this attention, or you simply no longer care. Whatever the case, you are too engrossed in Lady Catelyn's breasts to be bothered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you nurse, you feel a dainty hand caress your forehead. It feels like the queen's. You find out a moment later it is, as you hear the hand's owner say in Margaery's voice \"I envy you, Lady Catelyn. This looks quite enjoyable.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can confirm firsthand that it is. The Lady of Winterfell tells the young queen \"Someday, you will have children of your own, Your Grace. Then you can relish this experience, too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I look forward to it,\" Margaery mutters happily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time you drain Lady Catelyn's right breast, you are getting hard. A small tent has already appeared in the front of your nappies. None of the ladies seem to have noticed it yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat is what you thought, anyway. When Lady Catelyn moves you from her right breast to her left breast, you hear someone chuckle. It turns out to be Lady Brienne. You feel her large hand pat your padded crotch and her voice declare \"It would seem some of us are enjoying this in more than one way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMira, Sera, and Margaery laugh a little in amusement. There is no denying it; you are incredibly turned on. You just wonder how Lady Catelyn will react to your arousal. You just hope she won't stop breastfeeding you because of it.</span></div></div>",

She keeps her left arm wrapped around your arms and torso, and she continues holding you close to her. She tells you firmly \"Go on, Brynden. Keep drinking.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou obediently latch onto the nipple of her left breast and resume suckling. Mere seconds after the milk starts flowing into your mouth, you feel Lady Catelyn place her right hand on the front of your diaper. She begins to press down lightly. The effect is immediate; you moan into her breasts in delight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour first impulse is to pull away and catch your breath, but Lady Catelyn holds you firmly against her, and she whispers teasingly \"Don't stop. Stay calm, and leave everything to Mummy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are powerless to go against her. All you can do is keep drinking from her breast and she rubs your erect cock through your thick diapers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou start to feel as though your greatest fantasy is finally becoming real. In every way. The diaper was the one thing you had not envisioned. Yet surprisingly, it seemed to make the sensation even more pleasurable than you could have imagined. Was that even possible? To feel better by being rubbed off in diapers than when wearing absolutely nothing?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, you begin humping into Lady Catelyn's hand. At the same time, you are moaning into her breast. You never stop suckling, though; the small river of milk is consistently flowing into your mouth. In response to your humping, she begins rubbing you faster and more firmly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis goes on for... you do not really know how long. It feels like hours, but it is likely just a few minutes. You rapidly get closer and closer to the pinnacle of your pleasure. For a brief moment, you worry that Lady Catelyn is going to relent just before you hit your peak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo your enormous relief, she does not. Right before you reach your pinnacle, she whispers into your ear sensually \"Go ahead and fill your nappy, dear. A growing boy like you needs an occasional release to stay healthy. Make Mummy proud of you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat is all the encouragement you need. You let out a muffled scream into Catelyn Stark's breast, and you orgasm into your diapers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy now, you have drained Lady Catelyn's other breast, as well. That is fortunate, because now you do not even have the strength to suckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou unlatch from her nipple, and you struggle to catch your breath. Catelyn Stark herself just hugs you close to her bosom, rubbing your back and whispering sweet nothings into your ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you finally open your eyes, you glimpse over at the other ladies. Judging by their faces, they, too, had gotten more than a little excited by what happened between you and Lady Catelyn. You wonder if you are not the only one there who now requires a change of clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat now?</span></div></div>",

You do not complain about being stuck in your creamy diapers. It's still far better than being left in them after using them for either of their traditional uses. The concept of having to sit in your own piss or shit for hours does not appeal to you in the slightest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, then,\" Queen Margaery announces, \"It is time for Brynden's bath. Brienne, if you would...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As you say, Your Grace,\" says the tall blond knight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLady Catelyn gently pulls you off her lap and sets you back down on your bed. Then she gets back to her feet, and Mira and Sera help the Lady of Winterfell put her top and cloak back on. You find yourself staring at Catelyn Stark's breasts right up until the moment they are back behind her bodice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrienne then approaches you with a basin.of hot water, a washcloth, a bottle of liquid soap, and a bottle of perfume. She begins to wash your body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou lie perfectly still and watch Brienne as she wets the washcloth in the basin, wrings it out, and applies a bit of liquid soap and perfume. Then she starts scrubbing your bare chest. She is firm but gentle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Brienne cleans you, a sudden thought enters your mind. You turn to Lady Catelyn and ask nervously \"King Robb won't ever know of this, will he?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only if you want me to tell him, my dear,\" Lady Catelyn assures you. You cannot imagine WHY you would want the King of the North to know that his mother had breastfed another boy and rubbed that same boy to an orgasm. At least you are assured that this will be kept secret.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Brienne has washed the front of your torso, she moves on to your arms and legs. She carefully raises your limbs up one at a time, and then she scrubs each one thoroughly. The sensation is heavenly, as though she is wiping away all the strain in your muscles with the dirt and grime.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLady Catelyn, Queen Margaery, Mira, and Sera just stand idly by and observe while the tallest of their group washes you. You are still quite tired after having such an intense climax. Even so, you are fully capable of enjoying the experience of being washed by a lady's hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter your arms and legs are clean, Lady Brienne picks you up and carefully rolls you onto your stomach. Then she proceeds to wash your back. You let out a sigh of contentment as the washcloth is pressed against your skin. It nearly brings you into a state of utter bliss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile you are lying on your stomach, you feel someone sneak a few pats on your diapered bottom. You are not certain who it is, but based on the small hands and delicate touch, it would have to be either Mira or Sera. When you hear the handmaids giggle, that would seem to confirm your suspicions.  You do not mind; they can touch your bottom all they'd like.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen your back is done, Lady Brienne rolls you over again so that you are facing upward. She tells you to close your eyes, and then she washes your face. Her hands caress you lovingly, as though she was an actual mother tending to her child. When she is done, she places a soft kiss on your forehead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only part of you that Lady Brienne did not wash is your private area. However, since Queen Margaery already wiped and powdered your crotch and bottom earlier when she changed your diapers, it would be unnecessary for Lady Brienne to attend to that just yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyway, every other part of you is now clean and smelling of flowers, which you attribute to the perfume. It is a nice scent; it helps to mask the lingering scent of horse you had from riding Aerion for so long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wonder how long this unusual yet wonderful treatment will go on for. You also wonder what else these five lovely ladies have planned for you, as well as where your relationships with them might head.</span></div></div>",

Even after you recover from your injury, they keep you in diapers. You do not know why, but you have two credible theories. Either they enjoy caring for you like their own child, or they just want to have an excuse to see your private area.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, you are hardly in a position to complain. However, the women are very particular about your manner of dress. Whenever you are in your pavilion, they insist that you wear only your nappies or your nappies with a robe over them. You are never permitted anything else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhenever you leave your pavilion, however, you are allowed to wear your regular attire, meaning your tunic, breeches, doublet, cloak, and leather armor. Beneath all that, however, you are always thickly and securely padded. The queen and the other ladies seem to have disposed of all your smallclothes somehow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the first month, King Robb Stark and his forces arrive in Renly's camp. You are present when King Robb reunites with his mother (not in your tent, thankfully), and you can tell they are both very happy to see one another. You envy the Northern king just a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLady Catelyn then introduces you and Robb to each other. Almost immediately, you and the Young Wolf get along very well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobb then surprises everyone (particularly his mother) when he brings forth a young Essosi lady and introduces her as his wife. Her name is Talisa Maegyr, a noblewoman and healer from the Free City Volantis. Apparently, he had met her in the aftermath of the recent Battle of Oxcross, and they had bonded afterwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatelyn Stark is not too pleased with this development. Although she approves of Talisa as both a woman and a daughter-in-law, Robb's sudden marriage to her means that he has broken a contract he had forged with Lord Walder Frey. He was supposed to marry one of the Late Lord Frey's daughters in exchange for passage over the Crossing and the use of House Frey soldiers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSecretly, you can hardly blame Robb. After all, Talisa is a very beautiful, intelligent, and caring individual. You can tell that much after your very first meeting with her. Furthermore, you are aware that Walder Frey is a notorious swindler, and his female descendants are known to be dimwitted, selfish, and... unpleasing to look at. In your mind, King Robb made the right choice for his own queen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRenly assures Robb that they will handle the matter of Lord Frey later. For now, the black-haired king claims, they have more important things to worry about. The biggest of which, obviously, is taking King's Landing from the Lannisters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobb agrees to acknowledge Renly as the rightful ruler of the Seven Kingdoms and to help him seize King's Landing, as long as Renly lets him be the one to execute King Joffrey. Renly agrees to that term.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, a few days after the Young Wolf's arrival, the combined might of the North, the Riverlands, the Reach, and the Stormlands marches for King's Landing. You are included in the march, but how do you travel?</span></div></div>",

At one point, she invited Queen Talisa to share carriage, and the Volantene healer graciously accepted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe extended the offer to you, too. But while the offer is appealing, you have hardly ridden Aerion at all ever since you came to Storm's End. You do not want him to think you are discarding him or anything of the sort. Furthermore, whenever you travel, you prefer to do it exposed to the fresh air and scenery, not hidden within some stuffy vehicle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMargaery understands your decision, and she tells you that if you change your mind, you are welcome to join her and Talisa in the carriage. You assure her that you will remember that offer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt happens that Lady Brienne and Lady Catelyn are travelling by horse, too. Because of that, the two of them ride close to you for the duration of the march. Most of the time, one or both are alongside you. Whatever the case, they both keep a close, watchful eye on you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily for you, nobody else - not even King Robb - seems to question the attention the Lady of Winterfell and the tall blond knight are giving you. Other than the two of them and Queen Margaery and her handmaids, no one else in the entire company is aware that you are padded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn that note, you have come to be accustomed to wearing diapers. You can appreciate how soft, comforting, and reassuring they are. They also rub up against your manhood, mildly exciting you at all times.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you ride on Aerion, your diapers press into your bottom, too. As a result, the saddle is a lot more comfortable to sit in. So, there is at least one practical advantage to being padded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhenever you stop for lunch or to make camp, Lady Brienne or Lady Catelyn take you to the side and discreetly check you for wetness. Most of the time, you are dry. There are, however, a few occasions when you drink too much water before setting out, and you are forced to use your nappies for their intended purpose a few hours later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately, whenever that happens, Lady Brienne or Lady Catelyn take you someplace quiet to change you. Both of them always seem to have plenty of spare diapers on hand, and they are ready to get them out at a moment's notice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter another month of fighting, you arrive at King's Landing. Renly and Robb prepare to lay siege to the city.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two kings have ordered you to abstain from the battle. You are glad for that, as you never had any intention of joining the fray. Although you are trained with both the sword and the bow, you are no soldier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat aside, you doubt your female caretakers would permit you to partake in the fighting. They are far too protective (almost possessive) of you to allow such a thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as the Sun sets, the two kings and their armies head off to battle, Lady Brienne follows King Renly, but Lady Catelyn remains behind with you. You and she watch as the majority of the Stark-Baratheon forces ride out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLady Catelyn then turns to you and says \"Since we cannot see the battle from here, Brynden, perhaps this would be a good time to join the queens. Or, if you prefer, we could stay here until the fighting stops.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat do you decide?</span></div></div>",

The guards allow you and Lady Catelyn to approach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLady Catelyn knocks on the door to the carriage a few times, and Sera answers it. She smiles when she sees who is on the other side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have you room for two more in there?\" Catelyn asks rhetorically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, my lady, ser,\" the handmaid replies. She backs away to allow you and the Lady of Winterfell inside. When you climb in, you realize that the carriage is a lot more spacious than it appears to be from the outside. Margaery and Talisa are seated on one side; Mira and Sera on the other.

In fact, she would like to see you in them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are shocked by both of those sentences. However, before you can process them fully, the ladies advance on you. Mira and Sera hold you down while Margaery, Talisa, and Catelyn strip you out of your armor and clothes. Within two minutes, you are in just your thick, white cloth diapers. You blush and try to cover them with your hands, but your efforts are in vain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be embarrassed,\" Queen Talisa encourages you, \"You are not the first man I've seen in nappies, Brynden.

They needed nappies until they recovered. As I recall, they ALL recovered and never wore them again after. Of course, you're the first person I know of who wears them for pleasure instead.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blush. It IS true that you wear diapers for pleasure, but it is more for the pleasure of your caretakers than your own. Even so, you have come to associate your padding with your own pleasure, too. Thankfully, Queen Talisa does not seem disgusted. Instead, she seems rather fascinated and curious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would you mind if I checked him, Margaery?\" the Volantene noblewoman asks the woman from the Reach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are a little annoyed.

As of yet, I am not pregnant. However, I would like to prepare for motherhood in any way possible.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you are welcome to tend to Brynden with the rest of us,\" says Margaery, pulling you close and wrapping your side in a firm embrace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I would be happy to,\" says Talisa, sitting on your other side and embracing you, as well. You find yourself in the arms of two half-naked women, both of whom are queens. \"Is that why you treat him this way? To ready yourself for when your first babe is born?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We have several reasons for this treatment,\" Margaery admits, \"One of which is that. Another is to show him proper love and affection. You see, Talisa, Brynden has been alone for almost his entire life. We are giving him the attention he was denied in his youth.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Caring for him IS quite similar to caring for a real babe,\" Catelyn remarks, reaching out and stroking your head tenderly, \"Only he is much more compliant and understanding.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And his nappies are bigger,\" Mira japes, patting your diapered crotch. You blush again, and the ladies snicker at your reaction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is not the only thing that's bigger,\" Sera adds, gazing down at your padding. You know full well she is referring to the thing within your nappies. You blush even redder, and the ladies just snicker more loudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the laughter dies down, everyone cuddles close together to share their body heat. Margaery and Talisa cling to either of your sides.

Every now and then, one of them reaches down and lightly pats, rubs, or presses against it. Most of the time, they only tease you for a few seconds. A couple times, however, they stroke you through the diapers slowly and sensually. They never bring you to a climax, though. Any time you get close to release, they relent. You are frustrated, but you do not complain. You should be grateful just to have all this attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you sit in this carriage with these beautiful women, you wonder how the siege of King's Landing is going.</span></div></div>",

All the while, you can hear the sounds of battle in the distance. Once or twice, you swear you hear an explosion of some sort. But you do not let it trouble you. As long as you are in this carriage, you feel as though all your troubles are meaningless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSometime after midnight, there is a knock on the door to the carriage. At that, Queen Margaery sits up a little, keeping both her arms around you tenderly. She calls out \"Who is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is I, Your Grace,\" a deep yet feminine voice responds. You recognize the voice as Brienne of Tarth's. You are glad to hear her. Although you greatly enjoyed being with these other five ladies, it was not quite the same without the tall blond knight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMargaery smiles, lets go of you for a moment, wraps her cloak around her exposed chest, and approaches the door to the carriage. She cracks it open to peek outside, and she asks \"What news of the siege, Brienne?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The battle is won, Your Grace,\" Brienne of Tarth proudly declares, \"King Renly and King Robb breached the walls of King's Landing hours ago. Not thirty minutes ago, they stormed the Red Keep. Their combined armies are securely the city as we speak.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What of the Lannisters?\" says Queen Talisa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They've all been captured,\" Brienne reports. Everybody smiles at that, including you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And my daughters?\" Lady Catelyn asks in concern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am afraid Princess Arya is nowhere to be found, my lady,\" Lady Brienne reveals, \"But rest assured; Princess Sansa is safe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatelyn Stark is left both relieved and apprehensive by that news. One of her daughters is alive and well, but the other is unaccounted for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWanting to help ease her worries, you lean closer to the Lady of Winterfell, place a comforting hand on her shoulder, and tell her \"Do not fret, milady, please. I am certain your younger daughter is alright. Surely you or King Robb would have heard by now if some misfortune had befallen her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThose kind words seem to ease Lady Catelyn's tension. She smiles at you and pulls you into a tender hug. She gently pats your diapered bottom and whispers \"Thank you, Brynden.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are very welcome,\" you mutter, your head planted against Lady Catelyn's exposed breasts. You are sorely tempted to fondle one of them, but you do not want to ruin this tender moment. Of course, since the front of your diaper is pressed against her leg, she undoubtedly knows you are enjoying being held like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The kings sent me to fetch you all,\" Lady Brienne declares, \"I am to escort you into the city and up to the Red Keep immediately.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well,\" says Queen Margaery, opening the door a little wider and backing away from it. It seems less cold now than it was earlier. \"Would you care to join us in here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLady Brienne is surprised by that offer. \"I am a knight, Your Grace. It would hardly be appropriate of me to ride with my queen and her companions.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Never mind that, my lady,\" Queen Talisa counters, \"In this vehicle, we are all equals. Status is unimportant here. We would be honored if you rode with us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Indeed,\" Margaery agrees with the other queen. She then looks over at you and mutters \"Unless, of course, Brynden would prefer to enter King's Landing on Aerion. If he so chooses, someone will have to ride with him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I would be happy to oblige him,\" says Brienne.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So would I,\" says Catelyn Stark, letting go of you and giving you some space.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe six ladies gaze at you expectantly, awaiting your decision.

Or should you enter in a carriage?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHere is another way to consider that choice:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWill you enter King's Landing in full clothing and armor?

As she leaves to find someone to tend to Aerion and the other horses, Margaery closes the door to the carriage.

Half a dozen people have seen you in diapers, and you have no desire to increase that number.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later, Lady Brienne returns to the carriage. You and the other ladies make room for her. Given her height, Brienne has to bend over a little to avoid hitting her head on the ceiling of the carriage. Other than that, though, she seems comfortable. Once Brienne is settled, the carriage begins to move, and it heads straight for King's Landing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this time, the other five ladies are only wearing their cloaks and smallclothes, and the only thing you are wearing is your diapers. Brienne is the sole person in the carriage who is still fully-dressed. However... that does not mean she must stay that way. In fact, she looks as though she is considering undressing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou personally would not mind if Lady Brienne sheds her attire. You are certain Queen Margaery and the other ladies would not mind either. The real question is whether Lady Brienne herself would mind.

Why not discard it and let your skin breathe like the rest of us?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrienne's cheeks go a light shade of red, and she awkwardly gazes off to the side. You expect her to protest or argue. Yet she does not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen her cheeks regain their normal color, Brienne of Tarth looks around at you and the other ladies, and she lightly nods, saying \"Very well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe slowly brings her hands up to the top of her breastplate, unfastens it, and pulls it off. Then she slides off her chainmail shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMira and Sera move closer to the tall blonde and assist her as she continues to undress. A couple minutes later, Lady Brienne is down to her smallclothes and her cloak, just like all the other female occupants of the carriage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes immediately go to Brienne's chest. Out of all your cartetakers, she has - by far - the largest pair of breasts. They are enormous; definitely the biggest ones you've ever seen. You feel your member press against the front of your diapers once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLady Brienne notices the bulge in your padding, and she chuckles. She traces a finger along her bust, and she mutters sensually \"Do you like these, Brynden?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou vigorously nod your head, causing Lady Brienne and the other ladies to giggle. Margaery and Talisa have been clinging to your arms for the last few minutes. Without warning, the queens let go and playfully push you towards the female knight, who catches you and holds you close. You slowly wrap your arms around her and hug her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We have had Brynden to ourselves for the whole evening,\" Talisa remarks, sneaking a pat on your diapered behind, \"It is only fair that you have some time with him, as well, Lady Brienne.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you very much, Your Grace,\" the blonde tells the Queen of the North, embracing you and rubbing your back gently, \"I was looking forward to this all throughout the siege.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight now, your head is firmly planted between Lady Brienne's breasts. Up close, they are even bigger than you thought. You jokingly think that perhaps you might actually suffocate in them. That would not be an unpleasant way to die, you think. But, of course, you are not ready to die for quite a while. As you now, you have six reasons to live, and all of them are in this carriage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Lady Brienne continues cuddling you, you gawk at her bosom. You feel an overwhelming desire to grope her breasts. Normally, you would be able to restrain yourself. But the combination of being in an enclosed space, being surrounded by six gorgeous half-naked women, being thickly diapered, and being denied sexual release for the last six hours has substantially weakened your will power.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou unwrap your arms from around Lady Brienne's waist, and you slowly lift your hands up to her chest. You take ahold of one of her breasts in each hand, and you begin to squeeze them softly. She promptly lets out a gasp. This gasp sounds as though she is both surpirsed and excited by this daring action of yours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe does nothing to stop your fondling. Nor do the other women. They just let you enjoy yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are getting quite bold, Brynden,\" Lady Brienne mutters, warmly and sternly at the same time, \"I do not mind if you touch and caress my chest, but next time, please ASK first.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou immediately let go of her breasts, gaze up at the tall woman, and say apologetically \"I am sorry if I bothered you, milady.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is alright; you did not,\" she assures you, placing a loving kiss on your forehead, \"However, first, you must learn a lesson.

She places you in such a way that your diaper is pressing against her smallclothes. Those two layers of clothing are the only thing separating your private area from hers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou do not have much time to absorb the implications of that arrangement. A moment later, Lady Brienne places her left hand on your back to keep you in place. Then she slowly raises her right hand into the air. After holding it in the air for a few seconds, she brings her hand down and smacks your bottom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou yelp, more in alarm than in pain. Brienne proceeds to raise her hand and spank you once more. She repeats this process over and over again for the next few minutes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour diaper absorbs most of the impact. However, even through your thick padding, you can feel the force of her blow. You can tell Brienne is not trying to actually hurt you or scare you. Still, even when striking your bottom playfully, you get a rough idea of just how strong she really is. You make a note to never do anything that might make her SERIOUSLY angry with you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLady Brienne spanks you for a full five minutes. Near the start, you feel two things: your member stiffening and a strain on your bladder. Both sensations become progressively more pronounced overtime.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time Brienne of Tarth relents, you do not feel anywhere close to wetting or climaxing in your nappies. However, it is possible that your \"punishment\" is not over just yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Might I have a go at that, my lady?\" Mira Forrester requests.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, me, as well, my lady?\" Sera Durwell says excitedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat is one thing you did not expect. You gulp and wait nervously as Brienne the Beauty thinks on that.</span></div></div>",

Then she scoots closer to the handmaids and, continuing to hold you down, displays your padded behind to them. She tells them \"At your leisure, my dears.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMira and Sera begin repeatedly spanking your diapered bottom. Their blows are almost dainty and delicate compared to Brienne's. Even so, you can feel the force behind them. They are mostly just having fun and playing with you, but they are definitely not going easy on you!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour excitement quickly returns. So does the pressure on your bladder. Both of them gradually rise as these two beautiful girls paddle your padded behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore very long, Lady Catelyn and the queens decide to get involved, too.  The five ladies take turns spanking you in rapid succession. Soon, you hardly even have any time to register who is spanking you at which exact moment. You begin to moan in both mild pain and extreme pleasure. Your libido gradually rises, as does your desire to relieve your bladder. If this keeps up, you will most certainly give in to both urges.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite how caught up you are in this experience, you attempt to struggle against it or escape. Doing so proves to be feeble; Lady Brienne refuses to release you or give you an inch. She just holds you down on her lap as the others assault your padded bottom. There is no denying it; you are completely at the mercy of these six half-naked women. It is as wonderful as it is frightening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother ten minutes later, your bottom is starting to feel a little sore. Furthermore, your control over your bladder is almost totally gone, and your manhood is fully erect, straining painfully against your diapers. You could go off at any moment now.</span></div></div>",

They stop just in time, as you are currently in a very weakened and blissful state. The slightest quiver could set you off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLady Brienne releases you from her grip.  However, before you can get off of her or recover at all, the tall blonde abruptly raises her right hand and brings it down, landing a final, harsh blow on your bottom. This one actually stings a little, and it finally drives you over the edge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately, you cum into the seat of your padding. You collapse onto Lady Brienne's lap as you feel your seed spread through the front of your diaper. You do not know how long the orgasm lasts, but it had to be for at least thirty seconds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMere seconds after the orgasm ends, your diapers starts to become warm and heavy. You quickly realize you've let go of your bladder, as well. But you pay no mind; you are too exhausted to care. Besides, after being in nappies almost every second for the last two months, pissing yourself feels almost natural now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLady Catelyn is the first to notice your accident. She reaches out and softly pats your padded bottom. Although her touch is gentle, you cannot help wincing a little. Your bottom will probably be tender for the next couple days.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good boy,\" the Lady of Winterfell coos, rubbing your wet padding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How wet is he, my lady?\" Sera asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He is absolutely drenched,\" Catelyn Stark replies, causing the other ladies to giggle and you to blush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We were wise not to remove his nappies,\" Mira observes. You are grateful for that. Your padding absorbed the worst of the spankings. Had your diapers been removed beforehand, your bottom would probably be totally numb by now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Indeed,\" Brienne agrees. She turns you over, lightly rubs your diapered crotch, and embraces you warmly. Once again, your face is in her breasts. This time, you make no attempt to caress them. You do not think your posterior could handle another \"punishment\" such as the one you just endured. Besides, your libido is gone for now. So you just lay still and let the tall knight embrace you in a motherly fashion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Brienne releases you from the hug, Margaery turns to the only foreigner there and says \"Talisa, I believe you wished to attend to his nappies the next time he used them?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I did, Margaery,\" the Volantene healer confirms, nodding. \"But I wonder... should I change him now or after we get to the Red Keep?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou personally have no say over when and where you are changed. Secretly, you are hoping Queen Talisa will go ahead and change you now. While you have accepted the concept of entering King's Landing in a diaper, you would prefer to enter the city in a dry diaper. Of course, if Queen Talisa decides to hold off on changing you for a while, there is little you can do about it.</span></div></div>",

Additionally, we already have the supplies required to change him in here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that, Mira and Sera reach under the bench they are sitting on, and they remove a bag of said materials. You have seen this bag - and a few like it - many times over the last eight or nine weeks. Your caretakers seem to have a never-ending supply of cloth diapers, pins, powder, and cream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excellent,\" Queen Talisa states in approval, accepting the bag from the handmaids, \"Then I shall change him right away.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other ladies give you and Talisa some room. She spread her cloak on the floor of the carriage, and she has you lie down on it. She kneels over you, her breasts dangling less than a foot away from your face. If you had not just had an intense orgasm a couple minutes ago, you would probably be getting hard again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyway, Talisa carefully unpins your drenched padding, and she swiftly pulls it out from under you. She deposits it into another bag the handmaids provided. This bag was designated for all your used diapers. Those were washed at least once a week. You wondered just how many nappies you have gone through since this babying treatment began. Since you were changed at least two or three times a day, it had to be well over a hundred.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTalisa proceeds to wipe you clean of stickiness and moisture. As she does this, she takes a moment to admire your muscular frame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough the ladies have been spoiling you, you have been careful to maintain your physique. You are eating and sleeping better than before you arrived at Renly's camp, but you still exercise regularly to avoid getting lazy or fat. There ARE days when you do nothing but lie around for hours on end. Even so, you have lost none of your strength or gained any additional weight in the last sixty days.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce your private area is clean, Talisa begins to apply the powder and cream to your bottom and groin. As she rubs your manhood with the substances, you get a little hard. But only a little, as you are still recovering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gaze up at the healer queen and mutter nervously \"King Robb won't hear of this, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, he won't,\" Queen Talisa assures you. When she lets go of your member, she smirks and adds \"I'm not certain he would want to, either. Between you and him, you're a little bigger.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat produces more laughter from the ladies, accompanied by more blushing from you. Still, you feel strangely proud of yourself. Robb Stark is older, taller, and strongly than you. Yet his own queen admits that you are slightly larger... down there?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTalisa quickly slides a fresh pair of diapers underneath you, pulls the front up between your legs, and pins the sides up on both sides. She pats your new padding, leans forward, and places a gentle kiss on the front of your nappy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat is something the ladies do often when changing you; press their lips against your diapered crotch after you've been changed. That is perhaps your favorite part of the changes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens now?</span></div></div>",

She seems just a little bit younger than you. She has smooth and clear yet slightly pale skin, and long hair that almost goes down to her waist. You note her hair is auburn, just like King Robb Stark and his mother. That gives you an idea as to who she is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA moment later, Lady Catelyn climbs out of the carriage and spreads her arms. The young girl rushes forward and wraps her own arms around the Lady of Winterfell. She begins to weep joyfully, and you hear her mutter \"Mother...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatelyn Stark holds the girl close, tears beginning to spill from her own eyelids. She whispers in relief \"My darling girl... I've missed you so. You need not cry; you're safe now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as you thought, this is Princess Sansa Stark. From what you have heard, she has been a captive of the Lannisters for many months now, ever since her lord father was arrested and executed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou cannot blame her for getting so emotional. After all, to finally be reunited with her family after being surrounded by her family's enemies for so long... it must be overwhelming. In a good way, of course.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and the other five ladies proceed to exit the carriage. Someone - you cannot tell who - pats your diapered bottom through your breeches as you step out. You do not know who it was, but you hear Mira and Sera emerge giggling deviously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobb, Renly, and Catelyn proceed to dispense with the introductions. Sansa shakes hands with Mira and Sera, she salutes Brienne, and she gives Margaery a respectful bow. When she meets Talisa, she embraces her new sister-by-law warmly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, she comes face-to-face with you. You bow your head lightly, and you declare \"I am honored to make acquaintance, milady. My name is Brynden. I have been in your lady mother's care for the last three months.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pleasure to meet you, as well, ser,\" Sansa mutters kindly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Begging your pardon, but I am no 'ser,'\" you inform her, \"I am but a traveler of common birth.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A far too modest one,\" Renly tells Sansa, \"This victory would not have been possible without him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou flush at that praise. \"You give me too much credit, Your Grace.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do not give you enough,\" King Renly insists, \"I should be dead. If I had died that night at Storm's End, my soldiers would have gone over to Stannis or Joffrey, and this alliance with the North would never have come to be. It is because of you that we have gotten this far.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He is right,\" King Robb declares, \"Because of you, Brynden, I have rescued my sister from the Lannisters, my brothers were saved from an Ironborn invasion, and I will soon avenge my father. In some way or other, all of us owe you a debt.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are taken aback. \"I am grateful for the acknowledgment, Your Grace.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've earned it,\" Robb assures you. You hear most of the other people in the area voice their agreement. It makes you feel quaintly proud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon after, everyone decides to turn in for the night. King Robb and King Renly both head to Maegor's Holdfast, taking along Queen Talisa and Ser Loras respectively. Lady Brienne settles down in one of the rooms reserved for Renly's Rainbow Guard. Soon enough, she, Loras, and the other five members of the Rainbow Guard will move up to the Tower of the Kingsguard instead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and everyone else go to the Maidenvault. You assume you'll be sleeping in a room by yourself, but your female companions have other plans.

Is this really happening?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou confirm that it IS in fact happening a moment later, when Mira and Sera lean their upper bodies forward. Thankfully, their heads do not bang together when they stop leaning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMira starts licking the tip of your manhood. She sensually maneuvers her tongue over and around it, causing you to flinch slightly. At the same time, Sera plants gentle, tender kisses along the shaft of your manhood. Her lips are so soft and delicate; each one of her kisses makes you shudder in ecstasy. You soon start to moan again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a couple minutes, they switch their roles. Now Sera is licking and Mira is kissing. They both prove equally capable at performing either task. Soon, you are so overcome with pleasure that you are not able to move your body at all. Your moaning gets progressively louder, though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore long, your cock is feeling quite moist, and not just with their saliva. Pre-cum has started to leak from the top of your manhood. Ever time more than a drop has amassed, one of the girls wipes it away with her lips or tongue. They giggle whenever they do that, and you can vaguely hear them comment on how you taste.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt one point, you are so aroused that you are on the verge of hitting another climax. The girls can tell that an orgasm is impending by the loudness of your moaning and the humping of your crotch. They are in total control of your pleasure and how you receive it, as well as how much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat do the handmaids do?</span></div></div>",

Having been denied your release, you groan, too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, what the queen does next quickly dispels your disappointment. She spreads your legs, moves between them, and settles down in front of your cock, which is still at full mast. Without taking her eyes off your groin, she states \"Tell me, Brynden; have you ever been intimate with a woman before?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point, you are too excited to feel any shame, and you admit \"Alas, I have not, Your Grace. Mira and Sera are perhaps the closest I have come to the deed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe handmaids blush again, but they do not seem embarrassed. Margaery chuckles and sensually declares \"In that case... allow me to assist you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are bewildered. \"What do you mean, Your Grace?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe does not answer verbally. Instead, she gives you a very seductive glare and slides her hands down her chest. She stops at the hem of her nightgown, which she gradually lifts up and over her head. Now she is fully naked in front of you. Her firm breasts, her sensuous curves, her tanned skin, her shaven womanhood... you can see it all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour bewilderment only increases. \"Your Grace... what are you doing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou have an idea, but you do not want to make premature assumptions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMargaery Tyrell just smirks, moves even closer to you, sits up on her knees, and places her hands on either side of you. At this moment, her womanhood is less than a foot from your manhood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMargaery then leans forward and whispers \"Your queen orders you to... fuck her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat is all the coercion you need. You vigorously nod your head in compliance, and Margaery carefully lowers herself onto you. You and she both let out a surprised gasp, but that only lasts a moment. Everything becomes much easier from there. As well as much more pleasurable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMargaery frequently slides up and down your erect manhood, and you thrust up and into her at a steady pace. Overtime, you gradually get faster and faster. The sensation... it is phenomenal. You have often imagined what your first time would be like, but you never would have imagined it would be like THIS. In any case, you never thought a queen would be your first. Even so, it is definitely happening right now. You plunge deeper and deeper into this attractive young woman, exploring every part of her dripping wet cunt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMargaery is the first to hit orgasm. She places her hands on the bed to brace herself. Fortunately, she is not spent yet. She mutters in a shaky voice \"Keep going!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou eagerly obey. You place your hands on her tender buttocks. and pull her down onto you. Her wonderful bosom is now pressed against your toned chest. You kiss her on the lips and mumble slyly \"By your leave, Your Grace.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMargaery wraps her arms around your neck and begins humping against you. You continue thrusting, trying to be a little gentle for now. Once Margaery's libido recovers, however, you resume thrusting at your previous speed. Even Mira and Sera are aroused by this interaction. You momentarily glimpse over at them, and they both appear to have slid a hand beneath their nightgowns in effort to stimulate themselves. All your focus is on Margaery, however.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver the next twenty minutes or so, the Queen has several more orgasms. By then, you are on the verge of hitting your own peak. You are not quite certain what to do about that. Do you dare to actually let go while you are inside the queen? Maybe it would be safer to pull out early.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou decide it is safer to ask. \"Where do you want me to release, Your Grace?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite how immersed in pleasure Margaery is right now, she manages to give you an answer.

As things stand now, though, you are quite unable to do anything of the sort. Instead, you almost involuntarily nod your head and declare \"Yes, Your Grace!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout fifteen seconds later, you experience an intense orgasm. At that very same moment, the queen has her last one, too. You and she both cry out in delight at the same time. Mira and Sera have been touching themselves all the while, and they finally reach their own climaxes. They both remove their hands from under their nightgowns, and you see their hands are soaked in their own juices.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the handmaids wipe their hands clean, Margaery collapses onto your chest. You feel your exhaustion taking over, but you still have enough strength left to pull out of the queen, lift your arms, and wrap them around her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hold her close for the next few minutes, savoring the touch of her skin and the scent of her hair. You feel as though you may actually be falling in love with her. But you think it would be best to keep those feelings to yourself. For now, you simply kiss her on the cheek and whisper \"Thank you for that, Your Grace.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, Brynden,\" she insists in a tired voice, looking into your eyes \"Thank YOU. That was marvelous. It's one pleasure even my husband will never be able to provide.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIs it odd that you are proud to hear her say that? Maybe not. What matters is that the queen is pleased with your \"services.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, Margaery gets up and goes to retrieve her nightgown. As she puts it back on, she tells her handmaids \"Mira, Sera, please put him back in his nappies.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are still recovering from your first time, but you can sense Mira and Sera tending to you. They swiftly wipe your private parts clean of saliva and love juices, and then they pin your diapers back up on you. As they diaper you nice and snug again, they pat your padded crotch gently. To your surprise, being diapered after a love-making session is rather delightful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Margaery is dressed, she announces \"Time to go to bed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, everyone returns to their original positions. You are in the center of the bed, Mira and Sera are on either side of you, and Margaery is on top of you. She sneaks another kiss to your lips, which you do not object to. At this point, you feel as though you would permit ANYTHING she wants to do to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, you cannot overlook the fact that she had you cum inside her. It would be foolish to ignore the possibility that she might become pregnant because of this. You will have to talk about this matter with her soon. Do you mention it now, or will you put it off for a little while?</span></div></div>",

After the deaths of Prince Rhaegar Targaryen and his father, Mad King Aerys, Robert Baratheon had usurped the throne.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a while after the Mad King's death, the realm seemed a better place. However, the people of Westeros soon realized that while Robert Baratheon was an excellent leader of armies, his aptitude as a leader of the people left much to be desired. At least under the Targaryens' rule, there had been stability and security. Or so you had heard, anyway. You were only born a year or two before the rebellion began. Even so, the quality of living in Westeros had gradually gone downhill overtime.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat may be another sign that it would be ideal to move on. After all, what good could come from living in a country with an incompetent king? You feel you would be much better off taking your chances with the Nine Free Cities. Or, if worse came to worst, Slaver's Bay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take ahold of the reins and direct Aerion towards Maidenpool. As he begins galloping in the direction of the coastal city, you tell him softly \"We've had enough of this miserable continent, boy.

After that, you ride to the east in silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeveral days later, you arrive at Pinkmaiden. You have no trouble entering the town or accessing the harbor. To your good fortune, there are several vessels of Essosi design docked there. A number of them are scheduled to depart for the east by the end of the day. You are quite pleased.

Until you can secure a job or a stable income in a foreign land, you'll have to be frugal with your expenses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLess than an hour after you and Aerion board the Qartheen freighter, the vessel pulls out of the harbor, and it sails for its destination.

But since you are not leaving behind anything or anyone important, you will be content if you go a long time without returning to Westeros.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe voyage from Pinkmaiden to Qarth is supposed to take about a fortnight in total. There are no stops or breaks in-between; you will just go straight there. You appreciate the expediency.

One of them has long black hair and tanned skin, and she is clad in a flowing red dress which covers her entire body, save for her head. The other woman is wearing a bare-sleeved dress with a multicolored hexagonal motif. She is also wearing a wooden lacquered mask which conceals her face completely. You cannot even tell the color of her hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInterestingly, neither of them seems intimidated by the mercenaries. However, they DO seem annoyed by the mercenaries' advances. Their attempts to convey their disinterest do not appear to be successful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou know this does not really concern you. However, despite having a rough upbringing, you are not the type of person to turn a blind eye to people in distress. Especially when the victims in question are attractive young women. Being chivalrous has worked to your advantage many times before...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou climb off Aerion, draw your sword, and cautiously approach the mercenaries from behind. Fortunately, they are drunker than you thought; they do not even notice you. You strike each one on the back of his head with the hilt of your sword. Within ten seconds, they are all on the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter taking a moment to verify that they are unconscious, you turn your attention to the women. While they both give off a neutral expression, they seem gladdened by your intervention. Out of concern, you ask them \"Are you alright, my ladies?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am quite well,\" says the woman in red. She is rather stoic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As am I,\" says the masked woman. Also quite stoic. \"Thank you for your mediation, ser.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, thank you very much,\" the woman in red remarks, \"There are not many men who would do what you did.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And for a complete stranger, nonetheless,\" the masked woman adds in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is no bother,\" you assure them, gesturing to the unconscious mercenaries, \"These men were obviously disturbing you, and they were unwilling to listen to reason. I just used what force I deemed necessary to get them to let you alone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman in red lightly smiles. The masked woman is probably smiling, too, but since her mouth is hidden, you have no way of knowing that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Might we know your name?\" the woman in red requests.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Brynden,\" you inform them. You walk over to Aerion, take him by the halter, and declare \"This is my faithful horse, Aerion. We arrived in Qarth just today. We came here from the Seven Kingdoms.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, you have the look of a Westerosi,\" the masked woman remarks. She then steps forward and proclaims \"Now that you have indulged us with your name, allow us to do the same. I am Quaithe of the Shadow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I am Kinvara, servant of R'hllor, the Lord of Light,\" the woman in red states.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are intrigued. These women turn out to be a shadowbinder and a red priestess, and you are on good terms with both of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, one of the mercenaries starts to stir. You warily glimpse down at him, and you declare \"We should probably get out of here before they regain consciousness.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe women have no objection. The three of you proceed to leave the area. Kinvara and Quaithe walk on either side of you, and you lead Aerion by the halter.

These two lovely ladies have told me that someone living here maybe willing to hire me as a bodyguard.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, have they now?\" says Xaro, gazing over at Kinvara and Quaithe, who lightly nod to confirm. The merchant prince shrugs and mutters \"Very well. Come with me. I will take you to her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nXaro Xhoan Daxos escorts you and your two female companions to the residence's guest chambers. You are intrigued to discover there are a lot of Dothraki in that area. Three of them are standing guard outside the door to one particular chamber. They look intimidating and formidable, but they allow you, Kinvara, Quaithe and Xaro to enter the chamber.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere are five other people inside that room. They are crowded around a desk. Two of them are Dothraki girls with the same long dark hair, tanned skin, and almond-shaped eyes. A third is a girl with sandy blond hair, and she seems to be from the Free City of Lys. The fourth one - and only male - is a tall man with a thick bear and thinning hairline. He has the look of someone from the Seven Kingdoms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of them are standing around the desk, and they are either speaking to and tending to the fifth one, who is actually seated at the desk. She is the youngest of the five, and - by far - the most beautiful one. She is a few years older than you, and she is a blonde, with mesmerizing violet eyes. However, she has the lightest shade of blond hair you have ever seen. It is almost white. Not even the Lannisters have such bright hair. In fact, there is only one family you can think of whose members have even brighter hair than that. That is when you wonder; could this girl actually be...?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My queen, Daenerys Targaryen,\" Xaro Xhoan Daxos proclaims in a loud, flamboyant tone, \"I have received three visitors who seek an audience with you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe seated girl turns in the direction of the merchant prince, and she remarks \"I thank you for bringing them to me, Xaro.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dark-skinned man nods and swiftly exits the room. As you suspected, this woman is Daenerys Targaryen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tall bearded man steps forward and asks suspiciously \"What business would you three have with the Mother of Dragons?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have no additional premonitions to share,\" Quaithe admits, \"But I believe my counsel would still be beneficial to her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"R'hllor smiles upon you, Daenerys Targaryen,\" Kinvara declares, \"Dragons are the embodiment of fire, the object of my faith's worship. The Lord of Light has guided me to you, so that I may serve you in his place.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaenerys Targaryen nods at that, and then she turns her gaze towards you. \"What of you, good ser?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am not a 'ser,' Your Grace,\" you confess. You then draw your sword, step forward, place the tip of the blade on the ground, and declare \"Even so, I would like to offer my services, as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your accent...\" Daenerys remarks, \"Are you from the Seven Kingdoms?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Your Grace,\" you confirm, \"Alas, there was nothing for me back there, and the realm is on the verge of collapse. Thus, I elected to leave those lands in search of better opportunity. I wish to give you my sword. If you would have it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does Daenerys do?</span></div></div>",

I wish to speak with this young man alone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that wise, Your Grace?\" asks the bearded knight, whom you've concluded must be Ser Jorah Mormont, the former head of House Mormont of Bear Island.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young blond woman smiles gently and says \"I assure you; everything will be fine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe knight seems reluctant, but he ultimately complies with those orders. He escorts the red priestess, the shadowbinder, and the three handmaids out of the chamber. You find yourself alone with Daenerys Targaryen, the last of her line.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight now, you are still kneeling on the ground with your sword pointed downwards. Daenerys tells you \"Rise, ser.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time, you do not correct her about your status. You just silently stand back up and return your sword to its sheath. Daenerys gestures to a chair on the other side of her desk and beckons you \"Have a seat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou promptly approach the desk and sit down. \"Thank you for seeing me, Your Grace. Forgive me if I am overstepping my bounds by asking this, but does this mean you are accepting my services?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perhaps...\" says Daenerys, \"Before that, I have a few questions, which I would like you to answer fully and honestly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well,\" you remark. You have no intention of lying to this beautiful young woman, especially if there's a good chance she will actually employ you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaenerys then folds her hands together and asks \"Firstly, what is your name?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then realize that while you did identify yourself to Xaro Xhoan Daxos, you quite forgot to give a proper introduction to Daenerys Targaryen. You mentally kick yourself for being so negligent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Brynden, Your Grace,\" you hastily inform her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe nods, and then she asks \"Did you come to Braavos alone?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I brought my horse, Aerion, with me,\" you reply, \"But other than that, I came here with no one else.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe nods again. \"Have your any family back in the Seven Kingdoms?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shake your head and reveal \"Both my parents died before my seventh nameday. I have spent these last ten years traveling around Westeros, doing what I must in order to survive.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe seems a little saddened. \"I understand how you must feel. I've no living family, either.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I am aware,\" you mutter, trying to sound sympathetic, \"I was born shortly after your brother Rhaegar, your father Aerys, and your mother Rhaella died. The whole of Westeros knows of the plight of you and your brother Viserys.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, and Viserys himself died recently,\" Daenerys glumly recalls, \"It was my husband who killed him. Then my husband and my unborn son died not long after.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have my condolences,\" you tell her sincerely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe seems to appreciate that. \"Now that I know more about you, let us discuss the matter of you entering my services. You should know that I am not simply looking for a bodyguard. I am hoping to raise my own army. An army to retake my family's throne.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now would be an ideal time for you to do so,\" you comment, \"Right now, the Seven Kingdoms are in the midst of a civil war.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I have heard,\" says Daenerys, \"My husband, Khal Drogo, commanded forty thousand warriors. I have under a hundred, most of which cannot fight. They are not fit to storm the weakest keep in the Seven Kingdoms. Thus, I will need every sword I can acquire.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then pauses and says \"You would likely be invaluable.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How so, Your Grace?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know nothing of Westeros,\" Daenerys explains, \"I was born there, but immediately after my birth, I sailed east. The only other native of Westeros in my company is Ser Jorah Mormont, and he has not been to the Seven Kingdoms in many years. You, however, came from there how long ago?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Approximately a fortnight,\" you respond.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then if you have truly been all over the Seven Kingdoms as you claim, you must know everything about it in modern times,\" Daenerys debates.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do, Your Grace,\" you insist, \"I can tell you anything you would wish to know about it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaenerys looks pleased. \"Then here is what I propose: if you swear fealty to me and help me reclaim my family's throne, you will be greatly compensated for your troubles and your services. Serve me faithfully, and you will never again have to struggle to find work or survive. How does that sound?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou do not need long to think. You vigorously nod your head and declare \"My sword is yours, Your Grace.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou extend your hand. It may be unorthodox for a commoner to bind a contract with a princess by a handshake, but you feel this type of contract would warrant such a gesture.</span></div></div>",

Ultimately, she gets up from her chair, walks about the desk, and stops in front of you. She gestures for you to lower your arm. After that, she places her hands on both sides of your head, gently pulls your closer, and plants a kiss on your forehead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis gesture surprises you, but the shock is quickly replaced with enjoyment. It is so soft, so tender, so warm. It is precisely the type of affection you have been longing for all your life. You savor this moment, hoping that more like it will soon follow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Daenerys finally pulls away, she smiles and tells you sweetly \u201cThen I welcome you into my service, Brynden of the Seven Kingdoms.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blush a bit, and then you straighten yourself out, stand up, bow your head, and declare \u201cThank you, Your Grace.

Perhaps you would also like some food and a change of clothes, as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I would appreciate that, Your Grace,\" you remark thankfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaenerys then summons her handmaids, and she introduces you and them to each other.

For a moment, it sounded as though you just said I would be sharing a room-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"With me,\" Daenerys interrupts, nodding, \"You heard right. I wish to know everything about the current Seven Kingdoms as soon as possible, and as my most recent and available source, I would like to keep you close to me at all times.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou have to admit that the princess is making a valid argument. However, that hardly seems a big enough reason for you to room with her. You query \"Is that your only reason for having us share a room, Your Grace?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not quite,\" Daenerys tells you, \"As it happens, I have another reason, which I will not reveal to you just yet. I note you seem hesitant with this arrangement, Brynden. Does the thought of sharing my chamber displease you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hastily shake your head and raise your hands. You exclaim \"No, no! Not at all, Your Grace! On the contrary, I am honored by the prospect. But at the same time, I was somewhat dubious. I mean, you've known me for less than half an hour, yet you're willing to sleep in the same room as I. I have never heard of a royal who would do such a thing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaenerys lightly smiles. \"I understand your reservations, but you need not worry on them. Already, I can tell you are not the type of man who would force himself onto a woman. I know that because my husband WAS that type, but I could handle him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou would not ever take advantage of a woman, regardless of how beautiful or vulnerable she may seem. You are glad the young blond woman seems to have faith in your character.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now,\" Daenerys resumes, looking over at her handmaids, \"I would like to make Brynden feel at home. Let us help him get settled. Irri, Jhiqui, draw a bath for him. Doreah, we should find something more appropriate for him to wear.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Khalessi,\" the three older women declare in unison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou would actually appreciate a bath. You have not had one in over a week, and it was more of a scrub than a thorough wash. You wonder what clothes Daenerys has in mind for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe princess then leaves the chamber; Doreah follows her out. At the same time, Irri and Jhiqui gently take your arms and lead you into the next, which turns out to be a fine bathroom. There is a large copper tub in the center. The handmaids proceed to fill it with hot water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the tub is almost entirely full, you prepare to begin to remove your armor and clothes. However, before you can even take off your boots, Irri and Jhiqui approach you. They tell you \"Please leave everything to us, ser.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are bewildered by that implication. You nervously mutter \"I can undress and wash myself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey shake their heads and insist \"This is our duty. The Khalessi orders it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile you are still a little hesitant, Irri and Jhiqui seem quite adamant. Apparently, they will not accept a refusal. So, you state in defeat \"Very well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIrri and Jhiqui speedily get you out of your breastplate, gauntlets, greaves, boots, socks, doublet, tunic, breeches, and smallclothes. Once you are totally naked, they help you into the tub. They soap and rinse your hair and body. They are very thorough; they do not miss any part of you. You are tempted to cover yourself when they get to your lower body, but your resistance is pointless. Despite how vigorous these two handmaids are being, you cannot help but feel a little turned on by this treatment. Thankfully, your manhood does not give away your excitement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you are clean all over, Irri and Jhiqui help you out of the tub, and they towel you off. Once you are dry, you wrap a towel around your waist. You feel quite refreshed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later, Irri and Jhiqui lead you back out into the bedchamber. Daenerys and Doreah have already returned, and they have brought something for you to wear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat have they brought you?</span></div></div>",

You sway your hips in tune with her, intent on finding a good motion together with her. Sighing in content Daenerys turns around and leans forward, pressing her chest against you. Nearly smothering you with her breasts, you tilt your head and start to suck on her left tit. Giving a light moan she rattles about in the bath, finding your shaft and pressing into it despite the water resistance. She keeps a slow and steady movement, to get accustomed to sex in a tub.

You notice Doreah is holding a large bag in her hands. You assume the contents must be your new clothes. \"Now, let's get you into something more comfortable. Lay down on the bed, please.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat confuses you a little. You remark \"Shouldn't I remain standing if I'm going to get dressed?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Normally, yes,\" Daenerys mutters, \"However, the garments we're going to put on you will require lying down instead.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat response just confuses you more. It also takes you by surprise. You assume \"Do you mean to say you wish for your handmaids to dress me, Your Grace?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No,\" Daenerys informs you, \"I mean to dress you myself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow you are completely speechless. You can't even find words anymore. While you are in the midst of your astonishment, Daenerys states \"Irri, Jhiqui.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that, the handmaids take ahold of your arms again, and they bring you over to the bed and have you lie down. They then remove your towel, exposing you. You try to cover yourself, but Irri and Jhiqui pin your arms to your sides. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just relax,\" Daenerys encourages you, \"There is no need to feel embarrassed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe soothing tone of her voice has a calming effect on you. After you settle down, the blond princess and the Lyseni girl approach the bed. You cannot bring yourself to make eye contact with them. You just stare straight up at the ceiling and try to keep calm. You also try not to get too excited. That is not easy; as you are surrounded by four very beautiful women.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile you are struggling not to freak out, Doreah hands Daenerys the bag. The princess kneels in front of you, opens the bag, and removes some items from it. Doreah then takes ahold of your ankles and lifts your legs up. You feel Daenerys slide something under your bottom, and Doreah lowers you onto it. Whatever it is, it is rather thick and soft. Daenerys then brings part of the soft garment up between your legs. While holding the center of it in place on your abdomen, she brings the other parts up around your sides and she fastens them in place. Your entire private area is now encased in something bulky yet comfortable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaenerys happily declares \"There. You can sit up now, Brynden.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIrri and Jhiqui release your arms, and they help you sit up. Once you are composed, you curiously gaze down at your crotch. When you see what Daenerys has dressed you in, your eyes widen in surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe has put you in a diaper. Oddly enough, the diaper seems to fit you perfectly. Almost as though it was meant for you. Or someone with your measurements.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou slowly look up at Daenerys, who is still smiling. You mutter awkwardly \"Your Grace...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is the other reason I wished to share my chamber with you,\" the princess reveals, \"My son died in childbirth, and I was told I may never have another child again. You, meanwhile, have never known a mother's love. Therefore, I wish to care for you as though you were my own babe. This would solve both our problems.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes... it would,\" you state quietly. As strange as this situation may seem, it is also the perfect opportunity to finally experience motherly love. Wearing diapers would be a small price to pay in exchange. In fact, you cannot deny that the diapers themselves are actually somewhat pleasant. In time, you may come to enjoy them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn this subject, is there anything abnormal about your padding?</span></div></div>",

There are no pins holding it in place, it seems to be made of something other than cloth, and it makes a slight rustling sound whenever you move. Nothing like any other nappy you know of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou place your hand on the front of your padding and press down a bit. Sure enough, it is definitely not made of cloth. Upon contact with your hand, the padding rustles some more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What type of nappy is this, Your Grace?\" you inquire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A type that was recently patented by the Qartheen,\" Daenerys informs you, \"They refer to it as a disposable nappy. It is quite different from traditional cloth nappies. Instead of cloth, it is made from cotton and an absorbent substance. That is why it produces that crinkling sound. Also, rather than pins, they use a special adhesive to keep the garment together. The result is what you are currently wearing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fascinating,\" you comment, examining your padding in interest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaenerys then sits beside you on the bed, wraps her arms around your waist, and asks \"How do they feel?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Honestly... quite pleasant,\" you admit, lightly patting your padded crotch, \"I could get accustomed to having them on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am very glad to hear that,\" the blond princess remarks, \"I intend for you to wear them from now on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Even when we're... outside?\" you assume, nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" Daenerys confirms, \"But you need not worry. I'll let you wear other apparel over your nappies whenever we leave this chamber. However, whenever we're inside this chamber, you will not need any other clothing. So, for now, I'll be keeping you in just your nappies.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well, Your Grace,\" you declare. You find that a reasonable arrangement. \"As long as no one other than you or your handmaids sees me like this, I have no objections.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about Kinvara or Quaithe?\" Daenerys mutters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wonder what incited her to bring the red priestess and the shadowbinder up. Despite that, you shrug and declare \"I suppose I wouldn't mind. As long as they do not mention this to any other person.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have my word,\" Daenerys assures you. You smile in relief and appreciation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens now?</span></div></div>",
