He's made his way around, having stayed in wealthy hotels, as well as living in the wooded areas nearby. He's always tried to keep himself hidden from humans, for fear of what they'd do to him, but this doesn't mean he could not, or should not benefit from their spoils.<br>\r\nJames has dark hair, and he wears clothes sewn together from random loose strings he's found during his time in the Big Apple.<br>\r\nJames is incredibly small, smaller than most insects, so it's unsurprising that most human eyes do not see him moving about.<br>\r\nOut of everything James hates about humans, he hates their feet the most. The smell is appalling to him, and due to the nature of his kind, he's unable to pass out, causing him to endure every stinky moment, if he's accidentally caught by one.<br>\r\nLastly, he has a lot of energy, considering his kind doesn't sleep, so it's unsurprising if he travels far distances in a day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis all being said, we now need a setting, so...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere do we start off our story?</span></div></div>",

He lived underground in the middle of the Central Park where he lived most of the time though he does move into several places around New York from time to time. \"I wonder if I could go outside...\" he said as he slowly made his way to the overground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere is he right now?</span></div></div>",

Because of this she sometimes accidentally steps in dog or cat poop instead of mud, but even when it is inside, and not her accidentally stepping in the cat litter she just picks up what's on tne ground, and ignores whats on her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo whose house is it? or is it someone else's house?</span></div></div>",
