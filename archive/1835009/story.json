Eileen only glanced down at the suffering puniness for a moment, but got a rush from seeing ordinary everyday people being bullied, beaten and broken by her big toe, not a speck of toe nail paint scratched. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith hands on her hips, fingers wedged in her beautiful red bikini bottom and a sexy confident stance, the 150 foot fearsome female frowned upon the scene of some of the people on the bridge nearly escaping. OK, PEOPLE SO PUNY, NO ONE GETS OFF THIS BRIDGE, AND....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the brunette bombshell bathed in beauty, the beating sun and bold height, a bevy of helicopters came upon the scene, keeping a respectable distance above the bodacious babe. MMMMM, I SO IMAGINED, SO DREAMED OF CHOPPERS FLOATING ABOVE ME. Before the police could speak on their megaphones, the catastrophe-causing Eileen leaned down, picked up a brand new Mercedes from the bridge, her cute bikini-clad butt showing off in the sun like it had every right to. COME CLOSER AND I SWEAR....WHAT THE FUCK...I'm A GIANT....Eileen tossed the car in the direction of two of the choppers, clipping the blades of both. The car continued it's path in the air, arcing to the ground and crashing with a fiery and resounding crash onto a moving passenger train. MMMM, SO HOT, EILEEN COOD, licking her fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOH, LOOK AT THIS. The two helicopters began to lose control, sputtering, coughing, choking and struggling to remain airborne. MMMMM, THIS IS THE SHIT...PURE GIANT GIRL HEAVEN. Eileen tussled her hair, alleviated a edgy and surveyed allo the people, cars and mayhem at her feet as one chopper slammed into and a building and the other landed on a line of cars, its blade tearing loose, spinning, grinding and slicing through people, cars, telephone poles and ripping a massive hole in the side of the building. OH....MY...GOD....THAT WAS....OH....SOOOO GANGSTER...MMM, Eileen oozed as she caressed her bikini top, her nipples nicely outlined in the smooth redness, the sun casting them in supreme light. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSHIT....OMIGOD! SOO FUN! YOU PEOPLE ROCK! BETWEEN SNACKING ON PEOPLE, CRUSHING CARS, BLOWING BIG KISSES AND NOW THIS! THOSE DEFECTIVE MAC COSMETICS ARE THE SHIT...THEY REALLY DID TURN ME INTO A GIANT. In her wake, some thirty people had been killed and another fifty injured with a toss of car. The commuter train where the car landed had derailed and slammed into an office building. All around the gorgeous and gigantic girl, people, cars, debris, helicopters, and building material was left in a haze of pulverized humanity, smoke billowing, people crying and screaming and sirens wailing<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn urge came over the red bikini-baring brunette as she bathed and pampered her giant self in destruction and death; I SO HAVE TO PEE..</span></div></div>",

And I'll flip on the radio to find out what the fuck is going on with this giant girl business,\" Amber said to her friend Gina as they made their way along the Downtown Expressway. The two ladies sat in the late model Audi, along with hundreds of other cars, simmering in the hot summer sun on the elevated freeway that meandered right through the heart of the city. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll those on the Downtown Expressway, along with thousands upon thousands of others is sit and stare at the jungle of concrete, steel and glass that towered above them as they sat in traffic, hearts pounding with suspense as they tried eagerly to escape the hijinx of a 21-year old giant woman on power trip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get back! Keep moving!\" the police shouted at the throngs of pedestrians, commuters and generally people of all walks of life. \"Here she comes!!!\" Hundreds of people along Haste Street looked up in horror as Eileen, looking marvelous, marvelous in her shiny bikini strolled in their direction. Eileen was in virtual orgasmic suspense when her brown eyes captured the multitudes of the metropolis' citizens running like mice away from her. The giant girl was only two blocks away from Haste Street, crushing cars, stepping on people and poking windows out of buildings. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCataclysmic Eileen stopped at the intersection of Haste and Concord, planting her bare feet dead in the middle of the wide intersection. The stop lights which hung level with her shin, swung to and from, leaving mild imprints on her shiny soft epidermis. Her feet stood upon three cars, having stopped them in motion with a massive SQUASH! CRUNCH! Eileen was bemused and barreled over in glee at the sight of thousands of people quite literally stampeding, clamoring and stomping each other to death. Eileen stared down at some of the piles of people forming like trash, unable to proceed in the hellacious heap of humanity. Feeling all frisky, cocky and downright sexy, Eileen quipped to the populous, THE COMMUTE'S A BITCH I SEE. MMM, THIS SO HOT, Eileen purred as she softly massaged her mildly moist bikini bottom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the moment, OUCH! ... An oncoming car slammed into Eileen's big toe, inflaming what had already been a nasty little sore she had been nursing for a while. It appeared to have been healing after a luxurious bubble bath the night before, but now her big toe was swollen and began oozing a mystifying concoction. DAMN CAR! The 150 ft Eileen reached down and crushed the Toyota Pathfinder with her fist. BOOM! CRUNCH!</span></div></div>",

The 156 had been stopped in its tracks when Eileen stomped in the middle of the intersection and now it's cargo could only hope for the best, gigantic feet and toes only fifty feet from the bus's front tires. \"What the fuck is that giant bitch gonna do next?\" one passenger asked in a whisper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTHAT SMARTS, Eileen moaned, looking down at her big toe. EW, WHAT IS THAT SHIT?!? Eileen marveled as she held her soft hands over her plump moist and red lips. As the giant bent over to grasp a glance at her festering toe, her boobs swayed in her bikini top, cleavage peaking out sexily for the world to see. Far below her pretty bikini-clad chest, Eileen watched as a seeming lava flow of pink fluid began flooding onto the street at her feet. Eileen stepped back, the cars she crushed sticking to her sweaty soles as she lifted her feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pink ooze percolated prettily as it foamed up and gathered ground within the confines of the intersection. Eileen stood high up, looking way down, her hands holding her luscious long locks back from her face. HOW PRETTY. PINK, MY FAVE COLOR. Eileen's mouth gaped as watched the fluid wash over several dead bodies and several cars. The girly pink foam appeared to bubble, hardening as it encased the dead people in a rock hard tomb. EW, HOW AWESOME! Eileen mused, squealing like a girl at Sweet Sixteen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We have to get the fuck outta here!!\" a man cried on the 156 bus, as the pink, and increasingly perfumey potion paved a path in the bus's direction. Slowly, effortlessly, Eileen's sore spot had spawned a monster which began moving along the street. The pink river of foam was now at the door of the bus and was eating away at the tires. \"Fuck this shit! I'm outta here, a large man exclaimed as he bolted for the door. The man barged through the parting doors, and stepped squarely into the feminine pinkness. \"Aaaaa! Help!\" the burly construction worker cried as the pinkness enveloped his body like a wrapper around a candy bar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEEileen stood high above the bus, observing the commotion from the comfort of 150 ft above, her smile wide, lips moist and hair flowing gorgeously. LOOKS THAT LITTLE MAN WAS SCARED STIFF, Eileen comically quipped to the stunned populous. Eileen giggled. AAAHHH, I KNOW, I CAN BE A REAL GAS SOMETIMES. Eileen sucked so cutely on a finger, grinning down at the bus. OR MAYBE THE PUNY MAN WAS FROZEN IN FEAR. Eileen bent over and picked up the stiff remains of the entombed construction worker, examine the death up close. YOU POOR PEOPLE. I WOULD NOT WANT TO BE IN YOUR SHOES, Eileen purred like a sex kitten, loud enough for people to hear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMMMMM, THAT SMELL IS SOO FAMILIAR. OH!, Eileen huffed as her boobs became firmer and she began to blush. OOOOOOO...MMMMM..DELICIOUS. Eileen's nostrils, flared and her mouth moistened. The pinkness painting the street below was now emitting strong pheromones into the air, making Eileen so hot. OH....MMMMM...I SO WANNA GO ON A RAMPAGE....Eileen amorously stared down at the bus</span></div></div>",

As Eyewitness 10 News reported earlier this morning, a giant woman has taken over the city. She is now hovering over a bus filled with commuters, having thrown several cars and downed two helicopters just moments ago. now sources tell me that this 150 giant's name is Eileen Johnson, a 21year old model and rep for MAC Cosmetics. Representatives from MAC tell me that Ms. Johnson was prepping for a swimsuit promotion sponsored by MAC, when the young model at fell ill at the Taj Hotel &amp; Resort here in the center of the city. Witnesses first spotted Ms. Johnson in giant form around 10:01 AM MT time this morning. Karen, back to you in the studio..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you for that on-scene report, Denise. And just moments ago, the mayor has announced that he will offer Eileen Johnson safe refuge, by, believe it or not, having the City Rubber Works build the bikini-clad giant an oversized raft and allowing her to float in the river while authorities evacuate the city. Stay tuned\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n156<br>\r\nEileen's foot sore foam was slowly but surely ensnaring the packed bus, almighty Eileen standing high above, watching the populous flirt with disaster. Eileen rummaged through her red leather purse and located a piece of cinnamon Bublicious Bubble Gum. GIANT GUM, I LOVE IT! The giant popped the sugary soft treat between her red lips, as her attention drew to the bus below. HA HA, the giant girl gaggles, lowering to her knees, the ground shaking as her knees pressed onto the caving asphalt, toes curling behind her, overturning three cars.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe passengers in bus were scare stiff, one woman peeing in her pants as massive long dark locks of girly hair smothered the bus, rendering sun light non existent inside the public bus. A collective gasp reverberated throughout the now-closterphobic interior when enormous brown eyes, lush lashes and pretty face appeared massive before them. KNOCK, KNOCK, Eileen cutely teased as she tapped her twelve foot long fingers on the roof. HAVING FUN? ALL YOU PUNIES LOOK SO CUTE...WATCH....the cute-as-button and bodacious beauty winked as she blew a massive bubble, the pink round flavoricious cinnamon gum formed a bubble the size of an elephant before...POP! The sweet smell filled the air and into the bus, the gum ripping into a large blanket, wrapping the entire bus in pink stickiness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSCRUNCH! ROAR! RIP! The mega girl mangled the roof with her MAC-painted pretty nails as she peeled the metal roof of the bus with the ease of peeling a banana, exposing all the frightened puny people posturing below her big brown eyes. MMMMM...LOOK AT ALL THE PUNY PETS...PEOPLE...PEOPLE...HHHHMMM...WHAT CAN I SAY? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nScreams, cries and desperate attempts to squeeze out of windows ensued. TISS...TISS, Eileen caressed in a sex kitten calm purr. Eileen reached into the bus as though it were a box of McNuggets, lifting one woman high in the air, examining her business suit. YOU ARE SO CUTE. Eileen then slowly placed the tiny against her plump moist lip that featured a round lip ring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman screamed for dear life, flailing as giant lips came closer. EWWwww, Eileen whined. <br>\r\nUGH! THIS PUNY BITCH IS STUCK ON MY LIP RING! Eileen pouted cutely.</span></div></div>",

Thousands of tiny city folk looked up in horror as at the woman scammed, cried and pleaded for rescue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the meantime, Eileen swaggered with all the confidence of a beach babe along the city streets, crushing cars without a care, looking straight ahead, her pretty mind on two things; 1) Going pee pee and poopy and 2) Totally going Godzilla on that overpass meandering between all the buildings, just a few blocks away. With eyes fixed ferociously ahead, her cute ears seemingly deaf the sirens, screams and crunch of cars and popping sound of people under her soft feet, the Downtown Elevated Expressway and hundreds of cars and thousands of people it held were deliciously and delightfully within destruction range.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFEE.....FI.......FO.....FUM....I'M A GIANT GIRL, HERE THE FUCK I COME, Eileen callously called out in a menacing feminine voice. The giant beauty now stood next to the expressway, it's elevated roadway coming up to just above her knees. The bountiful bevy of beauty's eyes widened with thrill at the tableau of cars, people and trucks just at her smooth and shiny legs. MMMMM, OH GOD! HOLY SHIT! THIS IS EXACTLY AS I HAD IMAGINED BEING A GIANT WAS LIKE. Thousands of people starting exiting cars, some motorists heading in reverse, smashing into other cars.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiggling with excitement, Eileen straddled the roadway. HEY, THIS PROBABLY LOOKS LIKE THAT 50 FT WOMAN, Eileen mused, picking up an SUV between her legs. I HATE SUVs, Eileen pronounced, with feigned disgust. Giant ladyfingers tossed the vehicle with three people inside at a tall communications tower on a neighboring building. WELL, COMMUTERS...ITS ABOUT TO GET A LITTLE WET AND STINKY AROUND HERE. Giant Eileen daintily peeled away her tiny tight red bikini bottom, exposing her tat of an evil smily face plastered on her smooth, tight and shiny butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout warning, thousands of gallons of warm yellow rain poured down on the jam packed six lanes of the Downtown Expressway. AAAAAAAAAAaaaaaahhh, the giant Ms. Johnson moaned with eyes closed. The rain poured in buckets, forming rivers on the slightly angled roadway, sweeping people away with reckless abandon in the direction of the City Tunnel, about 100 yards away. The acid level in Eileen's pee began to erode at people's skin, many rendered with third degree burns. People in cars were horrified at their fellow commuters on foot, many looking little like humans, half melted so to speak from the feminine flood. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe panicked drivers were mo better off. Many steered to and fro, their tires invariably unable to grip in the vast moistness, the acidity eating away at rubber and corroding roofs where cars were unfortunately directly under Eileen's cute butt. A large hole opened up in the roadway as Eileen's powder room break seemed to last forever. MMMMMMMM, WHO...I REALLY HAD TO GO! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEileen opened her eyes from the pleasure of relief to the catastrophe she had wrought. Some fifty people lay dead amongst the cars, half deteriorated by the pee, cars virtually piled five high as they attempted to maneuver through an onslaught of giant girl pee. Screams were subdued as whimpers and moans of the dying swept over the roadway between two 75 ft tall sexy girl legs. OH.......MY.....GOD! I AM SO IN LOVE WITH THIS GIANT SHIT! Eileen was beside herself, peeing slightly in her bikini bottom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEileen caught a glimpse of three men helping a woman out of car, their puny size making her laugh...hard. PHMP! FRMP! Eileen blushed. OMIGOD! HONESTLY, I NEVER.....Eileen's worst nightmare...she had farted in public. I HAVE TO POOP! <br>\r\nEileen was partly panicking, partly laughing as she could feel the warm essence of girly gases exiting from the soft, smooth and shiny expanse of teeny weeny bikini.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEileen's face perked to a well lit smile as, still straddling the humanity packed highway between high rise buildings, she focused on the City Tunnel, where people who survived the pee spree were now heading, whether by car or foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI'M POOPED, PUNY PEOPLE, I HAVE TO POWDER MY NOSE AT THAT TUNNEL, pretty Eileen pouted with 150 FT confidence.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The Downtown Expressway was an utter mess, wrought with wrecked and overturned cars, dead and dying people and, the most horrifying and menacing of all, the thousands upon thousands of gallons of pee streaming the downward slope into the City Tunnel. People, cars, lampposts and road signage adrift in giant girl pee, floating helpless as all burned, bruised and battered in the warm, sticky and smelly extract.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWOW! I FEEL SO MUCH BETTER. I SO NEEDED TO PEE! Eileen exclaimed in relief, adjusting her cute tiny bikini bottom. The giant suddenly felt an urge brought by extensive gas pain, the need to purge with a healthy poop took over Eileen's to-do list. SO COOL! Eileen eyed the entrance to the City Tunnel that connected to Downtown Expressway. She peered lower and could see, in addition to a river of people's belongings, like cars, bodies and purses, the bikini'd gargantuan could see hundreds of cars lined up within the cavernous roadway, seemingly safe from the girlish antics of an overgrown and oversized beach girl. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill straddling the Downtown Expressway, Eileen began to position her 75-foot long silky legs for the short trek to the entrance of the City Tunnel. I HAVE TO BE, LIKE, SO CAREFUL, MY SEXY LEGS MIGHT KNOCK OVER THIS CAR-FILLED OVERPASS, Eileen teased as her soft legs rubbed precariously against the guardrails, the roadway shaking and cars moving below her bikini bottom. The giant was now standing over the entrance of the tunnel, four lanes of traffic feeding it's mouth. All the cars, trucks and even people were toy-like as Eileen swung her gorgeous face down to the tunnel, her prettiness rendering the sunlight absent as her long, luxurious and abundant brown hair cascaded and drapes the roadway below. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHI, PEEPS, MY PUNIES. WHERE'S ALL THE PEOPLE GOING?, a voluminous and harrowing female voice thundering through the arced brick and concrete hallowed roadway tube. Eileen's big brown eyes ballooned at the site of thousands of tiny red tail lights facing her direction, cars honking and people trotting in her opposing direction for the entire expanse of the mile-long tunnel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEileen positioned her sexy, lanky and smooth body so that her cute butt was facing the tunnel. Using the lovely, well-manicured, soft and sensationally sexy fingers, now 12feet long, that god gave her, colossal Eileen daintily peeled back the smooth red bikini bottom, exposing her evil-face butt tat to the world again. Her shiny smooth ass cheeks were a work of art, the thin vail of glowing sweat made them shine, reflecting the chaos of the city.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEileen girlishly lowered her butt, curving her back and hips so sexily, her ass cheeks cupping the tunnel entrance, the giant woman hovering inches over cars, dead people and all the sticky residue of giant girl pee. MMMMM, Eileen moaned in relied as she farted peacefully, an even graceful flow of warm air piercing her butt, the pungent aroma invading the encased roadway of the City Tunnel. The exhaust fans in the tunnel's ventilation system could not keep up with Eileen. The girly gas overwhelmed people closest to Eileen's behemoth butt, rendering many unconscious, others vomiting. The air temperature rose ten degrees to above 100 degrees Fahrenheit, exasperating an already balmy day. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAAAAHHHHhhh, THAT FEELS SO GOOD! NOTHING LIKE LETTING ONE RIP. Eileen was all smiles as poop began to squeeze through her cheeks, two boulder-size pooh planting at the entrance of the City Tunnel, a third mounting on top of the others, ending any escape for the thousands of people entombed, blocked from any form of escape,lest they shovel through a 20 Ft tall pile of giant girl poop. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEileen started giggling as she uprooted a tree from the sidewalk at her feet, below the Downtown Expressway. The giant clasped the 30 Ft spruce in her delicate fingers, positioning the greenery between her legs as she diligently cleaned her privates. AAAAAh, Eileen coo'd as cleanliness filled her backside. HMMMM...SOMETHING'S MISSING. Eileen studied the tiny landscape at her pretty painted toes, her red toe nails basking in a sea of smashed cars, overturned lampposts, shattered glass, blood and guts. OH! WELL HELLO! JUST WHAT A GIRL WANTS TO FRESHEN UP AND POWDER.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEileen punctured the fire hydrant with her cute toes, thousands of gallons of water spewing from the sidewalk where earlier her feet had crated the concrete, several pulverized people and wrecked car flat as pancakes within her feminine FEE FI FO giant footprints. Eileen moved her giant legs over the Downtown Expressway, squatted all girl like and let the city water cleanse, refresh and powder the powerful, sassy, smart and honest to goodness Goddess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Eileen washed up, taking in the pungent aroma of a bathroom break, she marveled at the site of her poop piled high, pushing against the tunnel entrance, hearing the pandemonium of pathetic puny people panicking, prancing and pushing each other to get away from her stinky messy mound. Giggling with girlish abandon, Eileen mused, OH POOP! YOU POOR PEOPLE. YOU SHOULD KNOW EVEN GIANT GIRLS HAVE TO POWDER.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Eileen luxuriated her bare bottom on the fire hydrant, a bevy of helicopters appeared above her, much higher in the sky than the last time she blew the whirlybirds a kiss. MMMMM, MORE PEOPLE TO FUCK WITH, Eileen confessed, staring at the pink puss oozing from out of her big toe, the movement of the woman caught on her lip ring making her whet her lip. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ms. Johnson, we have come in peace. How would you like to be pampered this morning?\" a calm voice echoed from one chopper. Eileen was intrigued, holding back on her air kisses.</span></div></div>",

The late morning sun was intense, beaming boldly on the giant brunette, slowly and gorgeously transforming the girl into a Golden-skinned Goddess, a 150 foot swimsuit beauty and all-around envy of every girl and woman in the world. It was great to be Kate!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEileen stepped over a pile of cars wrecked at the intersection of Grand &amp; Junction.  People lost control of the vehicles while distracted watching Eileen pee on the overpass.  Further, the erotic smell of Eileen's oozing foot puss overpowered people's motor skills, sex drive and ability to operate a car.  \"Read the billboard!\" a loud voice gurgled from above.  Eileen primped her hair and lifted her foot off a car and several people as her pretty brown eyes scanned the sky above her.  Eileen spotted a police chopper just above her, close enough for her to swat out of the sky.  WHAT FUCKING BILLBOARD?! Eileen demanded, with a girlish pout, rolling her painted big toe over several screaming injured people beneath her, snuffing out their cries for help.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ms. Johnson, please read the message on the electronic billboard to your right, level with your bikini top,\" the man in the police chopper requested nervously.  THAT ONE? Kate boomed, pointing cutely.  Kate stomped on several cars and kicked a tree and a mailbox as she sauntered over to the sidewalk, standing up close to the two-story sign, choosing to read the message aloud as she posed sexily next to the office building, OK, PEEPS, WHAT THE FUCK GIVES? IF THIS IS A TRICK, I'M GONNA START THROWING CARS...  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKate, hands on her waist, stood back and read the scrawling electronic message to the herself and the city.  DEAR KATE, PLEASE ACCEPT, ON BEHALF OF THE MAYOR AND THE CITY, AN INVITATION TO LOUNGE AND RELAX IN THE DOWNTOWN RIVER.  WE HAVE ACCOMMODATIONS, INCLUDING A LARGE POOL RAFT, COCKTAILS, SNACKS AND ENTERTAINMENT SO YOU CAN PAMPER AND INDULGE WHILE AUTHORITIES HELP PEOPLE GET HOME....<br>\r\nKate smiled with anticipation.  She had not floated on a raft in so long and the mere thought made her feel so at ease and contented.  MMMM, OK. BUT IF THIS IS A TRAP, I'M GONNA GO SO APE-SHIT AND EAT ALL THE PEOPLE IN THE WHOLE CITY. Kate couldn't help laughing when police replied, \"Yes, ma'am. Please follow the helicopter to the river.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEYE FOR DESTRUCTION<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKate stepped forward as the police chopper, several news choppers,and even several Army tanks joined the feminine parade.  Kate could feel the rumble of the tanks' vibrations against her feet and toes as she noticed them in front and behind her.  Also, police cars and ambulances trailed the beautiful giant, painted red toe nails dauntingly close the vehicular escort.  On occasion, Kate's footprints caused the police cars to get stuck; or worse, her foot puss eroded the vehicles and burned the policemen alive. A trail of pink toe puss lay behind her; its sexy aroma arousing even the most fearful of citizens.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOUCHY! Kate yelped like a little girl who scraped a finger on the playground. Kate was sexily strolling in the direction of the river, her shiny red bikini glowing gorgeously when Kate swung her hand into a building, nipping her cute pinky on an electrical circuit. FUCK!  Kate exclaimed, stomping her foot in the roadway and causing a crater to open up. Several cars and people were swallowed up.  Kate licked her pinky in a pain-induced attempt to soothe her injury.  Momentarily furious, Kate stared down at the tiny girly escort, eying some ten tanks, twenty police cars and an endless line of cops, city officials and gawking pedestrians.  STOP, PEOPLE! Kate ordered down to the toy- sized cavalcade  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe scene fell silent as Kate sucked on her pinky, saliva assuaging the pain as her spit enveloped her smallest finger, making the air smell a little musky.  HONK! HONK! A rattling fire engine's horn broke the calm as Kate startled.  Kate was pissed, her big beautiful brown eyes honing in on the offending fire truck from Ladder Company No. 34.  Then, without warning a bright, pretty and massive pink ray of energy was emitted from between the gorgeous giant's lush lashes, one ray from each eye converging into a single laser beam that collided with the fire engine truck, causing it to explode; fire, debris and people were tossed into the air with the force of a large bomb.  The fire house was rocked to it's core, collapsing instantly, trapping countless people.  A deep crater was formed that swallowed more people, cars, and other streetscape.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ground shook for almost thirty seconds as the giant Kate sustained but a few dust marks, nicks and scratches on her perfectly painted toe nails as she watched with amusement, the world at her feet go to shit.  People ran around at her toes, half burnt, cars overturned and alarms ringing a commotion while Kate adjusted her bikini bottom from a creeping wedgy, letting out a small fart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n AAAAAhhhhh,MMMMMMM, I SO LOVE BEING A GIANT. LET ME 'SEE' WHAT ELSE I CAN DESTROY.          <br>\r\n<br>\r\nprishapal<br>\r\nTrusted User<br>\r\n <br>\r\nPosts: 277<br>\r\nJoined: Mon Nov 03, 2008 6:08 pm<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The city street near the fire house was a war zone look-alike; burnt craters pockmarked the sidewalk and roads, burned bodies lay lifeless on concrete, as flaming cars sat unattended amid the cries, screams and running people.  A crowd gathered around a gruesome sight;  Eileen's pink eye lasers had burned and subsequently tossed several people high into the air, their toasted bodies now smoldering among several trees in a nearby park. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBOOM!......BOOM!  Cars began skidding and colliding as Eileen approached with a sexily menacing stride toward the River Highway on he way to float on the raft.  \"Holy Shit!\", John exclaimed as he veered his car into oncoming traffic, the full magnitude of Eileen's enormous bikini-clad giant form appearing in his windshield.  John's car impacted head-on with a garbage truck, resulting in a chain-reaction traffic accident, ensnaring some 50 cars and trucks.  20 people were killed instantly and traffic out of the city was halted.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEileen tipped toed cutely up to the River Highway like a cute little girl, her breasts sexily bobbing in her glowing red bikini, marijuana plant-shaped belly button ring glaring in the sun.  Eileen pulled back her long brown hair and stared down at the vehicular mess, one hand grasping her leather purse at her side, level with her bikini bottom. OOPSY!  Eileen teased with hand mischievously over lips CLEAN UP IN AISLE TWO.  Far below the behemoth beauty were scores of people screaming, crying and scampering away from the giant. SHIT!  YOU PEOPLE LOK LIKE SCATTERING ANTS FROM WAY UP HERE.  DON'T YOU WISH YOU WERE GIANTS? Eileen inquired as she eyed a bloody mess of people shuffling out of a bus.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEileen was inflamed with power as she studied the toy-sized cars and trucks, many crushed in the wreck with people trapped inside.  Eileen marveled more as she rolled her toes amid the traffic, overturning cars and crushing others.  As she fondled the phenomenal mayhem at her feet, Eileen spotted the luxurious and inviting pool raft waiting for her. MMMM, HEY PEEPS, Eileen purred to the scampering commuters on the River Highway.  ANYONE CARE TO JOIN ME FOR A SWIM?  Eileen giggled as she picked up two cars with people in them, eyeing them closely, her hair strands blowing inside he vehicles. SO...SOOOOO.....PUNY.....MMMMMM.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEileen threw the cars into the river as she placed her feet onto the highway, intentionally stepping on the area with the most concentration of people and cars, her feet leaving sexy prints, deep impressions layered in sweat and entombing flattened cars and lifeless crushed bodies.  CRrrrUNCH!!! Never sounded so horrifying and loud in the history of civilization.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEileen stepped into the river water bordering the highway like she would a backyard pool. The water's luxuriously warm silkiness was level with just below her belly button.  AAAAAAAAHHHHHhhhh....MMMMM, Eileen moaned.  The River Highway, with it's miles-long line of cars rested no more than ten yards from her bikini top.  Now pampered and bathing in the river, water caressing her tired feet, legs and stomach, Eileen rolled her eyes in pleasure as she surveyed, studied and enjoyed the mayhem, chaos amongst the jumble of people, cars, trucks and rescue vehicles so close to her in the water. THESE CARS ARE LIKE BATH TOYS....HOW CUTE!  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStudying a long line of cars where people were running between, Eileen focused her big pretty brown eyes and released another energy beam, the pretty light display emitting seismic forces that cut most of the cars in half, exploding others and tossing people like popcorn high in the air.  The tremors created ripples in the river water, that only further pampered the gargantuan girl.  MMMMM, Eileen purred as water rippled righteously against her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWatching cars burn, the roadway crumble, and several lampposts fall on people along the highway, Eileen moaned with satisfaction, THAT EXPLOSION WAS  ORGASMIC!!!! MMMMMMM....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEileen turned her toned, sexy body toward the awaiting luxury raft; it would be a matinee of destruction from the best seat in the city.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The bright gold rubber/plastic raft sat in the river, a floating bed fit literally for a queen. The inflatable water craft was 150 feet wide and over 200 feet long. The Patel Plastic Company went all out on the float, inspired with a motto of \"Pimp My Pool Raft\". The company used double lining plastics and rubber and glossed the sleeping surface with a combination of silk and leather. The attached pillow was rubber but it was lined with goose down and silk. Each side of the raft had holes where the giant could hold drinks and waterproof pockets large enough for Eileen to store her purse. There was even a tin cigarette bin and built-in stereo speakers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe glowing giant gal almost galloped through the river water, stopping once to dip her head under the water. A loud, AAAAAAAAhhh was heard throughout the city as Eileen bathed in the refreshment. Eileen carefully climbed on the raft, the vessel's surface groaning and grumping as pretty fingers clawed for a grip, lanky and silly legs thrusting the stunner onto the watercraft. Eileen placed her ours at her side, primping her bikini, adjusting her hair as lay in a lounging position, her head high up on the raft's pillow, arms folded onto her muscular stomach which glowed in a golden hue in the 1PM blistering sun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sunbathing bad girl rummaged through her purse, locating a full bottle of sun lotion, the container the size of an oil truck. Eileen surveyed the cityscape, her raft sitting large in the river, which was wide to necessitate a commuter ferry service. Countless office buildings, condos, city streets, bridges were within spitting distance of the gargantuan. A large rumble caught the attention of Eileen who was stroking the vast landscape of her sexy skin, soothing in rich and luscious sun protection, it's cocoanut aroma giving the city a beach day essence. The large rumble was a commuter train barreling over the City River Bridge, only 100 yards from the basking beauty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNEXT TRAIN'S SO TOAST, Eileen purred to herself as the raft bobbed up and down in the river, the occasional wave soaking the giant's limbs, the girl feeling especially pampered when water creeped between her ass cheeks. Eileen crossed her legs, sucking on a finger as she girlishly watched the mayhem on the highway. She was particularly struck by two helicopters attempting to airlift several people to the hospital. Three fire trucks, and count police cars lined the highway that Eileen had decimated. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUH..OOOOOHHH.....MMMMMMM.......THIS GONNA BE SOOOO HOT, Eileen moaned as she sucked on a finger, her mind relishing the perspective of so many toys on the highway. Eileen sexily crossed her legs, primped her hair and stared like a sex kitten back at the River Highway. Without warning, Eileen released another wicked wink, her eyelashes batting, letting loose pink rays that attacked the highway. Eileen was in near orgasmic state with power, laying back on the raft as the beam broiled people, cars, signs and even helicopters for some 20 seconds. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen it stopped; Eileen was in rapture, her mind blown by what she did. The five helicopters she toasted blew up one at a time, like fireworks in tandem. She gyrated in joy as her eyes melted five police cars, the cops inside completely cooked. Eileen was mesmerized, so stoked that she rifled through her purse to toke on her now 15 foot long marijuana joint. Using her pink eye laser (on low beams, of course), the destructive diva lit up, violating so many city laws and ordinances.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGOD, PEOPLE, THAT WAS BETTER THAN ANY SEX I EVER HAD, Eileen clamored as she took a puff. MMMMMMM, THIS IS SO DELICIOUS, NAUGHTY AND PERFECT! Holding the relaxing joint at her side, Eileen laid back in her raft, luxuriating in a combination of reefer, luxury raft and the power of being a 150-foot babe. AAhhhh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEileen closed her eyes, letting the gentle waves pamper, caress and baby her senses. This moment was nothing like all those giantess fans on Facebook obsessed about. This was an experience that had to indulged, lived to its ultimate potential. As waves rocked and lightly soaked Eileen's cataclysmic girly biddy and soul, that obnoxious rumble again was stirring. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEileen smiled even before her eyes opened, her sexy fingers placing the smoking joint between her lips. CHOO...CHOO! Eileen giggled as she sat up in her water and sun lotion soaked golden raft. CHOO...CHOO! YOU PEOPLE ARE SOOOO.....The long passenger train was now in sight, a few yards away from crossing the River Bridge. YOU POOR PEOPLE. Eileen puffed on her joint and laid a massive pink Ray smack at the bridge. instantly steel beams buckled, bent and melted, turning to liquid. The oncoming train's crew never planned for a bikini-wearing behemoth bitch to spoil their commute, but Eileen was a giant girl on a mission. The train met head on with melted tracks and the engine dove off the broken bridge, barreling in to the water with a rush of force, sinking quickly to the bottom of the 70 foot river. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first three passenger cars, carrying some 100 passengers met the same fate as the engine car as the joint-wielding Eileen casually basked in the sun, feasting her pretty brown eyes on the destruction in progress. One passenger car dangled over the broken bridge, as the passengers clamored for safety. Five other passenger cars sat helpless on the tracks, some 300 people in peril in the midsts of a sunbathing beauty in a bikini with the ability to simply do what a playful girl wanted to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBRAVO! ....BRAVO! Eileen laughed in the direction of the disastrous train wreck, the worst in the country's history. The bedeviling beauty clapped her hands in the air as she savored a toke of her joint. The raft bobbed to and fro and made grinding noises as Eileen's seemed dance in glee of the enormous human toll she caused. Eileen placed a cupped hand to her ear, giggling as she listened for the obligatory cites for help; sadistically, Eileen teased, I CAN'T HEAR YOU.....OH POOPY DO I HAVE To COME OVER THERE AND EAT SOME PEOPLE FOR FULL EFFECT? More giant girl giggles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEileen watched as the front most passenger car teetered on edge, not he verge of dropping it's human cargo in the river....LET ME BLOW YOU KISS.....<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">Eileen Stood high above the Main Street Bridge in the heart if downtown. The hot summer sun baked the pretty giants skin in a warm glow, her red bikini shining bright, soaking just a tad from a slight coat pof sweat on her soft skin. Below her gorgeous face, tight stomach, cute belly button and just above her knees, lay the elevated expanse of the traffic packed bridge. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHI, PEEPS. I SO WANTED TO BE A GIANT, the lovely 21-year she old gargantuan girl gleaned down to the chaotic scene on the bridge. Eileen gingerly sucked on her painted pretty finger nails, soaking them in her saliva, as she amused her oversized playfulness with the frightful sight of people leaving cars some and crushing each other to escape. The pretty giant prankster puckered her red painted lips and blew a sultry kiss down to the bridge. MMMM, KISSES PEOPLE, Eileen delighted as the warm feminine wind caused people to fall down. Eileen laughed so cutely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen slowly, menacingly, Eileen reached down with her hand, her fingers spreading out like a giant spider, descending on the more than 100 people scurrying, crushing and pushing each other to avoid the grasp of the giant lady fingers. It was too late. The overwhelming and daunting digits pressed against the bridge's roadway, the touchdown so heavy, Eileen could make out her fingerprints in the asphalt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSCRUNCH! SQUIRT! Eileen's pretty fingers squished two panicked people whose cars Eileen was now flipping over for the he'll of it. I LOVE DESTRUCTION, Eileen purred. Eileen picked up another car and threw it at nearby building. It crashed crashed threw a large window on the fifth floor and killed several people watching the mega sized mayhem.</td>",
