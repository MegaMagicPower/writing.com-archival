The smell of warm pine and brief-blooming wildflowers wafted through the woods on the last warm day of summer. Birds chirped delighted chatter, lit by the rays of afternoon sun that filtered through the forest canopy above.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they approached the water, Mark gave a grin and tore off his shirt. He ran down the trail to the edge of the water, just next to the falls. Jenny and Samantha watched as Mark tore off his shoes and socks, then launched himself into the churning water. He disappeared, then his head bobbed up, still showing his goofy grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny and Samantha looked at one another and shrugged. They ran to the edge of the water, slipped off their shoes and jumped in as well. The water's glacier-fed coolness numbed the Autumn heat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark gave Jenny a splash. Then, Samantha. The girls shrieked and giggled before returning fire. The battle became fierce, but Mark finally succumbed, the sloshes and splatters of two beating one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they all laughed in enjoyment of their effervescent game, Samantha looked toward the roar of the water and noticed something behind its white veil. Something colorful. She swam toward the falls as the others moved toward shore to lounge at the water's edge and have lunch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamantha passed under the sheet of water, its hammering weight pounding on shoulders and back like an overenthusiastic masseuse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were three orbs that glowed, like spherical house lamps with holiday LED bulbs inside. One was blue, one was green, and one was yellow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe reached out and touched the green one, her slender finger pressing it's iridescent surface. She could feel a faint hum inside, the hum grew stronger. She attempted to remove her finger, but she couldn't! It was glued to the orb. The buzzing intensified, until it seemed to vibrate every cell of her entire body, as if she were standing in front of a bank of speakers at a summer rock concert.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust when the feeling was becoming unbearable, the orb disappeared. Samantha felt something enter her mind. An idea that wasn't her own. The sensation was strange. She knew what she needed to do somehow. She needed to choose. She focused her mind on what she wanted to look like, what she always imagined herself in her wildest fantasies. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA strange tingling spread through her body, and she shuddered. What was going on now?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFree from the hold of the green orb, she backed out through the waterfall again and headed to shore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny and Mark turned to her as she emerged from the water's white, thundering veil.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe face they saw was transforming, eyebrows thinning and rising, eyes growing large and luminous, cheekbones shifting to elegant prominence. Her lips plumped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer body began to rise out of the water as she moved toward the others. Her breasts swelled to luscious fullness under her tank, dripping water from under voluptuous curves. Her wet top was plastered against developing abs, their vertical ridges forming lines in the fabric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer hips grew wider, more dynamic, exaggerating her feminine gait as she walked in the water. Each step came on longer legs, their nubile shapes growing sleeker, sexier, water flowed down their toned, tanned length.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny watched her friends' eyes widen in shock as they started at her body. She looked down to see full breasts obscuring her view in a way they never had before. Her head snapped back up, then looked down again to examine the rest of her changes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer body was the one she had imagined, full and firm and all kinds of sexy. Surprise gave way to happiness as joy erupted from her... <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The light green sheen caressing his friend's body pulsed a final moment before melting into Samantha's skin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I touch?\" Jenny grew wide-eyed at the transformation standing before her. \"Is it real? How?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That did it,\" Samantha's supple turn showed off every curve of a perfect athlete's well-toned healthy body. Her voice had lost the faint leftover cough of the last few days. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark followed her long tapering finger pointed at the waterfall. \"The Garden of Youth?\"  He went into a swimmer's dive, slim body sinking without a splash. A moment later he floated on his back near the bubbling waves of the waterfall. He paddled in slow motion waiting for something to happen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny moved close enough to Samantha to grasp her head between both hands and stare into her eyes. Strange flecks of emerald green danced and flickered where once dull gray had been.  \"What got into you? Some magic pill from the college research lab you've been working at?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamantha shook her luxuriant length of silky hair, \"No. It was the strangest thing. There was a green ball shaped thing behind the waterfall. It called to me and this happened when I reached up and grasped it. I think it is inside of me now. Something is. I don't feel like I am living in my own body.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two girls hugged, eyes never leaving each other. \"At least your personality is the same. It didn't take you over body, mind, and soul.\"  Jenny said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey. It's not working. What did you do?\" Mark pulled himself up out of the water.  \"We can make ourselves rich. Show me.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop being stupid.\"  Samantha didn't want to be turned into a freak show. One push and Mark found himself failing, unbalanced with arms out wide, falling backward into the pool.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are beautiful,\" Jenny sighed. \"I've never seen anyone so attractive. The sound of your voice, every movement. I can't believe the change happened so fast.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamantha stood like a living Greek goddess statue, \"Look. There's more orbs, different colored ones, where the first one was. We'll get to the bottom of this yet.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe dove, swimming like a fish streaking toward the waterfall mist. Jenny hesitated, watched Mark summersault into a diver's turn and churn up waves following after his friend. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We don't know what we are doing. We should tell someone,\" Jennifer couldn't leave her friends to their fate without joining them. She bit her lip, steeled up her shoulders and plunged feet first sinking below the water to swim towards Samantha and Mark. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA soft rainbow haze blossomed over the mist when Jenny rose up to greet them. \"Samantha? You touched the green one, right?\"  Mark leaned on her shoulder to reach up where one floated in space behind the waterfall.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

A flash and arc of static electricity seemed to short circuit the changes going on in Mark. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let go,\" he demanded, pushing himself away. His aura turned dark green clothing him in mist. The vague shape of the changes speeded up once more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He looks like Michaelangelo's David. I didn't know Mark had an artistic side to him,\" Samantha was enthralled. \"Take those wet things off. I want to see all of you.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark was already shrugging out of his ill-fitting duds. \"Look all you want, just don't touch.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis sculpted body looked like the other bookend of Samantha's. They both flushed looking at each other up and down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Quit it. I can feel the heat coming off your bodies.

As she thought, the look on her face went from one of concern to one of resolution.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe moved to all three orbs. She touched the green one with her left hand, the blue one with her right hand, and lifted her right shoulder upward to touch the yellow one. The vibrating was incredibly intense, as three sets of massive changes occurred to her small body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamantha watched as Jenny's body began to transform, looking a lot like her own. Except that Jenny's seemed to be getting fitter, stronger in addition to more beautiful. Striations appeared over arbs, legs, and abs as her back arched and body tensed. She shuddered and quivered as power built inside her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny cried out as all of the changes hit her at once. The orbs released her, and she fell back under the waterfall, convulsing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as Mark began to move toward where she had submerged, she rose under the heavy sheets of water. She barely felt the weight pounding down on her shoulders and head. It didn't feel any heavier that rain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark watched with interest, his carved muscle tensing as he watched Jenny's new superfit, supermodel proportions emerge from the water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Mark? Are you, O.K.?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry.\" Jenny let go like she'd grabbed someone's freshly mangled flesh from a meat grinder. The purple and red bruise pulsing lively on Mark's hand was shocking. \"I don't know what happened. Yes, I do. It was that.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamantha came up to look more closely. Mark leaned over to plunge his throbbing fingers down into the cool water. \"Don't ever ask me to arm wrestle with you. I'd lose the use of one whole side of my body.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jenny, I thought you were a goner. Now we know what two of the orbs do. Super-strength and transforming our bodies into whatever we most want them to become. What's the third?\" Samantha stepped away from Jenny in wonder, imagining all manner of impossible things. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look at you. All three of us could be a god or goddesses we seem so perfect,\" Mark held his numb hand with his normally colored one. \"We don't have the clothes to match. None of what we wore would fit us now. Not that I mind, looking at you two babes.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Someone's coming. It is more than one.\"  Jenny lifted her head up, her ears scanning around the waterfall forested enclave like radar. \"The strength of my hearing has improved. I can switch it on and off. This is amazing.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom the rocky path leading down to the pool, a half-dozen grizzled figures of men grew larger as they came into view. Shouts of drunken laughter came with them. The first stopped to throw a beer can up in the air, spilling brew into the sky. A rifle shot made it spin up higher before it tumbled into the pristine water. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, you are going to pick that up, right? We leave it cleaner than when we came. Us nature lovers never leave trash.\"  Mark moved a step towards the men, winced as his injured hand brushed his side, and paused. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look at those two half-naked babes, man,\"  the gun-wielding figure pointed the rifle at them. He stood unsteadily weaving back and forth gaping with drool dripping from his mouth.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Party time,\" leered another drawing a hunting blade from his side. \"Me first.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny flexed her new body, feeling the ease with which it responded. If she could entice the party close enough, it might become a real surprise party for the intruders. \"Ready, you two? Might not have super-strength like I do, but with your new perfect bodies, they'll be no match.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamantha nodded, licked her lips, beckoned the lecherous fools on. Her body shone in the mid-day sun straight out of a Sports-Illustrated swimsuit issue. The leader pushed forward. \"Spread out, guys. There's enough for all of us.\" </span></div></div>",

One quick strike to the first guy's Adam's Apple was all it took to immediately incapacitate him while a follow-up punch knocked Number Two off the shore and straight into the water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWatching Mark quickly dispatch of his assailants filled Samantha with even more confidence then she had since winning the magical genetic lottery.  Making full use of her new shapely, sexy legs, Samantha cut loose with a stern kick to the groin of one of her attackers, making him fall to his knees and nearly pass out.  As the second man drunkenly rushed her, Samantha pirouetted on those same amazing legs, deftly avoiding the man's grasp as he sailed past her and over the bank to splash harmlessly in the pool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny beamed with excitement watching her two friends handle themselves so easily without the aid of the superhuman strength she now possessed.  The two remaining men, including the one that had brandished the knife, looked at each other with uncertainty, confused at how these young kids so easily bested their friends.  More confusing still was that even after pulling out his hunting knife, Moses couldn't understand how this incredibly hot girl didn't even look scared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoistening her lips, Jenny stared and smiled at the man like an apex predator, waiting for him to make the first move.  It didn't take long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout warning, the man lunged forward slashing with his 8\" blade when he suddenly felt his arm stop in mid-air.  Looking up, his eyes turned white as he saw the young supermodel holding his wrist in her small hand.  Mo pulled with all his strength but was not able to free his arm from her superhuman grip.  Hell, he couldn't even budge her hand one inch, despite pushing and pulling with all his strength.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny maintained her wry smile and remained silent, but on the inside, she felt like screaming in ecstasy.  She marveled at how easy it was to hold this man who had to weigh at least 100 pounds more than her at bay with one hand.  And it was so freakin' easy!  While the man may have been using his full strength, Jenny felt like she wasn't even trying.  \"God, how strong am I?\" she queried to herself, then remembering how she inadvertently hurt Mark by grabbing his hand.  Jenny's Mona Lisa smile suddenly morphed into an evil grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Strong enough to do THIS!\" Jenny mumbled as the young supergirl clenched her fist tightly, her fingers snapping his wrist like dried kindling.  As the man howled in pain, Jenny ignored his pleas to stop and pressed on -- literally.  Within seconds, the burly man's radius and ulna transformed into a mass of broken bone fragments swirling in a sea of torn cartilage and tendons.  Releasing his mangled arm, Jenny flashed one hand forward and hoisted all 250 lbs of him over her head as easily as changing a light bulb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny's smile took on the appearance of a Cheshire cat now, as she held the man aloft with one hand and placed one hand theatrically on her hip.  She felt like a superheroine!  Looking over at her friends' wide-eyed expressions only reinforced her superhuman confidence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jenny, oh my God!  You're amaz ---\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark's sentence was cut short by the sharp crackle of gun fire.  Instantly, Jenny instinctively reached for where she felt the bullet strike her abdomen, and in the process, dropped the portly hunter to the ground with a thud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jenny!\" Samantha cried out as she watched her friend clutch her stomach and then looked over to see the last man nervously holding a smoking, discharged rifle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Jenny's fingers traced expeditiously over her sexy abdomen, she was somewhat puzzled.  No hole.  No blood.  Hell, now that she thought about it, it didn't even hurt!  Looking down to confirm her assessment, all Jenny saw was the same perfectly toned tummy that the green orb had given her.  Still trying to process what just happened, Jenny suddenly caught a glimpse of a clue.  Bending down with unfathomable grace, Jenny picked up a small deformed bullet slug and examined it in her fingers, her jaw dropping at her logical conclusion:  she was bulletproof!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly spinning on her heels, Jenny demeanor turned as she slowly strided towards the man holding the rifle.  \"That wasn't very nice!\" she chided as she casually tossed the spent slug to the side, her superhuman strength sending it rocketing off like a gunshot and embedding deep into a hardwood with a crack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-w-what the hell are you?\" the man nervously stammered, instinctively firing off three shots in quick succession at the advancing young superhuman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny confidence was soaring as she walked -- no, strutted -- towards the man like a tigress.  A bulletproof tigress.  Shot # 1 whizzed past her ear without her even flinching.  In fact, it only made her smile wider.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShot two struck her belly like before, the bullet crumpling like a tiny accordion against her harder-than-anything abdominals.  Shot number three was the last one he got off, striking the left side of Jenny's new ample curves.  With new super-charged senses, Jenny watched in amazement as the bullet made first contact and dimpled her luscious breast ever so slightly before it recoiled with superhuman force, sending the bullet careening away.  Jenny let out a giggle.  Superhuman boobs!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Jenny approached the man, she reached out grabbing the gun barrel with her left hand.  The hardened steel gave off a high-pitched groan as Jenny used her thumb to bend the barrel back on itself with about the same amount of effort she'd used to bend a straw.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the gun out of commission, Jenny then grabbed the man by his shirt and tossed him 40 feet into the cold pool.  As her adrenaline slowly subsided, Mark and Sam rushed over to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jeez, Jenny....are you ok?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny stared incredulously at them, silently thinking about those wonderful orbs.  Thanks to a strange twist of fate, she was now supremely beautiful, superstrong, and seemingly invincible!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jenny?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah....sorry....I'm fine....I'm super!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Nothing was going to stop her. \"This must be some kind of test.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaughter chuckled like a fluid flowing stream from where the waterfall splashed back into place.  An alien figure vaguely shaped like a man began juggling the flashing colorful orbs faster and faster until they spun in a circle of light. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Greedy, are we? Willing to feast without knowing who cooked this fun prank up?\"  the voice rippled with glee.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who? What are you?\"  Mark shouted, gathering Sam against him.

Jenny left an emotional vacuum behind her. She no longer seemed interested in either of her two best friends. She followed Xinth around like a puppy.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want to know everything about you,\"  she said for the hundredth time. Everything the alien did had to be questioned, analyzed, almost worshiped. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo make things easier, Xinth used one of his green orbs to wish himself into a comfortable human form. It should have fit him right into the group. All it managed to do was draw Jenny further away from Sam, and more extraordinary, from Mark.  The emotional yen she'd had for the man now was just a blank stare whenever he approached her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He is not a God, Jen. Why you try to make him one is making it kind of hard to take.\"  Mark had trapped her in the pool while bathing. Xinth was off somewhere juggling balls, making them appear and disappear in random patterns only he knew the reason for. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am doing it for all of us, Mark.\"  The lie was written on her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, right.\"  Mark felt Sam's hand on his shoulder. \"Something?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two had grown closer as Jenny had grown apart.  Xinth either didn't notice the changing pattern of their relationship or didn't care. \"I need to talk to you.\" she leaned down to caress a hand through his hair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't mind, do you, Jenny?\"  there was sarcasm in her voice. Sam pulled Mark to his feet literally dragging him into the temporary shelter the three had made while camping by the waterfall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look at me. What do you see?\"  Sam turned slowly, keeping as much eye contact as she could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am starting to fade,\"  she said. The change back to her original shape had started with a tingling sensation over her entire body. She didn't feel faint. It was more like an aching hunger.  \"I need to feed. I need another hit off a green orb.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked down afraid to see the question in Mark's eyes. \"You have to help me. Jenny won't.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How?\"  At the mention of feeling an itch that could not be scratched, Mark found himself rubbing his palms up and down his manly physique. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know. If the hunger hasn't started with you it soon well. I think Jenny is secretly feasting when she's with Xinth.   </span></div></div>",

Before Mark could ask the many questions on his mind, Xinth spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know what you're thinking... what do I need to do for more orbs?\" Xinth smiled, a predatory gleam in his eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have just the thing.

She then moved over to the security guard, lifted him, spun him in the air one-handed to let his pistol drop from his holster to her other, outstretched hand. Turning the gun toward herself, she pulled the trigger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the assembled press in the audience gasped in shock, Jenny turned toward them and smiled. She brushed the flattened slug from her svelte abs, showing off the hole in her blouse where the bullet had clearly struck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everyone, search out these orbs, and you can have powers like these for yourself!\" Jenny's eyes sparkled as she saw the lust for power enter the eyes of each assembled journalist.

Translucent monsters flashed back a warning. Creatures at this depth grew their own light much like fireflies did above. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry. This was a minor setback. I've dealt with them before on other worlds. They have to guard every one of them while I play where and when I want.'  Xinth eased his craft into settling in the murk, turned and slid Jenny on his lap. \"Let's have a ball, shall we?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny's eyes gleamed as she received all three of hers.

It comes from the core of the stars just like you and me.\"  He shared an intimate brush of lips whispering delights to come against Jenny's open and welcoming mouth.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jenny and I will enjoy a private party. You two are welcome to your own.  We'll rest after for a while in our own beds.\"  Xinth's strength picking up Jenny in his arms made her own increased toughness seem weak. She lay back against him. There was nothing on earth which compare with this star man. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark turned, shrugged, and led Sam back to her compartment to dabble in a little love magic of their own. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeveral hours later, they heard the quiet hum of the spaceship pulse in their ears. They joined Jenny and Xinth in the control room, settling into the seats rising out of the floor.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where are we off to?\" Sam asked, releasing Mark's hold on her fingertips.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA shield of gray twinkling light covered the viewports. \"Need to guard us from prying eyes as well as protect our own. We are going to dive into the sun, my pets for more treasure than we can hold.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEight minutes later, a solar flare shot out to greet them. Warning lights flashed, quickly overided by Xinth's sure hand.  \"Can't stay too long in this atomic inferno but long enough. Behold.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe star shine became so intense it was all that his guests could see. Xinth was so concentrated in his focus he was not aware of Jenny coming up to shelter herself against his side. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe light from the sun's great orb became x-rays and every other spectrum of light there was. The four space travelers shone for a flash of a moment as bright as lightning. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is done.\"  Xinth's hand returned to its former more earthly shape as it passed over the shipboard control. The craft shot out like a bullet causing a massive corona hiding the small shell and its crew. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Our power will last as long as we need it.

Realization of the exact nature of the intimate act Jenny had been sharing with Xinth rolled over her face. She gulped, then looked like she was about to say something, then clapped her mouth shut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam closed the hatch without another word.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny turned back to Xinth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI may have to go explain some things to my friends,\u201d Jenny said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nXinth nodded.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jenny watched curiously as Mark reached out for the same green orb -- the same one that had turned Sam into some modern-day version of Aphrodite only seconds earlier.  Mark hoped for a similar transformation of his physique, discounting the remote notion that crept into his mind that the orb would shuffle his X and Y chromosomes and turn him into some female sexpot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs his hand touched the green orb, he felt a slight discharge as his palm began to emit a faint green glow.  \"It's happening!\" he exclaimed proudly as the green glow got brighter and brighter and then stopped its ethereal progression and even began to dissipate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!  What the ---\"  Mark never finished his thought, his face turning sullen as he watched the magical green glow grow even more faint, turning to a muddied hue of karaka momentarily before morphing into a dim sort of brown glow -- if that was possible -- that just as quickly faded into nothingness.  Mark's disappointment was evident by his expression as he glared at Samantha, her exquisite beauty and almost mythical proportions almost mocking him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sam took all the mojo outta this stupid one!\"  he said pointing at her accusingly.  She merely shrugged her shoulders with a snarky, wry smile as if to say \"Sorry...not sorry!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, let's just see then what these others can do...\" Mark said haughtily as he reached out quickly and grabbed the blue and purple ones, one in each hand.  Like earlier, Mark's excitement skyrocketed as his watched his two hands illuminate with hues of turquoise and indigo.  Then, as with the green orbs, Mark's exuberance waned in concert with the diminished glows of both orbs.  Nothing!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How come Same got them to work?\"  Mark said desperately as he touched the other one, the yellow one.  Same result.  As if to mock him, four more orbs  -- black, white, grey, and red -- suddenly sprung from the depths as Mark lunged for each of them in succession, all with the same disappointing results.  \"These things are fucking useless!\" he snorted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know about that!\" Jenny giggled as Mark spun around.  In Jenny's hands were the green and yellow orbs, her hands glowing brightly -- much brighter than Mark's had been -- her left hand a bright yellow, her right a blinding neon green!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInternally, Jenny could FEEL the magic happening, just like with Samantha.  Mentally, Jenny visualized her face becoming angelic and her body becoming unparalleled in its symmetry and shape.  And just like that, the green orb made her thoughts reality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark and Samantha stared with mouth agape as Jenny's blonde locks began to shimmer and magically unwind from themselves, cascading down her shoulders much like the waterfall in the background.  Her light blue eyes began to brighten, sparkling like two sapphires.  Her face, formerly cute, now morphed into a visage that was worthy of any fashion magazine with cheekbones and full, pouting lips that would be the envy of even any supermodel.  She was, in a word, breathtaking!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n As she was standing in about 4 1/2 feet of water, Mark and Sam couldn't see Jenny's hips flaring out sexily or the layers of stubborn body fat evaporating from her torso was being vacuum-packed.  But Jenny could feel it....and it felt SO good.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA subtle moan escaped the young girl's lips as she felt a sudden tingle in her legs.  Her former stems which were never Jenny's favorite feature -- or even in her top 10 -- now were transforming into a pair of the sexiest legs on the planet, resplendent with sleek feminine muscle and devoid of any trace of cellulite.  Not to mention, she was....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm growing!\" Jenny exclaimed, almost in tears as she found herself slowly rising out of the water as her phenomenal legs lengthened.  As the newly elected Venus seemed to rise up, there a churning of water against her chest as wonderful series of new shadows began to emerge within her cleavage, her formerly B-cup taking a few steps up the alphabet!  Sitting high on her chest without a hint of sag, her new curves would rival those of any Sports Illustrated cover girl and be worthy of any bra, bikini, or strapless dress on the planet!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven Samantha with all her newly acquired beauty could stop stop ogling at the vision of Jenny 2.0.  \"You're.....you're......g-g-gorgeous!\" Was all she could mutter under her breath as Jenny flashed a perfect smile back at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark on the other hand, despite the sudden bulge in his swimsuit under the surface, was incredulous. \"How the hell does it only work on you two?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny looked sympathetically at Mark and said innocently \"I dunno....maybe they only work on girls?\"  Jenny wasn't sure of her theory, but it sure SEEMED that way for now.  Internally though, Jenny pondered another question....\"If the green one did this?  What did the yellow one do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

They swirled into a halo making Sam's hair flutter and kiss her cheeks, her eyes, her brow. \"Feels so good,\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe arched like a human bow, hands rising to dance with them, feeling strange tickles of heat and cold.  \"I get it. I can't choose them. They have to choose me, Mark. Stand still and see if you get a visit or two or three.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny moved up to hold Mark back. \"Those are hers, my friend. All we can do is watch. Aren't they beautiful? See how they make Sam's aura shine?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wonder what gifts they bring,\" Mark muttered while trying to shake Jenny's vice-like grip off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll but one orb shot off leaving Sam grasping for them. The black ball hovered in place, wiggled a bit as if in silent thought, and launched itself directly at Sam's face.  \"Help me,\"  she tried to grab and fling the thing off. \"I can't breathe.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"God, Jenny. It is eating her,\" Mark gasped.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, it's not. That's the magic power being given to her. It is not eating her. Its giving her a disappearing act.\"  Jenny laughed.  \"Are you there, m? See if you can make a guest appearance.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA whisper of disturbed air became a rising whirlwind where Sam had been. \"I love it. \" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam became a blinking on-and-off-again rapid-fire second long instances of herself. \"This could come in real handy, guys. Want to play hide and seek?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark grinned to himself, \"I prefer your hide.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Men.\" Jenny stopped from giving Mark an elbow in the gut. She was beginning to learn how easy she'd have to take her new strength. There were times when it was useful and times when it should be gently held in place. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sam? We both want that kind of magic.  Aren't we just having a ball?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When they let us,\" chuckled Sam, appearing next to Mark and kissing the scowl off his lips. \"Hang in there buddy. I have a feeling you are next.</span></div></div>",

I was asked to post on their behalf</b> :)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny and Mark stared gobsmacked at their friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne moment they had seen Samantha descend beneath the waves. The next\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark reached over and pinched Jenny, causing the girl to cry out and jump back. The short girl held up her hands in the stereotypical karate hand-chopping pose the pair had seen in those old films. She looked at him darkly as he just continued to stare at Samantha, mouthing the words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry. I had to check to see if I was dreaming.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny lips pouted and quickly she bought her karate chop down on Mark\u2019s head, to little but comical effect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re meant to do that to yourself, ya dingus!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark finally tore his eyes away from Samantha to respond to the irate semi-shouting/scolding girl who only came up to his chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell if you hadn\u2019t noticed I am kinda distracted.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDistracted!\u201d Jenny yelled, now fully going over the cusp of irate but well-intentioned miffed scolding, into genuine shouting. She jabbed him the ribs for good measure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark, however, wasn\u2019t having any of it as usual.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah! Well if you hadn\u2019t noticed our friend just came out of the water and just turned into\u2026\u201d Mark waved his hand up and down as if to highlight the now supermodel Samantha, pursing his lips as his mind worked overdrive to find the words: yet failed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd as she stood knee-deep in the water Samantha she had to agreed: words failed to describe her. Staring down at her own reflection large almond-shaped eyes, with deep chocolate irises that invitingly stared back at her. Long legs which stretched out of the water into gently sloping hips were crowned by a soft six-pack of defined muscle. A chest which Samantha could only dream about blocked much of this though. But then again dreaming or rather imagining this body for the green orb had been what caused this miraculous transformation only moments ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer now manicured hands reached up and explored her body. With one Samantha clasped a clump of her formerly brown hair, marveling at how it had turned a brilliant shade of neon green: Neon Green! Her over hand tugged at her tank top and pulled at the collar to get a better look at her chest, yet felt a jolt of excitement as with every centimetre she pulled at the top more and more creamy cleavage was exposed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe reflection of a goddess stared back at her. Though she only got a good look once she looked to her side to bypass her chest. This caused her to let out a dumb laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHeh, heh\u2026 I can\u2019t see my feet.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe comment was enough to get Jenny and Mark to stop arguing and swing their heads back towards Samantha, with a look of \u2018Did you really just say that\u2019 and \u2018yeah this is more important.\u2019 Jenny was the first one to speak, as she coughed to break the tension in the air and forced a smile, as if to pretend this was normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSamantha\u2026 are\u2026 you alight?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatching the cough, the now living goddess of beauty looked up at her friends and looked at them somewhat confused. Yet managed to stammer a \u201cY-yes.\u201d Yet she was somewhat distracted. Absently her other hand clasped her perfect chest and gently massaged it to see if it was real. Realising what she was doing her hand snapped back to her side and she let out a nervous laugh, which soon became rather forced. \u201cI mean\u2026 yeah. Totally I am fine. Never better. I mean just look at me?!\u201d Her eyes turned downwards to the pool again and she let out a nervous chuckle. \u201cI\u2019m\u2026 beautiful.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s an understatement.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny shot Mark a glance through slitted eyes, before placing a finger to her head and sighing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan you keep your brain above the waist for like five minutes Mark.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe college freshman let out a slight nervous laugh of his own, as he scratched the back of his head. \u201cY-yeah sorry.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamantha though couldn\u2019t stop laughing. This was a dream come true. She ran her hands through her now shimmering neon green hair, idly commenting. \u201cOh, let him look Jenny. I am fine. Moreover, I feel great. Better even.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark raised a hand now, as he closed his eyes in a way Jenny and Samantha knew he was trying to concentrate. \u201cNo, she is right Samantha, you\u2026 we need to focus. Start from the top, you went into the pool and, what happened?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamantha shifted the weight of her body to one side, as one of her ladylike hands rested itself on her womanly hips. Her other hand reaching up to tap her perfect full red lips, as she tried to recall what happened. Yet even with such idle pose of pondering she seemed to radiate supernatural sexuality. From that tiny movement, both Jenny and Mark seemed to go ridged. Their head became filled with fog like wonder, as their eyes became transfixed on the movements of Samantha\u2019s mouth. Time seemingly slowed as every movement of their friend seemed to cloud their minds. They just couldn\u2019t think, or concentrate as with every subtle turn and point and even noise she was just\u2026 to\u2026 sexy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd on and on it went until\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd that\u2019s what happened.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark and Jenny snapped to attention as they heard the conclusion to the story which they had somehow just missed, and saw Samantha heading back into the pool. Mark reached out a hand to cry, \u201cwait where are you going,\u201d only to freeze again, when he got a look at her perfect heart-shaped rear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamantha however only shouted back. \u201cI am going to find the orbs,\u201d causing Mark to just stare at her, and yell \u201cWhat orbs!\u201d Then frantically looking to Jenny as he said again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat orbs\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly to stop as she saw a trickle of blood roll out from his female friends\u2019 nose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow beneath the water Samantha followed the route she had used before and headed for the waterfall. Still, as she swam, she began to notice how much easier it was to swim this deep bellow the surface. Before she had been somewhat been straining for air before she had reached the falls, let alone the orbs. Now she had managed to reach where they had been in a few seconds, and felt as though she was hardly trying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd there they were, the yellow and blue orbs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust like the green one, they pulsed with their own light. The water around them turning yellow and a lighter shade of blue with each rhythmic change in their energy. It was somewhat enchanting for Samantha as she just floated there staring at them, the possibilities of what the orbs could do running through her mind. She could take them back to the university, to her friends, make them like her: or\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf she wasn\u2019t underwater, she would have managed a giggle, but instead allowed herself a wicked grin, made all the more enchanting by her enhanced features.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, deliberately she reached out and placed on hand on each of the orbs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat same buzzing, she had felt when her hands had touched the green orb greeted her. It was like static, yet now she was familiar with it, it was so much more. Like all the best bits of a warm bath, mixed with a gentle massage: as whatever energy was within these orbs flowed into her body and washed over her form. She stifled a moan as the energy peaked and she felt her whole body vibrate in tune with the orbs. Her dull moans echoed throughout the water as whatever gifts these orbs had, began to change her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly across her body, the same toned muscles that had come with the green orb started to ache. All her fat, save for her chest, had evaporated on leaving the water, and now as she stared down as her hands, as they were pinned to the orbs, she could see the muscles beneath her skin start to move. Her forearms began to fill with power, with them growing wider at the wrists and then flowing up the arm. She got a slight look as her biceps and triceps first got tighter and then began to swell. only for the energy to reach her shoulders and then her back, which forced her posture to arc as a weight she had never known left her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was an intoxicating feeling. After touching the green orb, she had felt like she could do anything, but now, as whatever the yellow and blue orb were doing to her, even the act of holding her breath became trivial. The now green-haired goddess closed her eyes, and allowed another small moan to leave her lips. As the energy flow down to her midsection Samantha could feel each abdominal harden, one after the other, which was nothing to say about the feeling in her chest. The tightening of the pectorals lifted her already mighty endowments higher, giving them a natural perc as she now felt no weight from carrying them anymore. It was like having all the pleasure and none of the drawbacks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, as the power migrated southward, she got a sudden rush of energy as her more personal area seemed to clamp together with sudden strength, forcing to scream. It was too good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill now her legs were hardening and she stuck them out to get a better look. Before the transformation Samantha had always felt she had nice legs, but after the green orb they had become one of her most dominant features. Still as whatever strength was filling her reached them, they grew far more toned and her quads grew to a sexy defined level pushing just to the edge of what a woman could get naturally, yet still being undeniably alluring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was something about this transformation though. She had clearly gained muscle, but nothing freakish. She was still feminine, likely Amazonian, but yet as she admired the clearly defined eight pack and looked at her arms filled with power, yet still clearly feminine muscle, she knew whatever had changed her had not compromised her looks. If anything they had enhanced them<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet this had only been one orb. What had the other one had done?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I was asked to post on their behalf</b> :)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamantha suddenly became aware the buzzing had stopped. She felt her hands leave the orbs and watched as the light left them and drained into an aura which surrounded her. The structure of the orbs seemed to evaporate as whatever they were made off just seemed to melt away into nothingness, leaving the now Amazonian Samantha in darkness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Well, I better show Mark and Jenny the new me.\u2019 Samantha thought as she slowly kicked one of her legs to go up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then felt herself be catapulted out of the water and half a mile up into the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith one movement Samantha had managed to create so much momentum that she had launched her whole body out of the water like a bullet, and was now heading skyward above the forest. She watched in amazement as the wood seemed to stretch all the way back to the campus three miles away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can fly!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly to then become aware of that same sinking feeling you get whenever you\u2019re falling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh no. No. NO! NO! NOOOOOOOOOOO!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamantha now fell like a brick, quickly reaching terminal velocity and heading down, down, down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then with an almighty explosion hit the floor in a blast of dirt and several shattered trees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamantha though was quite aware she had hit the ground. She even had felt herself when she had somehow been buried beneath the dirt, as her momentum had carried her through the first layer of the ground: and it had felt like\u2026 nothing. She recalled times when she had been on the playground when she had been much younger and fallen from a bench and scratched her knee. Now that had hurt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow all she could see was darkness, and was very aware she had not died, as she could feel her hand poking out into the open air above her. Yet what she had just gone through had felt like\u2026 a love tap. No worse than a gentle tap on the wrist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tried to say \u201cWoah,\u201d only for dirt to full her mouth. She spat it out and sat up. And again as she did so she became aware of a pile of dirt and rock which she had been buried under just seemed to disintegrate and crumble away. Even a whole tree, which had collapsed on her she just pushed idly aside before noticing what she had been doing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill holding onto it, she lifted up the trunk with one arm, looked it up and down, and then let it drop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHoly\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamantha had to wonder how strong was she.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then looked around at the shallow crater she had made, with her now standing at the epicentre like a freshly sprouted plant. With one act Samantha had just remoulded what had to be garden-sized area of the local woodland.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then had to wonder how tough was she.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then she heard shouting. Not superhuman shouting or anything, like she knew it was several miles away. Actual shouting and cries of terror coming from her friends. She was about to get up and help them when she saw them run to the lip of the crater and see her just stand up as though it was nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey stared in awe as a green-haired, Wonder Woman-like figure had just risen out of the earth and was looking at them with as much concern as they had for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll at once they asked each other. \u201cAre you alight?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen realised by each other\u2019s concern, and that they all were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd Samantha again looked about the crater, and smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah.

I was asked to post on their behalf</b> :)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe trio had decided to put some distance between themselves and the crater and instead headed back to the waterfall where their belongings were. It was a necessity at this point. After the crash Samantha\u2019s tank top was in tatters, and only holding on by one strap and the fact the rest of it seemed painted onto her freshly grown body. They were hoping she could squeeze back into her jeans and jacket for some modesty, but Jenny had already given her friend a once over and could tell she was taller: by how much she had no idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey spent the trip back getting Samantha to tell them what exactly had transpired, and what these orbs were. There was a lot of \u2018no way\u2019 and gasps of surprise, as well as a hefty amount of distracted staring from all three of them. Yet once they returned to the pool, they set about getting ready to head back to the campus and at the very least getting Samantha a new pair of clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, this blows.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark heard Samantha\u2019s curse, and looked up from where he was draining his sodden shorts behind a bush when he got an eyeful of Samantha\u2019s new shapely rear: as she was bent double trying to squeeze into her old jeans. She let out another curse as she managed to get the jeans up to around her waist and button them up, pulling a face of clear annoyance. Mark though was again going red as he could clearly see how Samantha\u2019s goddess-like legs were pushing the jeans to their limits, as the demine fabric now hugged every crevice of her muscles. Worse, or better still there was now a tasteful length of calf exposed, as the jeans rode around half way up, showing that Samantha had indeed gotten taller.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was making it very hard for Mark to concentrate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny meanwhile was busy trying not to stare at her best friend, and was repacking the lunches they had bought, all the while thinking about all the things Samantha could now do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuper strength.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeauty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat was probably invulnerability.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd all due to some weird orbs?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe paused as she packed their rubbish in a small black bag and bit her lip as her mind was filled with thoughts. And then she had to ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSay\u2026 Samantha. Do you think there are any other orbs around here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamantha who was now pulling on her jacket, and annoyed to see that it now only came halfway down her forearms paused as she heard this and then turned to Jenny, who had wisely chosen to turn her back on her old friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI suppose. There were no more orbs in the pool. I checked.\u201d Although in her head she scolded herself by saying \u2018not thoroughly\u2019 and too began to wonder of the amazing powers they could accumulate if they acquired them. \u201cDo you think we should look for them?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes!\u201d Mark and Jenny simultaneously responded to Samantha. There was an awkward silence followed by a pause as they realised, they had spoken in sink and stared at each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll three of them laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI mean you kind of owe us\u201d Jenny said now smiling. \u201cYou hogged all three of those orbs and now you\u2019re\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWonder woman.\u201d Mark excitedly finished off earning another round of laughs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamantha ran her hands through her long green hair, which with the water glistened in the sunlight. \u201cYeah Wonder Woman wished she had my body.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo where should we look first?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo sooner had Mark proposed the question, than a jovial voice from above them called down, \u201cOh follow that trail and you should find some.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe trio paused, and then slowly all in sync turn around to face where the voice was coming from, and\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNothing. No one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe group again paused, as Mark and Jenny shared a nervous glance, while Samantha stepped forward, her now powerful legs allowed her to cross the distance in only three strides. Still even she couldn\u2019t see anyone. She felt something within her go on guard, and was about to ask who had spoken when above them the voice spoke again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy, my, you humans really don\u2019t track your four-dimensional space, don\u2019t you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone\u2019s eye shot up and what they saw was\u2026 unexpected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere floating on what seemed to be air, was what seemed to be a man. He was clad in a tight green spandex suit, brimming with an unusual muscle structure that seemed to be hugged at every inch by the strange reflective costume. Whatever the muscles though they seemed to be huge and his face looked human, save for the light blue skin tone, white hair, and ears which seemed to curve back into points. At least they looked like ears. The figure opened its mouth and smiled down at them with rows of sharp pointed teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBonjour.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll three of them just stared. Mark\u2019s mouth fell open as he slowly began to circle the area this strange man was floating over. Jenny moved behind Samantha, looking at whoever this was with caution. And Samantha. Well Samantha crossed her arms under her chest, as she could no longer fold it over with her new features. Her defiance seemed to amuse the person somewhat and he rolled over onto his front and rested his chin in his hand as he stared down at all of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh, that\u2019s the wrong language isn\u2019t it.\u201d He opened his mouth and a longer than normal tongue slivered out and dangled there for a moment, before returning to its owners\u2019 mouth. \u201cAh yes. I am right. Sorry, I am still getting used to your direct dialect. Honestly, I prefer German, much more like my own language. Say do any of you speak German?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe trio didn\u2019t answer, but instead seemed to relax as whoever, or whatever this man was he seemed willing to talk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was Mark who was the first to overcome the lump in his throat and managed to squeak out the question. \u201cWha\u2026 I mean who\u2026\u201d he coughed and then added. \u201cWhat and who are you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe figure laughed and flipped backward, doing a backward summersault as he hovered in the air and then drifted down to eye line with Mark and smiled broadly in his face. The figure then extended a six-fingered hand and clasped Mark\u2019s rather forcibly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGergovitchkanvrolar Septinitanleoti.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark eyes went wide as it felt like whoever this figure was, he had just placed his hand in a vice, and then smashed it. The pain was so intense he almost blacked out instantly, as a mere handshake from this person had shattered what had to be every bone in his hand. Gergovitchkanvrolar though seemed to get that he had done something wrong, as his eyes went wide and he looked down at the hand, and then said. \u201cOh. My bad.\u201d And around his hand a bright white light emerged and all of a sudden Mark felt the pain leave him, and he stumbled back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first-year college student hit the dirt with a thud and stared at his now healed hand in disbelief. Samantha was quick to demand. \u201cWhat did you do,\u201d as the strange figure floated back up into the air and held up his hands in defence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry, sorry. My apologies. I am not used to dealing with unevolved\u2026 no that\u2019s not right. Sorry unenhanced lifeforms.\u201d He forced another fanged smile and turned to Mark and coughed. \u201cReally I am sorry. Please can we start over I feel I am making a real cat\u2019s ear of this introduction.\u201d He then floated down next to Jenny faster then anyone could spot and whispered to her. \u201cIs cats ear the right term?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny jumped back several meters though, and joined Mark on the dirt floor.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I was asked to post on their behalf</b> :)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay stop this,\u201d Samantha demanded, pointing a finger at the floating figure who now had returned to a gentle hovering height just out of arms reach. \u201cWho are you Gergovelch, or whatever your name is!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe figure laughed and raised a hand as if it would calm the now superhuman woman. \u201cYes, yes. I will explain. Though for simplicities sake call me Greg, and I am an extraterrestrial lifeform.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe trio were once more disarmed by this almost casual revelation and were left a full minute processing the information before Jenny spoke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou mean like E.T\u2026 or Yoda.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg nodded. \u201cYoda, yes\u2026 although I don\u2019t know what ET is. Should I watch, read or eat it?\u201d He leaned in now, after counting off those three options on his six-fingered hand before flashing what could only be called a dashing smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUmm, it is a movie.\u201d Mark began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, a movie. What fun. Then yes, I will watch it tonight.\u201d He then laughed seeing Jenny and mark\u2019s blank expressions of confusion and Samantha\u2019s expression which was a mix of pissed and concern for her friends. Greg on seeing this sighed and again floated down, though this time landed on the ground, his powerful legs and imposing height being all the clearer now they had some reference next to Samantha, who he dwarfed. \u201cLook please calm down. I don\u2019t mean you harm. I mean look at what I have done for you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamantha now perfectly formed eyebrows raised in an expression of \u2018seriously.\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait, you gave her the orbs?\u201d Jenny asked in surprise.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg shrugged, and pointed back to the waterfall. \u201cWell left there under that water formation. But yes, you found one of my gifts.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGifts?\u201d Samantha said now feeling a new series of questions enter her mind, as she now looked up at what was clearly an Alien humanoid, but one she couldn\u2019t help find somewhat handsome.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course. I am what you call a\u2026 tourist. I teleport around the galaxy observing unevolved lifeforms and well.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMake them superheroes.\u201d Mark said in excitement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg laughed again. \u201cOh, celestials no. I fuck with them.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat statement earned another series of blank looks from the trio, which caused Greg\u2019s laughter to taper off into a nervous chuckle: followed by a cough. \u201cWell within reason. I am not a spiteful individual. Nor do I enjoy genocide. No, I am a\u2026 agent of chaos.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamantha stared at him in shock. \u201cHow is that any better.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, no.\u201d Greg said shaking his head. \u201cI am sorry, I am so used to instantaneous mental communication my verbal skills are somewhat rusty, so things get lost in translation. I am\u2026\u201d he again paused to think. \u201cI am that droplet falling in a flat plane of water. The flat plane is boring, uninspired, simple. The droplet adds movement, spice and well momentum.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark then nodded. \u201cI get it. You\u2019re an agent of change.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg clapped his hand and pointed two fingers on each hand at mark. \u201cAnd progress my good man. Yes, change and progress. You see I am from a megastructure nearer the core of the universe, where life evolved around a two billion years before yours did. We long ago achieved biological perfection, ecological sustainability and technological mastery. As such the only new thing we really can do is bring new races into the fold, and well\u2026\u201d he pointed to Mark\u2019s hand and smiled. \u201cYou\u2019re a bit behind in the evolution department. So, we \u2018tourists\u2019 tour the cosmos spreading genetic advancement to all of the\u2026 less evolved races and bring you up to an equal playing field.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd the orbs.\u201d Samantha asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOur little way of having fun.\u201d Greg admitted with a shrug. \u201cYou see its not so much for us to dump ultimate power on you, you need to use it responsibly first. Get it bit by bit and learn to use it. So, we push people to seek out the power and in doing so learn about themselves and their new abilities.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, wait, there are more orbs?\u201d Jessica cried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo which Greg smiled. \u201cAs you three were the first to stumble on one of my caches. I\u2019ll give you a hint. Up the mountain is a cave. If you can get to it the powers inside are yours.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd if we don\u2019t get it?\u201d Mark asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell someone one day will. I mean I don\u2019t plan on going back to get them.\u201d He snorted. \u201cStill the important part of this is for you to learn and have fun. Now, what do you say?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I was asked to post on their behalf</b> :)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving received a hint from Greg, Mark, Jenny and Samantha now headed up the gradually increasing slope Mount Nibs: following the vague direction of a being who had really only described himself as an interplanetary prankster. It was a hard path, but after seeing what those orbs had done for Samantha, how could they not press on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet out of all of them, Jenny could not help but bring her doubts forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, do you think he is telling the truth?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNobody dared to slow their pace up the rocky trail, but both Mark and Samantha, who was setting an incredible stride on her model-like legs, looked back at her in a way which could only help but convey surprise. Mark shrugged and pointed at Samantha, as if that would answer the question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell they are his orbs and I mean\u2026 look at what they did for Samantha.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe now neon green amazon giggled and spun around and wiggled her now wide childbearing hips with an almost delighted grin on her face. Indeed, ever since the transformation she had not stopped smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike before, Jenny felt her mind fog over, as with every subtle move she found herself more and more attracted to her best friend. Mark too was having a hard time concentrating, but for Jenny this was so surreal: she wasn\u2019t into girls\u2026 Her mind trailed off again, causing Samantha to walk up to her and with a gentle prod of her finger snapped close Jenny\u2019s mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCareful Jenny. You\u2019ll catch flies.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll at once reality came crashing back to Jenny and she shook her head, blushed, and then redoubled her pace up the mountain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAll I am saying, can we trust him?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThree hours later the trio had spent the better part of the afternoon exploring the highest peaks of Mt. Nibs. It wasn\u2019t an impossible-to-climb mountain, more of an excessive hike. Yet after only an hour and a half both Mark and Jenny were pooped. They were now stopping every half hour, and in desperation both of the unpowered individuals had surrendered and were now allowing Samantha to carry them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy now the shadows were getting long, as the sun began to set behind the mountain. Mark checked his phone and saw not only was his battery low but it was getting close to six. He absently wondered as he bobbed in Samantha\u2019s strong arms if they would ever find the cave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe let a hand cup her arm and felt the hard steel like wires that were her muscles beneath the skin and felt himself not only marvel at her strength but also found himself getting incredibly turned on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe wanted this. Strength like hers, to be worthy of her, or someone like her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis eyes then turned to Jenny who Samantha was carrying under arm, and who was now lightly dozing after tuckered herself out with her fears of Greg. He smiled at her at first, but then paused as he began to imagine\u2026 how would she change.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe felt himself get hard at the thought, and let out a nervous chuckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamantha caught this and shot him a glance, and smirked. \u201cEnjoying the ride, are we?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark blushed and shifted his pants. \u201cSorry, you\u2019re just so\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, I know,\u201d Samantha grinned. \u201cBut I am wondering how much sexier I can be. Tell me. Does that turn you on?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith her come hither look, Mark froze and began to feel his own mind go blank. She was perfect, too perfect. Her smouldering dark brown eyes, long lashes, the way her green hair fell about her face in great tassels and how her lips just moved. He began to look around for a distraction when he cried out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, hey, is that the cave?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd sure enough, there was a cave. It was buried into the side of a cliff, where rainwater had once pooled and slowly carved out a large gorge through the bare chalk. It went far enough down to become dark towards the back, but sure enough, a faint glow could be seen emanating from within, the colours enrapturing Samantha and Mark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPower was within reach and, whatever was within the save called to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamantha set Mark and Jenny down, the tired girl letting out a yawn as she and Mark crossed the threshold of the cave, ignoring the animal bones littered around the entrance. Still, as they walked, almost hypnotised a crack broke whatever spell was over them and Samantha looked down and saw in her haste she had severed what had likely been a bone to some deer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore she and Mark could wonder why the bone was here a growl from within the save could be heard, and there, walking into the light, came a great, black bear.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Yet as soon they were at safe distance and the two of them glanced back to the rocky hole that was the cave entrance, they heard a scream and soon saw Samantha come flying out of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir superpowered friend slammed into the ground not far from them, her momentum cutting another shallow trench in the earth as she landed. With whatever was left of her jacket and top falling away. She now rose to her feet, bare-chested, exposing her unearthly beauty to the world. Jenny had a chance to call out \u201cSamantha your top,\u201d but the neon green amazon did not hear. Instead, she stared back at the cave knowing that bear would soon come for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn\u2019t long for her theory to be proved correct as the bear left the cave\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy jumping 30 feet into the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll three of the college students tracked its ascent in disbelief as the creature somehow had leapt as high as Samantha had when she had first used her powers. It moved in an unusual arc, its arms and legs flailing, yet was very clearly coming straight for them: its clawed paws outstretched. And then it dawned on Samantha.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had somehow used one of the orbs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had a split second to notice her friends behind her, and to register the descending bear when she made up her mind and jumped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCoils of superpowered muscle leapt into action as her powerful legs barely needed to bend, as with a simple kick, she too found herself propelled skyward towards the beast. The now half-naked goddess moved like a bullet, one of her arms outstretched towards the bear and managed to connect a solid gut punch to the beast. The howl of the giant furred mass of superpowers was so loud it shook the air and defended not only her but Mark and Jenny who were now a good quarter of a mile below. Yet her own superpowered blow had stunned it, and Samantha took her opportunity to grip the black fur and while still in air swung it over her head and threw it towards the other side of the mountain bellow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bear hit with the force of a small explosion, creating a huge crater in cliffside. One which Samantha descended upon like an angel from on high as she fell, more gracefully than last time, flipping herself over as to allow her legs to collide with the beast, feet first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA second explosion now erupted from the mountainside, and for those in town, several miles away, it looked to be an avalanche had happened on the side of Mount Nibs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor Samantha though it just felt as though she had missed a step on a staircase. An inconvenient jolt, but otherwise she was fine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bear through\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhichever of the orbs had granted her this durability sure as hell hadn\u2019t affected the bear. It was standing up, but it was bleeding heavily from numerous cuts and bruises; one of its arms was bent in a weird way; and Samantha was sure part of its skull was showing. Still now in a frenzy, it roared as soon as it got a clear look at her. It bought its claws up to swipe at the neon green hair that was billowing around Samantha at this point. Yet this time Samantha was prepared and she braced for the hit and\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNothing. On hitting Samantha, the claws had only gently indented her skin, as a finger would if you pressed down hard enough. Yet there was no mark of scratch. Indeed, it seemed the momentum and force of blow had just been absorbed by the now superpowered college student, who looked at the bear's arm and managed a laugh. She laughed and laughed and the bear just stood there unsure what to do as this tiny human had just taken all it had to give and more and was now\u2026 laughing?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamantha bought her hand up. She revealed in the feeling of power she now had and rested a hand on the bear's outstretched limb and smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy turn.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, she seized the forearm of the creature, and with the deftest touch, the bones in the limb shattered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bear roared and fell onto its back, its mangled arm trying to clasp its other mangled arm: all while bleeding damaged and injured. Samantha watched for a moment, revealing in her strength. She had defeated a bear with her \u2018bear hands\u2019 and even while this bear was likely as strong as her. She felt like she could do anything!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was until the beast began to whimper. A low painful growl, filled with fear and sorrow. And it then dawned on Samantha that they had kind of walked into this bears home, barged in without a second look and beaten it to a pulp. It had likely been scared, frightened and now it was so injured it would surely die.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamantha bit her lip, as the super-powered amazon wondered what to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n10 minutes later<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy did you bring that thing back here!\u201d Jenny screamed as Samantha lowered the battered body of the one-tonne bear to the floor as if it was a shopping bag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJenny, we invaded its home. Of course, it was going to attack us.\u201d Samantha explained as she looked at the now defeated king of the forest, whining in pain. The neon green victor then bent down and gently patted the defeated creature on the snout. The bear seeing the kindness and likely fearing Samantha after such an awesome arse-kicking gently licked her hand in a sign of submission. Samantha smiled, sensing the respect from the creature now. \u201cPlus, you know I love animals Jenny. Maybe with these new powers, there is something we can do for it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny scowled and kept a good distance back from the black bear which pinned under its breath. It was in a lot of pain, and from that mere sound Jenny\u2019s heart softened and she looked away. \u201cYeah well\u2026 it better be grateful.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, guys! I found them.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing Mark\u2019s voice the two girls looked towards the cave and then at each other. Jenny had to hold up her hand to conceal Samantha\u2019s lower half to keep her head on straight, but both of them shared an excited grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRushing to the back of the cave both girls saw the glow before they got there, but when they did their eyes went wide. There at the back of the cave were no less than eight orbs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2 green orbs, 1 blue orb, a grey orb, a white orb 2 yellow orbs and a black orb.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I was asked to post on their behalf</b> :)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the orbs lying before her Samantha felt her mouth become very dry. When she had first found the orbs, it had been a shock. Then when she had gone back to them it had been her curiosity. But now it was an ever-burning desire. What would happen if she was to touch another green orb or blue orb? What kind of powers would she develop, what would she look like?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking down she gazed at her bare chest, her nips turning hard in the open air, there gelatine firmness bouncing ever so slightly as gravity tried to exert some effort on them, only for her super strength to say no. She clutched at her neon green hair, and ran her fingers through it, marveling at its silken texture, its lustre and shine. Her mind fogged up with the possibilities, and a dumb smile crept across her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then that a noise shook her back to reality. The pained moans of the bear behind her, and she bit her lip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYes, she was powerful, but she had to be responsible with that power. She had to undo the wrong she had performed as well as\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe let out a dumb chuckle as her eyes turned towards the green orbs, with a thousand possibilities running through her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUmm Samantha,\u201d Jenny voice caught her off guard, and she turned to see both Mark and Jenny looking at the floor, almost embarrassed to be near her. \u201cFirst off could you put some clothes on.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA question to which Samantha smirked and replied. \u201cNo.\u201d Jenny looked up in protest, and Samantha merely giggled. Why should she? She was the hottest this thing on earth and sure she wanted to see what this body looked like in that dress she had seen in that boutique window: but right now, she wanted to reveal in this power. A power which could cower people with but a look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny\u2019s response to this was a protesting gasp, as whatever line she had prepared melted in the face of Samantha, and Jenny\u2019s eyes became fixed on Samantha\u2019s perfect teats, her head now nodding in motion with them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cO-okay.\u201d Jenny gulped and Mark looked up and looked Samantha dead in the eye\u2026 at first. Both of them paused as Jenny then added. \u201cS-second thing Samantha. Which orbs should we take?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamantha smirked again. The fact that her friends were asking for her suggestion, filled her with more confidence. She was the expert here, the saviour, the knowledgeable individual. It was nice to be on the other end from Mark the know it all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell,\u201d she said stepping up to the orbs and looking down at glowing spheres. \u201cNot these ones.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer hands came to rest on a white and green sphere, as Mark and Jenny called out in protest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSam no!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly for Sam to laugh as that same buzzing she had felt before overtook her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe energy from the orbs flowed up her arms and into her body, the Green energy snaking along her left arm and white aura moving along her right. As it did Samantha threw back her head and gasped. This was amazing! Beyond amazing! And as Samantha closed her eyes she felt those same thoughts that were not her own, enter her mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat body do you desire?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat changes shall be made?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow beautiful do you want to be?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamantha let these questions wash over her as she saw her form right now. An amazon of green hair, perfect chest and model-like proportions. She was everything she wanted to be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd yet now she wanted more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith her mind she sculpted her form. Her chest grew larger, larger then any girl could support on her own, yet they remained perfect spheres with only enough sag to seem natural. Her heart shape rear firmed and tightened. Her more muscular traits softened without losing an ounce of strength, yet her tight eight pack grew more pronounced to that of a ten.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreen hair now billowed around her, growing first down her back, then past her arse and then to her heels. It draped her like a cloak, strands disappearing into cleavage which now naturally formed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer face changed still. Her blue eyes turned green to match that of her hair, her eyebrows thinned and with the slightest change her already astonishing face became even more heavenly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then with a final gasp Samantha felt the last of the energy flow into her and she let go, and let out a gasp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd from that gasp she heard a new voice, a sultrier voice, one which spoke with a deep feminine confidence. One which with the right choice of words could cream and man with the sheer subtlety of her tones.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was going to enjoy this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet from behind she heard the same pained whining of the bear, and then stared down at her hand. Within her palm a white glow emanated and she let herself smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome here little one. Let me heal you.\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",
