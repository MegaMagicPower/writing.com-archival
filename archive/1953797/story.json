Whether or not one becomes a proficient user, whether one takes up a life of manual labor whilst tending the fields or whether they strife to pursue the refinement of their magical skills through their studies, everyone can take up the robes of a mage.<br>\r\nCzarodaal is trapped within a stasis where the culture and technology does not evolve past that of Earth's medieval period, barely even advancing towards it's modern period. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>The (former) Empire of Euphion</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nEuphionians also carry an inherent gift, though it is not exactly \"magic\" as it does not have the reality-warping potential, but only the more mundane effect of redistributing energy within certain elements. They can essentially bend the movements of particles and energies to their will. Much easier to learn, but still requires concentration and creativity to use effectively. The Euphionians have dubbed their powers as <b>\"Affinities\"</b>.<br>\r\nEuphion is trapped within a stasis where the culture and technology does not evolve past that of Earth's long nineteenth century, particularly dwelling favorably on the Victorian Era and embellishing the ideals of the Industrial Revolution.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Vaskyre Republic</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere are only mundane humans in Vaskyre. No physical perks, no special powers, no magic, only a person's own two hands and the resilience of the human race.<br>\r\nOne thing Vaskyre has going for themselves is that they are not exactly trapped in a stasis of time, but circumstances have not let them advance in culture or technology, though their exploitation of petrol power has made them a powerful nation indeed. They are currently a society that resembles the Interwar Era to the Cold War beginnings on Earth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Note -- Affinity Powers are not yet fleshed out, but as far as magic-type powers are concerned, affinities are more broad in scope than <i>elemental bending</i>, though even more defined by limitations than Vancian Magic, hence it is an affinity as opposed to, say, <i>alchemy</i>, of all things, or <i>Plasmids/Vigors</i>... actually that last one might just be where I'm coming from...</font></span></div></div>",

Each separated into a completely different realm by unseen, powerful forces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Czarodaal</b><br>\r\n<div class=\"bquote\">The fantasy realm where everything resembles the medieval ages and while influences of an early-modern era do appear the people still use archaic tools and primitive  technology. However, that is hardly a problem when the entire population has the ability to use <b>magic</b>. They also have an uncanny ability to tame many of the mythical creatures that are drawn to their realm.</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Euphion</b><br>\r\n<div class=\"bquote\">The retro-modern realm where civilization has advanced well into its era of industry and manufacturing. Yet, as an added perk, the entire population has the ability to bend elements and energy with \"<b>Affinity</b>\" powers to complement their passionate pursuit of steam power to further its technological prowess and the elegance in the designs of such machines.</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Vaskyre</b><br>\r\n<div class=\"bquote\">The post-modern realm where the times are well into a modern era powered by a newly realized distillate of petroleum coined as <b>Diesel</b> fuel. No one possesses any special powers, but technology has gone so far and manufacturing moves so fast, the mundane humans can hold their own and even benefit from playing their war games.</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere is a fourth realm, but it is a realm of chaos that has corrupted most of the world. An ever-changing, ever-growing and monstrous force, its vile creatures maraud the rest of the continent as the realm's influence permeates across the rest of the world. It has no entity, no leader and is only known only as \"the Horde\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe \"Horde\" had always existed since the dawn of time, but only within the past centuries did it manage to overwhelm the humans on a large scale. The ceaseless waves of animal ferocity pushed humanity to the northwest corner of the continent where they defend what little ground they have left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvery country shares a border with the other two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVaskyre stands as the front line, the southernmost of the three. It is also smallest of the three, but it has the most access to coal mines, iron deposits, and most importantly, petroleum reservoirs.<br>\r\nCzarodaal has the largest expanse of territory and easily holds the flank at the northeast with its mountain ranger acting as natural barriers. Effectively immune to a full scale attack, Czarodaal's mages reside in security.<br>\r\nEuphion is situated on a peninsula north of Vaskyre while Czarodaal's shoreline lies across the bay to the east. The location gives Euphion the best seat from which to rule the waves.</td>",
