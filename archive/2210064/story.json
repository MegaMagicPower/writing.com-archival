            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>In his most recent mission, Peter Parker ran into a predicament while fighting Dr. Octopus. What he thought would be an easy victory turned into a disaster as the two were almost evenly matched. The fight dragged on for hours and Peter quickly found himself in a predicament, he needed to use the bathroom. The fight showed no sign of slowing down so Peter had no choice, he wet himself in his Spiderman suit. Unfortunately, the liquid caused his suit to short out and Dr. Octopus got away. Peter tried to fix the suit himself but didn't have any luck, he had to tell Tony Stark the embarrassing news.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeter had Happy schedule an impromptu meeting with Tony at the Avengers Headquarters. Something Tony wasn't too thrilled about. \"Okay kid, what is so important that I needed to drop everything I was doing to have a face to face meeting with you. Because there are thousands of more important and entertaining things I could be doing right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay Mr. Stark, I'm sorry but the suit kind of shorted out and I don't know how fix it. I don't know how it shorted out.. It just kind of... well.. happened.\" Peter said holding the suit in his hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTony took the suit out of Peter's hand and looked it over \"Look kid, the suit doesn't just short itself out like that. I would know, I designed it. It's waterproof on the outside so that wouldn't be a problem so there's no way that would be an issue.\" Tony placed the suit in a scanner and talked to his voice assistant F.R.I.D.A.Y, the replacement to J.A.R.V.I.S, \"Analyze, determine the source of the short.\" The scanner sent rays of beams of light across the suit and showed a digital image of the suit highlighting the crotch area as the source of the short. Tony looked closer at the image and then looked at Peter who was red in the face. Tony paused for a moment \"Congratulation, you shorted out your suit by pissing yourself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeter's face was still red, \"pfffft, I did not.\" he said in a very unconvincing tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, the suit says otherwise.\" Tony replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a short pause. \"Well, can you fix it?\" Peter asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course I can fix it but I don't want to have to keep fixing it.\" Tony said as he began to call Happy, \"Hey Happy, run to the store and pick up some diapers or pull-ups you think will fit the kid. Don't ask questions, he'll explain it to you later. Just make sure he wears them on his next mission.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mr. Stark, don't you think this is kind of unreasonable. I mean the only reason I had an accident was because the battle lasted like 4 hours. It was like a one time thing.\" Peter pleaded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't care kid, I've had long ass battles too and you don't see me pissing my pants.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your suit literally has a built in bathroom in it, couldn't you add that to mine too?\" Peter asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTony laughed ,\"I mean I could but that's too much work. You're still small enough, you can pull off wearing diapers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mr Stark, I'm fifteen...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Exactly kid you just proved my point. You're still young enough.\" Tony said at that moment Happy came walking in with several packs of diapers and pull-ups. \"That was quick,\" Tony said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes sir, love the new teleporters you designed.\" Happy said. \"I didn't know what to get for the kid so I got several kinds. Pull-ups, goodnites, and pampers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not wearing a diaper!\" Peter pleaded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTony looked at Peter, \"Look kid if you want to be a part of the Avengers and continue to be Spiderman you don't really have a choice. I don't have the time to redesign your suit right now. I'm busy with other projects. Now I'm going to place your suit in the scanner and it will be good as new in a couple minutes. You need to wear some sort of protection while wearing it though because one more accident and it could be completely irreparable. You're lucky it was just a small short.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two remain silent for a while as the suit finishes being repaired by the scanner. Peter is not happy about the idea of wearing a diaper under his suit. With the skin tight design people are sure to make out the outline of a diaper. As the scanner finishes, Tony and Happy leave the room so Peter can change.</span></div></div>",

He put the suit on and decided to go on patrol. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeter was swinging around the city as he thought to himself, \"If I capture Dr. Octopus Tony will be so impressed with me he'll make me a full Avenger.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeter took out his frustration at being called a kid by Tony on a purse snatcher. The common criminals were easily dsipatched. But a silent alarm at Oscorp was tripped. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsing the police scanner he took from Stark Labs Peter smiled this was definately the Doctor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeter headed over to Oscorp and sure enough he saw Doc Oct. Peter checked first on the knocked out cops and got them to saftey before webbing Doc Octs glasses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Spiderman back again i see. Well im afriad i have no time to play!\" Doc Oct says. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeter laughs. \"I was gonna say the same thing I went easy on you last time.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeter charges at Doc Oct and lands several good hits. And feels confident ij his victory. Tony was gonna be so impressed. But Peter's spider sense goes crazy and before he can react Doc Oct blows up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeter groans the suit absorbed most of the impact but before he can react the real Doc Oct slams his armored tentacles into Peter's chest multiple times. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeter goes to use his web shooter but screams in agony as Doc Oct smashes both his wrists. Shartering the web shooters. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'You interfered in my plans for the last time bug!\" Doc Oct says as he breaks Peter's right arm causing Peter to howl in pain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Before I kill you bug lets see who you are.\" Doc Oct removes Peter's mask. Peter's face was streaked with tears. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeter's eyes widen in horror as he feels a tentacle wrap around his neck. He didnt want to die. In fear he pisses his pants again shortening out the suit again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah just a boy! Get in my way again and i wont be as nice!\" Doc Oct says as he leaves. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeter sobs happy he was killed but still terrifed. He gets his mask back on but with his arm and web shooters broken he cant swing out. Peter limps off and tries to find a way to contact Tony.  </span></div></div>",

He sits down on a bench to rest for a moment while he replays the days events in his mind. He wonders how he'll ever be able explain it all to Mr. Stark. He ruined his suit again by having another accident on the same day Mr. Stark had told him he needed to wear protection. 'Mr. Stark's crazy if he thinks I'll ever wear a diaper, those are for babies. I'll just have him add a bathroom or something when he builds me a new suit. Oh my god what am going to do!' Peter thinks to himself, disgusted by the thought of wearing a diaper again. He buries his head in his hands and starts to cry, his arm still hurt from being broken but he didn't care. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter crying for a few minutes, Peter soon hears what sounds like a small jet approaching. He looks up and sees a familiar figure, Tony Stark showing up wearing his Iron Man suit. Tony lands and removes his mask before approaching Peter who was still clad in his Spiderman suit. \"What's wrong kid? You look terrible.\" Tony asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeter looked up at Tony and then back at the ground and sighed before removing his mask, \"I was rescuing some lady's purse from a thief when Doc Oct appeared out of nowhere. I wasn't prepared and he pinned me down and removed my mask. The only reason he didn't kill me is because I look young.... How did you find me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your suit sent out a distress signal but it disappeared for some reason, we debated about sending out the whole Avengers team but I decided to come check out the situation first. Good thing too, could you imagine how angry Banner would be if he had to stop what he was doing to take care of your sorry ass?\" Tony replied causing Peter to crack a smile. \"So are you injured kid? You're suit isn't communicating with me for some reason.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeter grew red in the face, \"I.. I think I broke my arm and might of sprained my leg. I just can't believe I lost to him again\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, weird kid. Your suit should have protected you if it was working correctly. Let's get you back to Avenger's HQ and see if that fancy Wakanda shit can't fix you up. Hop on.\" Tony said offering a hand to Peter who gladly to the offer. Tony's suit grabbed onto Peter and the two flew back to Avengers HQ. When the two arrived at Avengers HQ, Peter was quickly rushed to the infirmary where medicine from Wakanda was stored. Tony removed the Spiderman suit from Peter's body and took it down to his lab. He told the nurse to have Peter find him when he was completely healed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin an hour the Wakandan medicine does the trick and Peter is as good as new. His broken arm which would normally take weeks to heal was completely healed and his limp was gone. Any other internal injuries he had suffered were fixed as well. The nurse released Peter from the infirmary and sent him down to Tony's lab where he saw Tony carefully studying his Spiderman suit. \"He..Hey Mr. Stark. The nurse told me you wanted to see me?\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Peter, Yeah, I wanted to talk to you about your suit.\" Tony replied and Peter's face flushed red. \"It shorted out again, but I can't identify the cause this time. It was either due to a faulty repair the first time or another accident on your part. It's fixable so I don't need to design you a new suit but I do need to know the cause of the short.\" Tony said looking up at Peter.</span></div></div>",

I've now had two accidents in my suit and I'll never get to be an Avenger.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile in the lab, it was pretty obvious to Tony what had happened. Every test he ran on the suit proved that it had shorted out due to internal water damage. \"uh huh, just as I expected. The kid didn't listen to me and now he pissed in another suit. You know, this is why I hate teenagers, they don't listen to you\" he said to his virtual assistant. Tony got up and open door to the lab which Peter was slouched against. The sudden opening of the door caused Peter to fall down at Tony's feet and he looked up to see his idol with a disapproving face, he was in trouble and he knew it. \"Get up kid, I got your suit fixed.\" Tony said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeter's face lit up and he ran over and grabbed the suit, \"Really! you were able to fix it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTony quickly snatched the suit out of Peter's hands, \"Not so fast kid. Clearly you're not ready for this. You've managed to short it out not once, but TWICE, in one day by pissing yourself. Why the hell should I give it back to you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeter was stunned, \"Because... Because I'm Spiderman. I'm part of the Avengers\" he replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTony laughed, \"Do you see any of the other Avengers ruining their suits by pissing themselves?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeter paused for a moment, \"What about Groot? He's a baby.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First of all, Groot is not an Avenger, he's one of our allies... Secondly, He is a TREE,\" Tony replied in a displeased tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But he's a baby!\" Peter protested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And he's a tree!\" Tony said getting annoyed with the conversation, \"Look kid, you're missing my point. You can't be an Avenger if you keep ruining your suit mid battle by pissing yourself. Either wear something to protect your suit or you're off the Avengers. End of story.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But Mr. Stark... Only babies wear diapers,\" Peter pleaded. \"Please can't you just add a bathroom to my suit or something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTony laughed, \"I don't know how to do that. I mean, I do know how to do it... I just don't want to. You've already wasted enough of my time kid. I'll give you the suit back if you agree to wear protection otherwise I'll let Nick Fury know that you're not ready to be an Avenger.\"</span></div></div>",
