Though the ship was majestic, and versatile, it lacked certain qualities that were certainly important on the Grand Line. Namely, the ability to naturally produce food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Luffy! We need to stop off on one of these islands to restock out supplies!\" The ship's navigator Nami yelled at the young captain. Luffy look at her and blinked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean? We've got tons of food!\" He was answered by a shake of Nami's head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We finished off almost all of our supplies last night!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuffy went a bit slackjawed. \"NO MORE FOOD!? WE'RE GONNA DIE!\" In traditional Luffy style, he began to freak out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oi, Nami, what about that island over there?\" Usopp pointed at a small forested island not far off. Nami began rustling through her charts. \"Well.... it's not patrolled by marines... I suppose it will work....\" She turned. \"Zoro! Get the anchor ready!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ship's swordsman dropped the weights he'd been lifting and ran over to the anchor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin moments, the ship had docked safely. The strawhats were getting off the ship and looked around. \"Alright, we'll split up. Robin, you head out that way with me. Luffy and Sanji, go that way. Zoro, Chopper, Franky and Usopp guard the ship. We'll gather any supplies we need and come back here in three hours.\" The others nodded and they set off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Nami and Robin walked along the beaches, they picked fruits and berries off trees and bushes. Then Robin noticed something out of the corner of her eye...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe ran over towards what looked like a log, but turned out to be a boy! He looked roughly 15, and had darker skin, and messy black hair. He was relatively tall for his age, and had a what might have once been a strong build, but was now horribly malnourished. And unconscious. \"Miss Navigator!\" Nami ran over to him. \"Hmm....\" She began checking through his pockets. She gave a sigh. \"But he's got nothing on him....\" She thought for a moment. \"Alright, we'll take him back to the ship. Maybe he might be worth something!\" She exclaimed, with her eyes sparkling at the idea of the money he might be worth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Nami fantasized, the boy began to wake....</span></div></div>",

Walking in fronf of the tree, you waited for her to speak again, yet at the same time, ready to run at a moments notice..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, that makes this alot easier.\" she said.<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" You wondered. A sharp pain hit your neck, and everything went black...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*******************************************<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...You started to come too.<br>\r\n\"Owww!\" That lady moaned. \"I swear, it was like a severe case of static\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh stop your whining.\" A scruff voice came from the left. \"So... why did you hit the kid anyway?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He wasn't going to get any closer to me, so I did what was nessesary.\" She responded snyly.<br>\r\nIn the back ground you heard a wave crash against wood, that could only mean that you were on a ship...

Name's Luffy, thats Zoro, Nami, Chopper, Sanji, Usopp, Franky, and Robin. What's yours?\" He asked with a grin on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-nathan.\" You mutter<br>\r\n\"Cool!, can I call you Nate?\" He asked<br>\r\n\"Sure.\"<br>\r\nSuddenly, just as you actualy felt safe, a wave crashed on the ships side, soaking everybody. <br>\r\nA bright flash, the sound of electricity craked throught the air, and a bloodcurtling scream came next.<br>\r\nSteam, and smoke filled the air, the strawhats looked at your smoking body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright then...

You can\u2019t possibly be defending that....\u201d Robin countered, a bit distressed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not! I\u2019m just asking that you don\u2019t blow your top like that again, for everyone and the Sunny\u2019s sake.\u201d Franky replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cLike, for you that\u2019s seriously OOC how you reacted, Robin.\u201d Ussop nervously injected into the conversation. \u201cYou\u2019re supposed to be the only sane man among us! Or only sane woman...\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, the grammar also ticked me off, Robin.\u201d Zoro muttered, but not ashamed. \u201cThat\u2019s why I charged at him. But...shoddy spelling aside, he seems like he can hold his own.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAll that Franky is asking is that you don\u2019t go into a state of anger that makes me want to sleep in the treasure hold for the next seven nights, Robin.\u201d Nami added in, still curled up into a ball and now terrified of her fellow crew member. <br>\r\nSanji noticed this. \u201cOi, Chopper! Make Nami something that will calm her nerves.\u201d he demanded the ship\u2019s doctor, who snapped back at him. \u201cI\u2019m not at your beck and call! But I\u2019ll do it as the ship\u2019s doctor!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin nodded her head, still a little mad. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, Franky, Nami. I will try and keep my temper under control. No promises, though.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCouldn\u2019t the reader just go and read another branch, though?\u201d Sanji, Zoro and Usopp piped up at the same time, before looking at each other, annoyed. \u201cStealing my lines, you crappy chef?\u201d Zoro threatened Sanji, who predictably snapped back. \u201cI could say the same about you, you lazy swordsman!\u201d Ussop wisely kept his mouth shut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot all of the chapters are about Royce, though.\u201d Luffy injected, before he remembered something important! \u201cOH, RIGHT! We gotta find some food! That\u2019s why we stopped here in the first place!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can help with that.\u201d Royce said. \u201cI\u2019m a talented fighter, and it\u2019s not just bluffing. I can hold my own if things go south.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo says the blurb.\u201d Robin spoke, not quite convinced. \u201cAnyway, consider this a sort of redemption and test, Royce. If you can help us gather....say, a week and half\u2019s worth of food, I\u2019ll forgive you for any grammar mistakes you make untill the next island.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSeems fair, Miss Robin.\u201d Royce boldly said, agreeing to her terms. The Straw Hats and Royce prepared themselves to go a-hunting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThree choices?!\u201d Ussop said, looking down at the choices the story could take. \u201cWe are spoilt!

Pitt looked at her and then Nami and answered, \"To tell the truth...I don't truly remember. All I know is that I was asleep in that thing over there\" Pitt pointed to an object that has just washed up on shore. Nami and Robin looked at the object and saw that it was a strange looking egg like shell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNami rushed over it and just could't believe how big it was. She leaned in closer and saw that it was all shiny like it was made out of diamonds. \"So what...\" said Nami as she looked at Pitt, \"You woke up from this thing?\" \"Yeah...I must have gotten out that when it was in the water and the egg washed up later on\" answered Pitt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Best get a sample of this\" said Robin as she used her Devil Fruit powers to cause four hands to grow out of the egg and broke a bit of it's shell. Which was tough to do. Once broken, the hands tossed the piece of the egg shell over to Robin whom caught it. \"Right then, we better things to do than just stand out here, lets meet up with others\" said Nami as she walked towards where she placed the fruits. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Others?\" asked Pitt as he looked at Nami. \"Of course the rest of our crew\" answered Nami. \"Rest of the crew?\" asked Pitt still confused. \"We're pirates, wish to come aboard?\" answered Robin as she smiled at him. \"Please\" was all Pitt as said he went along with the girls back to the ship.     </span></div></div>",
