My plans, no, Our ambitions I pray, will come to pass. Sadly I myself will not see them fulfilled.\u201d<br>\r\n<span class=\"cmaroon\">Jellei Mel: \u201cYour Grace, we could have our necromancers keep your soul att-\u201c<br>\r\n</span>\u201cNo, and even were Dreadknight Necromancer Overlord Mlysk Xrei Luithr were to do so with all of his necromancer subordinates, would it matter a damn?\u201d King Aggelos reprimanded.<br>\r\nA servant of the Earth speaks. \u201cPardon my intrusion, but my mistress, Paladin Miraajane-\u201c<br>\r\n\u201cSo she\u2019s here to fill us in. It\u2019s been a while since she would entertain with her own presence.\u201d King Aggelos stated before commanding the servant of the Earth to \u201cLet her in\u201d.<br>\r\nA random mook: \u201cSir! We\u2019ve just received reports of a monster slayer who\u2019s been terrorizing those under your protection and grace\u201d<br>\r\n<span class=\"cmaroon\">Jellei Mel: \u201cIs that so? Your Grace, if I may-\u201c<br>\r\n</span>\u201cNo, not yet.\u201d King Aggelos said.<br>\r\n<span class=\"cbgreen\">Mios: \u201cDemoness Concubine of Burning Passion Jellei Mel, let us hear the words of His Majesty.\u201d<br>\r\n</span>\u201cYes, tell us about this \u2018monster slayer\u2019 \u201cKing Aggelos commanded the random mook.<br>\r\n\u201cWell \u2013 (goes on to truthfully explain about the monster slayer)<br>\r\n\u201cThis man is a terrible force to be reckon with.\u201d King Aggelos concluded. <br>\r\n<span class=\"clteal\">Miraajane: \u201cMlysk and I can keep tabs on this individual.\u201d<br>\r\n<span class=\"cmaroon\"></span>Jellei: \u201cNO!

Let us proceed with it then. One moment, Overlord Jellei.\u201d King Aggelos spoke.<br>\r\n<span class=\"cmaroon\">Jellei: \u201cYes, your Grace?\u201d<br>\r\n</span>\u201cI want you to copulate with this \u2018particular monster slayer\u2019. Now I know you hold a grudge against all monster slayers, especially human ones. I want you to sire an heir for my Kingdom.\u201d King Aggelos ordered.<br>\r\n<span class=\"crose\">\u201cNyahahaha! Oh, I get it!\u201d<br>\r\n<span class=\"cbgreen\"></span>Mios: \u201cA most diabolical course!\u201d<br>\r\n</span>\u201cYes, with both Overlord Mios\u2019s plans and my orders, the Kingdom of Altreuk shall fulfill its own desire. The desire to make a world or help to do so where nonhumans aren\u2019t viewed as monsters just for simply being nonhuman. And where both creature and beast can mutually coexist. A world closer to eglatarism.\u201d King Aggelos applauded.<br>\r\n<span class=\"cmaroon\">Jellei: \u201cThank you, your Grace.\u201d<br>\r\n</span>(Some time later after siring an heir)<br>\r\n<span class=\"crose\">\u201cOur liege is most wise, isn\u2019t he?\u201d<br>\r\n<span class=\"cmaroon\"></span>Jellei: \u201cI\u2019ll miss him.

Just b/c you should remain in character doesn't mean you should endear to make the exposition torturous. <br>\r\n5. Please maintain some form of logic within the contexts of this story. Rules may adapt, concepts can be ignored, laws created, but for all which is HOLY, please don't turn this into an erotic story! Keep to the genre, if possible.<br>\r\nThis is a fan-based prequel to Bruce607's The Outcast. It follows the Dracolich story arc and as such is meant to serve as the basis for what will hopefully be added onto that arc.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Kingdom of Alchtreuk is a kingdom considered to be accursed as both monsters (not necessary in the sense of personality) and humans coexist in harmony. Chronologically speaking our tale first begins 7 generations ago and ends 30 mins before the start of Bruce607's The Outcast Chapter 1. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHere are the Characters who may not die off (they are basically the protagonists, except for the first one who's still just as important)<br>\r\n1. King Aggelos - The current ruler of the Kingdom of Alchtreuk, he is a full on human who seeks to sanction an era of mutuality between humans and monsters and where fantasic racism is greatly frowned upon. That and he plans on fulfilling each of his 4 Overlord subjects wishes. Just think of him as the Holy King. Traits: Diplomatic, wise, and old. Class (other than King) : Sage<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2.Jellei Mel- Concubine of Burning Passion. She's the demoness Overlord of Fire and Poison and is the same demoness whose actions beget the start of Bruce 607's The Outcast. Though she is fiercly loyal to her kings propositions and his kingdom overall, she is even more amicable with the other ruling heads (the Overlords) of the Kingdom of Alchtreuk including the king himself. Her story is one on revenge. She might harbor romantic feelings for the 3rd person on this list. Just think of her as someone planning her revenge yet loves those she is loyal towards (and it's not just herself). Traits: vengeful and manipulative (except for those on this list) Class: Demoness warrior (at first) Lilith Seductress (end)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. Mlysk Xrei Luithr - Dreadknight Necromancer Overlord. His dominion is over demons and water. A master at curse spells and water along with dark elemental arcana, he follows Jellei around, even though he's technically higher up in ranking than she is. An aromantic chaste virgin, he is essientially the Heart and Pollyana of the group. His story also begins sometime around where Jellei's begins. Part of his ends with infiltrating Bowhan's group. Just think of him as the moe and Heart/chick of the group. Traits: emotional crutch, morality chain (sort of ), genki, pollyana, is unable to even perceive the concept of monsters or what's even normal. IOW a nightmare fetish) Class: Necromancer Dreadknight (he prefers curative and support spells over physical combat)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n4. Mios Lein Selter - Arc Sage Despot, he is the Overlord of Air and thunder/lightning. His specialty lies in his charms and illusions. He is both Jellei's and Mlysk's best friend as well as the leader of the 4 Overlords. Just think of him as both the leader and the genius. Traits: Tactical, strategic, understanding) Class: Warlock<br>\r\n<br>\r\n5. Miraajane Julia or Julia Miraajane \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Paladin. Her dominion is over Holy and Earth. Unlike the stereotypical Paladin, she has no qualms about working with and even befriending the undead and remains neutrally friendly towards necromancy. Though she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the lowest in ranking of the Overlords (followed by Jellei)she acts as both the official eyes and ears and shield of the group. Similar to Mlysk, she prefers sending off others to do her work and is just as manipulative as all of them. Unlike Mlysk however, she prides herself on being technically honorable within reason. Just think of her as a double agent (end) and the 6th ranger. Traits: Calm, collective, fa\u00c3\u00a7ade. Class: Paladin (Yes, she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s actually a Paladin)<br>\r\n</td>",
