As you continued to search for Koragg , your heart began to feel an incredible pain. It didn\u2019t take too long to find find trouble. In fact, this time, trouble is a female. The most beautiful woman you have ever seen. She then started to attack you. \"Wait, why are you attacking me?\" you asked. \"All Ashikabi aret dirty men.\" she said \"Look, I'm not the kind of Ashikabi you're describing. In fact, what is an Ashikabi?\"  You then transformed to defend yourself. She was very surprised, but she continued to attack you. You used your power to defend against her water attacks. \u201cThou aret impressive in battle.\u201d she said. \u201cI was just thinking the same about you. But anyway, I need you to be my Sekirei!\u201d you said. She was surprised at this, but continued to attack. Meanwhile, two more Sekirei showed up and attacked Tsukiumi. You jumped in the way of the blast and protected her. \u201cYou\u2019re luck he used his own body to take the blast.\u201d one of the Sekirei said. You stood up and said \u201cIf you lay one finger on her, I\u2019ll kill you!\u201d Tsukiumi was very shocked with this. But the girls were about to attack again when she attacked them. But she ended up hitting the Sekirei\u2018s Ashikabi. He got mad and charged toward Tsukiumi. He pinned her against the wall. He was about to unlock her powers when you said \u201cHey! You leave her alone. She\u2019s MY Sekirei! And I will defend her to the bitter end!\u201d You jumped at the man and punched him away from Tsukiumi. Tsukiumi asked why you did that. \u201cBecause you are my Sekirei and I can't explain it, but you have made the storm in my heart calm for the first time in years.\u201d Tsukiumi looked shocked and said \u201cThou hast courage. Not only didst thou protect me with thy own flesh, but also from that vile Ashikabi. For a monkey, thou are a man of metal. It\u2019s strange. But my heart which once clamored so loudly with protest, is surprisingly at peace now. What is thy name?\u201d You said to her \u201cMy name is (name).\u201d Thank you. Very well then. If that is what thou wants, then I shall except thy proposal of marriage.\" \u201cMarriage proposal!?\u201d you said. She grabbed you by the collar of your shirt and said angrily \u201cYou did call me thy Sekirei right?\u201d You said yes and then she said \u201cListen (name), there is only one person who shall kill thee, from this day forward, and that\u2019s me.\u201d She then kissed you hard on the lips. You began to blush and her power was unlocked. But after she unlocked her full power and broke the kiss, you thought to yourself \u201cWhat is this feeling? I haven\u2019t felt this way for any woman in over a hundred years. Could it be that I love her? Excuse me, miss.\u201d Thou may dispense with the formalities and address me as Tsukiumi. Thou aret my Ashikabi after all, as well as my husband.\" You smiled and the two of you went to find a place to stay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The woman continued to call herself a Sekirei, which you had no idea what that meant. One day, as you were walking along, your heart began to feel an incredible pain. It didn\u2019t take too long to find trouble. In fact, this time, trouble is a female. The most beautiful woman you have ever seen. Then you remembered her as the woman in your dreams She then started to attack you. <span class=\"cblue\">\"Wait, why are you attacking me?\"</span> <span class=\"clblue\">\"All Ashikabi aret dirty men.\"</span> <span class=\"cblue\">\"Look, I'm not the kind of Ashikabi you're describing. In fact, what is an Ashikabi?\"</span> You then used your powers to defend yourself. She was very surprised, but she continued to attack you. You used your powers to defend against her water attacks. <span class=\"clblue\">\u201cThou aret quite impressive in battle.\u201d</span> <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cI was just thinking the same about you. But anyway, I need you to be my Sekirei!\u201d</span> you said. She was surprised at this, but continued to attack. Meanwhile, two more Sekirei showed up and attacked Tsukiumi. You jumped in the way of the blast and protected her. <i>\u201cYou\u2019re luck he used his own body to take the blast.\u201d</i> one of the Sekirei said. You stood up and said <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cIf you lay one finger on her, I\u2019ll kill you!\u201d</span> Tsukiumi was very shocked with this. But the girls were about to attack again when she attacked them. But she ended up hitting the Sekirei\u2018s Ashikabi. He got mad and charged toward Tsukiumi. He pinned her against the wall. He was about to unlock her powers when you said <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cHey! You leave her alone. She\u2019s MY Sekirei! And I will defend her to the bitter end!\u201d</span> You jumped at the man and punched him away from Tsukiumi. Tsukiumi asked why you did that. <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cBecause you are my Sekirei and I can't explain it, but you have made the storm in my heart calm for the first time in years.\u201d </span>Tsukiumi looked shocked and said <span class=\"clblue\">\u201cThou hast courage. Not only didst thou protect me with thy own flesh, but also from that vile Ashikabi. For a monkey, thou are a man of metal. It\u2019s strange. But my heart which once clamored so loudly with protest, is surprisingly at peace now. What is thy name?\u201d</span> You said to her <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cMy name is Sasuke.\u201d</span> <span class=\"clblue\">\u201cThank you.\u201d</span> <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cLook, I know we don\u2018t know each other, but please be my sekirei. I saw you in my dreams for a reason. We\u2018re meant to be together, I\u2026I need you</span>.\u201d She gasped a little. <span class=\"clblue\">\u201cThou has said enough now. Very well then, the Sekirei Tsukiumi, will graciously accept thy proposal of marriage.\u201d</span> <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cMarriage proposal!?\u201d</span> She grabbed you by the collar of your shirt and said angrily <span class=\"clblue\">\u201cYou did call me thy Sekirei right?\u201d</span> You said yes and then she said <span class=\"clblue\">\u201cListen Sasuke, there is only one person who shall kill thee, from this day forward, and that\u2019s me.\u201d</span> She then kissed you hard on the lips. You began to blush and she had emerged and become your sekirei. She broke the kiss and started to walk away to get some distance. <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cExcuse me, miss.\u201d</span> <span class=\"clblue\">\"Thou may dispense with the formalities and address me as Tsukiumi. Thou aret my Ashikabi after all, as well as my husband.\"</span> You smiled and the two of you went to find a place to stay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Tsukiumi and I were using out powers to get you nice and wet. And I think you know my favorite element to use in battle.\u201d</span> Reaper tried to pull away, but you grabbed onto his wrists and knew he had no chance of escape. <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cThat\u2019s right. Chas Lightning!\u201d</span> you said as a blast of lightning came from your hands. Thanks to the water, it traveled through Reaper\u2019s body and sadly, you got a little fried yourself. You were both blasted away from each other. <span class=\"clblue\">\u201cSasuke!\u201d</span> She ran up to you and asked if you were alright. <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cYeah, I just got a little fried.\u201d</span> As you tried to get up, you noticed that Reaper was still standing. <span class=\"cgrape\">\u201cYou really know how to piss me off Sasuke. You\u2026will\u2026<b>DIE!!\u201d</b></span> he said as he charged at you. You tried to lift your arms, but because you got caught in the blast, your arms needed time to recover. As he charged at you, his anger had blinded him to the fact that Tsukiumi got in front of him until it was too late. <span class=\"clblue\">\u201cI will not let thee touch him!\u201d</span> she said as she thrusted the water blade into his chest. <span class=\"cgrape\">\u201cMaster Blackheart\u2026forgive me.\u201d</span> he said as he died. His body then turned to ash and Tsukiumi went to check on you. <span class=\"clblue\">\u201cAre you alright Sasuke?\u201d</span> <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cYeah, thanks to you. I say we go home now.\u201d</span> <span class=\"clblue\">\u201cAgreed.\u201d </span>She helped you up and you told her to hang on to you. <span class=\"clblue\">\u201cAlright.\u201d</span> She held onto you and you yelled <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cChaos Control!\u201d</span> Both of you were instantly transported back to Maison Izumo.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

If you fail, not only will the entire world be destroyed, but I will lose the person most precious to me; you. I beg of you Sasuke, you must win.\u201d</span> You knew this was the moment of truth. As Blackheart was getting ready to leave, he then saw your hands coming out of the hole in the canyon wall. <b><span class=\"cnavy\">\u201cI see you are still able to stand.\u201d </span></b>You came out of the wall and said <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cI will not fail.

And I will defend her to the bitter end!\u201d</span> Just then, a great power awakened inside of you and in that moment, a huge explosion came from where you were standing. When the dust cleared, Both Tsukiumi and Blackheart were surprised. You were surrounded by a golden aura and your hair was as golden as Tsukiumi\u2019s. The energy you had ended up destroying your shirt. <b><span class=\"cnavy\">\u201cWhat the hell?!\u201d</span></b> <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cBlackheart, your hour has arrived.\u201d</span></span></div></div>",

You were also born with the power of Chaos which made you the strongest member of your clan to ever exist. You swore to avenge your clan no matter what the cost. However, after your clan was destroyed, you were left alone to defend yourself. Until you soon met a man named Takahito. He took you in with his wife Miya Asuma. During some of that time, you learned about MBI and the Sekirei plan. Miya and Takahito soon turn this place into a boarding house. And it became home to Matsu, Homura, who also went by the name Kagari, and Uzume. All three of whom were Sekirei. You also met a man named Seo who built a secret room for Matsu who was on the run from MBI. He also had two lightning Sekirei named Hikari and Hibiki. But then, Takahito died one day and you did everything you could to help Miya, who was like a mother to you. All the while you still continued your training. Thanks to Miya, you kept getting stronger and stronger. Ten years later, the Sekirei plan continue to progress, and soon a man name Minato Sahashi, who was the same age as you move in with his Sekirei named Musubi. That is when things began to get more entertaining. Musubi was always excited to spar, and with you and Miya, her skills progressed each day. Not too long after that, Minato gained his second Sekirei named Kusano, or Ku for short. She was just a little girl but she saw Minato as her big brother. And then Matsu became his third Sekirei the next day. You had never seen an ashikabi gain three Sekirei in such a short time. But you had no idea that soon you would become and ashikabi yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a beautiful day and you decided to relax on the roof. You were enjoying the peace and quiet very much and decided to sleep. However, during your nap, you soon had an odd dream. You could only see a woman in a black dress with long blond hair stood before you. <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cWait a minute, who are you?\u201d</span> <span class=\"clblue\">\u201cAt last I have found you. I hope you\u2019re prepared ashikabi, for death!\u201d</span> she said turning toward you. You woke up in that moment and had a feeling this was more than just a simple dream. So you decided to see the one person you know could help you out with this. You knocked on Matsu\u2019s door. <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cMatsu, can I talk to you?\u201d</span> <span class=\"corange\">\u201cSure Sasuke.\u201d</span> she said before opening the door and you walked in. You also noticed Minato and Ku in the room too. <span class=\"corange\">\u201cSo what\u2019s up?\u201d</span> You told Matsu about your dream. <span class=\"corange\">\u201cWow, so the girl in your dreams wants to kill you huh? What did she look like?\u201d</span> <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cLet\u2019s see\u2026she had long blond hair, a black dress, and a really angry look on her face.\u201d</span> She began to search through that database of hers. <span class=\"corange\">\u201cFrom what you just told me, a Sekirei has now connected with you unconsciously. Its not surprising that a Sekirei would eventually react to you Sasuke, especially with the powers you possess.\u201d</span> You nodded and soon she got her answer. <span class=\"corange\">\u201cOh no. Sasuke is this her?\u201d</span> You looked at the screen and it was a perfect match. <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cYeah, that\u2019s her.\u201d</span> <span class=\"corange\">\u201cThis isn\u2019t good. Actually, this is really, really bad. That\u2019s Tsukiumi.\u201d </span>From the tone of her voice, this woman had quite the reputation among Sekirei. <span class=\"corange\">\u201cTsukiumi, Number 9. She\u2019s very dangerous. A water Sekirei. Infamous for her intense hatred of ashikabi. If she\u2019s reacting to your powers then, I imagine you\u2019ve damaged her pride an made her angry.\u201d</span> <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cI see. Well I have to find her.\u201d</span> <span class=\"cbrown\">\u201cSasuke, what happens if she does find you? She could kill you.\u201d</span> <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cMaybe. But I cant just ignore this.\u201d</span> <span class=\"corange\">\u201cHe\u2019s right. Well we might as well help him out.\u201d</span> You looked at Matsu surprised. She, Minato, Musubi and Ku decided to help you out. Musubi would travel the rooftops while Minato and Ku went with you. Though Matsu\u2019s title \u201cOperation: Kill or be Killed\u201d wasn\u2019t exactly encouraging, you all went with the plan. As you, Ku and Minato were walking around, you eventually were surprised by a cat who jumped off a small roof to get away. Ku caught the cat with the plant she was carrying before it hit the ground. <span class=\"ctan\">\u201cNice catch kid.\u201d</span> You all looked up to see Seo. It turns out he was on a job for a client that lost her cat. And of course Seo did this for the money. However Hikari and Hibiki soon arrived an they seemed to be running form something. <span class=\"clblue\">\u201cGet thee hence!\u201d</span> You looked up. <span class=\"clblue\">\u201cI said out of the way!\u201d</span> You soon found yourself on the ground. <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cUgh\u2026\u201d</span> <span class=\"clblue\">\u201cLoathed monkey, I bid thee-\u201d</span> she stopped as soon as she looked at you and she fell to her knees panting. <span class=\"clblue\">\u201cWhat does this mean?

Thou, thou art he!\u201d</span> she said as water formed around her. <span class=\"clblue\">\u201cI know thou seek to defile me, but all I shall grant I suffering. Thou shalt only be relieved through death!\u201d</span> You knew this wasn\u2019t good.</span></div></div>",

But she managed to cause you to lose your footing when she hit the ground just behind you. <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cWait. Just listen to me.\u201d</span> <span class=\"clblue\">\u201cNot on thy life. Water-\u201d</span> before she attacked, Kusano got in front of you and use her power of plants to cause a tree to change the field of the area. <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cKu, calm down. You cant fight her.\u201d</span> She stopped. <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cThank you, Ku.\u201d </span>you said smiling. <span class=\"clblue\">\u201cIt\u2019s a child. But why is she? You despicable fiend!\u201d </span><span class=\"cblue\">\u201cHuh?\u201d</span> <span class=\"clblue\">\u201cThou has sank thy claws into a child?\u201d</span> <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cHold on, its not what you think.\u201d</span> Water began to form a torrent around her. <span class=\"clblue\">\u201cFilthy man. What thou needest is a shower. Water Celebration!\u201d</span> she fired a blast of water an you an sent you into the wall of the building behind you. <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cShe\u2019s strong. That actually hurt a little.\u201d</span> you thought to yourself as you began to rise to your feet. She watched you while standing on a very large branch of Ku\u2019s tree. <span class=\"clblue\">\u201cWeakling. I only used a modicum of the power I possess. Before I give thee another taste of it, to what I thou want me to listen?\u201d</span> <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cI want you to be my\u2026no wait, I need you to be my Sekirei.\u201d</span> <span class=\"clblue\">\u201cWait, what was that?\u201d </span>Seo, Hikari and Hibiki stood by. <span class=\"ctan\">\u201cOoh.\u201d </span><span class=\"clblue\">\u201cHave I gone mad, or didst thou just request me to be thy Sekirei?\u201d</span> <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cThat\u2019s right, I did. I need your power.\u201d</span> <span class=\"clblue\">\u201cHow couldst thou be so shameless in public?\u201d</span> <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cShameless?\u201d</span> <span class=\"clblue\">\u201cAs much as I despise thee, I thought to spare thy life. But now\u2026\u201d</span> she said looking at you intensely. <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cYeah?\u201d</span> <span class=\"clblue\">\u201cI will destroy thee!\u201d</span> she said as she prepared to attack. <span class=\"cgrape\">\u201cUh-oh. She\u2019s serious.\u201d</span> You stood still ready to take whatever she threw at you. She fired of a blast of water so strong it wiped out a huge chunk of the building, but you were unscathed. Tsukiumi was on her knees panting. <span class=\"clblue\">\u201cI let my anger cloud my aim. I shall not be so careless with the next shot.\u201d</span> <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cGo ahead then. I\u2019m not moving until you listen to me. I\u2019m begging you.\u201d</span> She wobbled a little an place her hands on her heart. <span class=\"clblue\">\u201cWhy? Why doth my chest feel like this?\u201d</span> She thought to herself as she prepared another attack. <span class=\"cgrape\">\u201cHey Blondie! My sister and I aren\u2019t done with you yet.\u201d</span> <span class=\"clblue\">\u201cYou two. Didn\u2019t thou learn thy lesson last time?\u201d</span> <span class=\"cgrape\">\u201cOh please. The only one around here who is about to learn something is you. Seo.\u201d</span> <span class=\"ctan\">\u201cYeah, yeah.\u201d</span> She looked at Seo and thought. <span class=\"clblue\">\u201cThat man, another ashikabi?\u201d</span> <span class=\"ctan\">\u201cJeez, guess I got no choice. Hey, you might want to close your eyes kid. This might be too hot to handle for ya.\u201d</span> <span class=\"cgrape\">\u201cWould you just shut up and do it?\u201d</span> <span class=\"clblue\">\u201cWhat art thou going to do?\u201d </span>Seo looked at Hikari an moved to kiss her. Minato covered Kusano\u2019s eyes. <span class=\"cbrown\">\u201cKu whatever you do, don\u2019t look.\u201d</span> Seo kissed Hikari and empowered her and did the exact same to Hibiki. Tsukiumi was just speechless and blushing when she saw this.<span class=\"clblue\"> \u201cWhat on earth did that human just do?\u201d</span> <span class=\"cgrape\">\u201cOh that? It\u2019s simple.\u201d</span> <span class=\"crose\">\u201cHe empowered his Sekirei\u2019s.\u201d</span> The two of them clasped each others hand and raised them. <span class=\"cgrape\">\u201cBy the thunderstorm of our pact\u2026\u201d</span> <span class=\"crose\">\u201cOur ashikabi\u2019s perils will be destroyed!\u201d </span><span class=\"clblue\">\u201cThat\u2019s an incantation only emerged Sekirei\u2019s use.\u201d</span> The sky went dark when their incantation finished and a large sphere of lightning formed in the sky. You knew if that hit her, she\u2019d be done for. With their unclasped hands, they aimed the blast right at Tsukiumi. <span class=\"cplum\">\u201cHere comes, God\u2019s Song!\u201d</span> The lightning struck the ground an moved toward Tsukiumi. <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cWatch out!\u201d</span> you said charging in. After a few moments, Tsukiumi opened her eyes to see you were holding onto her. Needless to say she was surprised. <span class=\"cgrape\">\u201cCrap! That guy\u2019s blocking our shot!\u201d</span> She backed up looking at you. <span class=\"clblue\">\u201cWhy wouldst thou\u2026?\u201d </span>She turned her head and saw that the lightning devastated most of the alley. <span class=\"crose\">\u201cYou\u2019d be toast if he hadn\u2019t knocked you out of the way.\u201d</span> Her eyes widened and she looked at you. <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cHey, are you okay?\u201d </span><span class=\"clblue\">\u201cThis man. He protected me with his own body.\u201d</span> The twins were ready to attack again. <span class=\"cplum\">\u201cReady for more?\u201d </span>She stood up an charged at them. <span class=\"clblue\">\u201cBring-eth it!\u201d </span>She attacked them but her attack hit Seo and the cat got away. Seo was pissed off. As soon as Tsukiumi landed he came at her. <span class=\"ctan\">\u201cHey, you!\u201d</span> Tsukiumi turned and saw Seo sliding down a rail that ran up the building. He jumped an lane right in front of her. <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cSeo, please calm down.\u201d </span>He walked towards her. <span class=\"clblue\">\u201cStay back, fiend!\u201d</span> she said trying to smack him away but he grabbed her wrist and put her against the tree. <span class=\"ctan\">\u201cSo how are you going to pay me back Blondie?\u201d</span> <span class=\"clblue\">\u201cTake thy hands off of me.\u201d</span> <span class=\"ctan\">\u201cNot after you made me lose that cat and smacked my girls around.\u201d</span> She tried to call on her powers but couldn\u2019t. <span class=\"clblue\">\u201cMy strength, why can I not summon it?\u201d</span> she thought. <span class=\"ctan\">\u201cIf you\u2019re wondering how I\u2019m doing this it\u2019s thanks to my pal Takahito. He gave me a special ability. Oh yeah, one that cancels a Sekirei\u2019s powers. And as for payback, how about I make you emerge and become my Sekirei?\u201d</span> Seo got closer an Tsukiumi tried to push him back. <span class=\"clblue\">\u201cNo. This is not him. I do not want this. The one\u2026the one that I want is..\u201d</span> <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cHey, Seo.\u201d</span> <span class=\"ctan\">\u201cWhat?\u201d</span> <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cPlease let her go. If not I will fight you for her. It\u2019s because\u2026she\u2019s <i>my</i> Sekirei!\u201d</span> Tsukiumi looked at you in surprise. Seo smiled and let her go and looked at you. <b><span class=\"cgrape\">\u201cSEO!\u201d</span></b> The twins struck him with lightning and he was fried a little. <span class=\"cgrape\">\u201cDon\u2019t you remember what you said? That we\u2019re the only ones for you?\u201d</span> <span class=\"ctan\">\u201cWhoa, hold on.\u201d</span> <span class=\"cgrape\">\u201cMaybe this will jolt your memory a little. You ready sis?\u201d</span> <span class=\"ctan\">\u201cNow just wait, calm down. I was just trying to scare her.\u201d</span> He was hit with a large amount of electricity and was unable to move, yet he was alive for sure. Tsukiumi jumped down and looked at you. <span class=\"clblue\">\u201cMonkey. I heard. Thou called me 'My Sekirei' did thou not?\"</span> You nodded. <span class=\"clblue\">\"Then thou must take the responsibility.\"</span> <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cOf what?\u201d</span> She doused you with water when you asked that. <span class=\"clblue\">\"Do not jest! Thou said I was thy Sekirei correct?\"</span> <span class=\"cblue\">\"Yes, I did.\"</span> <span class=\"clblue\">\"Thou hast courage. Not only didst thou protect me with thy own flesh, but also from that vile Ashikabi over there.\"</span> You looked at Seo who was still pretty fried. <span class=\"cblue\">\"Not really.\"</span> She stepped closer to you. <span class=\"clblue\">\u201cFor a monkey, thou are a man of metal. It\u2019s strange. But my heart which once clamored so loudly with protest, is surprisingly at peace now. What is thy name?\u201d</span> <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cMy name, is Sasuke Uchiha.\"</span> <span class=\"clblue\">\"Thank you.\"</span> <span class=\"cblue\">\"Look, I know we don't know each other. But please be my Sekirei! I saw you in my dreams for a reason we were meant to be together. I.. I need you.\"</span> Tsukiumi gasped lightly. <span class=\"clblue\">\"Thou has said enough now. Very well then. The Sekirei Tsukiumi, will graciously accept thy proposal of marriage.\"</span> <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cMarriage proposal?!\u201d</span> She grabbed you by the collar of your shirt and asked angrily <span class=\"clblue\">\u201cYou did call me thy Sekirei right?\u201d</span> <span class=\"cblue\">\"Yes, I guess I did I'm sorry.\"</span> <span class=\"clblue\">\u201cSasuke.\u201d</span> <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cYes?\u201d</span> <span class=\"clblue\">\u201cOnly one person gets to kill thee, from this day forward. And that person is me.\u201d</span> she said as she kissed you full on the lips. <span class=\"clblue\">\"What? What is this? This feeling rising from my heart, it's so warm and strong. So this is emergence.\"</span> She thought to herself as she emerged. She leaned on you for a second then turned around walking away for a second then stopping. <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cExcuse me, miss.\u201d</span> <span class=\"clblue\">\u201cThou may dispense with the formalities and address me as Tsukiumi. Thou art my ashikabi after all.\u201d</span> She said before she turned toward you. <span class=\"clblue\">\u201cAs well, as my husband.\u201d</span> You smiled at this and went home with Minato, Ku, an now your own Sekirei, Tsukiumi.</span></div></div>",

You chuckled a little and of course, Miya knew she was your Sekirei.

The woman then asked \"You looking for a place to stay?\" You turned around and asked \"What did you have in mind?\" The woman tells you to follow her and you did. She led you to a place called Maison Izumo. She knew the land lady and she introduced herself as well. \"Nice to meet you both. My name is (Name).\" Kazehana and Miya liked your name and you went outside. Kazehana followed you and saw that you were training with the Shark Sabers again. She saw that you were blindfolded and was confused by this. But your movements were very powerful and graceful, like a true warrior. You stopped training and the sabers disappeared. You heard Miya call you and Kazehana to dinner.</span></div></div>",

She was a decent fight. Actually, her fighting was more than decent. She was the only one who was able to fight you on a level like this other than your old enemy Broodwing. But soon, she sent a shockwave at you, which you managed to send most of it into the ground to the side. But you still had a deep wound in your side, from which you were losing a large amount of blood. You passed out rather quickly and the five women gathered around you.

You are also the strongest member of the clan that ever lived, due to your power of Chaos. You swore to get revenge against a demon named Blackheart, who served someone, but you had no idea who. One night, you slept on the branch of a tree as usual, when you were met in your dreams by your dead brother Itachi.<span class=\"clred\"> \u201cSasuke.\u201d </span><span class=\"cblue\">\u201cItachi, it\u2019s good to see you again.\u201d</span> <span class=\"clred\">\u201cIt\u2019s good to see you too, but I am here to tell you that tomorrow, you will be captured by some kind of army.

You were soon surrounded by tanks and you knew this was Itachi spoke of, so you surrendered. You soon were brought through Kamikura Island and before you could use your powers to free yourself, the tank began to shake. You knew that it was now or never. You used your superior strength to break free of the chains and bust out of the tank before it was destroyed. Once you were free, you dusted yourself off to see five life forms before you. You could tell they weren\u2019t human thanks to your Sharingan.<span class=\"cbrown\"> \u201cIt seems you missed one Karasuba.\u201d</span> <span class=\"clgrey\">\u201cI guess I did.\u201d</span> she said before charging at you. You drew your sword and blocked her attack. Though she was surprised with the others, she continued as you continued to block the attacks. You then called on the power of earth to turn your hand to the hardest combination of minerals and  grabbed the sword. The woman was very surprised now. <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cDon\u2019t make me laugh.\u201d</span> you said as you landed a kick to her stomach. As soon as she was done, the male of the group attacked you as well, and you managed to beat him by sending a little lightning into his body. Another then called on the power of wind, but you blocked her attack with your own wind attack as well as send her back with it. You were left with only two of them, and you could tell only one could fight. <span class=\"corange\">\u201cI\u2019ll leave him to you.\u201d</span> You stared into the woman\u2019s eyes and you could tell she was much stronger than the others. <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cSeems I\u2019ll need to use all the skills I have against you.\u201d</span> The woman moved her sword and when she began to swing it, you had a bad feeling and got out of the path of the blade. But then, from her blade came a massive shockwave, which you barely avoided completely. <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cShe has more power than I thought! I need to be careful.\u201d</span> you thought. The woman then charged at you and you blocked her attack. Like the one they called Karasuba, she never stopped attacking, only she was much more skilled than she was. You soon had this funny feeling inside you, and you could tell she had this feeling as well, though she didn\u2019t show it much. Only you could see this. You had no idea why you had this feeling, but thinking about it gave her the opportunity to attack you and slice your side. You jumped back and gripped your side with one hand, still holding your sword in a position where you could attack or defend. But the woman stopped and you noticed that the same one from before came at you. She tried to fight you again and you blocked almost all of her attacks, but the wound in your side was causing you to lose a large amount of blood, and you were soon too weak to defend. <span class=\"clgrey\">\u201cLooks like this is the end. Too bad, I was having a lot of fun.\u201d</span> She raised her blade and you knew you were in trouble. But then someone yelled <span class=\"cmaroon\">\u201cStop!\u201d </span>You looked and saw a guy who seemed human to you. <span class=\"clgrey\">\u201cWhat is it Takahito?\u201d</span> <span class=\"cmaroon\">\u201cHe needs to stay alive Karasuba. We need to learn more about him and his powers. Kazehana, Matsu bring him inside.\u201d </span>The two women nodded and got under your shoulders, as you backed out, you noticed Karasuba getting ready, but the woman who caused the wound stopped her, and this time, Karasuba backed down. This was the last sight you had before losing consciousness. But as they were all walking in, Takahito spoke to the woman who you fought. <span class=\"cmaroon\">\u201cYou had a reaction didn\u2019t you?\u201d</span> The woman nodded. <span class=\"cmaroon\">\u201cI see. Well this day is very interesting indeed. I will put him in your hands for the time being.\u201d</span> </span></div></div>",

Just then, you heard something going through the air and the woman said \"Look out!\" She tackled you and the two of you managed to avoid a blast of purple lightning.

They then jumped in front of you and the girl and you took a fighting stance. But before you could take action, the girl grabbed your hand and the two of you ran for your lives. Somehow the two of you managed to escape, but you remembered nothing of the events from yesterday. You woke up and hit your hand on something. You turned your head and saw the girl from before lying next to you. You ended up hitting your head on the wall from the surprise. The girl woke up and said \"Oh, good morning. Thank you for lending me your pajama\u2018s.\" She ended up showing you her breasts and you looked away. You then told her \"If you need me, I will be outside. You just get dressed.\" She got dressed and grabbed your hand again. \"I didn't mean to get you involved. I'm so sorry. I wonder why I did that. I could've just run off by myself, but for some reason, I put your hand in mine without thinking.\" she said to you. \"Oh, we haven't been introduced yet. My name is Musubi. What's yours?\" You then said \"Call me (name).\" \"(name).\" she said \"That was very brave of you to save me back there. Thanks again.\" You told her that you didn't do anything, but then Musubi fell to the ground and asked if she was alright. Turns out, she was just hungry. She then went on about how she could ever repay you and you told her it's OK. She then told you she had nowhere else to go. You then said \"That is where you and I are alike.\" She then crawled up to you and said \"Your so kind. I wish someone like you could be my Ashikabi.\" You had no idea of what that means and she explained it to you. But as she explained it to your, she placed your hand on her breast. The two of you went outside to find those two girls again. They ended up attacking you and Musubi. They used the word Sekirei. You didn't know what that was, but Musubi began to run again. Then the two of you were trapped between the two girls in an alley. But then, Musubi kissed you and her power was unlocked. She then beat the girls and you went to find a place to stay. It was night when someone on the jumbo screen talked to you and Musubi and explained everything. You and Musubi then went to find a place to stay and ended up staying at a boarding house. The two of you went to bed shortly after.</span></div></div>",

But she had to admit, it was better than paying rent. As she was coming back from the market, she was sitting on the fence on top of a roof while eating some kind of sweet to enjoy the view. <span class=\"cmagenta\">\u201cThis one\u2019s for me.\u201d</span> she said to herself. But then, she felt a strange sensation all of a sudden. <span class=\"cmagenta\">\u201cWhat? This feeling\u2026\u201d</span> she thought. But then she heard some commotion coming from a rooftop that was a couple buildings away. <i>\u201cListen, we have had enough of you asshole!\"</i> some goon said. <i>\u201cYou have been beating down every one of our members that we send to mug people.\u201d</i> <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cYou think I would allow something like that to go on while I\u2019m around?\u201d</span> <i>\u201cWe\u2019re here to put an end to this once and for all!\u201d</i> he said as he and quite a few others charged at you. With minimal effort, you were able to nock them back a few feet. More and more gang members charged at you and you didn\u2019t need to put to much effort to keep them back. Uzume could only stare at you as you fought them off. Some of them pulled out swords and attacked all at once. You had no choice but to make an example of them now. You called on the power of fire and melted the blades instantly. <i>\u201cWhat the hell?!\u201d </i>one of them said. <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cNow do you see what you are up against? Beat it.\u201d</span> you said  as you walked towards the rooftop exit. But then, one of them pulled out a missile launcher and pointed it at you. <i>\u201cSay good-bye.\u201d</i> he said as he was about to pull the trigger. But then, you turned around and threw a kunai at his hand, forcing him to drop the weapon. <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cI am warning you for the last time. Leave.\u201d</span> you said as you pulled out your own sword. These guys had one last plan, so they decided to pretend to retreat. You decided to destroy the weapon before someone could get hurt. But when you weren\u2019t looking, one of them pulled out a grenade and threw it at the missile launcher. This was a fast acting one and you didn\u2019t have enough time to get out of there. Just before it was too late, you created a small barrier of energy and protected you from most of the blast. The goons knew better than to think you were dead and ran. You on the other hand were sent into the air. But your fall was cut short when you seemed to land on something soft. <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cWhat the?\u201d </span>you thought and you took a look at what you landed on. It seemed like you landed on a hammock or something. <span class=\"cmagenta\">\u201cHey, are you alright?\u201d</span> You looked up and saw Uzume in her vieled outfit. You found her pretty attractive. <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cY-yeah, I\u2019m fine. I\u2019ve taken worse hits.\u201d </span>Uzume once again felt that feeling inside her. <span class=\"cmagenta\">\u201cIt\u2019s you.\u201d</span> she said as she gently placed her hand on your cheek. <span class=\"cmagenta\">\u201cI\u2019ve found you. My Ashikabi.\u201d</span> You were about to ask what the hell she meant, but she kissed you on the lips. Uzume was now an emerged Sekirei, though now she had some explaining to do.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She told Hiahne and she let her find him. She began to use the rooftops to find their Ashikabi. She ended up near a mansion with a very large courtyard. They hopped on the roof and saw you. You were training in order to hone your powers. You control the power of chaos and you were training to focus your powers into your fists. A large number of machines you had created charged at you and you fought them off with ease. You didn't get the slightest scratch. As you continued to train, you could sense Benitsubasa. So you stopped training and the machines vanished. You looked up and said <span class=\"cblue\">\"Something I can help you with?\" </span>She jumped down while blushing and introduced herself. <span class=\"cred\">\"I'm Benitsubasa. You're my Ashikabi.\"</span> <span class=\"cblue\">\"Ashikabi? Do you mind explaining this to me? Come inside, you seemed to have traveled a ways.\"</span> you said as you walked towards the door. You showed Benitsubasa to the living room and she was amazed with some of the stuff in there.<span class=\"cblue\"> \"So, tell me what an Ashikabi is please.\" </span>Benitsubasa then explained everyhting about the Sekirei Plan, The Disapline Squad and eerything else she knew. It was a lot for you to take in, but in the end, you decided that having a girl like Benitsubasa in your life would be a good thing. Plus, you might be able to get a little action as well. <span class=\"cblue\">\"Alright. I will be your Ashikabi. Now how do you emerge?\" </span>Benitsubasa walked over to you, sat down next to you and kissed you full on the lips.

An do not hold back on my account.\" </span>As you led Hiahane and Karasuba to the courtyard, Benitsubasa came to watch as well. You took a fighting stance and the two Sekirei charged at you. Hiahane was the first to challenge you. You dodged her claws with the greatest of ease. You then focused a little energy into the tips of your first two fingers and gently tapped her forehead. She then passed out as soon as that happened. Karasuba was up now. She charged at you with her sword and you jumped onto one of the statues. You created a perfect copy of Hiahane's claws from your own energy. Karasuba was impressed by this and so was Benitsubasa. You then charged at her and she blocked it with her sword. The battle raged on for a little while when you decide not to hold back. You then focused the power of wind into your claws and you made an upward slice which made the wind knock her sword out of her hands. You then jumped into the air and caugth the sword. You the had the blade at Karasuba's neck and she knew you had her beat. You gave her her swor back and the claws on your hands disappeared. Hiahane woke up shortle after that and Benitsubasa ran up to you. <span class=\"clgrey\">\"Well, I am impressed.

You inediately began to increase your power by a great amount. You noticed a fewhigh powered slow motion camers and you decided to go with the Chaos Lotus (Which is a much stronger version of the Hidden Lotus). As soon as you were ready, you charged at the machine ith enough speed to destroy the ground behind you. You sent the machine into the air faster that anyone could blink. And then you used this speed to attack the fake multiple times. You created an energy threat and wrapped it around the machine and punched it with your left hand. But then you pulled it back ap and focused your energy into your right fist. <span class=\"cblue\">\"Now to end it! CHAOS LOTUS!!\"</span> Your fist made contact and then you sent the machine deep into the ground, destroying it instantly. Once you were back on the ground, you looked at the camera wher eyou knew Minaka was watching and said <span class=\"cblue\">\"If you make one more Benitsubasa impostor, you will be at the recieving end of that attack Minaka.\"</span> Benitsubasa was amazed with your power and feelings for her. You left the training room and when you got out, Benitsubasa wrapped her arms around you and embraced you. You did the same when Karasuba handed you a uniform similar to Benitsubasa's. You took the uniform and went to change. You used your powers to change it a little bit. Your shoulders had spikes on them and your fore-arms were armored. <span class=\"cred\">\"You look great Shadow.\"</span> <span class=\"cblue\">\"Thank you Benitsubasa, and so do you.\" </span>She blushed a little and you were now a member of the Disapline Squad.</span></div></div>",

You knew she would try to escape using the copies to distract you both. You used your powers to create a massive spiked earth wall to keep her from escaping.

The original created more  every time, but you knew it was only a matter of time before she ran out of energy.

You quickly ran up to her and saw that her Sekirei symbol was vanishing. <span class=\"cblue\">\"No! Benitsubasa! Please, don't leave me!\" </span>But her sekirei symbol completely vanished and she was gone. <span class=\"cblue\">\"Kagato! Kagato, you have stolen the one who was most precious to me.

You were close to dyeing as well, but before you did, Kagato grabbed Benitsubasa's head and crushed it in his hands. As soon as that happened, you woke up sweating like crazy. You looked and saw Benitsubasa, still completely unharmed andsafe. You got out of be and went to the balcony. About ten minutes later, Benitsubasa woke up to see you were not next to her.

The bartender looks at you for a second then nods and let's you behind the counter and takes you into the backroom where you walk down a flight of stairs hidden by a trapdoor. At the base of the stairs you open a metal door and see your friend, informant, and inventor looking at his computer. \"Typh I need\" You were cut off by Typh \"Information on this copy cat and your suit right?\" Typh answers turning to face you. \"What do you have?\" You ask nit surprised. \"Well for your suit I'm making some upgrades on the armor so only you mask and cloak are ready.

On the other side was a lab white room rows of weapons from melee to guns and explosives there was even anti tank, anti aircraft, and anti vehicle weapons lining the walls.

You undress and put your civilian clothes on a bare manikin You grab a light weight shinobi armor from a manikin and put it on. You then walk to your suit you stand and stare at it for a few seconds before finally speaking. \"I had hoped never too have to wear you again but it looks like that Reaper still has A part yet to play.\" You say before grabing the cloak and puting it on you then grab the red skull mask with black eye socket and put it onto your face. You feel it start moving on your hand completetly covering it and the optical systems activating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nanobots simply incredible.\" You say commenting on the masks properties before turnings around to the weapons. You grab only a silver desert eagle .50 caliber, a hand full of smoke and flashbangs, shuriken, LHR Combat Knife which you place in the knife holster on you chest armor, and eight spar cartigaes of .50 Action Express. You turn around and go out the door to Typh's room. \" Hold these for me will ya Typh.\" You say tossing the keys to your motorcycle to him which he caught without even looking. \"His last know coordaniates were at he warehouses at the pier and Watch your back out there ok?\" Typh says. \"We'll do my friend will do.\" You say walking through the door on the left side of the room.

Though it was not a challenge to them. Benitsubasa was the one to take care of it. She grew bored of opponents like this, of course, she wanted to find her Ashikabi as well. She had no idea that her Ashikabi would drop down from space itself. As she was heading back, Benitsubasa saw a green light head straight for a place called the arboretum (Note this is after the bridge escape and Kagari becomes Minato\u2019s 6th Sekirei) She decided to investigate. Karasuba called in that moment and told her that she and Haihane were heading there as well, along with about three dozen MBI troops. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-with you-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the arboretum, you had just crash landed onto the Earth and knew you couldn\u2019t just walk around looking the way you are. You decided to change your appearance into that of a human being. <span class=\"cgreen\">\u201cHow sad. To think I have to take on the form of a human. Oh well, this is only temporary.\u201d</span> You walked out of the crater an noticed that there were many human soldiers around you. \u201c<i>Hold it. You\u2019re coming with us.\u201d</i> one of them said. You smiled and said <span class=\"cgreen\">\u201cAs if I could be stopped by such a pathetic species.\u201d</span> In that moment, you drew your sword and sliced a soldier in half. The others fired at you in that moment, but you were able to avoid the bullets like they were nothing.  You slaughtered the soldiers and when only one of them was left, he tried to run. You pulled out your Dragon Dagger and threw it at him like a kunai. The blade pierced through his skull and killed him instantly. What you didn\u2019t know is that Karasuba and Haihane were watching from a distance. <b><span class=\"cgrey\">\u201cWell, this is one person I wouldn\u2019t mind as my Ashikabi.\u201d </span></b><span class=\"cnavy\">\u201cI bet it\u2019s because of the fact he has the same type of view of humans as you do Karasuba.\u201d</span> <b><span class=\"cgrey\">\u201cWell there is that. And also his sheer brutality. And my body does seem to have a small reaction from him.\u201d</span></b> <span class=\"cnavy\">\u201cFunny, mine does as well.\u201d </span>The two of them then notice you raise your hand and the dagger came out of the trooper\u2019s skull and into your hand. You put your sword away as well as your dagger. It was in that moment that Benitsubasa arrived and saw the devastating carnage. You turned toward her and knew she was no human. <span class=\"cgreen\">\u201cWell, things seem to have gotten interesting.\u201d</span></span></div></div>",

You can tell from the evidence around you that I am not one to be toyed with.\u201d</span> Benitsubasa almost grew so weak from your strong and commanding tone that she couldn\u2019t stand. She then explained to you everything about the Sekirei Plan she knew. Her role, the object of the game, even how to make a sekirei your own. Needless to say, this game peaked your interest. <span class=\"cgreen\">\u201cSounds like <i>my</i> kind of game. And you say I am your Ashikabi?\u201d</span> you said walking up to her. <span class=\"cred\">\u201cYes.\u201d</span> <span class=\"cgreen\">\u201cBefore you confirm that, you should know my true form. You see, this human body is nothing more than a ruse. Behold!\u201d</span> you said as you changed into your true Psycho Ranger form. To say the absolute least, Benitsubasa Haihane and Karasuba were extremely surprised. But now Benitsubasa\u2019s body had reacted much stronger to your now. She fell onto one knee as she collapsed. You changed your head into that of a human and bent down to look her in the eye. <span class=\"cgreen\">\u201cSo, you still think I\u2019m your Ashikabi?\u201d</span> <span class=\"cred\">\u201cThere\u2019s no question.

As my Ashikabi, I devote myself to your command.\u201d</span> <span class=\"cgreen\">\u201cVery good. As of this moment, you are my Sekirei, and I am your Ashikabi.\u201d</span> you said as you kissed her. Haihane &amp; Karasuba watched this. She is not denying the fact you could be her Ashikabi, but she was still not sure. In that moment, you and Benitsubasa jumped onto the rooftop where Karasuba was and they introduced her to you. You could tell that the silver haired one thought the same way you do. <b><span class=\"cgrey\">\u201cHello.\u201d</span></b> <span class=\"cnavy\">\u201cSo, you got a name?\u201d</span> <span class=\"cred\">\u201cOh that\u2019s right! I never got a name from my Ashikabi.\u201d</span> <span class=\"cgreen\">\u201cI have no human name, but I might as well give myself one.\u201d</span> You thought about it for a moment. <span class=\"cgreen\">\u201cCall me, Kurai.\u201d</span> <b><span class=\"cgrey\">\u201cA name that fit\u2019s the way you slaughtered those pathetic humans.\u201d</span></b> <span class=\"cgreen\">\u201cYes. Now, take me to this, MBI tower. I wish to rest from my journey through space.\u201d</span> They all nodded and led you to the tower, with Benitsubasa at your side the whole way there. Once you got there, you were brought to your own room. You decided to sleep up against the wall that night. </span></div></div>",

But before the three of you could leave the room, Karasuba showed up. <span class=\"cgreen\">\u201cKarasuba, you needed something?\u201d</span> <b><span class=\"cgrey\">\u201cNo. But you will need my help in order to get inside the vault.\u201d</span></b> <span class=\"cgreen\">\u201cI appreciate the help, though I am curious as to why you wish to assist me at all.\u201d</span> <b><span class=\"cgrey\">\u201cMy reason is simple, you have been peaking my interests this whole time. I\u2019m just making sure you continue to do so.\u201d</span></b> You chuckled and said <span class=\"cgreen\">\u201cFair enough. Leas the way.\u201d</span> You, Yuri and Sakura followed Karasuba down to the vault where the defeated sekirei\u2019s were kept. You noticed that the pickings were not that diverse, though you soon found two suitable hosts for the two of them. <span class=\"cgreen\">\u201cPsycho Yellow, here is one that will suit you very well.\u201d</span> Psycho Yellow walked up to the sekirei. <span class=\"cyellow\">\u201cWhat is this one called?\u201d</span> <b><span class=\"cgrey\">\u201cThat is number 43, Yomi. That scythe there is her weapon of choice.\u201d</span></b> <span class=\"cgreen\">\"You should be able to use that weapon with ease.\"</span> <span class=\"cyellow\">\u201cI agree with you Kurai.\u201d</span> You pushed the button and opened the capsule so that Psycho Yellow was able to enter the body. Once she did that, the sekirei symbol reappeared, though she was not an emerged sekirei anymore. <span class=\"cgreen\">\u201cAre you in complete control, Psycho Yellow?\u201d</span> <span class=\"cyellow\">\u201cYes, Kurai.\u201d</span> <span class=\"cgreen\">\u201cExcellent. Now for you Psycho Pink. This one has no weapon, but you will be able to use your bow.\u201d</span> <span class=\"cpink\">\u201cAgreed. What is the name?\u201d</span> <b><span class=\"cgrey\">\u201cNumber 44, Yumi.\u201d </span></b>Psycho Pink entered the body and took control. <span class=\"cgreen\">\u201cPerfect, and now to add the finishing touch, making the two of you my sekirei\u2019s.\u201d</span> Both of them nodded and you made the two of them emerge. Needless to say, Karasuba was still very amused by your plans.</span></div></div>",

Once you got out of the building, you changed into Psycho Green and went off to find the source of your amusement, killing humans.

As another one ran, you threw your dagger into his skull and as he was still standing on his lifeless feet, you chopped him right across middle. The last one you decided to be creative. You pulled out the dagger from the dead human\u2019s skull and used your power to give this human a whole new level of pain without killing him. After giving him a nice shock with your Psycho Lightning, you wanted him to suffer more. You cut off both his hands, then his forearms, then his arm off his shoulders. Then you sliced his legs off, the same way you cut his arm off, one part at a time. Then you stabbed him multiple times in the torso with your sword. And before he died of blood loss, you crush his skull slowly and painfully. <span class=\"cgreen\">\u201cThese humans are so weak, but I will not have to deal with them for much longer.\u201d </span>You changed back and went back to MBI, leaving the massacre for the human authorities to find.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

That person seemed to check your pulse and the like, then left again. Once he or she was gone, you grabbed your shirt and jacket and left the hospital out the window. You were not sure if you could trust them or not, so you had no choice but to run. Later on, Benitsubasa entered and noticed you were gone. <span class=\"cred\">\u201cHey Haihane, the guy you think is your Ashikabi is gone!\u201d</span> <span class=\"cnavy\">\u201cWhat?\u201d</span> <span class=\"clgrey\">\u201cLooks like we have a little chase on our hands.\u201d </span>In that moment, the three of them chased after you. Benitsubasa and Karasuba almost caught you, but you managed to avoid them with a quick burst of speed. Benitsubasa did get extrmely frustrated, being a total hothead. Eventually they lost sight of you. They needed to find you again. Though for Haihane it isn\u2019t that hard. She just followed her gut instinct to find her Ashikabi. Eventually, she found you standing on the second highest rooftop in the city. She stood on top of the tallest roof which was next to the one you were on. By following Haihane, Karasuba and Benitsubasa made it to the same location. <span class=\"clgrey\">\u201cLooks like we found him.\u201d</span> <span class=\"cred\">\u201cLet\u2019s get him already.\u201d</span> <span class=\"cnavy\">\u201cNo, lets wait a minute.\u201d </span>Karasuba then pulled out three sets of special goggles so that they could see you and get a closer look without you knowing. They then noticed you pulling out a locket (shaped like the Uchiha Crest) from the inside of your shirt. They saw you open it to reveal a picture of you, your parents and your brother when you were young. They couldn\u2019t make out a word that you were saying, but they did see a tear run down your cheek. They couldn\u2019t help but wonder what happened in your past, especially Haihane. Before they could stop her, Haihane jumped down right behind you. You notice this and put your locket in your shirt and get ready to fight. But then she says\u2026.</span></div></div>",

You are also the strongest member of the clan that ever lived, due to your powers of chaos. You don't remember too much about your past. You swore to get revenge for your clan against the Master (of Evil) and his 10 Terrors, who were sealed away by your Mother, Father and Brother. You knew the time would soon arrive where they would rise again. Some of the minions of the underworld have already started to rise, such and the Hideaks, who were foot soldiers of the underworld. One day, you were battling the Hideaks and a general not too far from the outside of the capital city. The Hideaks were too easy, but the general was a different story. This thing was like a combination of a demon and a centipede, and his striking speed matched the animal. His claws were covered in venom, luckily you had an anti-venom ready, but not just for him, for the other four that worked for Blackheart.. The two of you clashed for quite some time, but you here gaining the upper hand. <i>\u201cYou are getting better Sasuke, my master will be pleased that I will have destroyed you.\u201d</i> <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cNot on your life Rantipede!\u201d</span> you said as you sliced his chest. <i>\u201cYou are getting better Sasuke, you might be a match for the others if you can defeat me.\u201d</i> <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cLet me tell you this, I will never lose to you, Blackheart, The Ten Terrors or the Master!\u201d</span> you said as you called on the power of lightning. <i>\u201cWhat?!\u201d</i> <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cHere I come!\u201d</span> you said as you charged at him with your sword surrounded by lightning. You then thrusted the blade forward and pierced his chest. But before he died, he managed to strike you 100 times with his poison claws. And sent you flying at the last strike. In about 30 seconds, you returned to the city and crashed into an alley. You were feeling extremely weak. You knew this was because of Rantapede\u2019s venom. You had to act quickly. You pulled out the last anti-venom sample for Rantipede and got ready to inject it into you. But just before you could act, your body was paralyzed. <span class=\"cblue\">\"No, I can't move!\"</span> you thought to yourself. The venom was acting much faster due to the multiple strikes. You were losing consciousness and you ended up dropping the anti-venom. You thought that you were going to die then an there, but before the vaccine hit the ground, you heard someone catch it. Another person picked your body off the ground and set you against the wall. <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cThe anti-venom\u2026\u201d</span> you said weakly. <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cInject it into my chest\u2026please\u2026\u201d </span>A couple of seconds later you felt a sharp pain in your chest right before you passed you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

How did I get up here?\u201d</span> You then noticed two girls jump onto the rooftop as well. They were wearing maid outfits for some reason.

But I can\u2019t get you involved in my battles.\u201d</span> <span class=\"cgrape\">\u201cSorry to tell this to you, but it\u2019s too late.\u201d</span> <span class=\"cmagenta\">\u201cBoth of us truly believe that you\u2019re our Ashikabi, and that means we were destined to be together.\u201d</span> You saw that they were serious and you let out a sigh. <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cWell, nothing I can do about it.

After you graduated from high school you moved to a little town called Shinto Teito. You were trying to find a place to live so you could settle down, live your life, and hopefully find a girlfriend<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) Hmm. I wonder if I can find a decent place to live. I mean I can't get a girl to like me if I don't have a place to live.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walked to a nearby park. You sit a bench and rested for a while. You unzipped your backpack and got out a box of stick cookies. As you snacked on them you looked to your surroundings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) Wow. Shinto Teito is a great place! I've never seen sights so beautiful. Hopefully I'll be able to find a girl in this place after I find a place to live. Well might as well keep looking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were just about to start walking into down when you see something. There on a bench next to you was a girl. She had short brown hair, wore a long white dress that resembled a kimono, and had a strange pattern on her forehead. When you saw her you were awestruck by how pretty she was, but you also saw that she looked sad and lonely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) Wow! She's gorgeous! but...she looks so alone. She looks like she could use a friend. but.....she'll probably turn me down like all the other girls. Then again I can't just leave her there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat do you do?</span></div></div>",

With mulit-piloted robots such as the Getter, depending on the which form's abilities you are using you have that pilot's personality, eg if Getter 1 then Ryoma Nagare. G Gundam and ONLY G Gundam is to be accepted here because G Gundam is the only Gundam series classified as a Super Robot series. Even then it is the God Gundam. Furthermore, all Super Robots shall be reffered to, during the power options since they will not be reffered to afterwards, by their original Japanese names, eg God Gundam not Burning Gundam. Same goes with attacks but translations are accepted, eg Erupting God Finger not Erupting Burning Finger. Final point, and this goes to you Venom, NO NARUTO INVOLVMENT! NO SASUKE! NO SASUKE'S OLDER BROTHER! NOT EVEN THEIR LAST NAME!!!</span></div></div>",

Then another one grabbed a bunch of kunai knives from his belt and threw them at you. You didn't even bother to dodge them. They hit you in the heart and areas like that. \"Ouch.\" you said. The thugs were surprised and one of them asked \"What is this guy? Is he immortal?!\" \"Isn't that obvious you fools.?\" you asked as you used your scythe to slice them to ribbons. It was a blood bath.. You put your scythe away and walked up to her. \"Are you alright?\" you asked as you held out your hand. She took your hand and told you \"I'm fine now. Thanks to you.\" She knew that you were her ashikabi. She then explained all the details of the sekirei plan that she knew about. You nodded and said you would be glad to be her ashikabi.

Thanks again.\"</span> <span class=\"cblue\">\"I didn't do anything.\" </span>But then Musubi fainted and you went to see if she was okay. But you bought her a few burgers and said <span class=\"cblue\">\"I get it now, you fainted form hunger.\"</span> <span class=\"cpink\">\"Oh Sasuke, I owe you everything, but I don't know how I'm ever gonna repay you. Not only did you save me but you gave me food too.\"</span> <span class=\"cblue\">\"No it's ok. You can eat all you want.\"</span> You then ecided to recap as she ate the burgers. But then she told you that she had nowhere else to go and asked if she could stay with you again. You agreed and Musubi said <span class=\"cpink\">\"Thanks so much, you've saed me once again.\"</span> <span class=\"cblue\">\"Hey, that reminds me, why were those two girls...\" </span>you were cut off by Musubi who looked at you and said <span class=\"cpink\">\"You're so wonderful, kind and giving. I wish someone like you would be my Ashikabi.\"</span> <span class=\"cblue\">\"Ashikabi?\"</span> <span class=\"cpink\">\"A special one I'm supposed to find.\" </span>She then took your hand <span class=\"cpink\">\"I've been looking so long for mine. Even though we never met, our Ashikabi's are the ones we were born to serve. It's our job to guide them, to the higher sky above.\" </span>she said as she placed your hand on her heart.</span></div></div>",

Just then you both fell to the ground and the girls showed up again. Musubi then moved towards you and then she kissed you. Then she seemed to be stronger than before.
