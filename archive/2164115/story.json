            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A bright and sunny morning in New York City, in one of the most upscale neighbourhoods in city stood a very large manor, with both an indoor and outdoor pool. The home was massive, with so many rooms that you could do almost any activity without ever needing to leave the property. The home belonged to a mere 4 person family, and one that had been living there for almost ten years since they had won one of the largest lotterys in history.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst was Mr. Sean Rodgers. He was tall, handsome, in excellent shape and made women weak to their knees when they saw him. For 55 the man was quite good looking, but a lot of money can also help that. Before the lottery win, Sean owned a small restaurant, and his dream was to one day own a franchise. When they won the lottery, Sean took a bit of the money and launched his restaurant with a proper team making it extremely successful. Over the past decade, the franchise made the family even more rich than before, giving them essentially unlimited access to money. Sean enjoyed running the business, and loved helping his family.is daughter Stacy had recently been working with Sean at the business. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the family had different motivations, however.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamantha for one, didn't have a career before winning, so she found the money fun right away, and really wanted to splurge on the family. She picked the house, and she got them new electric cars, new clothes and offered to pay for college for the girls. Samantha however, found that she needed to keep busy, so learned to cook in her new kitchen with an instructor. Sam learned tons of skills, and began to enjoy the culinary wonders of the world. At the beginning, Sam actually was losing weight because of her gym memberships and all of her activity. Sam initially weighed 180 pounds before winning the lottery, but since winning she shed off 40 pounds and looked thinner than she had in years. However, Sam just wanted to do as much as possible, which meant trying new food, traveling, trying new wines and beers, learning new sex positions with Sean, and other activities were all she was doing. 4 years into winning, she broke her leg training for a marathon. She was forced to stay seated for 12 weeks, keeping away from physical activity. Sam was distraught at first, but eventually came to enjoy some relaxation time. The 12 weeks came and went, but Sam had put on 20 pounds from snacking and eating new foods without exercise. Sam developed a fondness for the way she felt relaxing, and began fitting it in more and more even when she could walk and go to the gym. For years she was gaining and losing weight, but always slowly gaining in the end. 7 years after winning and Sam had put on 100 pounds, putting her at 220 pounds, the heaviest she'd ever been. Sam did not enjoy the weight, Sean didn't mind as much as she would've thought, considering they were still very active in the bedroom. Still though, Sam wasn't fond of her appearance. Once, she was a hot blonde girl, with large breasts and a bangin' ass, and now, at the age of 47, she had thick thighs, a decent spare tire that drooped and had multiple rolls, even larger breasts (one thing she did like), a double chin and an enormous ass. The next three years she kept her weight more steady, only going up to 240 pounds, giving her a bigger belly and even more leg fat. Sam has come to terms with her gain a bit more now, still not wanting to gain more, but more confident than she would've thought. One factor for that was Chloe. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChloe was the oldest daughter of Sam and Sean. When they won she was 20 years old and hadn't started college yet due to their low finances. She was close to saving up enough, but when they won Sean and Sam paid her way through university. Chloe had tons of money to spend, and her parents bought her a car and her own place for her and her friends. This left Chloe with virtually no responsibility and she began to live big, rather quickly. Chloe experimented with boys, girls, drugs, alcohol and anything else she could think of. She loved going out to clubs and drinking beer and liquor, as well as taking her friends out for breakfast, lunch and dinner. Her and her roommates took full advantage of her wealth and indulged on almost every occasion. Chloe forgot about school for the most part but did enough to pass for her first two years. It wasn't until her third year when she flunked out and moved back home. Chloe had become quite a mess, and her parents were caring and helped her clean up her act. Over the first three years, Chloe transformed from high school hot girl and sexy barista, into a much thicker and fuller version of herself. Chloe put on 80 pounds in 3 years, putting her at 200 pounds. While home, she managed to lose some weight for a couple of years and stay slimmer, but Chloe had never lost that indulgent trait she gained from college. When her parents weren't home, she'd order take out and gorge herself. As of today, ten years later, she was by far the fattest in the house. The past few years Chloe has been eating more and more and more, and despite her Mothers nagging, she continued to grow. Chloe now weighed 275 pounds, and at the age of 30 still lived with her parents, which they were very happy about. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLastly, there's Stacy, the youngest daughter. Stacy is not very similar to her sister, in fact, she tries to do whatever her sister didn't. Stacy was 18 when they won, meaning she went to college too, but took a year off to travel. Stacy went to school for business, and watched her sister flunk out and fatten up. Stacy graduated with flying colours and a slim figure. She works with Sean and lives at home because Sean and her work from there. Even 10 years later, Stacy has kept her figure, remaining at a sleek 120 pounds. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCurrently, Sam is sitting on the couch, watching TV. Her pants unbuttoned due to the bag of chips she had just finished snacking on. Her belly looked prominent at the angle she was sitting at, and her fat breasts were resting on her bloated gut. One of the maids, Hannah, came and took the garbage. \"Thank you Hannah, you're such a gem.\" Sam said, thankful for the help. \"Of course Mrs. Dodgers, I love to help out, you know that. Anything else I can get you?\" Hannah asked happily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you know when dinner is?\" Sam asked, a little embarrassed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I believe Sean said they'll be home for 6, so not for a few hours, m'am. Would you like another snack?\" Hannah asked her boss. \"I can make you something sweet if you'd like.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh I'd love something sweet, what are you thinking?\" Sam asked, clearly interested in more to eat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll make a couple things, dessert for after dinner too! I'll let you pick you r thing when I'm ready, just give me some time.\" Hannah responded, running to the kitchen excitedly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>She likes to bake that's for sure hehehe... I could really go for something soon though, hopefully Chloe stays in her room... I can't let her see me eating so much, It'll only take away my point,</i> Sam thinks to herself. Little does Sam know, Chloe is in her own room, scarfing down her third burger she smuggled in to the house. Pizza boxes were scattered on her floor, bags upon bags from different fast food establishments were littered throughout her room. After her burger, she had an extra large poutine lined up, as well as two cheesy hot dogs. <i>Mmmm oh my GOD this is so good</i>, Chloe thought to herself as she took another large bite from her burger. <i>I need to order some dessert, it's hard to move but dammit I fuckin want some ice cream, and maybe some pies.. oh and what the hell, two milkshakes.</i> Chloe typed in her order, and leaned back as she finished the last bite of the burger, releasing a loud belch. \"BRRRaahhhppp!!! Oh my.. *HIC*... god, that tasted so good... mmmm.\" Chloe looked completely engorged, her 275 pound body crushing the bed frame. Her belly was quite large, and currently exposed as she had taken off her shirt. Her boobs were currently laying out onto her large gut, jiggling with every breath. Her prominent double chin was covered in grease and her arms looked thick and meaty. Chloe had expanded into a whale, and it appears she's only just awakening to it now. \"God I can't believe how fat I am, it's insane. I'm such a fucking pig, but it doesn't even matter, I just can't stop eating myself silly. It's never enough, I just want more, and more and more... speaking of, where's my poutine and hot dogs!\" Chloe grabbed the poutine and began inhaling it, drinking the gravy like water.  \"Mmm.. oh my goodness.... *HIC* *BRRAHHP!* oh my fucking god this is good... *HIC*... mmm Fuck I need more of this!\" Chloe gorged herself silly in secret.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam had no idea of what was going on, but she was also preoccupied with her own food. She was given her own 2 tier chocolate cake for a snack, which Sam ate more of than she intended. <i>Holy fuck Hannah is a great baker... I can't eat anymore but I need to, it's too good, just one more slice...</i> Sam was thinking to herself as she was almost done half of the cake. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As 6 o'clock rolled around, Sean and Stacy pulled up to the house, exiting their Tesla. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well kiddo today was great wasn't it? We secured 3 new locations, and our numbers are still going up steadily!\" Sean beamed, clearly happy with the work they had done. Sean looked very handsome and sharp in his suit, showing off his large arms and shoulders but still looking ready for business. Seans black and grey styled hair, perfect teeth and ocean blue eyes made him a catch for all the ladies, which was only good for business. Sean grabbed his briefcase from the car and continued talking to Stacy, \"I really couldn't have done it without you, you're such a valuable asset to me. Having you in there to back me up makes me the most confident man in the world.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStacy looked flattered by her loving fathers remarks, and as she grabbed her bag from the car she replied to him, \"Aw thanks dad, you are really too kind.\" Stacy had black hair like her father, while Chloe and Sam both shared the blonde. Stacy was in perfect shape, especially for her 30s. Stacy had perky DD breasts, she got them after school as a gift to herself. Stacy had a near perfect ass, as she worked out endlessly. Stacy was smoking hot, which was only great for business. \"I will say this, we make a hell of a team, we're only going to grow our business more and more, I have plans to keep us on the right track. <b>BIG</b> plans.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey both began to walk into the house, noticing it was rather quiet and dim, Sean called out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello? We're home!\" Sean said in a sing songish kind of voice as he slipped off his Italian leather shoes. \"Anyone here?\" Sean and Stacy both began to hear footsteps approaching, and saw Hannah come around the corner. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello there Mr. Rodgers, Ms. Rodgers, good to see you.\" Hannah said, smiling towards her boss's. Hannah was around 5'4, and had gorgeous brown hair down to her shoulders. Hannah was very fit, having a very firm and physically fit behind and a flat stomach. Her breasts were a C cup, showing minor cleavage in her formal uniform.  \"The girls are just napping currently, but I will have them woken up now seeing you are home. Supper is almost ready, only need a few more minutes.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course she's napping,\" Stacy said under her breath, \"fucking lazy slob of a sister.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cVery good Hannah, thank you very much! Looking forward to what you guys prepared tonight.\u201d Sean said, walking into the living room followed by Stacy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- -------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Hannah walked into Sams bedroom to wake her up, she spotted her sprawled out on the bed. Sam laid there with her clothes still on, her blouse full unbuttoned showing her boobs in her bra, and her pants pulled down to her ankles. She was truly a sight to see, one that Hannah enjoyed. Hannah hadn't been aware of these feelings until she worked her, rather since she met Chloe. Hannah began feeling towards Chloe, but knows she can't act. Hannah turned her feelings into a type of pleasure, by feeding both Chloe and Sam plenty of food. Hannah was another reason for Sams weight gain in recent years, since Hannah would always give her treats and seconds. Hannah was turned on looking at the plump 50 year old woman. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey there Mrs. Rodgers.... wakey wakey... time for dinner...\" Hannah said, trying not to wake her boss to abruptly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam began to awake slowly, moaning as she felt Hannahs hand rubbing her belly. \"Mmmm... uh.. *SNORT*\" Sam quickly awoke after that, catching her breath and seeing it was only Hannah. \"Oh boy... oh pardon me Hannah... thanks for waking me up. Did you happen to uh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The living room is all cleaned, and the rest of the cake is gone. No evidence, don't worry Mrs. Rodgers.\" Hannah said, cheerfully. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh thank you so much, I'm embarrassed by my habits enough already as it is... ugh... I ate three quarters of that cake, god I'm such a disgusting pig. No wonder I keep getting fatter, your food is too good Han. I can't resist.\" Sam said, poking her gut, causing Hannah to hold in how wet she was getting from all of this.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think you look great, you're being silly. Nothing wrong with enjoying yourself, Mrs. Rodgers. And you have so much to enjoy, what's wrong with taking advantage of it?\" Hannah said, pleasantly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're too nice Han, really, I can't believe how lucky I am to have hired you,\" Sam said with a smile, \"Well, I better get ready to eat some more hahaha, jeez this is some life. I still feel so stuffed from that cake.\" Sam said, rubbing her belly as Hannah walked out of her massive room, closing the door behind her. <i>Oh my god Hannah, keep it together. If they find out that this gets me off they're gonna fire my ass and think I'm some kind of fucking weirdo. </i>Hannah thought to herself as she leaned up against the wall. <i>I gotta cool down, I can only imagine what Chloe looks like right now</i>....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- -------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChloes room was a disaster zone, having garbage and wrappers littered all over her floor and stacking up on her furniture, it had an unpleasant smell that wafted over the entire apartment. As Hannah entered, she looked in the dark and tried to find Chloe in the large and messy room. Her massive TV was on, playing some streaming site, and then Hannah saw her. Laying on her bed, surrounded by garbage and old food, was the girl that awoke Hannahs new feelings. Chloe resembled a hippo sleeping, her belly moving up and down as she breathed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Chloooee... wakey wakey...\" Hannah said to no avail, resulting in her having to move Chloe to wake her. As she put her hand on Chloes fat arms she began to rock her, feeling the meat squeeze in her hand. <i>Okay, Hannah, don't lose yourself... you're just following orders, just trying to wake her up, nothing else.... come on...</i>Slowly, Chloe awoke, looking over at Hannah, not concerned looking whatsoever. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh hey there, like the view? HA!\" Chloe said, jiggling as she laughed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh haha just time for dinner is all, sorry to intrude Ms. Rodg-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey call me Chloe, how many times must I tell you that?\" Chloe said, giggling as she heaved her body out of bed and towards to the dining room. \"Good lord I hope you guys made a lot of food, cause I'm feeling peckish after that nap hehehe...\" Chloe laughed as she rubbed her belly. Hannah was having a hard time controlling herself, especially since as Chloe has grown she has only become more vocal about it, almost taunting Hannah as if she knew. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh don't worry, there's plenty.\" Hannah smirked, thinking about Chloe even larger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- -------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Chloe waddled towards the dining room table, her family all looked at her, clearly noticing how slobish she looked. Sean didn't intervene, he just wanted his family happy no matter what. Stacy just rolled her eyes, thinking, <i>Oh my god what a fucking blimp, I can't believe her. Those clothes barely even fit her... ugh what a slob.</i> Sam was upset, seeing her daughter was only looking bigger and bigger every time she saw her. But Sam was in a tough spot to talk, especially in the last little while. She was bigger than ever, and snacking like crazy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, let's eat!\" Chloe said as she sat down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHannah and the other staff rolled out their meals. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tonight is Steak and Mashed Potatoes, with gravy, roasted potatoes with 5 cheeses, bacon mac and cheese, and some salads of course as well. Eat up!\" Hannah said joyfully, seeing Chloe and Sam light up at the food. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come to Mama! MMMMMM!!\" Chloe said, biting into her massive steak without abandon or cutlery. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chloe use your fork and knife!\" Sam said, grabbing her plate and taking a bite from the cheesy potatoes. \"Ohhh myy goodness... this is just so goooood...\" Sam began to take another bite, followed by many more. Sam began chowing down and eating the delicious food quickly. Sam dropped her empty bowl on the table and rubbed her belly, thinking, <i>Okay, that's probably enough. Although, we should at least try my steak, to be respectful of course...</i> Sam took a large bite from her thick steak, and her face said it all. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hooooly fuck that's amazing, I can't believe this wow, okay a little more.\" Sam said to herself, eating the steak quickly, moaning quietly while eating. Chloe was already done her steak, and was forking down her potatoes quickly, washing them down with straight gravy. She was an absolute pig, getting food all over herself, making her sister grossed out but not phasing Sean. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Love to see my family enjoying their meals!\" Sean said happily, watching Sam unbutton her blouse. As the food began to disappear, Stacy had left the table, Sean was reading a book, and Sam was sitting back in her chair, grabbing her bloated belly while Chloe ate the rest of the food on the table. Chloe had burst out of her pants and her shirt exposed her full belly, making Hannah wet just thinking about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay now, who wants dessert!?\" Hannah shouted, to which Chloe said, \"Fuck yes! Bring it on, I'm not stopping 'til I can't go anymore!\" Sam looked physically uncomfortable. On one hand, she was stuffed to the brim, on the other hand, Hannah made great dessert....<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I've been sitting for a few minutes, I could maybe fit a slice of cake in.\" Sam said, rubbing her belly as Hannah smiled, just thinking about feeding Sam and Chloe until they couldn't move. Hannah came back with a trolley laid out with plenty of sweets. Chloe began to lick her lips looking at the spread, thinking about putting as much of it into her belly as humanly possible, while Sam looked nervous at first, but then seeing all the options, she began to overthink what she wanted to eat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mrs. Rodgers, what can I get you?\" Hannah said, pushing the food closer to Sam, making her drool slightly at the food. <i>Sam no! You can't!</i> Sam heard her will power shouting, unsure of what to do. <i>If you eat this you'll lose your figure! Resist!</i> Sam pondered for a couple more seconds, before making her choice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll take some cake, and I'd love to try some of that apple pie there too... oooh those brownies look delicious... okay maybe a couple of those and some cookies... y-yeah, t-that's not too much, trying to watch my figure after all.\" Sams plate began to look loaded from the sweets, and she began to take a bite from her pie moaning as she tasted it. \"Mmmmmmm oh my god Hannah! This is spectacular!\" Sam said, taking a second, bigger bite. Soon Sam was moaning and stuffing herself rapidly, looking like she'd maybe need more dessert....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Sam ate, Chloe began grabbing her food, and having Hannah bring her more milk to guzzle down. Chloe stuffed cake, pie, doughnuts, brownies, cookies, cupcakes and ice cream sundaes, covering her face in dessert. Chloes gut looked more and more full from the food as she ate with gusto, moaning and popping out of her clothes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy FUCK Hannah! YO-*UUURRRPP*!! YOU, are fucking... *hic* incredible!!! *munch munch munch* I'll take some more doughnuts *BURRP* please!!\" Chloe said, straddling her large bloated belly, looking like a slob, almost popping out of her bra and exposing her breasts to Hannah, who might just come if she does. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHannah had to work very hard keeping the food on it's way for the girls, but her focus drifted occasionally, fantasizing of one of them asking for her to do more than just feed them like a waitress. Hannah knew she couldn't do that, even if she thought Chloe would be into it. <i>I'll just have to keep waiting...</i> Hannah thought, bringing a second carton of Milk for Chloe, who was almost tapped out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChloe had a doughnut currently stuffed in her mouth, trying to drink milk to wash it down. She eventually did finish chewing, but Hannah could tell she was tapped out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm... *UUURRPP* ughh... I'm... *hic*... calling i-*hic*... it.... *BBRRAAAHHPP*\" thought Chloe as she put down the empty carton. Across from her was Sam, who was entirely passed out. She fell asleep after forcing half a pie into her gullet. Sam looked messy and bloated, showing signs that her weight will only rise in the coming months. Sean came over to his wife, had Hannah help him carry her to her room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There there pumpkin, I'm gonna get you to bed.\" Sean said lovingly. Minutes later, Hannah returned to help Chloe into her room. </span></div></div>",

Sean was always working, even though they had anything anyone could ever need. As Sam crawled out of bed, she began to smell something delicious coming from the kitchen, and she wanted to investigate. Sam moved her chubby body across her large bedroom, wobbling slightly since she was still a tad sleepy. Sam was wearing a silk nighty that was getting tighter and tighter everyday. Her breasts pushed hard against her nighty, and her belly was making it ride higher than it was supposed to. Either way, Sam was really only thinking about eating whatever smelt so heavenly. On her way out of the bedroom, she walked over to the fridge and grabbed herself a large bottle of pop to drink while she walked towards the kitchen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Sam approached her kitchen she saw Hannah and the staff scrambling around, setting the table and making food. Hannah noticed Sam and called her over. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey there sleepyhead! I was just about to get you, but, look! We made you breakfast!\" Hannah shouted, gesturing towards the dining room table. The table was loaded with plenty of food, far more than any person could eat, but any two people, well Sam and Chloe could be those people. Sam walked over to the table like a zombie, looking over it's contents. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh myy goodness look at those doughnuts... oh and look at the pancakes! Oh and all the different types of bacons and sausages.... mmmmmmm I can't wait, Hannah this looks amazing!\" Sam salivated thinking of all the food she was about to inhale. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It wasn't just me hehe... but thank you! I'm gonna go wake Chloe, please get started Mrs. Rodgers!\" Hannah exclaimed, running up the stairs towards Chloe's room. </span></div></div>",

First she grabbed some pancakes, loaded with maple syrup and whip cream. Then, she grabbed a fist full of bacon, stuffing it into her mouth with intense speed. She grabbed a full link of sausages and put them on her plate, rotating bites with more bacon and hash browns. Sam followed that with another plate, this time with an omelette and french toast on it. Sam got up and continued to feast on all the different flavours. This time, she reached for the doughnuts. She would stuff them into her mouth fast, inhaling a large doughnut in only two bites. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Mmmm oh my goodness... this is just amazing... how do they cook such wonderful food? Mmmmmm...</i> Sam thought, stuffing her third doughnut into her mouth. She was definitely becoming unhinged, stuffing as much food as she could into her belly before she got full. Just as Sam grabbed her second link of Sausage, she saw Hannah return with Chloe, who looked starved and tired. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom! Look at you go! It's my turn for some though!\" Chloe said, giggling as her belly jiggled. Chloe walked up to the table and immediately she picked up two doughnuts and inhaled them. \"Alright-MMMM... Hannah, *munch munch* let's get me some food!\" Hannah loaded up plates for Chloe, who was demolishing anything that was given to her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam was almost naked, only wearing underwear now since her nighty got too tight. She looked engorged with her belly puffed out so much. \"Urrrp!! uggghh....that was *hic!*... oh my goodne-URRP!...excuse me... wow I can't keep *brahhp*.... eating so much, but goodness *hic!* me, this food is just... *hic* too good... URP!\" Sam said, rubbing her gut. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChloe continued to finish the rest of the food on the table while Sam passed out. Chloe was looking fat after every meal, something Sam couldn't fathom that she didn't mind. Sam was afraid of not being able to stop eating, or really, she was afraid of what it'll do to her figure. </span></div></div>",

Ever since she was a child, Nicole always wanted to teach and help others, and has always been passionate about the education of others. She's been on councils, boards, and committees that help improve the state and countries education of tomorrows future. One main obstacle for Nicole, has always been that she isn't overly wealthy or well known by the big important people, and she has always tried to move up the ranks in the education system. While when she started to teach, the mere hands on concept was enough to satisfy her dreams, she's become thirsty for a larger role in helping teachers and children. Nicole has been teaching at Hill-Haven for a couple of years now, and is enjoying her colleagues and students. the school isn't too large, but it holds enough staff and students to keep Nicole on her feet 24/7. That about takes us to now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole is sitting in her classroom, it's currently recess and the children are outside playing. Nicole is catching up on some marking and eating her salad for lunch. She enjoys the quiet break from the students, until there is a knock on her door. Not knowing who it is, she welcomes her visitor in to her classroom and in comes Mrs. Haskell. Mrs. Haskell is in her later 30s early 40s (Nicole has never asked) with short black hair, a narrow face with some freckles, and an overly thin physique for her age. She is attractive, but she also has a serious look to her face that makes people hesitant to joke around her, at least until they get to know her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey there Nic, hope I'm not interrupting anything, I know how hard it is to get alone time around here,\" Mrs. Haskell said kindly, \"I was only wondering if you'd like in on this weeks lottery ticket with the rest of us?\" Some of the teachers at the school have been doing the lottery ticket for some time in hopes they might all be able to split the winnings and retire together. Nicole isn't usually the one to gamble, sure she gets in on it every now and then, but she finds it expensive and difficult to find false hope so frequently, so she only does it every now and then. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's the jackpot on this one?\" Nicole asked. \"So far it's close to 800 Million I think, though odds are it'll go up more\" Mrs. Haskell responded calmly. Nicole thought for a minute, <i>it has been a while since I bought a ticket, oh what the hell that's a lot of money after all...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Nicole pulled out her wallet, handed some cash to Mrs. Haskell and went back to marking. </span></div></div>",

Nicole ate very healthily, worked out almost every day, and lived incredibly frugally to save up for nicer things in the future, and enjoyed her lifestyle - even if it was lonely at times. She was attractive, probably one of the most attractive teachers at the school (which made some women jealous) but was very kind and humble, which made her easy to get a long with.

At first she panicked thinking she missed a day of work and got her days confused, until she realized what the messages were saying. \"NIKKY WE WON!! WE WON 800 MILLION DOLLARS!!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole dropped her phone, breaking the screen. <i>This can't be happening, there's no way.</i> Nicole thought to herself. She called one of the teachers and they answered with gusto, explaining everything and telling her to meet up with them at noon where they'll go to the office together. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole got dressed, barely able to contain her excitement. By noon she had met up with her co workers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were four of them in on this jackpot, including Mrs. Jessica Haskell. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Isn't this great Nicole! We can retire!\" Said Mrs. Haskell eagerly. \"I know, how great is that!\" said Mrs. Allison Wilton, another staff member who won. She's a geography teacher, and in her 40's, however, Mrs. Wilton is not as \"in-shape\" as some would say, in fact, she's rather obese. She's around 250 pounds, with long brown hair, glasses, and a decent double chin. She has larger boobs, and an ass that's a shelf. She's married and has children, and is not bothered by her weight gain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen there's Ms. Jennifer Colton, who is another young staff member. She is the youngest teacher at the school, in her mid 20's. She's rather thin in every department, however, the job has given her a tiny paunch in her belly. 5 lbs at the most, and it doesn't look bad on her either. \"I can't believe we won guys, this is crazy!\" Jennifer said, bouncing up and down in excitement. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of the girls were chipper, and ready to collect their money and change their lives forever...</span></div></div>",

None of the women were upset about how the deal went down, and went on their separate ways. Summer was just about to start fortunately, so Nicole used her vacation time for the rest of the school year so she could focus on getting her finances in order. She invested a large amount of money into special accounts and had people manage her money. Basically securing herself a rich life for the rest of her life. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next thing Nicole did was move out of her small apartment and into something more comfortable. Nicole was never one to splurge, but with this money she could finally buy her dream home. She moved into a beautiful mansion, not too far from where from where she teaches. Nicole didn't want to quit teaching, as it was something she enjoyed doing, so she kept her job at least until she had a reason to quit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicoles new house was something to gawk at. It was very large, and had it's own gym, pool and hot tub, a big backyard and patio for her to relax on, with huge bathrooms, multiple bedrooms, an amazing living and dining room, as well as a stellar kitchen. There were other rooms in the house such as an office, a little movie theatre room, and even a games room. Mind you, Nicole was never one to feel the need for all of these things, but after such a small apartment, she really wanted to live in a house that she could enjoy and go a little crazy in. She had enough money, it wasn't real concern. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe also bought a new car, hired a full time maid, and went shopping for brand new clothes - because she could. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Not gonna lie</i>, thought Nicole, <i>this has been a lot of fun going a little crazy for a change.

It wasn't anything too ludicrous, but she definitely got a little caught up in the fun. Nicole had never had money to spend, so for once she was just letting loose. She began to go out to bars and night clubs, and soon found other girls with money to spend. Nicole began to drink almost every night, and began to even experiment with some drugs. She was finally enjoying her college years, even if she was a little late. She got a little lazy and ordered out food often, her house started getting littered with empty bottles and drug paraphernalia, and she hated to admit she kind of loved it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout a month into this binging lifestyle however, she realized she couldn't keep going so crazy. Her head hurt, and while she was rich, she knew it wasn't a healthy lifestyle to keep. So Nicole found herself easing up and cleaning up. She ended up enjoying the other great part about her wealth, which was her relaxing accessories. Nicole enjoyed ordering food and sitting by the pool all day, while having a drink and maybe smoking some weed too. She often found herself hanging out with co-worker Jess Haskell, who loved spending her days with Nicole considering she had nothing else to do. Both were rich and single, and just wanted to enjoy life for now. Jessica had quit her job at the school the next day, and invested a bunch of her money like Nicole, but has to admit that she likes Nicoles pool and patio more than her own. Jess too had fallen for the indulgent lifestyle of drinking and ordering out. At this time of the summer, Nicole had found she had put on about 10 lbs, simply from poor eating, lack of exercise and drinking. While Nicole was aware of it, she wasn't overly worried. She planned on picking up her older habits once the summer was over, she just wanted to really enjoy her vacation, and you're supposed to put on weight on vacation, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJess had also put on some weight, she had actually put on a little bit more than Nicole, probably because of her recent enjoyment of her own personal chef. Jess only really had a tiny potbelly, and Nicole just put her weight in other places, so neither women really showed it in any negative way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCurrently, both women were sitting by the pool eating some very nice steaks while drinking some craft beer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know something Nic,\" Jess said while taking a decent gulp of beer, \" I have to admit I really fucking love this. I loved teaching, but man oh man I think this is what I want to do for the rest of my life.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole giggled and agreed, unable to speak due to having food in her mouth. \"I can't say I disagree with you, though I must say I really enjoy eating good food all the time. I used to only eat salads, but having someone cook so well for me has really opened my eyes,\" Nicole responded before burping a little, \"This is great *Belch* Woopsies excuse me!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth women laughed, drank some beer and continued with their day of relaxing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Sure they both enjoyed going out, meeting new people and old friends, but everyone was treating them differently. The money changes your life forever. Nicole often found herself buying multiple rounds, buying dinner, giving gifts to people she barely knew.  Nicole needed a break. Luckily, Jess was just walking up the drive way now, and she wasn't empty handed. Jess was sporting a matching pink sweatsuit with her tummy exposed, it wasn't large enough to attract attention yet, but Jess's new love of food might just sneak up on her. Speaking of food, in Jess's arms were two boxes of pastries, one with a dozen doughnuts and the other with a dozen strudels, while she also had a cookie dough doughnut amazingly held in her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nic! I brought these from that new vegan bakery, you'd think that make 'em healthier but I think they're actually worse for you than normal doughnuts... *munch*... either way they're friggin delicious, have some!\" <br>\r\nNicole eagerly walked over and took a look at the doughnuts. She grabbed a chocolate glaze and felt bliss as it practically melted in her mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmmm...oh my goodness wow these are amazing... wow Jess great call..\" Nicole could barely form a proper sentence. These pastries were too tasty not to enjoy. Her and Jess barely exchanged any real information for the first 20 minutes of their Friday morning. A few grunts, out loud moans of pleasure from both girls. <br>\r\nSoon, both girls were sitting, Nicoles pants undone to make room for her full belly, pastry all over her face which kept releasing small belches from her very invasive gut. Jess had unzipped her crop top hoodie revealing her white crop top which had chocolate and strawberry stains all over it with her very full looking belly underneath it. Jess looked absolutely finished from this breakfast. She did eat more than Nicole, and Jess has been less than eager thinking about what damage she's already done to her figure since retiring. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth women went to the living room, where Nicole put on an episode of their latest comedy show binge, and the women lounged off their heavy meals for an hour or so. Eventually, Jess repositions herself in her chair to look more directly at Nicole and says, \"I totally got distracted by the food this morning, but after the wine we had last night, when I was in my town car, I called Jen to see what she had been up to!\" Ah, Ms. Jennifer Colton. As the smallest and the youngest teacher at Hill-Haven Elementary, the lottery win was quite substantial. She was in her mid 20s, was single, very pretty, and a retired teacher/multi millionaire. Nicole had wondered what Jen was up to, considering the fact that she must've been going through something similar. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's fantastic!\" Nicole responded, still a little dazed from her massive feast. \"What did she say?\"Nicole asked, interested in hearing how it's been for another winner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She wants to meet up! She said she'd love to have us over. So I hope you don't mind, but I set up dinner at her house tomorrow night! She's going to try and get Allison to come, get the gang back together!\" Jess responded ecstatically. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well that's fine with me! Although I think I may need a new outfit... wanna go to the mall?\" Nicole asked, remaining in denial as to why she needed a new outfit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah! I need to new clothes too, plus maybe we can grab some Lunch there! They have great pretzels, and there's that new burger place! Oh and maybe I'll pick up some dessert for later from that bakery there, they have amazing cakes...\" Jess was getting her things together while thinking about the tasty snacks. Nicole knew she needed to watch her figure, but Jess was a bit of a bad influence on her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>They do have great cake though</i>... Nicole thought to herself.</span></div></div>",

Where Jen lived, the landscape was accented wonderfully by the sun, and the houses were massive and looked more like art installations rather than homes. As Nicole and Jess's town car pulled up, Nicole became amazed at the home they were seeing. It was huge. Jess and Nicole owned huge homes too, but this place was almost a palace. It was a large open land and a large modern home in the middle. As the women got out of the car, the main doors began to open and out came Jen, except she had changed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJen was still short, but now was incredibly toned and in shape. She clearly had been using her wealth and time to work out, and it showed immensely. and Nicole began to feel insecure of her minor weight gain. Jess's biggest worry was what dinner was going to be, <i>hopefully not celery</i>,Jess thought to herself, laughing a tiny bit out loud. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy shit girl! Look at you! You're a model!\" Jess said loudly and excitedly. \"Give me a hug!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJen enjoyed this welcoming, as she walked down the stairs and hugged both the girls. As she welcomed them in, Jen began to explain to them what she's been up to since winning the money.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At first, I had all this money, and I had no idea what to do, but my dad told me to invest in a company I believed in, and invest in them. He thought I should do something I loved, so I found this company here in California, and they're a fitness company. They weren't very big when I found them, and I wanted to finally have a body that wasn't so flat, so I invested a lot of money over time into the company. They're called, \"FitWhits\". I really loved them, and I became the spokesperson because I used their products to look like this. Anyways, the company blew up, like huge. We have gyms all over the country, and we're only growing. I ended up already making back my money, and I made even more too, so then I bought this house, and I've been modelling often too!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJess and Nicole were shocked about this. Jen had been so productive, she had made even more money than before. Jess then asked Jen, as nicely as possible, \"I hope this isn't rude, but how much have you made now?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh not rude at all, I know you guys aren't trying to take my money after all haha\" Jen giggled, Nicole realized that Jen appeared as lonely as they were since winning the money. \"I've made in total, around $400 million, and it's going up really fast. You guys should do this with a company too! I'll totally help you, it's nice having a little work and a whole company to your name.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJess and Nicole looked at each other, not minding the idea. \"If I could pick, I'd buy a restaurant chain, or just different themed ones, so I'll have a great dinner anywhere in California...\" Jess laughed a little, but appeared to be day dreaming about it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You should! I know someone who can help you with restaurants, I'll give you his number!\" Jen said, while digging into her purse for her phone. The ladies finally found the dining room, where a large table was waiting for them. A chef and wait staff stand ready for them. Jen then explains the dinner, \"Tonight, whatever you'd like, they'll make for you. And don't be afraid to try anything from Chefs menu, they're his speciality items, so get lots to try. I also have beer, wine, and other liquors, so whatever you'd like our bartender here will serve you.\" Jen said happily. Jess immediately started ordering, \"Can I have some mozza sticks? I'd love to try your turkey here, and a steak as well. Your mashed potatoes, and I want lots of gravy.\" Jess says, putting the menu down, she looks at the bartender, \"I'd like to start with beer, I'll have a few, I'll take wine for dinner, and I never want an empty drink. Thank you.\" Jess then holds onto the menu, indicating she may still order more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole wanted to hold back, so she ordered light. \"I'll take a salad, and Id love some pasta as well. And can I get some wine now? That's all thanks.\" Nicole begins handing back the menu when Jess interrupts, \"Hey no! You need to order real food! Utilize the team here, get lots of things to try!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJen begins to defend Nicole, \"I was going to eat something similar to Nicole...\" Jen pauses though, beginning to like Jess's idea. \"You know what Jess, you're right. We should enjoy, I have to diet so often, this feels like the right night to let loose a little. You should too Nicole, get anything you want!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole begins to feel pressured, but begins to like the idea of giving in, after all, if Jen is, then there's no shame, right? <br>\r\n\"Ok, I'll have pizza too, and I'll take steak too, and some lobster, and I'd love to have some tacos too, is that possible?\" The chef just smiles and nods. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's the spirit! Ok, my turn. I'll have the mac and cheese, and can I get some chicken nuggets too? And some pizza, and I'd love steak and potatoes too! Also, can I have a burger? And some wings too. And I'll take beer to start, wine and vodka later! Oh and lets get some shots too, lets party!\" Jen listed off, yelling and looking very happy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe women began taking a few shots in a row, Jess shotgunning a beer and getting Jen too as well. Nicole began to remember about Allison, who was supposed to be there that night. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Jen, did you ever hear back from Allison?\" Nicole asked Jen, who just finished her fourth shot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She said she was in another country, but she'll let us know when she's in town again.\" Jen answered rather slurred from the drinking. Just then the food was announced and all three women rushed to the dinning room awaiting their food. The table was full, full of everything they had asked for, in huge portions. Multiple burgers, wings, pizzas, steak and a huge pile of mashed potatoes. This feast was massive, and all the girls were shocked at the food in front of them. The alcohol had affected them to think less about the calorie intake, and more about feeling the warmth delicious taste this meal was about to bring to them. And so, without warning, they sat and began inhaling whatever inspired them. Jess started with potatoes, where she began dumping her loads of extra butter and gravy all over them, at one point she even began pouring the gravy into her mouth as a joke. A delicious joke... Either way, Jess was going full hog. She didn't hold back, trying to eat as much as possible. She had begun to really enjoy the sensation of a full belly, and enjoyed eating until she couldn't anymore. This wasn't unusual for her anymore, but before the money, Jess didn't really crave food this much. Granted, she had her own slight issues with weight, but since her divorce, she tried to stay in shape for the next man she'd find. But money changed that, she discovered what food can be, and she can't seem to stop eating like this. Worse yet, Jess hasn't looked at her weight in a while, but while she's afraid of looking at the dreaded number her feelings on her increased frame wasn't as negative as she thought. She doesn't totally mind the weight, especially when she gets to eat so much food. The trade off wasn't too bad in her opinion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole during this whole feast basically blacked out. She awoke to an almost empty table, with Jess sitting across from her, grabbing her exposed and very full belly, burping every couple seconds, holding a slice of pizza in her hand, stuffing it down even though she appears to have hit her limit. Nicole was shocked to witness this transformation of Jess. Sure Jess wasn't fat yet, but she had embraced the pig lifestyle. Jess's clothes were stained, open and exposed. She had food over her face, and looked like a zombie in her food comatose state. But while Nicole was shocked about Jess, only then did she began to see the damage on her own figure. Her pants undone, her shirt buttons popped off her open gut, her own clothes stained with food. Nicole couldn't really remember too much, just that ate until she physically passed out. Nicole noticed the empty wine bottle next to her, and the half dozen beer bottles next to Jess, as well as an empty wine bottle. That's when Nicole noticed Jen, who was at the end of the table. She had eaten herself to sleep. She was wearing a gorgeous dress, but she had apparently taken it off during the binge. Jen sat against the wall, with multiple wine bottles around her, multiple beer bottles around her too, with only underwear on. She was covered in food scraps, with a full belly on her lap. Jen had really gone all in on the food. It looks like she even finished a cake where she's sitting. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was quite the feast.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A few weeks after the first get together with Jen, and things had really changed for the ladies. First off summer had officially come and gone, the weather started to cool down, Jess, Jen and Nicole relaxing and enjoying food/drinks before September came. School had started back up and Jess and Jen weren't anywhere close to schools. Nicole however, had gone back. The past few weeks had been some of the best of the summer, but Nicole was happy to be helping kids again. Especially since she donated her time, and donated a great deal of money to better the school. They have a lot better supplies, and the building has been redone, and one thing Nicole enjoys a lot is the new cafeteria. Better food, nice seating, flat screens in the teachers lounge. The staff had definitely come to enjoy these changes as well. The food had increased moods across the school, one of the few people enjoying this feature more than Nicole was in fact the Principal, Mrs. Dunn. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMrs. Dunn is in her mid 40s, she is Caucasian, with brown hair done up and glasses that give her a stern appearance. Students and staff alike are afraid of Mrs. Dunn, she likes it that way. Since donating all this money though, Nicole has seen a different side of Mrs. Dunn. She smiles at Nicole now, even stops to talk. She's always thanking Nicole for the help and the supplies, but one thing Mrs. Dunn appreciates is the new lunch menu. Currently Mrs. Dunn was sitting at her desk, a mostly empty lunch tray sits on her desk, she's watching TV and casually doing paperwork. The rappers show she ate two slices of pizza, a muffin, some breadsticks, pop to drink and a slice of cake for dessert.  Since the menu change, Mrs. Dunn has eaten more than she ever has in her life. Nicole did make sure the chefs were good (a selfish reason, mostly) and wanted kids to have choices. Staff ate free as well, which is maybe why Mrs. Dunn was eating so much. Regardless, her frame was expanding. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole was walking into her office, as she opened the door she saw Mrs. Dunn taking the last bite of her cake, and pushing the tray aside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nicole! How are you doing dear? Here for our meeting?\" Mrs. Dunn asked cheerfully, stifling a burp at the end. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm doing well, Mrs. Dunn.\" Nicole responded, while observing her boss's desk. There were candy wrappers, opened bags of chips, and some old food containers on her desk. It had appeared she had been eating a lot today. Nicole noticed that Mrs. Dunn had a slight double chin. Mrs. Dunn has only experienced the cafeteria for a couple of weeks, so her frame is mostly the same, but Nicole could swear she see's it getting tighter. It's only a matter of time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I had some numbers I wanted to run by you, if you don't mind?\" Nicole finishes, going to sit down with the principal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Nicole was back to work, Jess and Jen were having different adventures. Jen decided to take a few weeks off after her dinner with Jess and Nicole. Jen wanted to enjoy her friends who didn't judge her about her money. Jen enjoyed sleeping in, eating a hearty breakfast, enjoying her day, her own way. Jen would go back after this little break, but she needs the time off. While Jen has been lounging, she's also been helping Jess with a business idea. Jess has been meeting with savvy business people from around California, and finding out what restaurant she wants to invest in. Jess and Jen would travel around the area and try different foods, seeing what Jess wanted to believe in. Eventually, Jess figured out the business, and rushed to Nicoles place to tell her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NIC! NIC! I have great news!\" Nicole could tell it was Jess running up to her door, as she opened it still yelling about this apparent good news. Jess was holding an empty burger wrapper in her hand, running into the kitchen to find Nicole, while Jen is walking in slower, eating the rest of a burger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it, Jess?!\" Nicole responded, excited to hear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm officially an investor in a restaurant! And with my money, we're making it a chain! It's going all over the United States Nic! I'm gonna be huge! I can't wait for this to make me even more money, and don't worry Nic, Jen and I will help you start a business too! That way you can get even more income! You can donate more to more schools too!\" Jess was so excited for herself and her friends. \"Oh, here's the name!\" Jess passes Nicole the burger wrapper, who unravels it ands reads out loud, \"Thiqq Burger\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is so cool Jess! Congrats! What do the burgers taste like?\" Nicole asked, while Jen came in still eating her burger, and passed her a bag, filled with burgers. \"Have one and find out.\" Jen remarked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole eagerly unwrapped the burger and took a bite. It was greasy, it was big, and it was the best burger Nicole had ever had in her life. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy Fuck.\" Nicole said, taking another bite quickly and chowing down on the burger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're good right? I've eaten 10 today, Jen is on number 9.\" Jess says, patting her belly slightly while looking at Jen, who was completely lost in her food. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just imagine guys, unlimited burgers on me. All over the place. I got these special cards, I get to give them to people I like, so there you go. It's always free with that card.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJess hands them both a card that says \"THIQQ BURGER SUPER MEMBER\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole began to realize what this meant, Jess and Jen eating all the time. Nicole knows she has no will power around them too. Food is everywhere in Nicoles life, she needs to be careful if she wants to keep her figure. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Big things were happening in these women's lives. Jess's business was taking off better than anticipated. Thiqq burger was gaining ground fast, and making headlines all across the country as \"Americas next big Burger Chain\". This business was the first burger joint using cloned meat. All stores did it themselves, so every burger was always guaranteed to be great. It was the next big craze in the U.S, and Jess was on her way to becoming a fast food mogul. Jen was still taking time from her real work. Her business was still growing every day, she didn't really need to be involved. Jen also knew that she had been gaining weight though. She couldn't deny it anymore. Jen looked at the scale, and it was harsh. 132 lbs. <i>How could I let this happen? I knew I gained some weight but this is 18 pounds!</i> Jen thought, while grabbing her extra curves. <i>I don't totally mind this though, maybe I should just throw in the towel? Or I can try and lose the weight, maybe I'll do it as promo!</i> Jen began planning a weight loss system with her trainers, and talking with her people about her PR stunt. They were on board and needed time before they officially go for it. Which to Jen meant time to eat as much as possible since it's about to go away forever. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Jen ate relentlessly so did Jess. Jess as well had been growing in the passing weeks. She enjoyed fast food all the time. Plus she had them innovate back at their lab. She came up with the next menu ideas, and how to expand into other things as well. Jess would muck down multiple burgers a day, mindlessly munching on fries, and poutine, mozza sticks, chicken tenders and milkshakes. Jess even admitted she was going overboard. Jess officially weighed 150 lbs. She had never weighed this much before. Jess didn't really know how she felt. She wasn't happy about getting fat, but food really was too good to stop eating. She knew she had to do something, but she kept putting it off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole was still working hard at the school. She had donated a lot of things to the school, including a new deal with Thiqq burger. They made the entire menu for the school now, which people were hesitant about, but since it happened everyone agrees they prefer the new menu. Especially Mrs. Dunn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore, Mrs. Dunn was almost a stick. She was stern, firm and edgy. She wasn't very comforting looking. Since the new food changes, she has definitely filled out. Mrs. Dunn eats immediately when she arrives. She eats breakfast food, while snacking until a full lunch, stuffed with a few burgers, 3 slices of pizza, wings, poutine with bacon and extra curds, a couple stuffed tacos, and then a whole cake to finish it off. A lot of pop and milk is also consumed. Mrs. Dunn found that she needed help, so recently hired an assistant to help her with work, as well as deliver her non stop food. This poor assistant is named Sam. Sam is a cute, thin brunette, with short hair.  She is trying become a teacher, and found this opportunity would help her advance her career. Sam isn't pleased with the situation. She feels partially responsible for Mrs. Dunns health. This woman consumes food like no other. The whole day the kitchen makes her special orders. This is, the reason Mrs. Dunn went from 110lbs to 175lbs. Her clothes are tight, she is behind on her wardrobe currently, so her clothes are showing every little detail. Mrs. Dunn doesn't seem to care though, anytime Nicole or Sam ask why she's so hungry she just explains her new love for food. Nicole understood though, she too was growing. Nicole finally stepped on the scale, to reveal her new weight of 140lbs. She had put on 30lbs, and she was afraid of not being able to stop. <i>What if I can't control myself? What if I end up like Mrs. Dunn? </i>Nicole was still eating more than she should, and frequent stops at Thiqq Burger weren't helping. She ate breakfast, lunch and dinner there. It was too good not too, plus they were always expanding their menu. They were becoming more than just burgers...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Nicole was at the school one day, an old friend she hadn't seen in a while showed up during her spare period. The door opened for Nicole to see a large woman. She is in her mid 40s, brown hair, glasses, a decent double chin. This woman has large breasts, and she is short, so she has a shelf as an ass. Nicole realizes that it's indeed Mrs. Allison Wilton! The fourth lotto winner! She was larger than before, she used to be 250lbs, but Nicole bet she was in the 300 range now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nicole! It's you! Come here and give me a big 'ol hug you!\" Allison waddled slowly towards Nicoles desk, while Nicole got up and walked around to hug her old work colleague. The hug was very soft, her huge boobs were like padding, and she smelt like candy. Like she just ate something sweet. As Nicole pulled out Allison says to Nicole, \"Nicole, how's it been? You've put on some weight I see.\" Nicole is shocked, and doesn't know what to say. <i>Do you realize how fat you are?</i> Nicole blanked, and Allison began to laugh hysterically. \"Oh my, you're cute. I know I'm huge, don't worry sweetheart. I was just being funny. Why don't we grab lunch?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey went to the local Thiqq Burger, where Allison began loading up on multiple dishes. A dozen burgers, a large poutine with a bucket of gravy, a large milkshake and 7 hot dogs loaded with bacon and cheese. Nicole held back compared to Allison. Nicole got 5 burgers, a milkshake and a fry. The girls got their food, sat down and began chowing down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So Nicole,\" Allison begins talk while preparing her meal, while Nicole watches and feels like she's about to witness a wild animal attack. \"Since winning the lottery, I realized I wanted to enjoy my time here. *munch..MUnch..burP\" I've always been a bigger lady, my husband has never minded, but I would diet, and do my best to stay healthy. *mmm* Since this money came into my life, I've realized I can afford to be *sips milkshake* unhealthy.\" Allison then proceeds to takes an enormous bite from the burger, moaning while she does. Nicole can swear she can see her clothes stretching in front of her. \"I want live my life to the fullest. *burppp* I gave most of money to a company that is working on reducing health risks for obesity, and the rest of my money I use for travelling, *chomp...munch..mm* my kids and my husband. I've eaten everything I've ever wanted, or so to speak *burrrp* hahaha.. I could never get enough food. I'm a greedy woman, Nicole. *bUUrrrPP* This is where my money is going. It's eye opening, I hope you and the others do the same. This whole school has put on weight since we left. It's only going to grow. When my company is done, there won't be any reason to not eat whatever you want.\" Allison then begins to eat faster, too fast to speak at the same time. Nicole keeps eating her meal, unsure of how to feel. She can't deny she's envious of Allison and her attitude, but that doesn't mean she can just give in. How is she supposed to keep children educated? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAllison had her order expanded for more poutine with even more gravy, she wanted 4 more burgers, and 5 more hot dogs loaded with all the greasiest things that they had. Allison continued to eat, more and more, popping buttons and gorging. Nicole ended up buying more as well. She felt weird to just watch Allison, so she thought eating would help. It did since Nicole began to eat more and more. Hot dogs, burgers, ribs, wings, apple pie and cake too. Allison also ordered more dessert for herself and Nicole. The two ate for hours. Eventually Allison called it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm all done, sweetheart. I know you liked eating that much though, dear. Trust me, this is what you wanna do. I'm happy as a hog. Goodbye dear, I'll see you soon! I'm going to catch up with Jen and Jess soon enough as well!\" And with that, Allison lifted her huge body up and walked to her husbands vehicle. Nicole went home, where she slept off the food, and maybe ate some ice cream too. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As time passed, Nicole did her best to stay busy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seemed like everyone else had things going for them, why not her? Even though she was rich enough to afford it, she <i>liked</i> her job at the school. She had always wanted to be a teacher, and without the stress that came with the depressingly low salary that teaching provided her, she was free to throw herself into her career. Especially now that she wasn't just a teacher, she was a <i>donor</i>\u2014every time she looked around at the improvements that her money had made in the school, she felt proud. That was plenty enough reason to keep pouring more time and effort into her job. She wasn't going to get rich off of it like her friends were off of <i>their</i> jobs, but this was rewarding! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBesides, she'd already struck rich once.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith everyone working at their own paces, keeping up with her fellow lottery winners became something of a hassle. Jen and Jess had their own entrepreneurial endeavors to attend to while Allison was otherwise occupied seeing the world and, apparently, stuffing her face. The four of them didn't meet up often, at least for a while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn that time, Nicole had done her best to restrain herself. It was hard, with how much she had grown to love cooking. Thiqq Burger was delicious, offered an increasing amount of options, and it wasn't like she couldn't <i>afford</i> it. She did her best to stop by only once a day, but her best often came about once a week. Her plumping physique only continued to expand in the coming weeks and months since she'd last seen Allison and her other friends. She had been hesitant to meet Jess for lunch\u2014the tightness of her new pink sweater really emphasized the roundness of her belly. Her jeans, brand new, had already started to bare at the thighs. She was getting so chubby lately, she was almost worried about what her friends might think of her! Tipping the scales at almost one hundred and seventy pounds, she felt like such a whale...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUntil, of course, she actually met Jess Haskell for lunch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter winning all this money, it was obvious that they were going to let themselves go a bit. Allison had done enough for all of them, but Nicole had been watching with a wary eye as Jess slowly chubbed up alongside her. Being an investor in Thiqq Burger, and all the benefits that came with, was a mighty responsibility indeed, and it had proven useful for far more than one occasion. She'd always been worried about what would have happened if <i>she'd</i> been the one to invest in that company instead of Jess. The thin, freckle-faced woman had played it so fast and loose with her benefits, Nicole doubted that she'd ever be able to reign herself in with that much access to delicious, scrumptious food...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nikki!\" Jess held her hands up high, \"Come, sit, I got started without you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJess had gotten fat. In the few months it had been since they'd seen one another, Nicole had managed to put on about thirty pounds. Jess looked to have matched that and a half. That same thin, freckle-faced teacher was slowly being swallowed up by chubby cheeks and a double chin. A round, proud belly rested on her plush thighs as she sat at the dinner table on her expensive patio. She didn't rise to meet Nicole, lest she part with the lunch that she had already heartily partaken in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... can see that!\" Nicole laughed awkwardly at the sight, \"Jess! You look...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great, I know.\" the older woman sniffed, taking a meaty bite out of something that looked particularly delicious, \"It's this new skin treatment I'm trying\u2014come on and sit!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole shuffled awkwardly towards the patio table. It was covered in food, all from Thiqq Burger. Even though it lacked the trimmings of a fast food binge, such as bags and containers, Nicole knew it well enough by smell. Had Jess been eating nothing but Thiqq Burger since she became an investor? She certainly had the figure to show for it...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot that Nicole was one to talk...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey caught up as well as they could over lunch. It was a little... <i>harder</i> to talk to Jess. Nicole had done her best to stay grounded, despite the money and the changes she'd made to her living arrangements. Meanwhile Jess, as her business continued to boom and her wallet expand, seemed to get a little airy. A little flighty, as it were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So did you see Allison before she left for Germany?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Boy did I\u2014she was <i>huge</i>.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohhhh, weeeelll...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole swallowed and grimaced at the hypocrisy of Jess's comment. She had never cared much about weight before all of this Newly Rich thing started, but it seemed to be so prevalent now. It was so strange to see all of her friends steadily puff up, but it felt even stranger to talk about it. Behind their backs none the less.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kinda.\" Nicole finally said, \"I mean, she seems <i>happy</i> about it...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pssh, yeah.\" Jess snorted, \"I'm just happy to know that I'm not the fattest winner of this lottery.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe dipped her chicken in heavy ranch dressing, coating it twice over in the stuff before taking a greedy bite. Ranch dolloped on her full right breast, and she used one perfectly manicured finger to scoop it up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I could eat like a cow all I want and never get <i>that</i> fat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer thoughts turned to the rapidly widening Ms. Dunn, who crammed food into her face with the same fervor and talent that her friends seemed to have. Admittedly, it was nice to know that, even though she'd been doing some expanding of her own, she was far dwarfed by her formerly hard-nosed principal, swiftly softening into a super-sized sow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven still, that wasn't exactly nice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Anyway</i>\u2014\" Nicole changed the subject, \"So have you seen Jen?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? No, too busy.\" Jess smacked her lips, \"Power lunches, corporate meetings, fancy dinners, you know how it is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was hoping to meet with her soon too.\" Nicole said with a smile, \"I miss you guys! I liked it when we all worked together.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww, I miss you guys too!\" Jess cooed, quickly correcting herself, \"As in <i>you guys</i>, not the school. God, I never realized how much I hated teaching.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not that bad.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a lot worse than sitting on my butt all day.\" Jesse laughed, making her belly slosh, \"But we should all totally meet up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of them embraced, their tummies colliding in a soft squishy hug. Nicole left Jess exactly where she was sitting when she arrived, sitting at the table on her patio. And just like when she had arrived, Jess was eating.</span></div></div>",

Starting with the very idea of food. Due to the incredibly low cost for Thiqq Burger, Jess and the board wanted to use the large profit margin to their advantage. Jess had realized the potential for their business beyond fast food. Why not Chinese food? Pizza Parlours? Bakery's? Jess and the team went hard at work to build theme restaurants, but Jess also wanted to make a themeless buffet. A restaurant that can make you virtually any meal. This dream, while possible, was tough considering they had to create and perfect recipes. This a rather large contributing factor to Jess's recent weight gain. Her greed was evolving beyond food as well, Jess wanted to dominate the entire food market with her product, and at the rate their business is growing it seems like a potential possibility. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, this made Jess a great deal of money personally, so much that she saw to it to spend it on more business ideas. Jess was making so much money, she invested a ton of her money into Allisons company because of her new-found interest in medical research for obesity. Over the last two months, Allison and Jess partnered Thiqq Burger and Allisons research business into one company, Harrow Inc. This company is planning on changing the world very fast, and so, in such a short time, Harrow Inc. food stores began popping up everywhere in Northern California (all of which gave free food to all four lotto winners). Such places like Chinese restaurants, and Bakery's that custom made any cake on the spot, as well as Pizza Parlours, poutinerys and ice cream parlours. They were in plenty of schools, such cheap food was great for keeping costs low and spirits high with the great food. This fast influx of cheap, guilt free and delicious food began to dominate the cities across the northwest, and already they are expanding fast. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs both of the ladies made tons of money, they also ate more than either of them had ever expected they could. Jess had broken 200 quickly 2 months ago, and while she was aware of it, she couldn't find a reason to care. 200 didn't seem terribly big to her, especially with a person like Allison next to her. The denial that Jess had was very apparent because of this, and so she continued to eat at lightning speeds. Jess had packed on 35 pounds in 2 months, but considering all of the new food to taste test, her and Allison gave themselves an excuse to gorge, it was for the good of the company, after all. Speaking of Allison, she was a sight to behold as well. 35 pounds for Jess, but 42 pounds for Allison, putting her at a total weight of 365 pounds. Allison was an unstoppable force against food. It seemed like she never stopped. Her husband enjoyed every minute, becoming obsessed with his wifes weight. Allison would eat breakfast in bed for about an hour, eating stacks of waffles drenched in syrup, while putting back 2 strips of bacon at a time. Allison would get out of bed slowly. She'd get ready for day, snacking on pastries scattered around the house, and once ready would get her driver to stop at whatever restaurant(s) she felt she needed. She'd arrive at the Harrow Inc. headquarters and be walked inside, where Jess would meet her. They would do their 1 o'clock meeting, and then after taste test the daily recipes. This was Jess and Allison's favourite time. They got to eat almost endlessly, for a couple of hours until both women are checked out and return home. Both women would snack until they fall asleep for the evening (late night snacks weren't uncommon though either). <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of the food was affecting more than just these two however, it was affecting almost everyone who ate their food. People in town were putting on weight all over the place. This was something especially Nicole was seeing. Hill-haven Elementary was becoming a drastically different school than it used to be, inside and out. The students of all ages appeared to be getting larger, but even then, it seemed the entire staff was being affected by the new cafeteria. First Ms. Harper, a heavier woman with a large rear and modest belly in her late 40's, used to weigh roughly 200 pounds, maybe a bit more. Since the new food, Ms. Harper began putting away much greasier food than Nicole was used to. Surely she ate unhealthy like an average person, but now she was losing all self control. Nicole saw Ms. Harper only yesterday eat 3 burgers, and a large poutine. Ms. Harpers ass had expanded exponentially in such a short time, putting on 50ish pounds. Ms. Harpers boobs were much larger, and her belly becoming a noticeable double, easy to say she was plumping up quickly. But not only her, the math teacher Mrs. Singh, used to be around 150, and now she's easily passed the 200 mark. Her hair done back, only recently to hair from getting in her mouth. Mrs. Singh seemed to have a sweet tooth, and heavily enjoyed eating cake, pie, cookies etc. fairly frequently. Mrs. Singh would also \"make the my favourite number is Pie! haha\" before grabbing a slice and wolfing it down. And those weren't the only staff members either, almost every teacher and faculty member has put on weight, some more than others, but it seems the trend is only increasing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne particular faculty member, is of course, Mrs. Dunn. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMrs. Dunn was a sight to behold. Over the past two months of getting great food all over town, Mrs. Dunn was growing at an alarming rate. At a stunning 240 mark, Mrs. Dunn was putting on weight at an almost impossible amount. It was likely due to the fact that she barely stopped eating even after work. Her car is filled with wrappers from Thiqq Burger and other Harrow Inc. restaurants. Some would say she's part of the reason the school has put on weight, since she loves working on their menu with Jess and Allison over lunch. Nicole was also at lunch, but they mostly either talked about food, or didn't talk due to the enormous enormous appetites the women have. Recently Nicole hasn't gone, due to the major temptations and peer pressure. Both women push food on Nicole like there's no tomorrow, and she can't handle all the temptation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCurrently, Nicole is at home, lounging on the couch, munching on vegetable chips. Her investor called and explained that she's spending too much money on the charity, and soon enough she'll lose too much of her fortune. However, he had a plan for her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait,\" Nicole asked confused, \"You think I should do what?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's simple, I'm watching the market right now, and I found a weed company that you can buy. You offer your friends at Harrow to make superb edibles, and you make royalties and own a weed company. What do ya say?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole thought for a moment, what's so bad about this, right? It's legal here now, and it'll bring in plenty of money for the kids at so many schools.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm in.\" Nicole responds confidently, with a slight smirk from making a bold choice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perfect! I'll keep looking for more business, we may as well keep making more, you can keep donating as much as you want after all. Anyways, I'm gonna make some calls. Bye, go and celebrate!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, she's back to munching on veggie chips, bored watching more TV. Nicole had been getting better with her will power slowly. Nicole weighed 180 pounds, so only putting on 10 pounds in the 2 months. Nicoles belly was beginning to jiggle more and more, while her thighs expanded as well. She didn't fully hate it, her breasts were bigger, and she didn't mind looking a little fuller, but she passed that a while ago, and doesn't want to be unhealthy, she does need to teach students. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Owning a full on Weed Company wasn't something that Nicole predicted she'd be doing ever. The company, named, \"High Hopes Farm\" was a funny name, but it just happened to be a lucky time to buy the business, as she immediately made money back. The plan to make edibles with Jess and Allison was brilliant, as it changed the game for all of them. Soon enough she just joined into the Harrow Inc. family anyways, and boy oh boy was it wonderful. Once Nicole started making money, she gave more than before to schools and children's foundations. Real change was being seen by Nicole once this had happened. She began giving the charities and foundations her all and was working all the time. Nicoles private Chef was told only make healthy options, and with little time to lounge, Nicole actually wasn't gaining weight. In fact, she was eating better, working out now too, and working non stop. Nicole was actually losing some weight from before. She felt good knowing that she was actually fighting her cravings and winning now too! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Nicole was losing weight and feeling great working for the cause, Allison and Jess capitalized on their new Weed business. Since the company was growing, people's opinion of Harrow Inc. was fairly positive, and it was only going up with more great food options. Once they started selling pot, people began to give into their urges of laziness. Burgers that made you eat more and more, it was a dangerous game for people already addicted to the food. Jess is a prime example.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCurrently, Jess is sitting in her office chair at the headquarters, taking a large juicy bite from a double cheeseburger infused with weed. Her dress shirt stained and unbuttoned almost entirely, minus two in the middle of her cleavage and her belly. Her pale skin was very exposed, and her posture was slouched back extremely, while she cradled her very bulging belly. One hand grasping her full and taught gut, one hand holding a messy juicy burger, her face in ecstasy while being so high and so full. Dozens of wrappers are littered on her floor. Gorging and feeling in bliss, Jess opened her drawer and pulled out her vibrator, she began to pleasure herself multiple times in a row, until she collapsed in her chair, exhausted and sweaty she slowly falls asleep. This new idea is Jess's latest addiction. She has become aware of new greedy feelings towards things other than food, and has begun to latch onto them as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimilar and not surprising, Allison is in her own office, on her couch after doing something similar enough to Jess. Allison and her husband enjoy stuffing sessions at any time of the day, so lately Allison hasn't stopped eating, even more than usual. Her Pants fully undone and her face covered in cake and other foods, her husband has trays upon trays of food for Allison to eat. She is in heaven.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth women continuing to increase weight and appetites, it seems that neither have any intention of slowing down anytime soon...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Whenever anyone called, she was confirm she was okay, but that she was in another country working. Taking the time off had her get behind, and she was keeping the appearances up for her brand.  Nicole wondered about her weight, if her company was mad at how much she had put on. Nicole had been using \"FitWhits\" to lose weight, and found it worked well for her. Nicole was down to about 160, and she was proud of herself. While the rest of the world around her fattened up, she was dropping her pounds. Nicole and Jen had been talking, and Nicole wanted to surprise Jen with her weight loss from FitWits. Jen was finally around for a weekend, and so Nicole went over for lunch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the front door Nicole was let in and walked to the kitchen. Sure enough, there was Jen. She is drop dead gorgeous, more in shape than she was the first time Nicole had seen her since winning the lottery. Jen had an amazing figure, she was more shapely, and still looked stunning as ever. Jen looked amazing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy shit Jen, look at you! You're so hot!\" Nicole blurted out loud, relieved her friend is on the fitness side of things as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJen laughed at Nicoles comment, \"Nic, look at you girl, you lost weight! You look great! Have a glass of wine and let's catch up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls drank and talked about the weed business, and Jen explained where she had been the whole time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You see, I really friggin loved the food. I really wasn't a fan of the idea of stopping... but I own a fitness company, and I'm known for my fitness lifestyle. I had to get out while I could, so I made a P.R. stunt and dropped the weight, made a vlog. The company really liked it, it boosted out numbers.\" Jen says, \"I miss eating whatever I want haha, but let's face it, it's too unhealthy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole knows, and thinks about everyone else she knows increasing in mass. Both girls proceed to eat a light and green dinner, which both enjoyed, but they both secretly wanted Thiqq Burger. Nicole went home, continued to drink a whole bottle of wine while smoking a joint or two, and maybe eat a little burger or something small.....</span></div></div>",

Nicole slowly rose, she noticed an empty bottle of wine, empty beer bottles, an ash tray, and a large amount of Thiqq Burger wrappers. She must've guessed somewhere around 13, she didn't want to know. I<i>'m gonna leave that for the maid and call it a one off... I gotta get changed...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the way to the headquarters, Nicole asks her driver if he'd make a detour to a Thiqq Burger on the way, which then lead her hungover brain to order 5 burgers, mega fries poutine supreme with 3 different types of bacon, chicken, sausage, and eggs too. In the order was also a mega sized pop and some mozza sticks as well. By the time she made it to Harrow Inc. Headquarters, her food was done and her shift was tight. She was feeling very gassy, but better with the hangover satisfied... for now anyways. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole made it towards the front desk, observing the building on her way. It's big and bold, very futuristic. The building had a great deal of people. Some in lab coats, some in suits and formal attire. Nicole noticed something about the people, some were also swollen looking, in fact, most were. It appeared even here people embraced the side effects of eating this food so often. As Nicole approached the front desk, she looked at the secretary. Mid 20's, very pretty, but looks like she's outgrowing her outfit. Nicole noticed this woman was even physically showing her own discomfort. The sleeves on her shirt were tight on her fat pudgy arms. More examination and Nicole see's wrappers in her garbage, they're over flowing the can onto the floor, which leads Nicole to see just the corner of what looked like a cake. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmph. How can I help you\" The woman said, clearly having a little food in her mouth, she quickly swallows it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm here to see Jess Haskall, and Allis-\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is your name Nicole?\" The secretary says interrupting  Nicole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, um yes. Nicole Smith.\" Nicole hands over her ID, and gets it back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Follow greg here, he'll take you to them.\" The woman smiles and gestures towards a man in a suit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you!\" Nicole says walking away, looking back a few seconds later to see the secretary chomping down on her whole cake. <i>My goodness, so many people are losing it. </i>Nicole thought to herself. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Her friends are still her real friends when they're not eating something. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah! It seemed urgent so came as fast as possible.\" Nicole replies, ignoring the part about the food detour on the way the headquarters. \"So what's the news?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, here's basically the idea in a nutshell,\" Allison came waddling around from a wall with a clipboard and a thick list of information printed on to it in one hand, and a meaty burger in her other hand which was covered in sauce, as was her fat face. \"Our labs have made one of the biggest breakthroughs in the history of healthcare, even humanity I may say.\" With that Allison took a large bite and chewed while sauce dripped down her chin into her large jiggly breasts. Allison was truly climbing up the scales, Nicole figured at the rate her and Jess were going, she'd have to be 400 pounds soon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of Jess, she was also currently munching on a small snack, but her belly was hanging out of the bottom of her shirt and was clearly much too small for her, as her buttons were being pulled as tight as possible. Jess and Allison looked as though they had been eating non stop, which they really had been. Both women were hooked on the idea of feeling full and satisfied, and since the weed based food, they had entered an even deeper dimension of food. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Allison finished her bite, she began to resume her explanation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Imagine a device, that cleans your bloodstream, kills all invasive cells for you, fixes and issues before they even happen. A device that essentially eliminates all harmful information in your body. Most specifically for the case of my self, a device that allows your body to be as healthy as ever no matter your weight. A world where we can all eat as we wish and feel no worry of health issues anymore... *munch*..\" Allison took another large bite, then stuck the rest of the burger into her mouth, resembling a chipmunk. As she tossed the wrapper in the closest garbage, the swallowed her food, releasing a large belch while doing so. \"Buuurppp.... phew, that was great.. Mark!\" With that, a man walked around the pizza holding a box of doughnuts, and began to hold them for Allison. \"OOhh me me me!\" Jess yelled, moving fast to the sweets, jiggling her doughy gut and boobs while doing so. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So wait a moment... what are you telling me exactly?\" Nicole asked, believing she knew what this meant, but wanted them to confirm it.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nic, it means we're about to dominate the pharmaceutical market now too!\" Jess said, taking a bite out of a pastry right after.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold on dear, we're about to change the world.\" Allison said, giggling out of glee and greed, just thinking of what they'll do next.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you can get as fat as you want, and it'll be harmless? Safe?\" Nicole asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Absolutely! This was the plan the whole time. Now we can keep eating. Jess and I have been testing the device, it's been great. I have plenty of energy, and I still have great charts at the doctors. I love this! Allison responded, motioning to Nicole to eat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not sure yet, maybe, let me think about it....\" Nicole responded, unsure of what this meant. Why diet? It's healthy now, she can eat with her friends, feel good. Why not? But what about the students? Giving in to food, that may mean giving up on the kids. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole didn't know what to do...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Her friends\u2014simple teachers in the public education system\u2014had become almost unrecognizable inside and out. Everything was money, money this and food, food that.

She'd fallen asleep at her desk, again, in the middle of lunchtime, again. The poor woman was about as wide as she was tall nowadays, having never been particularly tall nor active to begin with. The months spent on her endless indulgence had only served to make her almost spherical in shape. She was a poster child for the new world that was coming to fruition\u2014entirely consumed with consuming. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mm, Nicole.\" she said sleepily, resuming her meal exactly where she'd left off, \"Come...hrmmm... to join me for.... hrffff... lunch?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole watched in equal parts concern, revulsion, and jealousy as the piggy principal of her school continued to scarf down bite after bite of Thiqq Burger cuisine. It was all she could do, some days, to even look at Mrs. Dunn. She was so committed to making an absolute balloon of herself it seemed. Even before she learned that there were literally no consequences (health consequences, anyway) to her diet, all she wanted to do was eat. Now, it seemed as if that had been her core personality trait all along.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was wondering if I could, um... take a half day?\" Nicole gestured to her phone, \"I, uh... got a message from my friends, and...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh!\" the belly-built box of a woman hefted up slightly, leaning into her desk far enough for the edge to cut far into the lap of her belly folds, \"I don't see why not!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you.\" Nicole said with a restrained smile, \"It's, um... it's Jess and Allison!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yesyesyes...\" the fat woman burbled stupidly as she sucked down a handful of fries, \"Always liked them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They say hi.\" Nicole lied, \"Um... I hope you don't mind?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"After all the... <i>hrmmm</i>... good you do for us...\" Mrs. Dunn's slow heavy voice dropped as she lost interest in the nonedible conversation, \"Don't mind at all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a year of invitations, ebbing and flowing as time passed, Nicole had finally decided to meet with her friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a lonely life, her time as an incredibly rich woman beyond all belief. Her only other friends were women who were either too busy or too <i>dangerous</i> to be around. None of the other women at school seemed to like her for <i>her</i>, only her money. And none of her rich friends wanted her to be herself, it seemed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe invitation had come last week, and Nicole had thought long and hard about whether or not she had really \"forgiven\" them for turning their backs on who they used to be. The friends that Nicole had known them to be, and honestly liked them better as. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTonight would be the answer to that question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Nicole drove up the long, long, inconceivably long driveway and handed her car off to the chauffeur, she took the steps up to Jess's mansion with some trepidation. She was a bit out of shape\u2014teetering at more than a few pounds over 210. Still a blindsight better than some of the other people these days, but far heavier than she would have liked to have been. Thirty pounds since last year would have been mortifying just a few years ago, but now...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole shook her head, relating those kinds of thoughts to the back of her mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's just...\" she puffed as she rang the doorbell, \"Get this over with...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few moments, probably more than she had expected, the two front doors began to open...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Nicole was taken aback as she began looking over her old hot and fit friend. She was wearing a very nice dress, perhaps a dress too small for her new frame. Jen looked as though she had officially relapsed on her addiction to food. Her whole body had thickened noticeably. She had a spare tire that showed off rather obviously in her dress, looking either pregnant or just plain fat, her arms were thick and meaty, jiggling as she walked towards Nicole. Jens legs were also large and jiggling with every step, as her ass wobbled back and forth as well. Jen was forming a slight double chin, her weight seemed to stay belly and lower, as her breasts weren't all that big considering her size. Jen officially weighed around 220 pounds, and Nicole was in shock looking at her once fit friend. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nicole! Girl how are you! Please come in, we are so excited that you came! We have so much to catch up on girl!\" Jen said as they hugged, Nicole feeling Jens fat frame squeeze against her own. <i>Weird to admit but his doesn't feel all that bad</i>, Nicole thought just as Jen and her pulled away from the hug. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jen! It's great to see you, I love that dress! Where did you get it?\" Nicole asked, honestly curious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh thanks Nicole, you're sweet. It's actually too small as you can tell, I got it a few sizes ago but I haven't been shopping in a while, it's the only dress that actually fit me hahaha\", Jen laughed, completely aware of her size and apparent weight gain in the past year. Nicole quickly tried to ease it over quick, trying to not make it awkward for either women. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no, that's only a couple of pounds, look at me I'm the one who gained some weight haha\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well Nicole, to be honest with you,\" Jen started, \"I'm not really looking to lose this weight. Everything going on right now, I've decided that this is the right choice, plus it was only a matter of time before I caved anyways.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, so if you mind me asking, what exactly happened?\" Nicole asked, seeing Jen was open to talking about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well Nic, while I tried being thin and this glamorous model, my main reason was the health aspect. Jess and Allison contacted me once they had that device confirmed for consumer market, and I realized that people wouldn't care about me as much anymore. Looking around anywhere I went, people were looking rounder. In Paris, I saw vast amounts of women popping out of their pants, in England same thing. Jess and Allison have changed the world so quickly. And really, so have you. I mean, you must see how much money you make from the food and weed sales, my business was never <i>that</i> good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was true, while Nicole wasn't splurging on her income like the rest, she had made back her money invested already and much more. The women were on the way to being some of the richest in the world, as the health product and addictive cheap food became more and more popular. Nicole was officially a billionaire, and so was Jess and Allison. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I realized I needed to do something, but then Allison and Jess explained why they called me. See, as the world expands, the average model will need to  expand as well. So, Harrow Inc. owns FitWits, which we then rebranded and remodelled to the Harrow Lifestyle Branch. We're now all about the new medicine we offer, and our business aims to work on making this new fat worlds lifestyle as enjoyable and popular as possible. Myself, for example. I'm gaining weight intentionally now, I did it as a strategy for my followers, I'm the main model promoting this new device. It's awesome, I eat as much as I want, I still get to model, I'll be richer doing it and I'm with my best friends! Did I mention eating? hahaha\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole honestly understood her point of view. Nicole had the trendiest business in the world and was making more money than she even understood. Jen would lose her business the hard way if she hadn't adapted, and Nicole was already aware of the weight gain trend being even more popular since the device became public. A lot of people began to be more open about their obesity. Beyond the schools faculty, Nicole was seeing how fat the world was becoming, and in part because of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyways, the girls want to see you, let's go to the table shall we? They got started already haha, very typical.\" Jen said, walking towards to Jess's dining room with Nicole nervously following.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Here it is, we can do it. It'll be easy, here we go...</i> Nicole thought as she entered the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Nicole certainly had expected that both of these girls would be bigger than the last time they met, but this wasn't exactly what she expected. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst, there's Jess. She was currently sitting, hunched into the table, inhaling her mashed potatoes at a lightning fast rate, taking swigs from her cup of gravy next to her to wash down the thick and creamy treat. Her blouse was fully open, with her fat breasts overflowing her tight bra and resting on exposing her behemoth belly, which is laying out onto her fat thighs. Jess had food smothered all over her fat face, which had a large prominent double chin, even showing signs of a third chin on it's way. Jess had really expanded, she was 100 pounds heavier than she was last year, putting her at a solid 315 pounds. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, there's Allison. Thinking that 100 pounds in a year isn't a substantial weight gain would sound crazy, unless you compare it to something even larger, like 125 pounds, or 150 pounds, or maybe even to something like gaining almost 200 pounds in a year. Then it doesn't seem so large. Allison, well she gained even past 200. Her current weight was officially 580 pounds, and she really did look it. Allisons' face was very fat, she had almost lost recognition to her previous self. She had 3 full chins, and a fat neck that made her look smothered in fat. Her breasts were quite large, and hung onto her even larger belly. It was thick and had multiple rolls folding on to her massive thighs. Nicole couldn't believe how fat she'd grown, and clearly was still loving it. Beside her was her husband, who was feeding his massive wife anything he could grab from the table. Allison was currently eating a large pizza her husband folded in half and handed to her. She is practically inhaling it, looking like an absolute glutton. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ladies, look who made it!\" Jen yelled, grabbing both the girls attention to Nicole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nic! You came! Oh thank god!\" Jess yelled, moving her chair as she began to get up to hug her old friend. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi guys! I'm sorry it took so long, I was really in the wrong, I'm sorry that I've gone an-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay! Seriously! Don't mention it. You're here now, we forgave you long ago, it's all water under the bridge. Now hug me and update me on your life!\" Jess said convincingly, walking over and hugging her best friend. Allison proceeded to move her chair as she swallowed her last bite of the pizza, struggling due to her immense size. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No here I'll come to you!\" Nicole said as Allison opened her fat arms to receive a hug. Everyone sat down, and Nicole began to catch the girls up on her past year. Things like her charity, that has expanded to fund nearly a quarter of the schools in the state, her own weight gain, the schools weight gain (particularly Mrs. Dunns), as well as her recent new thoughts on her weight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm really over all of the issues before, I love you guys, and I love you with your appetites just as much. Although, one question Jess, if you don't mind my asking, how come you and Allison didn't gain as much?\" Nicole asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah good question. A couple answers to it,\" Jess responds. \"Firstly, Allison has been using other things for her company, since she's under the experimental procedures testing al their potential products. Some make her put on weight faster, so that's one part of it. However, I've been cutting back on my indulgences for a bit. Tonight is an exception, but there's too much business to be done, until our lab techs figure out to make our world perfect for immobility, I'm trying to keep my weight down.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh interesting. Well, I'm hungry looking at all this food, I'm not too late am I?\" Nicole asks, rubbing her belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course not! Let's get some more food out here please!\" Jess yells to the kitchen staff, who bring new trays of hot food on to the table. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole begins to grab food slowly at first, but begins to increase speed, eventually grabbing whatever what within her reach. She ate burger after burger, hot dog after hot dog. She ate the mashed potatoes she saw Jess enjoying earlier, using the same gravy method. Nicole undid her pants, lifted up her shift and exposed her own spare tire. The girls were a little shocked seeing Nicole so blatant about her gut, but they very much approved of it. They encouraged her to eat more by trying new things. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here, this pizza is great! The grease is amazing!\" Allison said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have some wings too! And how about some burgers? Have you tried the new deluxe Thiqq burger? It's sooo good!\" Jess piped in after, hold a platter of both, which Nicole eagerly grabbed and inhaled. Something about tonight was different, she was feeling her inner beast come out, and it was nice. Nicole and the girls got stoned and drunk and absolutely stuffed. Dessert came and went, each girl eating a solid portion of sweetness even though they were practically stuck from their food. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole was covered in sauces, stuffed to the brim, unable to speak. She's holding an almost empty wine bottle in one hand, and a slice of cake in the other, still trying to eat whatever she could. Allison was laying back, almost asleep at this point, holding her large beer and burping nonstop. She was practically naked sitting on her two chairs. Jen was halfway through a second pie, trying her best to finish it. Her dress came off a while ago, well more like ripped off. Jen was eating almost more than anyone since Harrow Inc. gave her appetite pills and weight gain pills to increase size faster. Thus, Jen ate a ton. She also is hammered from all the vodka she guzzled. Lastly, there's Jess. She really looked fat, sitting with her gut full swing. She was still drinking beer and wine, as well as eating more burgers from Thiqq burger. Jess begins to stand up, holding up her drink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here's to Nicole! *bblluuurp* She's finally here, and look at us, getting togeth-*HIC!*-er just like we used to! *Buurpp* We love you Nic!\" Jess said drunkenly, letting out a huge burp after speaking. The girls lifted their drinks, and sluggishly drank. Things felt good again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Nicole awoke dazed, her vision blurred as she looked around the room, unsure of where she how she had gotten there. Nicole looked down to see she had somehow ended up in a cozy bed, in a large bedroom that resembled a war zone. Food wrappers and drink bottles were scattered on her floor, showing she clearly ate right until the very end of her night. Nicole then saw she had only been sleeping in her underwear and a large t-shirt that definitely wasn't hers. <i>Holy fuck, what happened last night? I can't remember anything past that second bottle of wine... good lord, that would explain why my head hurts... I should go find the other girls, see how they're doing. </i>With that, Nicole slowly heaved her chubbier frame out of bed, her spare tire bouncing with every step. On her way out the door she noticed a bag of unopened chips on the floor, which she immediately grabbed and ripped open, grabbing a handful. \"Mmmm my god, how am I so hungry? I must've eaten more last night than I do in an entire month...god my belly is getting so big... ugh, but if I wanna save this friendship, so I'm gonna have to deal with whatever comes at me.\" Nicole said out loud to herself, grabbing another handful of chips once she was done. Nicole then moved towards the door and walked around the house trying to see what or who she would find. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole was walking down a large hallway when she found Jen on the floor in the living room. She was covered in chocolate, and her belly looked like a balloon, showing she had clearly devoured something recently. As Nicole went to see if she was okay, she heard a voice from the living room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's okay, don't worry! She's just tuckered out from her pre morning binge.\" Nicole looked and saw it was Jess, who was sitting on a chair reading a book, sipping on coffee and eating breakfast from her two fully loaded plates. \"Come and have some breakfast Nic, it's just you and me.\" Jess said cheerily, to which Nicole walked over and took a seat. One of the servants came over with a menu and handed it to Nicole, while pouring her a water. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi there, my name is Lisa, I work for Jess and I'll be serving you this morning. What can I get you?\" Lisa asked bubbly, making Nicole wince a little from her alert voice. Nicole quickly looked over Lisa and noticed she had very pretty red hair, with a very cute pale face and freckles. She looked like she was in fairly good shape, a nice average ass, but a big pair of tits. Her cleavage left very little to the imagination, giving Nicole a challenge not to stare at her large chest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh uh well uh let's see,\" Nicole stammered, also still not totally awake yet. \"Ouh okay, I'll take some pancakes... an omelette.. um some bacon, some sausage, oooh some homefries and a little gravy too please! Oh and some coffee as well if you don't mind.\" Nicole said, handing back the menu to Lisa who looked happy to get the food ready.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes of course! Anything you need, just ask me and I'll get it for you! Don't be afraid to ask for anything you want, hehe, okay?\" Lisa said with a wink, eying over Nicole quickly as she turned towards the kitchen, swaying her ass side to side in her tight black pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey uh, was it just me, or was she kind of..\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hitting on you?\" Jess asked as she stuffed three sausage links at once into her mouth. Nicole nods, still confused. \"She's a funny one, she's into heavier women, she's great for putting up with all the messes and what not. Don't mind her though, she only wants to help.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No no, I just was thrown a little off guard is all, it has been a little while since I've really had any sex to be honest...\" Nicole confesses to Jess, \"I've been so busy and all this weight has made me feel a lot less sexy around men...\" Nicole said as she picked up her gut and jiggled it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nic, I've never had hotter sex than fat sex. You're so hot girl! Look at Lisa there, she liked you at one look. You gotta take some time off, let someone else run your company, just relax for a bit! You need to enjoy some the finer things in life Nic, not only food and drink, but really good sex. Experiment, you've got the money now.\" Jess said, stuffing half a pancake into her mouth resulting in syrup dripping down her chin and onto her breasts. \"Mmmm excuse me, jeez I'm a slob sometimes haha, sorry about that.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm maybe you're right, maybe I need to take a step back from my work. Let someone else run it, take some time off, maybe even go on vacation... hmmm.... I like that.\" The two keep talking while Lisa begins to bring out breakfast for Nicole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here we go! Hope it's good, there's more coming so eat fast! Enjoy!\" Lisa said, seductively looking at Nicole. Nicole began eating her food quickly, still trying to chat with Jess, but she had to admit the food was pretty distracting. Over the next hour, both girls ate their fills and looked quite plump afterwards. Jess had a taught and full belly, and her fat face and multiple chins made her look absolutely engorged. Nicole also looked stuffed to the brim, still in only underwear and a shirt that was looking more snug than it had earlier in the morning. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole had to admit, she missed the feeling of eating to the max. <i>I know I should try for the children, but I really want to just enjoy myself. Besides, the foundation will only grow as I make more money, so maybe I should really focus on expanding my wealth. Maybe I should work with the girls more with Harrow Inc..... maybe it's time to start caring about what Nicole wants....</i><br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Nicole made the choice to help herself out for a change and live a little. Nicole was a massively rich woman, she could use her money and business to benefit more ands more people as she made herself more and more money. Nicole wanted to splurge a little, eat food guilt free with her friends, go out and be social and have hot sex with multiple people. After her and Jess' talk, Nicole left to sort out her taking some time off. Nicole knew Mrs. Dunn wouldn't care, as long as she had food in front of her Nicole was safe from any fury Mrs. Dunn might have left in her fat form. Nicole made it home after stopping at a Thiqq Burger and eating two double cheese burgers, 3 orders of nuggets and a large poutine, her belly jiggling as she stepped into her house. That evening Nicole spent her time indulging in anything she thought of. Nicole drank her favourite beer, smoked her favourite weed, and ate all of her favourite foods. She put back a full dinner, 2 desserts, and plenty of snacks until she passed out, waiting for Monday to come.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn Monday morning, Nicole awoke in her bedroom, unsure of when she even went to sleep last night. <i>Jesus... my head hurts... ugghhh and my stomach, I'm gonna need something greasy before I do anything today.</i> Nicole laid in her bed, ordering food from a couple different places, not wanting to move until the food was close. As the food got to the door, Nicole slowly lumbered out of bed, moving herself towards the door to meet the delivery drivers. Nicole took the food, and spread it out on the table before tucking in. She ordered pancakes, bacon, sausages and toast, as well as mac and cheese, a dozen doughnuts, and 3 breakfast sandwiches. Nicole began to inhale her food, enjoying the sensation of her belly filling up and poking out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohhh myy goooddd...\" Nicole moaned after taking a large bite from her breakfast sandwiches. \"This food tastes sooo gooood... I can't believe I'm finally just giving in. I can't wait to get the business growing, and to meet new people... mmmmmm.... wow this mac and cheese is just amazing I need more!\" Nicole began stuffing the pasta into her gut, also grabbing bacon to stuff into her mouth after she was finished. As Nicole ate the rest of her breakfast, she knew she had to get to the school soon even though her belly was fit to burst. Over the next hour, she got herself ready to visit the school for the last time in a little while, making Nicole excited for whatever comes after today. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Nicole approached the school in her car, she felt her clothes squeezing her rolls. Usually this would make her feel self conscious about her weight around other people, but things were feeling different, especially around the school. Almost every faculty member was bigger than before, leaving very few at their original weight. As for students, they were too growing larger by the day, increasing the uniform budget by quite a large amount, not that it mattered to Mrs. Dunn or any of the other faculty. Nicole did find that her embarrassment and shame for her weight was decreasing as the general populations weight climbed and climbed. Nicole was still fatter than the average person, but not by the amount she used to be. At 215 pounds, Nicole moved her bulky frame into the school, walking towards the Principals office at a medium pace due to still feeling stuffed from breakfast. As Nicole got closer to the office, she was stopped by a students mother that she knows very well, Mrs. Kimberly Mathieson. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mrs. Smith!\" Kimberly shouted while waving one hand, Nicole noticing her other hand holding a drink from Thiqq Burger. \"Hiya there, I haven't seen you in a while, I know how busy you must be.\"  Nicole smiled and stopped to chat with Kimberly, but Nicole noticed like so many others, Kimberlys figure had changed. Kimberly was once a yoga mom, who was incredibly fit with an amazing ass. Kimberly was in her early 40s, with short blonde hair and very cute blue eyes. It wasn't really a massive amount of weight compared to so many around her, but for a woman who looked like she did, it was extremely noticeable. She must've weighed around 170 pounds, sporting a belly that jiggled more than it ever had before. Her boobs looked larger and softer, now bouncing as she walked. Kim was still incredibly sexy, but she was definitely showing signs of her new lifestyle.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi Kim! It must have been ages since I last saw you, how have you been doing?\" Nicole said, trying to keep her focus on Kimberlys eyes, not wanting to be spotted checking out her friends new frame. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh so good, not like you I know hehe, but still, things have been going very well!\" Kimberly responded, taking a sip from her drink, then continuing to answer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Phil and I are doing better than ever, plus with the drop in price in food we've been able to save up for trips, and a new car! Not to mention Phil actually got a promotion at his office, seems like things are good right now!\" Kimberly said with a smile, before rubbing her belly. \"Well, seems like I'm a little peckish, I might run out for a bite to eat, you can come if you'd like!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole thought about it, knowing she had to talk with Mrs. Dunn, but maybe she had time for a quick snack? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Nicole thought long and hard, thinking about eating more food even though she still felt stuffed from earlier. Eventually though, Nicole knew what she had to do, maybe she'd get something to eat after her meeting though...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I would love to, but I actually have to meet with Mrs. Dunn, but maybe another time?\" Nicole said apologetically, hoping not to offend her friend. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's okay! Another time. See you later Mrs. Smith!\" Kimberly said, hugging her friend and walking out the door saying something quietly to herself. \"Okay now, where should I go... I'd love a burrito...\" Nicole could hear her planning her meal as she walked away, shocked to see even \"Hot Yoga Mom Kimberly\" eating junk food and over indulging. <i>Everyone is embracing the food, I still can't believe that sometimes...</i> Nicole thought, before turning her focus back towards the office doors. <i>Here we go Nic, we can do this, we've got this! </i> Nicole then moved towards the office, meeting her receptionist/assistant, Sam Peele. When Sam was initially hired by Mrs. Dunn, she was young, ambitious, eager to help even if that meant getting food. Sam would simply walk back and forth, giving Mrs. Dunn whatever she needed, however, since then Mrs. Dunns needs have increased, creating a lot of work for Sam. It was decided the cafeteria would be responsible with her order and deliveries, making it easier for her to always have food and making Sams life less stressful. The school then moved Sam to be Mrs. Dunns personal receptionist/assistant, making her do more school oriented work. This has resulted in Sam being strung out and seated for the entire day every day for most of time being here, and that has caused complications for her weight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam had grown a good amount since starting work at the school, though it isn't hard to tell, considering she's not exactly hiding it all that well. Sams clothes were snug and clinging to her fatter frame, looking strained and close to breaking. Sams pants were completely undone, though you wouldn't be able to tell from her full belly poking over her zipper. Sams chest had grown immensely, wobbling her fat tits without much effort needed. Sam was currently seated at her desk, stuffing a sub sandwich into her mouth, dropping food into her large cleavage. Sam looked full and bloated from her current meal, with the wrappers on the floor indicating her meal had been going for some time now. Sam saw Nicole come in, walking towards her desk. Sam quickly forced the rest of the sandwich into her mouth, trying to swallow it as fast as possible so she could talk with Nicole. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm-hey! *munch munch*... *gulp*...* burrp!*... excuse me for that, phew... that was delicious. How can I help you today Ms. Smith?\" Sam asked, holding her belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was hoping I could chat with Mrs. Dunn, I assume she's in her office?\" Nicole asked, gesturing towards Mrs. Dunns door.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She is, although she's currently on a break and normally wants to be left alone, but I'm sure you're an exception, Ms. Smith.\" Sam replied, getting out of her seat and going towards the door.  As Sam opened the door slightly, she politely asked Mrs. Dunn if she could meet with Nicole, who of course said yes. As Sam went back to her desk, she grabbed a chocolate bar and began to eat it while reading some of her paperwork, moaning a little with each bite. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Nicole walked into the room, the smell of fast food washed over her, increasing her craving for food. The room was large, and full of the impressive accolades Mrs. Dunn and her school has accomplished. In the large room, there were also many tables, mostly cluttered with garbage and empty plates yet to be cleaned up. On Mrs. Dunns desk sat a large amount of numerous food types, and behind them was the once accomplished principal, now eating her talents away. Mrs. Dunn was currently leaned back, her shirt full open exposing her breasts in her bra, resting on her large double belly. Mrs. Dunns fat arms jiggling as she squishes her doughy belly, burping as she does. She smiled as Nicole walked up to her desk, opening her mouth to speak and instead releasing a massive belch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"BRAAAHHHPP!!!!... Oh my... excuse me Nicole, I'm such a pig I know, it's all just too yummy to say no to *snort*.\" Mrs. Dunn jiggled her whole body with the snort, reaching for a slice of cake with her bare hand while continuing to talk. \"How can I help you Nicole?\" Mrs. Dunn stuffed the cake slice into her mouth, making a mess of herself while still sitting back. Nicole noticed her fat full neck as she tilted her head up, shoving the rest of the cake into her belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well Mrs. Dunn, you see, I love my job here but I think it's necessary for me to take a step back and run my business for a while, seems like it's the right moment after all.\" Nicole said, hoping Mrs. Dunn wouldn't be upset with her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my of course! I understand! Take all the time in the world, you're welcome back anytime I'll make sure your office remains yours, for whenever you want to come back!\" Mrs. Dunn said, grabbing a muffin from her desk and taking a large bite from. \"I never got why you stayed so long in the first place, you're so rich, and your business looks like it'll take over the world hahaha... teaching here is too small for you!\" Mrs. Dunn shook her frame as she spoke, inhaling the rest of the muffin and grabbing a box of pizza next. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you Mrs. Dunn, I appreciate the support. Anything you need let me know, I'll have it done for you.\" Nicole said, smiling as she turned around and left, leaving her hungry hungry hippo of a boss behind to continue to pork out. Nicole began to leave the office, seeing Sam eat a plate full of fries and a burger, and walk down the halls. <i>I'll miss this place, but I'll be back...</i><br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

While many people were gaining at more moderate and \"normal\" amounts, some people were gaining far more. Mrs. Singh and Ms. Harper were two examples of that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMrs. Singh was sitting on the left side of the table, pulling doughnuts out of their box, stuffing them into her full face. Mrs. Singh had really expanded, practically popping out of her top. Her large belly pushing up against the table while her tits push up against her bra, it was clear she needed new clothes soon before she has an \"incident\". These days almost every faculty had them, making you go home and change immediately. Mrs. Singh was only 5'2, making her 330 pound frame quite round. Her belly was bloated and taught, even as she reached for more sweets. As Nicole walked over, she got a better look at both women, seeing their figures stretch their clothing and witnessing how fast they put away a box of doughnuts. Mrs. Singh was large, but Ms. Harper looked to be eating as much as her friend, if not even more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMs. Harper just finished putting two doughnuts into her mouth, while going to loosen her pants. Ms. Harper looked to be almost 400 pounds, as her belly was squishing against the table and her flab jiggled everywhere as she inhaled more and more food. Nicole walked over, telling her friends she'd be out of town for the next while, needing to catch up on work. Both women looked sad, but happy she was taking time for herself. Mrs. Singh pulled out a cake, and took a bite out of it, before saying to Nicole, \"You need to take that break, you work so hard, look at us, unwind and be like us, we love taking care of ourselves, as you can see hahaha *munch munch*\" Mrs. Singh ate her cake with gusto, grabbing her large belly as she smothered it all over her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know,\" Ms. Harper began, after finishing her own platter of doughnuts and danishes, \"You own such an amazing business, and yet you don't utilize that. If I were in your shoes, I'd literally be unable to move hahaha... you have incredible will power.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're kind, but it is time I took care of myself for a change. I'll see you girls soon, come over for dinner some time!\" Nicole said, before heading outside towards her car, jiggling her butt with every step.</span></div></div>",

Besides, Nicole was going to work with Jess, Jen and Allison, 3 food loving fatties like Nicole, she was definitely going to be enjoying herself while working. Nicole had seen first hand at the school what was happening to people as they over fed themselves, seeing the needs that people were going to need very, very soon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole brought a lot of value to the table, now that all four women were working together at the Harrow Inc. headquarters. Nicole encouraged the company to go into self driving cars for the mega obese people who could no longer fit behind the wheel, as well as opening their own online department store meant for the over fed. As the weeks went on, Nicole began to enjoy the feeling of success more and more, drinking more, eating more, and fucking more,. A lot more. All four women were becoming social media stars, giving the girls lots of attention. Nicole used this to have more sex, more food, and of course more drinks. She was going in deep on the over indulging lifestyle, losing what day in the week it was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne month had passed since Nicole had taken a leave from the school, and she was loving life. Nicole had taken the device that removes health defects that Harrow Inc. owns, making her happier to pig out guilt free. This had taken a toll on Nicoles figure even in only a month. Nicole had managed to put on 20 pounds over the past month, putting her at a total of 235 pounds. Nicole was currently sitting on her couch naked, eating a bucket of chicken legs while drinking her 6th beer of the day. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicoles boobs were hanging down a little, as she slouched, causing them to almost rest on her flabby gut. Nicoles current bloated state made her appear like a beached whale, her fat rolls shifting as she lifts her arm up for more chicken. Nicole was having a day off, since she was getting burnt out from not taking a break in a few weeks. It was only 4 in the afternoon and she was already drunk, and had eaten more food than a regular person would eat in 3 days. She had ordered food from 7 different places already today, rubbing her full belly while still eating more chicken legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm *slurp* oh my... I can't believe I get *bbuurrp* to eat all this junk and be okay *belch* cause I can handle being fat, I just wanna be able to move for a while... but oh my... this food is just wonderful, I better watch myself....\" Nicole took another bite from her chicken leg, officially finishing off the drumstick and moving on to the last one in the bucket. Nicole grabbed her vibrator after tossing the bucket into her garbage, and began to rub her self until she came hard. With that, she got up, cracked another beer, and looked online as to what she wanted to eat next. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A Week Later<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole threw in another wrapper into the garbage. This time, it hit the rim and bounced out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah damn it.\" Nicole said, sounding exhausted. She was sitting in her indoor pool, the radio was on, probably playing whatever new music was on the top 40 charts. Nicole had really gone all in since she won. She has been living the good life, smoking pot all day, drinking, and eating almost non stop. Of course, you can imagine the impact on her figure from all this lounging. After a full week of letting herself go, Nicole weighed rough 245 pounds, gaining 10 pounds in a mere 7 days. She had now put on almost double her body weight since winning the lottery, something she never would\u2019ve seen herself enjoying so much. Nicole had a much bigger ass and thighs, and her gut was hanging more and more everyday. Nicoles\u2019 face was fat, with two chins no matter where she pointed it. Currently in her pool, her two piece isn't hiding much of anything. Her fat wet body floating at the side while she stuffs her 5th burger down her throat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole has enjoyed the life well though. She eats only the best food, or delivers herself whatever fast food she might be craving. As of recently, you could say Nicole had become unhinged. Her daily routine went something roughly like this..<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole would wake up at 10am, which is when her breakfast is delivered to her in bed. She watches TV and eats a full breakfast. Today it was a pound of cooked bacon, waffles, omelettes, and plenty of sausages. After they take the dirty dishes, she gets up and heads to the living room, where doughnuts, cookies, muffins, and other snacks await Nicole. She watches more TV while inhaling pastries of all types  drinking plenty of milk and juice and smoking weed. By noon she cracks a beer or two, begins her lunch. Today, she ate tacos, and a full burrito, as well as a couple burgers, she also managed to force in some dessert afterwards, which was an entire lava cake, which ended all over her chubby face. Nicole sits there, looking at her damage. The table is a mess, and her gut is heaving up and down. She cracks another beer, stands up sluggishly and begins to light up another joint. She then lays off lunch, until she wakes up and opens a bottle of wine, and drink right from the bottle. She is drunk and high and ready to eat some more. Dinner is served, where Nicole begins to put down an entire chicken, an entire large pizza with plenty of meat and cheese, she ate a large poutine with everything in it, and put back an entire bottle of wine. Nicole goes to the living room, where pie or cake is delivered, and she eats until she sleeps. The staff help her to bed, and give her snacks for overnight, which she always eats. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole was completely lost in this routine. Her staff didn't care, they got paid well. She made enough money to live this way for the next 2000 years. Nicole enjoyed this lifestyle. She liked being a pig. Nicole liked growing and growing, eating all day and enjoying her wealth in her own way.  With that thought Nicole grabs a candy bar and begins stuffing it in her mouth as fast as possible. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJen though, Jen was on board with Nicole. At first Jen saw it as letting loose a little, but between the food tasting so good, her increasing wealth from her new business deals and her body feeling sexier she continued to eat, and only increased her intake of food. Jen would visit Nicole regularly, hanging out for meals with her new slobby friend. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJen is currently at Nicoles\u2019 house, sitting in the pool and surrounded by dozens of fast food bags. Her 232 pound body floating in the water as she inhaled her last burger. On to the hot dogs! Jen thought, swallowing her last bite. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Walter! More Pop please!\" Jen whined, Walter (her own personal butler) came in the room and delivered the massive bottle, which she grabbed and chugged from. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"BUUUuuuRRRPPpp... oh excuse me, thank *blorp* you Walter, oops hehe\", Walter walks away confused but flattered by her kindness. Jen grabbed another extra loaded double hot dog and stuffed it in her mouth, moaning while she ate as much as possible. Amazingly she was running out of food, but someone would surely either get more, or make her some more. They could never run out of food because Jen felt she needed to keep eating until she physically couldn't anymore. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlso at the pool is our third lottery winner, Ms. Jessica Haskel. Her new 330 pound frame made her new life a little more challenging, but with her servants and her money, she had everything she needed. She was currently on a lounge chair, her huge body causing strain on the chair. Her new found addiction to greed was changing her in many remarkable ways. She constantly ate, wanting to feel stuffed at every given moment. She also loved her servants help and utilized them for her every need. Her obsession with power had grown even larger, now being wet at the thought of bossing people around. Some other things Jess enjoyed as well since winning it big, was the more \"pleasurable\" things in life, so to speak. Jess had come to realize how good masturbation or sex was, especially with food. Jess was hooking up more than ever. She had to admit, it made her feel very hot to know she had that kind of pull on people even in her mid 40s. Jess was also enjoying drinking and smoking weed more often, putting her in a lethargic and fat state 24/7.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAllison was also at the pool, although she was heavily focused on her meal. At 600 pounds she was a complete blob of a woman compared to what she used to be. As she sits on her custom industrial strength chair watching TV at the bar, she was eating her fourth box of pizza. She had also eaten 4 and a half pound of wings already, which sat on the other side of the couch with her dirty napkins. Allison let out a solid wet belch, \"BUUrrrppppp.. excuse me hahaha\u2026 my goodness girls\u2026*urp*...I\u2019m just such a fatass...but yet I feel like a million bucks\u2026*burp!!*\". Allison grabbed her pitcher of beer and chugged a large volume down before releasing another large belch. \u201cBUUUURRRPPP!!!! Oh my goodness I\u2019m such a fuggin\u2019 glutton\u2026\u201d Allison said drunkenly before she resumed eating the pizza.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Oh and a extra large chocolate milkshake! That's all hehe\" Jess giggled, knowing how much of a pig she sounded like. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Drive on through to the first window please.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe car moved forward, and the sounds of garbage moving about the vehicle began. Jess once would\u2019ve been disgusted by her current lifestyle choices, but that was the old Jess, you wouldn\u2019t even be able to recognize her anymore, she had really let herself go. Her doughy belly, now even larger than before. Currently, in her drivers seat Jess sat there in pink sweat pants that were looking stretched and even ripped in a couple of places, also wearing her sweat top, which had been unzipped open and looked unlikely to contain the belly that was spilling out onto her pants. Jess was wearing a white tank top, stained and rolled up to show her fat tits resting on her massive gut. Jess had a double chin, and her cheeks had grown and puffed out even more. Jess had to admit, she now loved this new look and lifestyle. The attention she brings satisfied a new craving she didn't know she had. As she pulled up, the girl working the window was staring at Jess, a full public fat ass. She noticed her expensive car littered with food wrappers, and how completely stuffed she looked. The cashier was wide eyed, she was used to obese people but normally people had more\u2026 decency. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh um.. uh that'll be 50 bucks..\" The girl says, trying not to look at Jess's large tits that are popping out of her tank top. \"Here's my Card.\" Jess lifted her free food card card, arm jiggling slightly, and handed it to the cashier. Oh my god, she\u2019s the freakin owner? She\u2019s fucking huge! <br>\r\nThe girl couldn\u2019t contain her nerves and curiosity, causing her to blurt out loud without thought. \"Are you going to eat all of this food by yourself?\" Immediately the girl began to sweat, realizing what she just asked a customer. Oh shit I'm so fired, shit shit shit. Why the hell would I say that out loud!? She had a terrified look all over her face, which Jess obviously noticed as she looked at the girl. She was pretty, slender, young, but looked past 20. Jess simply looked at the girl and began laughing out loud. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hahaha, that was gutsy...I like the energy you have. Yes, I'm gonna eat it all right away. Been on a bit of a self discovery haha. Can\u2019t deny I love my own food.\" Jess said, patting her pale and exposed gut for emphasis. \"What\u2019s your name?\u201d The girl was surprised by the calm answer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s Marissa\u2026 it\u2019s very nice to uh, meet you ma'am.\u201d Marissa said, still nervous about asking her head boss such a dumb question. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell Marissa, it\u2019s lovely to meet you, I like havin\u2019 you work here. If you ever need anything, let me know. Oh! And a word of advice, life is too short, just enjoy what you like. I like food. Here's that tip for the gravy!\" Jess handed her a $100 bill and then drove off. Marissa felt strange, and extremely confused about what just happened. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"..enjoy what you like.. hmmm...\" Marissa said quietly out loud, changing her focus towards the grill. With that, Jess began to drive home, stuffing down some of the burgers and fries to start while she drove. On the way, Jess spotted one of Harrow Inc. drive through ice cream stores, and pulled in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, how can we take your order,\" The box said.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Hi there, I'd love to have two of your mega fudge sundaes with all the toppings. I'll also grab one of your ice cream cakes, extra large please!\" Jess requested, biting into her last burger quickly afterwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, come on up to the window.\" The box responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Jess was pulling up she opened the poutine and began shovelling it down. She pulled out her card, the cashier was shocked at the pure gluttony she was witnessing. The cashier gave her her food, and Jess pulled into the parking lot. Jess began inhaling her poutine, barely chewing. Forkful after forkful into her gut, Jess was making a mess on her shirt as she quickly demolished her fries and gravy. She looked at the soup bowl filled with the rich gravy, and began guzzling it down until it was done, and she released a belch that pedestrians heard across the street. She then began eating her chicken and ice cream, beginning to drive home until something else popped into her focus.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJess was a monster when it came to eating, she has eaten almost anything that has come to her mind. Her home would\u2019ve become a mess, wrappers everywhere, food containers scattered all over, if not for her very helpful maids. Jess hired a chef named Gwen who lived in a guest house on the property. She also hired another housekeeper, named Olivia, to help Lisa (her first housekeeper) with the cleaning since Gwen is often cooking. These two would clean up after the messes, and take care of keeping the property in order. The three women were paid very well, mostly because Jess thought it was fair considering the sights/smells they had to endure with her slobbiness. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Jess's blouse was close to exploding off of her, and her pants were very tight. Jess hopped in her car, drove to Thiqq Burger, intending to order a massive feast. Marissa was at the cash, not the drive thru today, secretly munching on fries hiding them from her boss Karen. Karen was a once healthy tall and skinny woman, but now, at 35 she managed to put on enough weight from her job that she\u2019s needed 5 uniform upgrades. She weighed around 150 pounds, showing her new fat figure off under her tight uniform.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMarissa, we got a huge order coming up, all hands on deck!\u201d Karen shouted, taking a massive bite from her burger and leaning against the wall.

Jess looked the girl over, noticing that she was skinny and very cute. Marissa had short brown hair, a full sleeve tattoo on her left arm, and a nose piercing. Jess liked this girl, she couldn\u2019t stop thinking about her after meeting her yesterday. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey there Marissa, just who I wanted to see. How's work going today?\" Jess asked through the window towards her. Marissa's face warmed up when she realized Jess remembered her name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not bad, it was slow until you came haha. Are you gonna eat all this food too? This is way more than yesterday.\" Marissa asked, thinking Jess wouldn't mind the question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no, this is for me and my friends. I'm bringing them a surprise lunch from here. Just need to be prepared hahaha.\" Jess answered, her belly jiggling with her laughs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You sure do like to eat, aren't you uh... worried? You know.. about gettin\u2019... fat?\" Marissa asked, afraid of if she crossed a line yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I used to be! Fact is, I don't mind, I still hook up with people, and I feel great. I like eating like this, and our implant has made me healthier than I ever have been! \" Jess responds, still happy to answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not crazy, really.\" Marissa says, \"Honestly I love eating, especially here. Yesterday, once you left, I spent the rest of my shift paying for burgers with your tip money and sneaking them behind my managers back. I was so full, but I kind of loved it.. I'm a little jealous of your confidence with it...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJess is shocked and turned on by this conversation. I'm not sure what to do, on the one hand I should see the girls and apologize, on the other hand I'm so wet thinking about this girl, maybe they can wait a day? Hmmm I don't know\u2026 Ah fuck it, momma needs some of her... Jess leaned into the drive through window and speaks seductively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ditch work, I've got food you and I can eat together.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait you can\u2019t be serious? You want me to come eat with you?\u201d Marissa was stunned, unsure of what to do. \"I can't just ditch work! I'll get fired! How will I pay rent?\" Marissa protests with valid points.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJess smirks, and says, \"I'll pay your rent until you get back on your feet. I'll give you all the food you ever wanted, you'll live like a queen! You can stay with me until you wanna go. Come on, ditch it, I know you want to!\" Marissa looks around, and makes the choice. She gets up and runs out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! Where are you going!?\" Her manager Karen asked, her spare tire shaking with her frustrated voice and stomping as Marissa just turned and said, \"I'm done.\" And walked out the door, getting into Jess's car. Karen watched this happen. \"Shit, now I'll need to hire someone else. I need a friggin burger to calm myself down.\" Karen said, walking towards the back, jiggling her ass in her tight pants on the way to the grill.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As Jess drove to the house, Marissa began to digest what had just happened. She began to look at the clothes Jess was popping out of, clearly small, but she's wearing really expensive name brand clothing, and didn't care about destroying the outfits with stains. As Marissa began to realize she was now unemployed, Jess began bringing out some of the burgers she had just bought and proceeded to unwrap one, handing it to Marissa with a smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eat up! Food is hot! This is what you wanted, right?\" Jess said, still focused on the road but clearly trying to get Marissa to start eating some fast food. Marissa took the burger from her hand with wide eyes and bit in, forgetting all about her worries and just enjoying the greasy burger, one bite, two bites. Marissa only ate faster, stuffing the burger down her throat and grabbed the whole bag of food. Jess began getting wet, something about this was so hot, she really wanted to get together with Marissa. Jess grabbed her own burger, proceeding to eat while driving home to help calm herself down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the drive was coming to a close, the food was only a quarter eaten, and the girls were looking full. Marissa had undone her pants and was rubbing her small belly. Jess was bursting out of her clothes more than before, not very far from being naked (maybe intentionally so). As they drove up the driveway of Jess\u2019 estate, Marissa took in the sheer size of the property. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Told ya I got you covered, you're going to enjoy yourself for a change, really let loose!\" Jess said, seeing Marissa's shocked face. Jess began to explain her story, and how she got the money, and more on why she loves food and eats whatever whenever she wants. She told Marissa she\u2019d give her the implant if she wanted, and give her a room in the house until she wanted to leave. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See, since winning, I've realized that food is one of the greatest things in the world, and when you can afford to eat anything you want, you realize how good it feels to just let it out, to just eat anything I'm thinking about. As I get fatter, I honestly don't mind one bit. I have plenty of hot sex with many people who find me attractive. I've never felt so alive, so good, so ... pleased and pleasured.... it even kind of arouses me to see myself gain, to see where all my eating goes hahaha.... I hope this isn't strange to hear...\" Jess said, looking shy, but seductive towards Marissa. Marissa looked nervous, avoiding eye contact, but Jess could see Marissa's flushed face even while she pointed it towards her feet. She began to open her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All of this is so much to take in, I mean, I really want to just... eat whatever I want.... I want to be free to enjoy it. See, a little confession, I work at fast food places for a bit of a different reason... I'm a lot like you, I like pigging out on greasy food, but having very little money, I have to stay at least a little skinny, you know? So while I occasionally pigged out, I got my real fix from fattening customers and co-workers up, watching people grow and grow. I've always been quiet about this, I didn't think I'd actually find someone like you... you're kind of perfect.... basically, what I'm saying is, um.. well you see-\" Jess began to kiss Marissa, and Marissa completely returned the favour. The two began to undress each other, grabbing each others thick bodies. Jess stood naked in front of Marissa, belly hanging, fat boobs still somehow perky despite their large size. Jess walked over to the kitchen, pulled out a cake she had out, and motioned Marissa to come closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm feeling hungry, what about you? Want to keep eating?\" Jess said, rubbing her clit. Marissa walked over, her perky breasts bouncing as she walked. Marissa immediately grabbed a handful of cake and began eating it seductively, while Jess did the same.The cake was soon finished, and Jess grabbed more snacks. The two began making out while stuffing themselves and each other. Jess began to eat out Marissa, who began forcing as much food into her belly as she came loudly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was by far the hottest sex I've ever had,\" Jess said rubbing her distended gut.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jess and Marissa had really found a strong passion for their new hobby. Days upon days of non-stop eating and sex soon became weeks upon weeks, and both women got lost in their sexual bliss and gluttony that it almost seemed like a dream. It's been three months since the two drove off together, and the world hasn't seen very much of them. They rarely left the home, Jess managed to run her share of the business from home, especially since her team knew better on the boring part, she just wanted the money and food! Marissa and Jess were thankful for their maids and their chef, and were very happy to be given the chance to live complete and utter gluttony on a day to day basis. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething that helped keep the staff at the mansion motivated besides their large checks, was that Gwen, Lisa and Olivia were actually also feeders themselves. So, when the home was taken care of, all three enjoyed keeping the girls well fed and pleased.  The sex mostly stayed between Jess and Marissa, the staff were often busy just getting food and cleaning dishes, but the odd time a threesome has happened. One of Jess's requirements was that they were supposed to stay in shape, and while eating the food and putting on weight was okay, they needed to stay mobile enough to work. All three girls were average weights, Gwen was a little plumper, but still in good enough shape for her job. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaturally, three months of living the gluttonous lifestyle like this changes those involved. Let's start off with Marissa, who was currently laying on the couch (in only sweat shorts and a bra), halfway through eating a whole two tier cake with gusto, watching TV. Marissa had gained a very visible amount of weight, gaining a good amount all over her body. Her thighs had expanded and were full of fat, stretching the limits on her stretchy shorts, making her take up more of the couch than she ever had before. Her fat belly rested onto her shorts, and jiggled as she moved, devouring more and more of the cake. Her boobs had grown a good amount, straining her bra which was stained with grease anyways. She had a double chin showing up, and her arms jiggled quite a lot without much encouragement needed, not stretching any of her sleeve. Marissa had gained an astonishing 75 pounds in 3 months, devouring whatever she could. She now weighed 196 pounds. Marissa has become amazingly greedy, and tries anything she wants and this goes beyond her hunger for food. She was drinking often, smoking weed, and she even got new tattoos on her legs, which say \"thiqq\" and \"juicy\". Marissa had really began to give in to the freedom, fucking and feeding Jess and any other partners she brings, enjoying her new and open world, where she has given into the idea of gorging for pleasure, but as time had gone on, Marissa realized what she likes the most, fattening up Jess. All of her focus was on Jess, while she loved to stuff herself, she always made sure Jess had food. Jess ate far more than Marissa, which is a truly impressive feat for Jess. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Marissa took her last bite of the cake, she sat back, grabbing milk to quench her thirst, she chugs back the whole carton, sits back, and expels a humongous belch \"*BRRRAAAPP.*.. holy fuck, that *burp* was fucking delicious Gwen, you're amazing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very kind of you to say so, Mar,'' Gwen said, picking up the dishes, \"Anything else I can get you sweetie?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd love myself some doughnuts if you've got any? *uurrp* And more whole milk! Oh, also can you find me Jess?\" Marissa asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course! I'll go bring her here, I'm pretty sure she was napping off the pies she ate, I'm sure she's up by now though.\" Gwen responded, walking to the kitchen with the dishes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarissa watched TV as she waited for her lover to arrive. Recently, Jess confessed her emotional feels towards Marissa, who felt the same way. Marissa fully moved in with Jess, and they really loved being with each other. As Marissa watches the TV, she hears heavy footsteps approaching. Marissa turns her head to see Jess standing in the doorway, clearly winded from the walk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJess was enormous, an absolute blimp. 6 months of being stuffed to the limit every possible moment was very effective on increasing her girth. She had gained an astonishing 110 pounds in only three months. Jess was now 425 pounds, and feeling her weight increase every day. She currently was wearing tight black pants, which were splitting open on the sides a little, and t-shirt that was way too small, showing her large double belly. Her breasts pushing on her shirt, and her double chin even bigger than before, jiggling much more often. Her arms are very thick and wobbly, and some new small tattoos on them. Jess was large, and she loved it. She was so in love with Marissa, she was willing to eat herself immobile if that's what she wanted. Jess loved her new figure, and she wanted to have more of it. This is her now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi baby... *huff* how are .. *huff*.. you doing?\" Jess asked, breathing heavily as she moved to the couch to sit next to Marissa. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Better now that you\u2019re here, you hungry? I got food coming soon.\" Marissa asks seductively, grabbing Jess's fat belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, feed me baby, I'll eat anything you want me to, I'm all yours...\" Jess responded, leaning in to kiss her thinner lover. Gwen walks in with the requested food and sees the two making out and fingering each other. Gwen puts the food down and begins to walk away...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>While Jess and Marissa lived very closed lives Nicole and Jen tried their best to go outside, although, admittedly, it was usually to grab a bite to eat or to grab new clothes to replace the ones the had now outgrown. Living \"public lives\" didn't mean eating or indulging any less, in fact for Jen, being public was part of the appeal. Jen realized that she enjoyed over eating on a more sexual level than she ever could've imagined, but as she tried new things she realized there was so much more she could be enjoying, and one of those things was pigging out in public, a lot. She enjoyed the feeling of judgement from others, looks of disgust and disappointment. They made Jen so wet she was almost always touching herself under the table, or at least when she wasn't busy cramming food down into her ever expanding gut. And so, while Jen was almost always preoccupied with either of those two things, it often left Nicole in silence when she ate with her friend. Nicole found though, the best way to deal with that silence was by eating, or drinking, or just consuming anything she could really. Nicole really just enjoyed the idea of having whatever she wanted. Nicole loved going into stores and buying whatever she fancied, such as clothes, cars, furniture, technology, jewelry, art, and anything else you could think of. Nicole bought companies just so she could feel a sense of power, and she loved hearing her net worth was increasing. Nicole had a greedy habit of drinking excessive amounts of wine, beer and other liquor often, essentially always being drunk, while smoking weed and cigars often as well. Nicole also still feasted on food on her own quite often of course, resulting in her usually being incoherent and sloppy in conversation, from being drunk as well as stuffed to the brim. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAllison also enjoyed spending her time with Nicole and Jen, but Allisons lack of mobility has now kept her bedridden at her home. The girls would often visit her for meals, and catch up on business. With the past three months being anything but relaxed on her stomach she moved her weight up to an earth shattering 723 pounds. Allison now worked from home, eating more than she ever has (if you can believe it) but she was much more business oriented than Jess. Allison was the poster child for the obese future that was on the way. Harrow Inc. specialized in making products to make that future easier, and Allison was usually the demonstrator. She had become a celebrity, and was doing it all from her home. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCurrently both women were at one of their own all you can eat buffets, seated in a booth across from one another along a wall. The table has a couple tall stacks of plates and a few empty glasses, with only a few food items actually left on the table. Nicole was forcing a large bite of lava cake into her mouth, moaning as she did, it oozed down her down double chin and she simply grabbed a glass of her milk and began chugging while the liquid poured down all over her already messy and stained t shirt. Her fat frame jiggled as she moved her arm back and forth the stuff the remainder of the dessert into her very full belly. Almost 2 years since winning the lottery and Nicole was now passed the 300 pound mark (317 to be specific) and she didn't appear to mind very much, if at all. Our once slim and sexy young teacher was now an obese greedy glutton, giving in to any pleasure she could imagine. Nicole was cramming herself into the booths, with her bare belly pressing against the table and her face covered in her dinner/dessert. Nicole was wearing a sweat suit, one that was officially in need of replacing. The sweater fully unzipped, showing her large gut and her stained shirt that acted as a bra more than anything else. Her large tits covered in chocolate and other ingredients jiggled as she moved, while her round face just moaned in pleasure from her near sexual encounter with the dessert. Nicole burped as she finished the rest of her milk and snacks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Buurrrrpp!!! Oh my... UUrraappP!!.. goodness.. *huff huff*, tha-URRpp!.. that was.. *belch*.. *huff*.. that was amazing... I need some scotch.... *burp*... oh, um, waiter! I'll take a bottle of your finest scotch, *bruuahp* please!\" Nicole said, leaning back and looking stuffed to the brim. \"How's it goin, sweetie?\" Nicole asked across the table towards Jen, who was only a bite away from finishing her burger and inhaled it before answering her friend. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuckin greaaat, I love this place Nic, it's like heaven for me.\" Jen answered, before grabbing two more burgers and stuffing them into her chubby cheeks. \"I just can't get enough of it, I just need more burgers, and more pizza, and more and more and moooore!!!\" Jen exclaimed before eating with much gusto, causing her body to jiggle. Since Jens move into plus size modeling and lifestyle, she has created an entire wave of gluttony in the world. Jen weighs 304 pounds, extremely excited about the big 300. Jen is an internet celebrity, and has millions of followers watching her every move and meal. She encourages women everywhere to eat as much as they can, give in to desire and be happy. Her message is everywhere, and her fan club is turning the average weight in the world higher and higher. Jen herself has been eating at every opportunity, promoting Thiqq Burger and all her food companies, while also doing vlogs and photoshoots. Jen was working her way up to being the biggest star in the world. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Nicole awoke to the sound of her 11am alarm. She began rolling her 320 pound body out of her bed, showing signs of struggle in her face. She had become quite a different woman in the past few months, becoming lazier, greedier, fatter, less ambitious, and had almost lost all of her drive. She missed a lot of business meetings, only communicated with her charities through emails and occasional short conference calls. Nicole's gluttony and greed had transformed her into an uninspired endless pit, looking to fill her void with money or food. As Nicole walked around her bedroom, she grabbed a chocolate bar sitting in a bowl full of candy on her end table. Nicole's house had snacks all over it, constantly being refilled by her staff. She grabbed a couple other candy bars and sweets and walked to her dining room for her breakfast, eating her candy on the way. Nicole salivated as she began to smell her delicious breakfast getting closer and closer to her. I can\u2019t wait to eat all of this food\u2026 mmm I\u2019m starved. Nicole thought getting to the table and taking a seat. For the next hour Nicole consumes what she\u2019d consider is an \u201caverage breakfast\u201d, stuffing back waffles, piles of sausage, bacon, eggs and french toast. Nicole consumes huge amounts of maple syrup, plus all of her doughnuts and danishes. She\u2019d normally eat everything they give her, requesting what she\u2019ll eat while she watches some TV in 20 minutes. However, today was different. She didn\u2019t have time to watch TV and do nothing but eat today, she actually had to go to a meeting. All of the lottery winners were meeting up as Jess had asked everyone to meet, which was a little strange in Nicole's eyes. Nicole went to shower, put on her stunning outfit, feeling smart and sexy. Nicole got in her town car and had her driver drop her off at Harrow Inc. Headquarters. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt headquarters, Nicole got out of her car and walked inside. She walked up to the front desk and spotted a familiar face. The secretary that Nicole had seen ages ago, when she was still \u201cthin\u201d. Nicole would barely have recognized her had it not have been for her bright blonde hair and very pretty face. This secretary, like so many others, had put on a substantial amount of weight. Before she was a skinny girl with small fat spots, but now she was definitely fat. Around the 230 pound range, she was testing the limits on her jacket, as the seams were becoming visible as they stretched open. The secretary had ketchup on her upper lip, and was rubbing her very bloated gut through her tight dress shirt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHi, there. My name is Nicole, I\u2019m here to see Allison.\u201d Nicole said with a smile. The secretary looked up at Nicole and burped quietly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMmm yeah I\u2019ll give her a call, one moment. \u201d The secretary lifted the phone and called the office. \u201cHi there, I\u2019ve got a uh\u2026 Nicole here, for Allison? Mhm, yep will do. Ok bye.\u201d The secretary hung up the phone and looked at Nicole again. \u201cThey\u2019re sending security over now to escort you there. Just wait here please.\u201d Nicole smiled, looking around the secretary's desk. She noticed Thiqq Burger wrappers popping out of a drawer. Looks like she hides her overflow in there. She thought, spotting the secretary as she tries to secretly take a large bite from a triple stacked burger. Hehe it\u2019s always nice to see everyone else struggle like me, at least I\u2019m not the only one who\u2019s addicted. Eventually, security showed up and walked her to the elevator, which would take her to the top floors, otherwise known as the head offices. Nicole was out of breath and panting by the time she made it to the elevator (probably the Thiqq Burger stop she made on the way) feeling aware of her bloated body. Holy shit\u2026 she thought to herself, I can\u2019t believe I\u2019ve let myself get this fat\u2026 I know it\u2019s technically healthy now but still, this is a lot of weight to move around\u2026 Nicole walked inside of the massive elevator and waited as it lifted her all the way up. Once at the top floor, she entered the massive space that was only open to the big wigs. The whole upstairs had a pool, hot tub and spa, with it\u2019s own private buffet, plenty of entertainment, as well as tons of new tech ready to be messed around with. As Nicole walked in she spotted all of her friends sitting and waiting for her. They were all eating from the assortment of food on the table in front of them, surrounded by a few other board members and investors. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey guys, I\u2019m sorry I\u2019m late, I got caught up in traffic.\u201d Nicole lied, walking towards the open chair left for her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNic! Not an issue, it\u2019s good to see you! I can get started once everyone is comfy.\u201d Nicole sat down, and Jess began to stand up, hoisting her obese body out her chair. At 430 pounds, Jess was quite a blimp, even in a room with only fat people. Her thick arms jiggled as she moved them, her massive tits bouncing like crazy over her fat and large double belly. Jess drank from her beer before starting to speak to the group. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay guys, I appreciate everyone coming, I know business is boring but this is really important.\u201d Jess started, holding her large gut with both hands. \u201cAs you know, recently I\u2019ve been enjoying my time with Marissa, who has shown me the happiest time of my life. That said, I\u2019ve been neglecting my role in this company. I want us to succeed, and I want us to keep becoming bigger as a company, but to be honest I don\u2019t love being in the public eye since we became national celebrities. Which is why I would like to drop out from the board and hire a real pro in my position. I\u2019d like to take a step back, as I just bought a massive Villa in Italy which Marissa and I will be moving to shortly.\u201d The room fell silent. Italy? What the hell? Nicole thought to herself, before Allison started to talk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow, Jess that\u2019s really great\u2026 I\u2019m happy for you guys, are you really just gonna leave though? Just like that?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo no don\u2019t worry! I\u2019m keeping my house here, I just want some new sights. I wanna live with Marissa in a new place, I\u2019m even thinking of proposing to her out there\u2026\u201d Jess responded, excited. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCongrats Jess! That\u2019s so amazing! You better come visit all of us though!\u201d Nicole said, happy for her friend. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course we\u2019ll be back. We\u2019ll probably be there a little while, but it\u2019s just to get some space from everything here. Allison, is it alright if I step back though?\u201d Allison began to talk, holding a massive burger in her fat hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you\u2019re sure, then it\u2019s no issue. You\u2019ll keep all your shares as owner, just give up power to the board. I think it\u2019d be okay.\u201d Allison said, looking at her legal team who nodded in response. The girls all celebrated with a large lunch, while Jess filled them in on the house and their plans. As they all began to leave, they all said their goodbyes, realizing they wouldn\u2019t see Jess for a few months. Nicole went up to Jess and hugged her old friend, crying about seeing her leave. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou better keep in touch with me\u2026 and invite me to the wedding!\u201d Nicole said, weeping slightly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay Nic, I\u2019ll see you guys soon I know of it! And you should definitely visit too! The house looks gorgeous, I can\u2019t wait. I love ya, Nic.\u201d Jess said, holding her friend while crying. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLove ya more, Jess.\u201d </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jess was sitting down on her couch watching TV as Marissa came into the room. Marissa was past 200 pounds now, and she had no desire to slow down. Jess was her real desire, feeding and fattening her partner was her main priority. In fact, the idea to move to Italy was Marissa\u2019s idea. She told Jess they should go on a vacation there, and Jess took that as \u201cbuy a mansion there and move there for an unknown amount of time.\u201d Still, both women are excited to go and see the sights, as well as get out of the public eye. Marissa walked over to Jess fully clothed and began to talk with Jess. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey babe, what do you think about going out for our last lunch in the country?\u201d Jess did like the idea of eating out one more time before the move. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know what, that could be fun. How about where we met?\u201d Jess said, eyeing up Marissa. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAww yeah that\u2019s so cute!\u201d Marissa shouted excited while Jess got up to get changed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the restaurant, they both walked inside and Jess saw how much the restaurants had changed since she first bought the chain. Now they were built for the morbildly obese, having high tech feature in the booths to make it easier for the patrons to eat comfortably. As Marissa walked up to the counter she began to order for herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHi there, I\u2019ll take a number 3, um..  a number 4, three number 6 combos please, an extra large poutine with extra curds and all the fixins\u2019, and throw in a milkshake too please!\u201d Marissa rubbed her belly, excited for her large meal, that was until she heard a familiar voice.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s quite the order there, never would\u2019ve thought you\u2019d eat that much.\u201d Marissa looked up and saw that behind the counter was none other than her old manager, Karen, who was still working there. Since their last visit, it seems that Karen has been under even more stress trying to manage such an out of control burger joint. Karen's favourite way to relieve that stress was from snacking, and snacking HARD. Karen would munch on Thiqq Burger all day, from morning until night when she left. Her once thin physique was now popping out of her largest uniform yet, surly waiting on the next size up. Her face was chubbier, her gut was bigger, her boobs were larger and tight on her shirt, exposing a great deal of cleavage. Karen was a 200 pound fat mess, and was currently holding a half eaten burger. Her double chin was accented as she smiled at her old employee, who had gained enough to match weights with Karen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKaren\u2026 what a pleasant surprise\u2026 haha how\u2019s it going?\u201d Marissa began to sweat nervously, she really hated confrontation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s going great Mar, really splendid. This job really makes me stressed, but I\u2019ve uh, learned to cope. Looks like you have too, huh? Enjoying the food even without working here hahaha\u201d Karen said, taking a bite from her burger while devilishly smiling at Marissa. Jess was feeling uncomfortable for Marissa, and also very hungry, so she finally decided to interject. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExcuse me is there a problem? Cause I\u2019d like my food, Ma\u2019am.\u201d Jess said, leaning her large bulk against the counter, holding her gold status card. Immediately Karen stopped smiling, realizing who Jess is. She quickly moves to the cash register.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy apologies, uh ma\u2019am, please, go sit down and I\u2019ll have my staff give you the works. We can get everything for you while you sit comfortably.\u201d Karen said nervously, gesturing towards a booth. The women went to the booth, where moments later food begins to arrive. Workers bring milkshakes of every flavour, an assortment of soda\u2019s, a tray full of fries to share, and dozens of burgers, nuggets, strips and sliders went into both of the girls bellies. Quickly Jess had undone her pants, after cramming down 3 double chicken burgers. Marissa had stretchy pants on, but they were pinching hard, looking close to tearing on her fat legs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c*Burrrpp*! Oh my yes! This is quite a send off feast!! *BRAhhhpp!* Don\u2019t you think, babe!?\u201d Jess said before guzzling a bowl of gravy into her mouth, spilling it on to her large jiggly breasts. Marissa could only moan and nodded her head, as she had her mouth full of a triple deluxe burger. As both women continued to eat themselves to the brink of exploding, Karen watched from the kitchen, stuffing her 8th burger into her mouth, terrified that she\u2019d be reprimanded for her behavior. God I hope they don\u2019t stay mad\u2026 shit I\u2019m so screwed if I get fired\u2026 fuck, I need another burger\u2026 maybe some desert too. Karen went to the grill and continued to eat away her anxiety, hoping she\u2019d get away with it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter their meal, the ladies left, stuffed to their gills. They took their town car home and were greeted by the staff. Having their belongings packed, Gwen, Lisa, Olivia, Marissa and Jess left in the car to the airport. Once at the airport, they got clearance to the company hanger, where they saw the Harrow Inc. private jet. It was a prototype that they designed for the travel of obese people, hoping to roll it out on the new Harrow Inc. Airline company Allison was working on. On the plane had rooms for all the passengers. It was fully stocked with enough food to last all the women on board a week of eating. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is the life, Babe.\u201d Jess said, cheersing her wine glass with Marissa, who nodded and clinked glasses together. \u201cHere\u2019s to the future, whatever it may hold.\u201d </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A couple weeks have passed since Jess and Marissa packed up and moved to Italy and Nicole was missing her friend. Not that Jen wasn\u2019t great, but Nicole and Jess just got each other. Even if the last few months of their friendship were spent apart being gluttonous hogs with other people, they would always know what was going on in each others lives. Now Nicole only had her through the internet, which Jess didn\u2019t frequent as much since she was enjoying her new home and the lovely new sights. All of this made for Nicole to try and spend as much time with Allison and Jen as Possible. Allison was pretty busy though, as she was getting more and more involved in the business, especially since Jess had left. Recently, Allison had been getting more and more hands on with the company, which made Nicole feel bad about, especially since she didn\u2019t care about the business as much as her charities, which no one else really seemed interested in. All of this left Nicole feeling weird around Allison, since she was either eating or working. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of this led to Nicole wanting to spend more time with Jen, which Jen was thrilled about. Recently Harrow Inc. bought a huge professional baseball team, which Nicole and Jen had been taking full advantage of their services and created a utopian Baseball stadium. Every concession was all of their food, and still served at a low price, causing long lines and large seats. The stadium was equipped with everything Allison thought was ideal for the new obese future they were creating. Currently, Nicole and Jen are at their own teams game, they\u2019re sitting in their massive private box, which has a loaded kitchen, a bar, games and some rich friends and co owners. Jen and Nicole are seated right at the window, seated and bloated, rubbing their full bellies while ordering their third helpings. Jen and Nicole were very close in weight, as both were around 330 pounds. The ladies looked absolutely gorged and drunk, drinking right from the bottles of their expensive wine. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c*Braaahpp!* oh my *hic* I can\u2019t believe how hot *hic* all of these baseball players *hic* are!\u201d Nicole said after taking a large swig from her wine, sloshing her belly with her other hand. Nicole's appetite was only increasing more since she let loose and began to enjoy food again, resulting in her weight climbing higher and higher after every fattening and full meal. The third large tray that Nicole ordered had just shown up, being placed on her table in front of her. The tray was loaded with multiple burgers, an entire roast chicken, french fries with gravy and tons of cheese, as well as mozz sticks and onion rings. Nicole squealed as she reached for two burgers and bit into them at the same time, squeezing them into her mouth so she could eat as much as possible. Jen was in a similar position as Nicole, as she was bursting out of her outfit as she grabbed her third order of food, which was pasta, ribs, mashed potatoes, perogies and a huge steak. She picked up her steak but before digging in, she asked for a request from her servant first. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll tell you know I\u2019ll want another plate of this exact order, so you might as well get it friggin\u2019 ready now! Here we go!\u201d Jen quickly pushed the steak into mouth, taking a large bite before taking another. Her large body jiggling at every movement. \u201cNic, *burp* I\u2019m so happy we\u2019re doing this *munch* mmmmm\u2026. This food is too good\u2026I\u2019m gonna need more soon\u2026 *BURRRPP!* God yes that was great, I feel much better with that room open, mmm potatoes!\u201d Jen began digging into her mashed potatoes, eating a pile that looked as though it weighed at least a pound. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs both girls continue to gorge themselves, a thin woman approached them. She very thin, showing very little curves on her frame. She has medium length black hair that was shiny and silky, but flat and bold. She had thick frame glasses and was carrying a tablet. She was smaller than the average person, but one look would tell you she\u2019s not one to mess with. As she walked up to the ladies she was standing next to Jen before announcing her attendance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello, Jen. It\u2019s good to see you, how are you doing?\u201d The woman said with a smile, before going cold again and taking a seat. Jen swallowed her food and smiled at the woman before speaking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJulie! What a surprise, what are you doing here?\u201d Jen said surprised, before turning to Nicole and quickly remembering that Nicole doesn\u2019t know her. \u201cOh sorry Nic, this is my agent, Julie Broadheart! She\u2019s fantastic, though it\u2019s not often I get surprise visits from her.\u201d Jen said curiously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell Jen, normally I would just call but I was in town and I thought I\u2019d bring the good news I\u2019m about to share with you in person.\u201d Julie said with a smile before continuing. \u201cI was looking hard for new work, and you were real close to some stellar TV gigs, but they all fell flat. Luckily, I know a director who happens to be pre-pro on a big new hollywood flick, and he just told me he wants to cast you as the big lead! He said the movie would have to be a smash hit with someone of your fame and skill on it! Isn\u2019t that amazing?\u201d Julie said with excitement. \u201cYou\u2019re gonna be a huge star! It\u2019s happening girl!\u201d Jen sat there, shocked about her news. She began to cheer while looking around the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes! It\u2019s happening! I\u2019m gonna be a movie star! And soon enough I\u2019ll have TV shows and video game contracts, I\u2019ll be the biggest star in Hollywood! Oh my thank you so much! When does it start?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell it\u2019s pretty soon, he wants you there in 2 weeks I\u2019m afraid. But if it\u2019s any consolation he\u2019s sending a co-star to come and hang out with you here for an evening and travel down to LA with. I\u2019ll send you the rest of the details via email, but here\u2019s your big shot Jen, I\u2019m so proud.\u201d Julie smiled and began to walk away, leaving Jen and Nicole both shocked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo wait, you\u2019re leaving too??\u201d Nicole said, sad by the news. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAw Nic, I know I\u2019m sorry, I\u2019ve been waiting for this for a year now though, it\u2019s finally happening I have to go. Come with me! It\u2019ll be so fun!\u201d Jen said, trying to convince her friend. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell it\u2019s a thought, but I\u2019m not sure if I like that kind of place. I\u2019m really happy for you, just bummed I\u2019m gonna miss another one of my friends.\u201d Nicole said, holding her friends\u2019 hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, we\u2019re here now, let\u2019s make it count! I plan to eat enough to get my fill of you over these two weeks, so let's friggin' eat girl!\u201d Jen said, holding up a chicken leg and taking a bite from it, Nicole grabbing a burger and doing the same. \u201cWe\u2019re gonna need the next tray, pronto!\u201d Jen said, inhaling her food while Nicole does the same. They continued this for the rest of the evening, tray after tray of fattening greasy and savoury foods, bottle after bottle of wine. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Over the next two weeks Jen and Nicole spent almost all their time together, enjoying various yacht parties, sporting events, concerts and of course all of the food that came with them. Jen had her people looking after all of her living arrangements and contracts, she just wanted to have fun before she was off to L.A. Jen is getting set to leave tomorrow night making Nicole sad because she was losing another friend. Currently the ladies are on Jens private boat sitting by the pool, soaking in the sun while sipping on mixed drinks and platters of food. Jen was currently eating her third bucket of fried chicken, her double chins shaking as she slurps the greasy meal with force. She is currently in a bathing suit that isn\u2019t hiding very much of her body, especially since it\u2019s so close to bursting right off her fat body. At 350 pounds Jen was quickly realizing the scale of her own size. She was struggling to move more and more, incredibly even managing to eat more than she was before. All of this led to the obese Jen we see today, whose breasts were hanging over her colossal belly, which was resting heavily on her large legs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole had also been eating more than usual over the past two weeks, but nothing close to Jen. Nicole figured it was likely Jen was eating to keep her from thinking about leaving her friends, or that there\u2019s a solid chance they\u2019ll make her eat less in LA, meaning she wants to enjoy her final gorging days, at least until she\u2019s out of hollywood. Nicole officially weighed less than Jen, tipping the scales at 342 pounds, slightly but still just a bit smaller than Jen. Nicole thought it was strange to officially be the thinnest member of the group, she never would\u2019ve seen Jen or Jess growing into the blobs they are now. Nicole was still an incredibly fat woman though, and still ate more food than once thought possible. Currently, Nicole looked to be eating a large meat lovers pizza, with a platter of pasta and a cake next to that. She was eating a more relaxed pace than Jen, but also drinking more heavily. Currently she is drinking straight from a bottle of whisky. Her own double chin getting the beverage all over it. Her belly was also large, and her breasts heavy and weighing down on her own gut which had the pizza resting on it. As both women are indulging in the sun, Jens phone buzzes, causing her to check her text. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMmm Nicole, guess what!\u201d Jen said while looking at her phone. \u201cThat house I was looking at, the real big one in LA? Well it\u2019s confirmed, I just bought it!\u201d Jen quickly grabbed more chicken to celebrate and lifted them into the air slightly, before chowing down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s great Jen! I\u2019m so happy for you! What exactly is this place like again?\u201d Nicole asked before taking another swig from her bottle and grabbing her joint to spark it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, it\u2019s a gorgeous modern home in the hollywood hills, it has a 30 car garage, an indoor and outdoor pool, a massive 20 person hot tub, as well as a spa, two kitchens, 7 bedrooms, 5 very large bathrooms, and so many other different rooms for activities. I love the home, and I\u2019ll have the company fix things for my weight once I\u2019m there.\u201d Jen said before picking up a double stuffed hotdog and forced it into her mouth. \u201cOh my goodness this stuff never gets old.\u201d Jen said practically moaning from the pleasure of her food. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow Jen that\u2019s amazing, seems like it will be very fun to be there. I\u2019ll have to visit you once you know your schedule!\u201d Nicole added, finishing her pizza. \u201cMmm that one was exceptional great\u2026 *burp!*\u201d As Nicole picked up her pasta and started to chow down, Jen finished her bucket of chicken and picked up a platter of 6 more hot dogs, which she started inhaling into her fat face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI also\u2026 mmmm *munch munch* found out I\u2019m meeting my *munch munch* co star for *belch* lunch tomorrow, which I\u2019m just hoping *chew*  she\u2019s not a bitch or anything.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sure she\u2019ll be fine Jen, she\u2019ll love you!\u201d The day continued like this, as Nicole and Jen spent some of their final meals together, since Jen was going to be with her co star all day. Jen would say goodbye to Nicole before she left though. As Jen went to bed full and gorged, she was excited and nervous for whatever was coming with her future in hollywood. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJen woke up around 10, eating a full and hearty breakfast while she got her fat figure ready for her meeting. She made it to the restaurant for around 12:30, roughly the same time as her co star was supposed to arrive. Jen was waiting to order food until her guest arrived, which made her stomach growl. Jen was so used to always having food going into her belly that when she wasn't eating something it just didn\u2019t feel right. Just as Jen could swear her stomach growls were getting more powerful her guest walked into the private dining room. Jen couldn\u2019t believe her eyes when she saw none other than Emma Stone standing in front of her, smiling as she walked closer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHi there! You must be Jen?\u201d Emma said, extending her arm to Jen who happily shook her hand back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh my goodness yes you\u2019re Emma Stone! I had no idea you were my co star!\u201d Jen said, still in shock about the gorgeous woman in the same room as her. \u201cIt\u2019s so nice to meet you!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHahaha well thank you, it\u2019s nice to meet you too, Jen!\u201d Emma said with a smile. \u201cSo I\u2019ve heard this is your restaurant, is that true?\u201d Emma said curiously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt is, well, it\u2019s a little bit more complicated than that, I\u2019ll explain after we order? How does that sound?\u201d Jen said, excited to order some food. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh that sounds great! I\u2019m cheating on my diet while I\u2019m here so let\u2019s order up! What do you recommend?\u201d Emma asked Jen, who quickly started to answer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell as you can probably tell by my figure, I have enjoyed a meal here once or twice.\u201d Jen said shaking her belly, laughing a little. \u201cI say we just order one of everything, you can try anything you want that way!\u201d Jen said to Emma.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay that sounds fun! God I haven\u2019t eaten like this in months, a real good pig out!\u201d Emma shouted happily as the waitstaff came to the table. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Both women ordered one of everything, Jen began to catch Emma up on her life and her new found love for food. Jen found Emma was incredibly receptive and happy to chat, saying how she\u2019d never had thiqq burger as celebs were on strict hollywood diets. As the food began to come out to the table Emmas\u2019 look on her face was amazing, she sniffed the air for all of the great smells in front of her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh my goodness\u2026. Mmm it smells so good\u2026.\u201d Emma said, looking excited to dig in. There was pastas, burgers, pizza, sausage, bacon, hotdogs and full roast chickens. Emma couldn\u2019t believe the amount of food that was in front of her. Emma quickly grabbed a burger and bit into it, leaning back in ecstasy. \u201cOh my goodness! This might be the greatest thing I\u2019ve ever eaten!\u201d Emma took another bite, and then another. She quickly began to take bites from everything, trying as much of the junk food as she could. Jen was also eating of course, trying to look under control, but she had just eaten 3 hot dogs in less than a minute so she wasn\u2019t very successful in her efforts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter about an hour of on again off again eating, Emma finally threw in the towel. Her small bloated belly had unbuttoned her pants and left her shirt riding up. She was drunk on food and also the whole bottle of wine she drank while cheating on her diet. Jen had managed to eat everything Emma didn\u2019t, holding back from ordering some more dessert (didn\u2019t want to look like too much of a pig after all). <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWoww\u2026 Jen that was *hic* just amazing!!!... *hic* Holy shit I\u2019m so\u2026 fullll\u2026 fuck I need to sleep this off *hic* just\u2026 for a few minutes\u2026. *hic*\u201d Emma said drunkenly, leaning back in her chair again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s go back to mine! We can take some naps.\u201d Jen said, getting the staff to assist them with leaving for home. Emma slept for a couple hours, waking up confused and full. They spent the rest of the evening slowly snacking before both women realized it was time to leave, so they packed and headed off to the airport. At the Harrow Hangar Nicole was there, waiting to say goodbye. Jen and Emma walked over to her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh my gosh, Emma stone?! Wow of course you\u2019re gonna see me cry on the first time I meet you.\u201d Nicole said, laughing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAww, I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019ll leave you two alone don\u2019t worry. See you on board, Jen.\u201d Emma said, walking onto the plane. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m really gonna miss you, Jen. Please call me often, and please please tell me when I can visit!\u201d I love you, Jen.\u201d Nicole hugged her friend tightly, who hugged her right back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLove you too Nic, don\u2019t worry, we\u2019re staying in touch. I won\u2019t let us drift apart!\u201d Jen said confidently. \u201cI gotta go. Goodbye, Nic.\u201d Jen said, walking towards the plane. Jen felt sad walking on board, but then she saw Emma standing there, holding a bottle of champagne. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI say we party once this bad boy takes off!\u201d Emma said, looking at a box of treats on the table. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis is going to be fun. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>While Nicole was becoming bored and depressed without all of her friends, she still had Allison left in town. Nicole was currently with Allison at the Harrow Inc. headquarters, they were both eating sweets, although Nicole was the one doing most of the eating now. Since Jess left and Allison was now the person in charge of the company, she began to enjoy making the decisions around the office, especially since they were making the company more successful than any of them had ever intended. However, before Jen left to LA she also gave up her seat on the board to Allison, now making her even more in control. Becoming the boss had left Allison more preoccupied with work than she was with food, allowing Nicole to pick up the slack and continue to cram food in her mouth to distract herself from her own loneliness. Allison was twice the weight of Nicole, who just tipped the scales at 350 this morning. At 750 pounds, she needed assistance with carrying her massive frame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAllison had been expanding Harrow Inc. into more than just a food empire, or even lifestyle company for the fat people they were creating. She was turning it into a dominating empire that seemed to expand as fast as its customers waistlines, and it was looking to be unstoppable. Harrow Inc. had expanded to nearly every major city in North America, Europe and South America, while it was just beginning to make its way through the rest of the world. Harrow now expanded to many different styles of restaurants, attempting to appeal and expand to as many demo graphics. Thanks to Allison and Jess\u2019 hungry bellies, the company successfully launched pizzerias, burger joints, pubs, coffee shops, steakhouses, all you can eat restaurants, southern style fried chicken restaurants and many other diverse foods from all across the world. Not only restaurants, but they also sold store bought versions of their food for people to get from grocery stores. Quickly, Harrow Inc. was a household name amongst half of the world for their delicious and addictive food, which led to the very apparent weight gain from it\u2019s customers. The average weight in the United States was quickly increasing to 220 pounds and only growing, which is why Allison is putting her efforts into designing the \u201cFat Friendly Future\u201d technology the world will need in a few years. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole had just finished an entire two tier chocolate cake, rubbing her fat gut and belching. In front of her lays an empty box of doughnuts, an extra large frappuccino and a few plates of other sweets that were once there. Nicole felt full, but she was bored at the headquarters. Allison was always on the phone, or reading some email or article. Nicole didn\u2019t like how much food she was putting away by herself, she felt out of control and unhinged. Maybe she needed a change too? Before she ended up even bigger than Allison. As Nicole sat there, regretting how much she just ate, she could already feel herself thinking about what meal she was going to eat once she sat for a few minutes. <i>Mmm some bacon would be great\u2026 Oh yeah just some savoury breakfast foods\u2026 jesus, what is wrong with me?</i> Nicole thought to herself grabbing her gut, <i>I really need to do something else with myself other than eat all the time, it\u2019s gotten out of hand. </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Nic, great news! I\u2019m reading an email that just confirmed that our private airline is gonna be public soon! Like we\u2019re going to have multiple big ol\u2019 jets with our name on it! How cool is that!?\u201d Allison said excitedly, sitting back in her chair briefly. \u201cPlus, I\u2019ve got us a deal that I think can get Harrow Inc. self driving cars on the market in 2 years or less!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSelf driving cars and an airline? Woah that\u2019s huge. There\u2019s so many big companies though\u2026 aren\u2019t you afraid of not being able to compete?\u201d Nicole asked, feeling out of her element now being an investor in the airplane and auto industry. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNormally, yes, however, we have a big devoted fan base of people who will fly with us for the food we give out on board, plus the seats and bigger than every other airline, so as their bodies grow they\u2019ll still be comfy on our planes. As for the cars, I can\u2019t drive anymore, but I would love a car that would take me where I need to go. That\u2019ll be an issue for our entire population soon enough, we have to prepare now.\u201d Allison rubbed her massive jiggly belly with one fat arm while reaching for her extra large frappe (her 4th of the day) and taking a large sip. \u201cMy goodness these things are so good\u2026 they\u2019re my latest addiction, would you like another one?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThey really are tasty, I could maybe go for another one soon...\u201d Nicole said, looking at her cup and thinking about it. Right away a waiter came and took it away, getting her a new one as fast as he could. \u201cGreat service, wow ha ha\u2026 thank you!\u201d Nicole said as the waiter returned with another extra large frappe. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnother business idea I\u2019m working on is for mobility homes. So I\u2019m buying another house here in town, but this one is equipped with all of the tech for people my size and bigger, meaning I\u2019ll be the first test of the products.\u201d Allison said, grabbing a super-sized chocolate bar from her desk drawer and tearing into it. \u201cI\u2019ve got this vlog now, where I show our fans our new stuff, and I\u2019m gonna do the same for the airline and the house! I never thought anyone would care about me enough to make vlogs, let alone the fact that I have millions of viewers\u2026 it\u2019s incredible.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAllison I\u2019m so happy for you, you\u2019re doing so well at this company, you have such a passion for it, I wish I had it too.\u201d Nicole said honestly, hoping Allison wouldn\u2019t be offended. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAweh, I understand Nic. Things feel different now with the girls gone. And I\u2019m sorry I\u2019m so caught up in this, I know you want to hang out there\u2019s just so much\u2026 work to do, you must know the feeling from the charities after all.\u201d Nicole did understand, she knew she had to look for a new passion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks Allison, I really appreciate hearing that. I need to find a new hobby besides eating myself immobile he he he. Which is why I was thinking you should take my spot on the board as well, so I can do my own thing and you can fully run the company. Is that okay?\u201d Nicole asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh my, of course, I\u2019d be honoured! Thank you Nic, and don\u2019t worry, the company is in good hands, I\u2019m going to make us all as rich as possible.\u201d  Allison assured her friend. Nicole and her hugged, and then discussed what was next for Nicole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHonestly, I don\u2019t know. I think to start I should go back to the school, maybe some work will get me back into the swing of things. Maybe I could just teach again.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh c\u2019mon now Nic, you could make a real difference! Become the dept of education leader or whatever! We\u2019ve got every contact we could ever want at our disposal, use it!\u201d Allison said. <i>Hmm\u2026 maybe she\u2019s right</i>, Nicole thought, <i>I should see the school first though, make sure they\u2019re doing okay. I\u2019m sure they\u2019d love a lunch date. </i></span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As her black town car pulled up to Hill-Haven Elementary, Nicole began to undo her seatbelt and get her outfit in order. As she took another gulp from her frappe she grabbed her phone and checked the time. 12:35, she thought, they should be getting out classes in a few, so I\u2019m doing great for time. Nicole burped quietly, adjusting her borderline inappropriate cleavage. As the car came to a stop Nicole waited for her driver to open the door and help her large bulk out of the vehicle. After Nicole was out of the car, she thanked her driver and began to walk back into the school, excited for the food she was about to eat. As walked through the doors, she noticed how much nicer the building was than before she had left. New floors and better walls and colours all around the halls, she felt a little proud seeing what her charity did first hand. As Nicole continued to walk through the halls, she found her way at the entrance of Mrs. Dunns\u2019 office and entered to find none other than Sam Peele sitting at her desk, looking quite different from 6 months ago when she last visited the school. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole was fairly used to people being larger than the last time she saw them, thus Sams large frame didn\u2019t get any physical or facial shock from Nicole, even if it should have. The most obvious thing about Sams\u2019 gain was her breasts as they were even more enormous than before. They jigged with every move, and left very little to the imagination. They were pushing hard on her bra, giving her the appearance of a balloon very close to popping. Of course, while sitting her breasts had the luxury of resting on her ever growing belly that sat on her thick legs. Sams\u2019 double chin and fuller face was still very cute, especially when she smiled at Nicoles entrance. Sam had put on almost 60 pounds over 6 months, making her total weight 274 pounds, something she had begun to slowly come to terms with. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNicole! It\u2019s so good to see you! It\u2019s been forever!\u201d Sam said cheerfully, her fat breasts jiggling at her bubbliness. \u201cI\u2019ve been told you\u2019re joining us for lunch?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey there Sam, yeah I thought I\u2019d come and visit the ol\u2019 stomping\u2019 grounds, see what\u2019s going on.\u201d Nicole replied smiling, leaning her 356 pound frame on the counter. \u201cIs Mrs. Dunn joining us?\u201d Nicole asked, curious if Dunn was willing to leave her office when she had everything she needed right there. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh yes of course, she\u2019s very excited to see you. She\u2019s actually in the cafeteria now, I was just waiting for you. So let\u2019s head on over.\u201d Sam said, beginning to lift her large body out of her upsized chair. As Sam walked out of the office with Nicole, her jiggly body and tight clothes made for an almost hypnotising effect for Nicole. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo how\u2019s the food now?\u201d Nicole asked on their way down the hall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh man, it's even better, I wish it was bigger but it\u2019s just always getting tastier! As you can tell I\u2019m quite a fan.\u201d Sam giggled, shaking her large belly for emphasis. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh me too don\u2019t worry ha ha ha.\u201d Nicole said, shaking her own gut in response. \u201cI\u2019m getting closer and closer to 400 everyday\u2026 in a million years I never thought I\u2019d be this big.\u201d Both girls continued to talk as they got closer to the cafeteria. Upon entering it, Nicole noticed it was mostly empty, besides a few employees and staff. One of the staff members being none other than an even rounder version of Principal Dunn. Clearly still a complete glutton, Mrs. Dunn has managed to put on over 100 pounds since the last time Nicole visited, putting her at a total weight of 458. The once stern scary principal was now a round ball of fat, barely squeezing into her current suit jacket and dress shirt. Mrs. Dunns\u2019 neck was barely there anymore, as if the fat was making it disappear forever. Her fat rolls and fat breasts had widened so much, and her ass  now required two chairs to sit comfortably. Mrs. Dunn didn\u2019t have any food with her yet, she was just sitting at the table with two other familiar faces. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn Mrs. Dunns right was Ms. Maddison Harper who was also looking fatter. Maddison had a head start on most of the staff members in terms of gaining weight, due to her 200 pound frame before her lifestyle change. Maddison was the largest teacher at the school weighing in at an incredible 496 pounds. Her massive ass was taking up 2 chairs, close to needing 3 with how much currently overhangs. Her belly is large and gelatinous, resting her own large breasts on it. Maddison was drinking a large slurpee, rubbing her fat belly as she did. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn Mrs. Dunns left was Mrs. Singh, the once thin indian math teacher that had blown up to quite the balloon. She was close to Mrs. Dunns size, weighing 432 pounds. The teacher was wearing a tight dress shirt that was looking close to bursting off of her body and exposing her vast rolls to the world. Her double chin was large and her tits heavy and bouncy. Nicole felt pretty good only at 350, she was still somehow one of the lightest ones there. As Nicole walked up to the table her friends began to say hello all at once, excited to see each other after so long. After some much needed catching up, Nicole asked when they were getting their food. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh don\u2019t worry, it\u2019s on it\u2019s way any minute now\u2026\u201d Mrs. Dunn said, eyeing the buffet and waiting for the food to be delivered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s a big order, but luckily it\u2019s not lunch quite yet so we get food first. We plan it that way intentionally.\u201d Ms. Harper said chuckling. Just then a few servers came out with trolleys laid out with various foods all at once.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHi ladies! Hope you\u2019re hungry! There\u2019s plenty of everything to start this meal off, and we can always bring more.\u201d The server said happily. Plates began to move quickly, the women taking whatever they were craving that was within arms reach. Asking for the servers to fetch them something across the table, or to go back and make more of something that was already taken. Quickly the women began to devour their massive meal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGoodness me this *burp!* chicken is sooo good! More please!\u201d Mrs. Dunn said. She was eating a bucket of chicken and dumping loads of sauce on every bite, while chugging a milkshake back and eating curly fries in between her mouthfuls. Ms. Harper was halfway through an extra large meat lovers pizza, excited to put back her plate loaded with chicken tenders and assorted sauces. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSam *munch* can you\u2026 *burp* possibly pass me *burp* some of those doughnuts? Mama wants *belch* some sweets! BRAAHHPP!!\u201d Mrs. Singh was putting back bite after bite of her bacon poutine, drinking gravy from a bowl while also sipping on soda to cool her mouth down. Sam Peele was eating an entire chocolate cake first, drinking a milkshake to wash it down. Sam passed her the plate of doughnuts, snagging one first and stuffing down in between bites of her cake. Nicole usually would've watched them eat with disgust but not anymore, now Nicole was one of them. \u201cYou guys always had the right idea\u2026 *belch*\u201d She had put away 5 chili cheese dogs at this point, quickly going for a few burgers and fries. All the women gorged themselves, eating until each one\u2019s limit, popping buttons, bursting pants, staining clothes\u2026 you get the idea. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the incredible feast, all five of them were leaned back, stuffed to the brim. Few words were exchanged while the ladies simply tried to breathe after inhaling such large amounts of food. Eventually, Nicole opened up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo I have to\u2026 phew\u2026 say, that this place\u2026 looks incredible. You guys\u2026 are doing good things!\u201d Nicole gasped, finding her voice in the weight of her winded chest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMmm\u2026 thank you\u2026 Nicole *urp*. We\u2019ve been trying our best with all of your money\u2026  though now we\u2019re *urp* kind of stuck.\u201d Mrs. Dunn said. \u201cI\u2019ve been looking at\u2026 potentially expanding this school into a *burp* highschool as well, a full on academy. We\u2019ve got the grades to back it up.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm\u2026 you know what, I\u2019m gonna get you that. I\u2019ll make some calls. I need to start helping again, this is how I can start!\u201d Nicole said happily, while the teachers smiled faintly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a little while longer, the staff needed to get back to work, so Nicole began to leave the school, waddling her way down the halls with her stuffed belly. God dammit I\u2019m so fat, Nicole thought, I need to slow down\u2026 Just then she heard a familiar voice. </span></div></div>",

The once hot MILF was now a fat MILF, looking incredibly out of shape, especially with the bag of doughnuts in her hand. Her skirt and shirt were stretched, her large belly bouncing with every step, accented by her tight outfit choice. Her fat breasts bouncing as she walked up to Nicole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKim! Hey there, how\u2019s it going?\u201d Nicole said, happy to see her friend. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh it\u2019s so great! I\u2019m actually about to head out and grab some lunch, why don\u2019t you come with me we can catch up?\u201d Kimberly said with a pretty smile, reaching into her bag and pulling out a sugary snack and taking a large bite. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh my I don\u2019t know, I just ate my fill\u2026 I really shouldn\u2019t, but I said no last time\u2026 I should probably go, I don\u2019t have to eat that much after all. Nicole thought to herself before answering. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah I\u2019d love to. Where you thinking?\u201d Nicole responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow\u2019s Thiqq Burger sound?\u201d Kimberly asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSounds free.\u201d Nicole winked. \u201cLet\u2019s go!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls both arrived in their own vehicles, met up inside and took a seat in a booth. Nicole looked at Kims chubby arms, and the way her butt jiggles with every step. She seems either unaware, or she doesn\u2019t care anymore? I\u2019m so surprised she\u2019s like this\u2026 Nicole thought to herself. While picking out their orders, Kimberly explained why she was at the school so often now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve always been an active member of the PTA, but recently I\u2019ve thought that they needed new leadership, new direction. So I\u2019ve been working on it, I\u2019m hoping to announce it soon enough that I\u2019ll be running for the leader. Gretchen is gonna hate it\u2026 but screw Gretchen.\u201d Kimberly laughed. \u201cThis school is shaping up to be something special, and I want my kids to attend it as a highschool too, so that\u2019s my platform is to help with that step.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s really great to hear. I\u2019ll personally fund it if the government won\u2019t, you can tell the voters that.\u201d Nicole said, shocking Kimberly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh my thank you!\u201d She said cheerfully. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh it\u2019s no biggie, least I can do for a passionate parent and old friend.\u201d Nicole said with a smile. \u201cNow let\u2019s order?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, let\u2019s do it!\u201d Kim said, rubbing her belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly the girls milkshakes and burgers arrived, Nicole ordered two triple stacks, knowing she didn\u2019t need anymore. Kimberly ordered 4 triple stacks, an extra large curly fries and 10 chicken strips. Nicole was definitely surprised by Kim's appetite, shocked at the amount of food she was stuffing down her throat. After Nicole finished her burgers, she leaned back and exhaled feeling the pressure in her gut. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlready done? No way\u2026\u201d Kimberly said with a large burger in her hands. \u201cI figured you could eat more than that. Look at how much I\u2019ve got! You\u2019ve gotta have the chicken! Or poutine! How about another milkshake?\u201d Nicole didn\u2019t know what to say to her fat friend, incredibly stuffed but not wanting to be rude, she decided to eat another burger. Just one more. Nicole thought. After that she was pressured into a milkshake, and then curly fries, and after that chicken strips, and then the fish fillet, and item after item Kimberley stuffed down both of their throats, eventually leaving them both unable to move while looking like pigs in a pen. Wrappers, sauces, and grease were everywhere on the ladies, who both undid their shirts to let their bellies breathe. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy goodness\u2026 *hic*... I must say I\u2019m such a *hic* fuckin\u2019 pig.\u201d Kimberly said. \u201cAll of this food is *urp* so addicting *hic* I\u2019ve just been eating *hic* myself stupid everyday\u2026 *belch*.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTell me about it, I\u2019m huugee\u2026 I can\u2019t seem to stop, either.\u201d Nicole responded. Both girls stayed there and talked for an hour until they could move to their own cars and head home. <br>\r\n\u201cSee ya later! I\u2019m excited, my husband made dinner tonight and he\u2019s been getting so good lately. Plus I got a cake for dessert! Let\u2019s catch up soon!\u201d Kimberly said getting in her car. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy god\u2026 she\u2019s gonna be huge in no time just like the rest\u2026\u201d Nicole said out loud, getting in her car. At the house, Nicole thought over what she was going to do with herself. I need something new, I love the girls at the school, but I\u2019m not ready to be immobile yet\u2026 I want to be active and walking still. She thought to herself while snacking on doughnuts. I need a change of scenery\u2026 maybe I can start my work in some real politics\u2026 try and become the leader of education or something\u2026 I\u2019ve got the cash after all. Nicole thought about it, unsure of what to do. After eating her doughnuts, she grabbed a cake from her fridge and dug in with a fork while leaning her large gut on the counter. She called Allison and asked what she thought she should do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm\u2026 I like the idea of Washington for you, I think you should try it out. You\u2019re great at that stuff, but I\u2019m not sure about just trying education.\u201d Allison said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got enough money and support right now, you could try and become president. I mean look at your track record! And we\u2019ve got every important contact you\u2019ll need!\u201d Nicole was frightened of the idea of putting herself out there, but Allison did have a point. While Nicole chose to live a private life, they were very well known in the world. They were all the latest buzz, and they\u2019ve got great support with the public. Maybe it wasn't so crazy?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Nicole picked up her phone and called some friends of hers in Washington, she had her bags packed and booked a hotel until she found a place to live while there. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI can\u2019t believe I\u2019m going to really go, I\u2019m gonna really try and do something big. Something positive. Nicole thought as she walked out her door to the car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Here goes nothing.</i></span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Nicole threw in another wrapper into the garbage. This time, it hit the rim and bounced out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah damn it.\" Nicole said, sounding exhausted. She was sitting in her indoor pool, the radio was on, probably playing whatever new music was on the top 40 charts. Nicole had really gone all in since she won. She bought a new house, a gorgeous mansion in the hills, where she has a private chef and a driver. She has been living the good life, smoking pot all day, drinking as well, and eating almost non stop. Nicole initially wanted to teach again, but she failed to try and go back in the fall, so she stayed home for basically the entire year. Of course, you can imagine the impact on her figure from all this lounging. After a year of letting herself go, Nicole weighed rough 230 pounds. She had put on almost double her body weight in a year, which is incredible. Nicole had a much bigger ass and thighs, and her gut was hanging more and more everyday. Nicoles face was fat, with two chins no matter how she pointed her chin. Currently in her pool, her two piece isn't hiding ver much of anything. Her fat wet body floating at the side while stuffs another burger down her throat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole has enjoyed the life well though. She eats only the best food, or delivers herself whatever fast food she might be craving. As of recently, you could say Nicole had become unhinged. Her routine went something like this, roughly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole would wake up at 10am, which is when her breakfast is delivered to her in bed. She watches TV and eats a full breakfast. Today it was a pound of cooked bacon, waffles, omelettes, and plenty of sausages. After they take the dirty dishes, she gets up and heads to the living room, where doughnuts, cookies, muffins, and other snacks await Nicole. She watches more TV while inhaling pastries of all types, drinking plenty of milk and juice and smoking weed. By noon she cracks a beer or two, begins her lunch. Today, she ate tacos, and a full burrito, as well as a couple burgers, she also managed to force in some dessert afterwards, which was an entire lava cake, which ended all over her chubby face. Nicole sits there, looking at her damage. The table is a mess, and her gut is heaving up and down. She cracks another beer, stands up sluggishly and begins to light up another joint. She then lays off lunch, until she wakes up and opens a bottle of wine, and drink right from the bottle. She is drunk and high and ready to eat some more. Dinner is served, where Nicole begins to put down an entire chicken, an entire large pizza with plenty of meat and cheese, she ate a large poutine with everything in it, and put back an entire bottle of wine. Nicole goes to the living room, where pie or cake is delivered, and she eats until she sleeps. The staff help her to bed, and give her snacks for overnight, which she always eats. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole was completely lost in this routine. Her staff didn't care, they got paid well. She made enough money to live this way for 200 years. Nicole liked this lifestyle. She liked being a pig. Nicole had put on almost double her body weight in a year. Nicole liked growing and growing, eating all day and enjoying her wealth her way. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the win, the women stuck together for a bit, but they all had different ideas of how to spend their money.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAllison decided she wanted to travel, so she is traveling around, but she's also lost a bunch of weight. Allison wasn't on board with the food as much as Nicole was, and so Allison hasn't been around in a while. Nicole is a little worried of what Allison will say when she finally sees the damage Nicole has done. With that thought Nicole grabs a candy bar and begins stuffing it in her mouth as fast as possible. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen there was Jess, who divorced her husband before he claimed the money, he was a cheat anyways. Jess would drop in every now and then on Nicole, but Jess was alarmed at Nicoles weight gain. She only grew fatter and fatter every time she visited. But, Jess didn't exactly lose weight herself. She's been enjoying her own food and drink, and has a bit of a belly from it. Jess doesn't feel as bad when she sees Nicole, but Nicole barely leaves her house. Jess continues to give Nicole space for the time being.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJen though, Jen was on board with Nicole. At first, Jen saw it as letting loose a little, but between the food tasting so good and her body feeling sexier she continued to eat, and only increased her intake of food. Jen would visit Nicole regularly, until the last little while due to her own sheer laziness. Jen eventually surpassed Nicole in daily food consumption amazingly. Jen hasn't yet passed Nicoles weight yet, but she isn't far off. Jen was a bean pole before, now she has a huge gelatinous ass, a wobbly belly and she finally has regular sized boobs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJen is currently at her own house, surrounded by dozens of fast food bags. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Walter! More Pop please!\" Jen whined, Walter (her butler) came in the room and delivered the massive bottle, which she grabbed and chugged from. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"BUUUuuuRRRPPpp... oh excuse me, thank *blorp* you Walter, oops hehe\", Walter walks away confused but flattered by her kindness. Jen grabbed another extra loaded double hot dog and stuffed it in her mouth, moaning while she ate as much as possible. Amazingly she was running of food, but someone would surly either get more, or make her some more. Cause Jen needed to keep eating until she physically couldn't anymore. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll four women were enjoying themselves and their newfound money.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

Jess bought a penthouse in the city. She wasn't about the big house vibe in the hills. Mind you, her penthouse isn't small. It's the highest home in the city, she see the best parts of the city from the whole top 3 levels. Her home has tons of things, such as a lavish bar, an amazing kitchen, an indoor pool (as well as a rooftop outdoor pool), and many other rooms in her home. Jess lived in an amazing home that she enjoyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome things Jess enjoyed as well since winning it big, was the more \"pleasurable\" things in life, so to speak. Jess had come to realize how good masturbation or sex was, especially without her husband. Jess was hooking up more than ever. She had to admit, it made her feel very hot to know she had that kind of pull on men even in her mid 40s. Jess was also enjoying drinking more, and weed, as well as the amazing art of the culinary world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince seeing Nicole and Jen get so fat, Jess had mixed feeling about eating. While she liked it, she was very afraid of becoming those girls. Jess wanted to be hot and in shape, not fat and alone. While Jess was afraid of this, she wasn't really doing anything to help herself. Jess had put on some weight since winning, naturally as anyone would with essentially unlimited money. Jess would eat full breakfasts, solid lunches and full course dinners, while drinking casually and maybe smoking weed as well. The past year was filled with casual exercise, a few small seasonal diets here and there, but still lots of food and drink. This led Jess to look a little more corpulent than she normally does. As she sits at home on her couch watching TV, she was eating her fourth slice of her pizza. She had also eaten half a pound of wings already, which sat on the other side of the couch with her dirty napkins. Jess let out a solid wet belch, \"BUUrrrppppp.. excuse me hahaha\". Jess resumed eating the pizza. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJess was wearing some new sweats (which already had grease stains on them) and a white tank top, which was rolled up to support her little pudgy belly. Jess had put on maybe 30 pounds since the money, which sat noticeably in her belly area. Her butt had also increased in size, and her arms were also thicker. If not for the casual dieting and workouts, she might be more like Nicole and Jen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>If I keep eating like this, I'm going to be like them soon... I can't let that happen.</i> Jess thought to herself. <i>But the food is great.. maybe I should just workout? hmm...\" Jess wasn't sure what she wanted for herself.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

That's all hehe\" Jess giggle, knowing how much of a pig she sounded like. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Drive on through to the first window please.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe car moved forward, and the sounds of garbage moving about the vehicle began. Over the past month, Jess had really let herself go. Her doughy belly, now even larger than before. Currently, in her drivers seat Jess sat there in pink sweat pants that were looking stretched and even ripped in a couple of places, also wearing her sweat top, which had been unzipped open and looked unlikely to contain the belly that was spilling out onto her pants. Jess was wearing a white tank top, stained and rolled up to show her fast food baby to anyone interested. Jess had a double chin now, and her cheeks had grown. Jess had to admit, she loved this new look and lifestyle. The attention she brings satisfied a new craving she didn't know she even had. As she pulled up, the girl working the window was shocked to see Jess, a full public fat ass. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh um.. uh that'll be 50 bucks..\" The girl says, trying not look at Jess's large tits that are popping out of her tank top. \"Card please!\" Jess lifted her credit card, arm jiggling slightly, and tapped the machine. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl was so curios she blurted out loud without thought, \"Are you going to eat all of this yourself?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately the girl began to sweat, realizing what she just asked a customer. <i>Oh shit I'm so fired, shit shit shit.</i> She had a worried look that showed to Jess as she looked at the girl. She was pretty, slender, young, but looked past 20. Jess simply looked at the girl and began laughing out loud. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hahaha, I like the energy you have. Yes, I'm gonna eat it all right away. Been on a bit of a self discovery haha.\" Jess said, patting her pale and exposed gut for emphasis. \"How are old are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl was surprised by the calm answer, \"I'm 19. My name is Marissa.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A word of advice, life is too short, just enjoy what you like. I like food. Here's the tip for the gravy!\" Jess handed her $100 and then drove off. Marissa felt strange, and somewhat confused about that woman. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"..enjoy what you like.. hmmm...\" Marissa said quietly out loud, changing her focus towards the grill.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Jess began to drive home, stuffing down some of the burgers and fries to start while she drove. On the way, Jess spotted her favourite drive through ice cream store, and pulled in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, how can we take your order,\" The box said.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Hi there, I'd love to have two of your mega fudge sundaes with alllll the toppings. I'll also grab one of your milkshakes, extra large please!\" Jess requested, biting into her last burger quickly afterwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, come on up to the window.\" The box responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Jess was pulling up she opened the poutine and began shovelling it down. She pulled out her card, the cashier was shocked at the pure gluttony she was witnessing. The cashier gave her her food, and Jess pulled into the parking lot. Jess began inhaling her poutine, barely chewing. Forkful after forkful into her gut, Jess was making a mess on her shirt as she quickly demolished her fries and gravy. She looked at the soup bowl filled with the rich gravy, and began guzzling it down until it was done, and she released a belch that pedestrians heard across the street. She then began eating her chicken and ice cream, beginning to drive home until something else popped into her focus.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClearly, this was not new for Jess. Her almost 200 pound frame was accustomed to over eating. Jess was a monster when it came to eating. Since giving in, she has eaten almost anything that came to mind. Her home has become a mess, wrappers everywhere, food containers scattered all over. Jess only eats takeout, and essentially grabs whatever she thinks looks good. She had thought of seeing Jen and Nicole, but food/drink/weed was really all she was thinking about for the past month. Jess had really just given herself the new freedom she was looking for. She was embarrassed to say it, but Nicole and Jen were right. She needed to see them and apologize, maybe after some more dessert though...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Jess's blouse was close to exploding off of her, and her pants were very tight. Jess hopped in her car, drove to Thiqq Burger, and ordered away a massive feast. As she pulled up the workers were running the bags out the door to help the customer out and save time. As she waited, she saw Marissa, the girl from the drive thru window yesterday. Jess looked the girl over, noticing that she was barely skinny enough to not be chubby, but it looked like she was going to be growing, especially working here. Marissa had short brown hair, a full sleeve tattoo on her left arm, and a nose piercing. Jess liked this girl, and she thought she maybe had a chance with her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey there Marissa, how's work going today?\" Jess asked through the window towards her. Marissa's face warmed up when she realized Jess remembered here name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not bad, it was slow until you came haha. Are you gonna eat all this food too? This is way more than yesterday.\" Marissa asked, thinking Jess wouldn't mind the question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no, this is for me and my friends. I'm bringing them a surprise lunch from here. Just need to be prepared hahaha.\" Jess answered, her belly jiggling with her laughs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You sure do like to eat, aren't you uh... worried? You know.. about gettin... fat?\" Marissa asked, afraid of if she crossed a line yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I used to be! Fact is, I don't mind, I still hook up with people, and I feel great. I like eating like this, crazy as it sounds.\" Jess responds, still happy to answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not crazy, really!\" Marissa says, \"Honestly I love eating, especially here. Yesterday, once you left, I spent the rest of my shift paying for burgers with your tip money and sneaking them behind my managers back. I was so full, but I kind of loved it.. I'm a little jealous of your confidence with it...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJess is shocked, and turned on by this conversation.<i> I'm not sure what to do, on one hand I should see the girls and apologize, on the other hand I'm so wet thinking about this girl, maybe they can wait a day?

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As Jess drove to the house, Marissa began to digest what had just happened. Marissa looked around the car, and noticed it was really nice, definitely expensive as it was clearly a luxury car. <i>So clearly this woman has money, maybe she was serious about paying my rent? </i> Marissa thought to herself, as she began to look at the clothes Jess was popping out of, clearly small, but she's wearing really expensive name brand clothing, and didn't care about destroying the outfits with stains. As Marissa began to realize she was now unemployed, Jess began bringing out some of the burgers she had just bought and proceeded to unwrap one, handing it to Marissa with a smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eat up! Food is hot, this is what you want right?\" Jess said, still focused on the road but clearly trying to get Marissa to start pigging out. Marissa took the burger and bit in, forgetting all about her worries and just enjoying the greasy burger, one bite, two bites. Marissa only ate faster, stuffing the burger down her throat and grabbed the whole bag of food. Jess began getting wet, something about this was so hot, she wanted to fuck. Jess grabbed her own burger, proceeding to eat while driving home. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the drive was coming to a close, the food was practically out, and the girls were smiling. Marissa had undone her pants and was rubbing her small belly. Jess was bursting out of her clothes more than before, not very far from being naked (maybe intentionally so). Marissa took in the size of Jess's house. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Told ya I got you covered, you're going to enjoy yourself for a change, let loose!\" Jess said, seeing Marissa's shocked face. Jess began to explain her past year, and how she got the money, and more on why she loves food and eats whatever whenever she wants. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See, since winning, I've realized that food is one of the greatest things in the world, and when you can afford to eat anything you want, you realize how good it feels to just let it out, to just eat anything I'm thinking about. As I get fatter, I honestly don't mind, I can afford it and any complications that would happen, I have plenty of hot sex with many people who find me attractive. I've never felt so alive, so good, so ... pleased and pleasured.... it even kind of arouses me to see myself gain, to see where all my eating goes hahaha.... I hope this isn't strange to hear...\" Jess said, looking shy, but seductive towards Marissa. Marissa looked nervous, avoiding eye contact, but Jess could see Marissa's flushed face even while she pointed it towards her feet. She began to open her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All of this is so much to take in, I mean, I really want to just... eat whatever I want.... I want to be free to enjoy it. See, a little confession, I work at fast food places for a bit of a different reason... I'm a lot like you, I like pigging out on greasy food, but having very little money, I have to stay at least a little skinny, you know? So while I occasionally pigged out, I got my real fix from fattening customers and co-workers up, watching people grow and grow. I've always been quiet about this, I didn't think I'd actually find someone like you... you're kind of perfect.... basically, what I'm saying is, um.. well you se-\" Jess began to kiss Marissa, and Marissa completely returned the favour. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two began to undress each other, grabbing each others thick bodies. Jess stood naked in front of Marissa, belly hanging, fat boobs still somehow perky despite their large size. Jess walked over to the kitchen, pulled out a cake she had out, and motioned Marissa to come closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm feeling hungry, what about you? Want to eat?\" Jess said, rubbing her clit. Marissa walked over, her perky breasts bouncing as she walked. Marissa immediately grabbed a handful of cake and began eating it seductively, while Jess did the same.The cake was soon finished, and Jess grabbed more snacks. The two began making out while stuffing themselves and each other. Jess began to eat out Marissa, who began forcing as much food into her belly as possible as she came loudly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This was by far the hottest sex I've ever had,\" Jess said rubbing her distended gut, </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jess and Marissa had really found a strong passion for their new hobby. Days upon days of non-stop eating and sex soon became weeks upon weeks, and both women got lost in their sexual bliss and gluttony that it almost seemed like a dream. It's been six months since the two drove off together, and the world hasn't seen very much of them. They rarely left the home, they ordered in food and Jess hired a chef named Gwen who lived in a guest house on the property. They also hired two house keepers, named Lisa and Olivia. These two would clean up after the messes, and take care of keeping the property in order. The three women were paid very well, mostly because Jess thought it was fair considering the sights/smells they had to endeavour, however they were also hired due to their own opinions on the couples new lifestyle. Not only did all three not mind taking care of the ladies, Gwen, Lisa and Olivia were actually feeders themselves. So, when the home was taken care of, all three enjoyed keeping the girls well fed and pleased.  The sex mostly stayed between Jess and Marissa, the staff were often busy just getting food and cleaning dishes, but the odd time a threesome has happened. One of Jess's requirements was that they were supposed to stay in shape, and while eating the food and putting on weight was okay, they needed to stay mobile enough to work. All three girls were average weights, Gwen was a little plumper, but still in good enough shape for her job. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaturally, six months of living the gluttonous lifestyle like this changes those involved. Let's start off with Marissa, who was currently laying on the couch (in only sweat shorts and a bra), halfway through eating a whole two tier cake with gusto, watching TV. Marissa had gained a very visible amount of weight, gaining a good amount all over her body. Her thighs had expanded and were full of fat, stretching the limits on her stretchy shorts, making her take up more of the couch than she ever had before. Her fat belly rested onto her shorts, and jiggled as she moved, devouring more and more of the cake. Her boobs had grown a good amount, straining her bra which was stained with grease anyways. She had a double chin showing up, and her arms jiggled quite a lot without much encouragement needed, not stretching any of her sleeve. Marissa had gained an astonishing 75 pounds in 6 months, devouring whatever she could. Marissa has become amazingly greedy, and tries anything she wants and this goes beyond her hunger for food. She was drinking often, smoking weed, and she even got new tattoos on her legs, which say \"thiqq\" and \"juicy\". Marissa had really began to give in to the freedom, fucking and feeding Jess and any other partners she brings, enjoying her new and open world, where she has given into the idea of gorging for pleasure, but as time had gone on, Marissa realized what she likes the most, fattening up Jess. All of her focus was on Jess, while she loved to stuff herself, she always made sure Jess had food. Jess ate far more than Marissa, which is a truly impressive feat for Jess. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Marissa took her last bite of the cake, she sat back, grabbing milk to quench her thirst, she chugs back the whole carton, sits back, and expels a humongous belch \"*BRRRAAAPP.*.. holy fuck, that *burp* was fucking delicious Gwen, you're amazing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very kind of you to say so, Mar\", Gwen said, picking up the dishes, \"Anything else I can get you sweetie?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd love myself some doughnuts if you've got any? *uurrp* And more whole milk! Oh, also can you find me Jess?\" Marissa asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course! I'll go bring her here, I'm pretty sure she was napping off the pies she ate, I'm sure she's up by now though.\" Gwen responded, walking to the kitchen with the dishes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarissa watched the TV as she waited for her lover to arrive. Recently, Jess confessed her emotional feels towards Marissa, who felt the same way. Marissa moved in with Jess, and they really loved being with each other. As Marissa watches the TV, she hears the footsteps approaching of a heavy woman. Marissa turns her head to see Jess standing in the doorway, clearly winded from the walk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJess was enormous, an absolute blimp. 6 months of being stuffed to the limit every possible moment was very effective on increasing her girth. She had gained an astonishing 110 pounds in only three months. Jess was now 310 pounds, and feeling her weight increase every day. She currently was wearing tight black pants, which were splitting on the sides a little, and t-shirt that was way too small, showing her double belly. Her breasts pushing on her shirt, and her double chin even bigger than before, jiggling much more often. Her arms very thick and wobbly, and some new small tattoos on them. Jess was large, and she loved it. She was so in love with Marissa, she was willing to eat herself immobile if that's what she wanted. Jess loved her new figure, and having sex with Marissa and others is more enjoyable than it ever has, Jess has no intention of stopping. This is her now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi baby... *huff* how are .. *huff*.. you doing?\" Jess asked, breathing heavily as she moved to the couch to sit next to Marissa. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Better now, you hungry? I got food coming soon.\" Marissa asks seductively, grabbing Jess's fat belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, feed me baby, I'll eat anything you want me to, I'm all yours...\" Jess responded, leaning in to kiss her thinner lover. Gwen walks in with the requested food and sees the two making out and fingering each other. Gwen puts the food down and begins to walk away...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>While Jess and Marissa lived very closed lives Nicole and Jen tried their best to go outside, although, admittedly, it was usually to grab a bite to eat or to grab new clothes to replace the ones the had now outgrown. Living \"public lives\" didn't mean eating or indulging any less, in fact for Jen, being public was part of the appeal. Jen realized relativity early on that she enjoyed over eating on a more sexual level than she ever could've imagined, but as she tried new things she realized there was so much more she could be enjoying, and one of those things was pigging out in public, a lot. She enjoyed the feeling of judgement from others, looks of disgust and disappointment. They made Jen so wet she was almost always touching herself under the table, or at least when she wasn't busy cramming food down into her ever expanding gut. And so, while Jen was almost always preoccupied with either of those two things, it often left Nicole in silence when she ate with her friend. Nicole found though, the best way to deal with that silence was by eating, or drinking, or just consuming anything she could really. Nicole really just enjoyed the idea of having whatever she wanted. Nicole loved going into stores and buying whatever she fancied, such as clothes, cars, furniture, technology, jewelry, art, and anything else you could think of. Nicole bought companies just so she could feel a sense of power, and she loved hearing her net worth was increasing. Nicole had a greedy habit of drinking excessive amounts of wine, beer and other liquor often, essentially always being drunk, while smoking weed and cigars often as well. Nicole also still feasted on food quite often of course, resulting in her usually being incoherent and sloppy in conversation, from being drunk as well as stuffed to the brim. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCurrently both women were at an all you can eat buffet, seated in a booth across from one another along a wall. the table has a couple tall stacks of plates and a few empty glasses, with only a few food items actually left on the table. Nicole was forcing a large bite of lava cake into her mouth, moaning as she did, it oozed down her down double chin and she simply grabbed a glass of her milk and began chugging while the liquid poured down all over her already messy and stained t shirt. Her fat frame jiggled as she moved her arm back and forth the stuff the remainder of the dessert into her very full belly. Almost 2 years since winning the lottery and Nicole was almost passed the 300 pound mark, and she didn't appear to mind very much, if not at all. Our once slim and sexy young teacher was now an obese greedy glutton, giving in to any pleasure she could imagine. At 290 pounds, Nicole was cramming herself into the booths, with her bare belly pressing against the table and her face covered in her dinner/dessert. Nicole was wearing a sweat suit, one that was officially in need of replacing. The sweater fully unzipped, showing her large gut and her stained shirt that acted as a bra more than anything else. Her large tits covered in chocolate and other ingredients jiggled as she moved, while her round face just moaned in pleasure from her near sexual encounter with the dessert. Nicole burped as she finished the rest of her milk and snacks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Buurrrrpp!!! Oh my... UUrraappP!!.. goodness.. *huff huff*, tha-URRpp!.. that was.. *belch*.. *huff*.. that was amazing... I need some scotch.... *burp*... oh, um, waiter! I'll take a bottle of your finest scotch, *bruuahp* please!\" Nicole said, leaning back and looking stuffed to the brim. \"How's it goin, sweetie?\" Nicole asked across the table towards Jen, who was only a bite away from finishing her burger and inhaled it before answering her friend. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuckin greaaat, I love this place Nic, it's like heaven for me.\" Jen answered, before grabbing two more burger and stuffing them into her chubby cheeks. \"I just can't get enough of it, I just need more burgers, and more pizza, and more and more and moooore!!!\" Jen excaimed before eating with much gusto, causing her body to jiggle. Jen had gained...</span></div></div>",

Just jalapenos.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, uh, then extra jalapenos. And some of that oil and vinegar.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBianca Hayden, or Bee to her friends, was ringing this idiot out for his sandwich. It seemed like that was all she did nowadays post-grad, tell clueless idiots that they couldn't get their subs toasted because the toaster was busted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That'll be $7.29.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, lemme add a cookie to that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe thought about just telling him no, but the manager wouldn't like that. It was only a minor inconvenience, but Bee's life felt like an endless series of them. \"$8.78.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dude handed her a 10 dollar bill. She flashed a fake smile as she handed him his change. \"That'll be up for you at the end of the counter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBee washed her hands after using the restroom like a good little employee, looking at herself in the mirror as she scrubbed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBianca was a hard girl to miss in a crowd for a number of reasons. The most obvious reason was her height; at 6'4\", she towered over most women her age and up to this point was taller than every single one of her romantic partners. She used to be a bit self-conscious about it during middle and high school but as college rolled around, she learned to own it, almost never going to a party without a pair of high-heeled boots.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother attention-grabber was her goth-inspired personal aesthetic. Bee wasn't one to straight-up identify as a goth, she didn't like the music or the culture or the over-the-top look of the more \"serious\" goths that she'd see on Instagram, but it was hard for her to deny the fashion similarities. She had short, dyed black hair, naturally pale skin, a little nose ring in her left nostril, a stud in her bellybutton, a penchant for applying heavy black makeup around her eyes and on her lips, and a number of edgy tattoos on her arms and legs. Nevertheless, she preferred \"punk\" as her descriptor. Instead of the frilly, leathery goth dress code, she often wore Japanese hardcore or black metal tees and skinny jeans. Right now though, she was in her work uniform: a black t-shirt with \"RANDALL'S SUBPORIUM\" on the back and a pair of blue jeans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last major standout feature of Bee's was her figure. Bee was the epitome of what the kids called \"thicc\" nowadays and frequently got a lot of often unwanted attention because of her big booty and wide hips. If she had a nickel for every time some douche came up unsolicited and tried to touch her ass at college parties or at the bar, she'd be a millionaire. That being said, she liked sexual attention aimed at her butt from the right people and liked to wear tight or revealing clothes to show it off in case somebody wanted to be polite and get to know her first before trying to dive between her cheeks. Her breasts weren't too shabby either, a full double D cup, but they were far from her center of attention. Bee had a bit of a tummy, too, and was generally a pretty soft woman. She weighed in at around 220 pounds, but about 60 of those pounds can be attributed to her just being pretty damn tall. It goes without saying that she carried most of that weight in her lower body, her chunky thighs and cute belly going together nicely with her booty fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Bee was throwing away the now wet paper towels she used to dry her hands, she noticed something out of place in the trash can. Nestled between another paper towel and a tampon wrapper was a folded up lottery ticket. Huh, odd. Why would someone just throw this away in the bathroom? Whatever. She slipped it in her back pocket. Could be lucky, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBee took a bite from her turkey and bacon sandwich. Of course, it was absolutely delicious. That's part of the reason why Bee kept working at this dump: she got half-off sandwiches and Randall's had the best sandwiches in town. You could say Bee was a \"foodie\". You could also say that Bee had a... thing for large amounts of food. The feeling and pressure of fullness, the incredible, overwhelming taste, the vibration in her throat when she released a deep belch, the hedonism of at all... Let's just say that Bee tried to keep her portions down when she was on break at work; she didn't want to have any embarrassing mishaps. This lead to an odd dichotomy in her mind. She had a genuine interest in sampling food from around the world, tasting the complex flavors of the finest quality ingredients, but if she ate too much, well, she'd really, really wanna fuck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she ate her food and scrolled idly down her Instagram feed, the general manager, Rosario, came over to the table. Rosario was a slightly short Latina woman in her 40s. Her demeanor was often cheerful but she ran a tight ship. \"Hey, Bianca? Can I ask a favor?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm?\" She looked her in the eyes, mouth full of sandwich.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hate to tell you this, but Brian just called off. Says his car's busted and can't get a ride over.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe swallowed and rolled her eyes. \"Goddamnit Brian.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeaaaaah... Can you stay until close tonight? If you can't it's okay, I can find somebody else.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sighed. \"Yeah, it's fine. I can stay, I don't have anything going on.\" In fact, Bee had planned on buying and subsequently stuffing a whole McDonald's dinner box into her face tonight, but she supposed that could wait.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRosario breathed a sigh of relief. \"Oh God, thank you. You're a lifesaver.\" She looked at the clock: time to pick up her kids from school. \"I'll leave you alone now. Call me if you need anything, it's not like anybody comes in here after 3 though. See ya tomorrow!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Rosario left, Bee continued to munch on her sandwich. Yummy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA couple hours of daydreaming and occasional sandwich making later, a suspicious, out of breath customer burst through the glass door. Outright ignoring Bee's flatly delivered greeting of \"Hi there, what can I get ya?\", the crazy-haired lady pretty much jogged her way to the women's bathroom. Eh, whatever. Randall's got its fair share of people who came in exclusively for the public restroom, and she couldn't give less of a shit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, the lady re-emerged as frazzled as ever, jogging to the counter where Bee continued to stand. She leaned over the counter, breathing heavily. \"You didn't happen to find a lottery ticket lying around, did you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh shit. If there was a question to answer with a lie, this was it. \"I didn't, no. Why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shit. The winning lottery ticket was sold today at the gas station down the street and they can't find who bought it.\" She stopped to catch her breath for a moment. \"I bought a ticket earlier but I lost it. Are you sure you didn't see anything?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBee's heart was pounding, but she had to conceal her nervousness. \"Sorry, I didn't.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay.\" The lady removed a pad of paper from her purse and ripped a sheet off, scribbling her phone number down. \"Call me if you find it. Please.\" She smacked the paper down on the counter and stormed off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lottery ticket was suddenly burning a hole in Bee's back pocket. Could this be...? She rushed into the office behind the kitchen where that lady wouldn't be able to see her, even though she already left. Precautions must be taken. She pulled out her phone and the ticket and looked up the winning numbers. The ticket was for the MegaBall, which according to the Google search had hit its largest jackpot of all time. And...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh my God. They matched.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe numbers matched.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBee held in her hand a winning lottery ticket which after taxes would net her around 750 million dollars.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n750 MILLION DOLLARS.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn't know how to handle this information, but she KNEW she wasn't gonna call that woman. This was hers. She HAD to claim it.</span></div></div>",

The sound of traffic drifted in through an open window, but she couldn't separate them from her own chaotic thoughts. She looked like she just rolled out of bed: messed up hair, a lack of make-up, a sloppy Frank Zappa t-shirt, baggy sweatpants. A direct contrast from the man she was here to see: Oscar Borden, an esteemed financial advisor. A thin man in his early 50s, very quickly going grey. Black, three piece suit that looked like it cost a fortune. Cornflower blue tie: tasteful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. Borden leaned back in his swivelling office chair. \"Well Miss Hayden, I'm glad you came to me.

I'm gonna see you up with some investments. Get you some stock in some large and up-and-coming companies that are absolutely gonna turn a profit. That's where my cut's gonna come from.

Do you have any right now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhhhh... Not that I can think of. Do you have any general advice for me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you can spend your money however you'd like, really. You've acquired quite a sum of cash. But if you'd like my advice? Be modest about it. You didn't tell anyone you won 750 million dollars in the lottery, did you? Even a parent?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't. No.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Keep it that way. The people you love will never look at you the same way if they find out. You'll become their personal bank rather than a human being to them. Trust me, I've seen it happen. Are you in a relationship?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, if you get into a relationship, that's the ONLY person you should tell about your financial situation. Still, be vague about it. Keep your job for a while. Pretend you're leaving for a better opportunity and then you don't have to work again. Do you live with relatives, rent, or own property?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I rent.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You should buy a house. Move out when your lease runs out. You don't wanna be under the thumb of some landlord if you don't have to be. Do you have roommates?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nevermind then. Um...\" He tapped a pen to his desk. \"I think that's all. You've got my number, call me anytime. Around the clock advice is what you're paying me for.\" He rose from his seat and extended a hand for a handshake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBee promptly shook his hand with gusto. He seemed surprised by the firmness of her handshake. \"Thank you so much. I'll let you know if I have any questions.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great! I look forward to having you as a client. Enjoy your winnings! My secretary will have some forms for you to fill out when you leave. Contracts and stuff. You can take them to a lawyer if you want, no rush on signing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBee sat in her crappy 00s Ford Taurus, which she thought would be soon on the chopping block for replacement, thinking about what Mr. Borden told her. It was great advice, but at the bottom of her heart she knew she needed to be impractical right now and make some vanity purchases. Something throwaway that Borden said stuck out to her, playing again and again in her mind like a broken record: \"...squandered their new wealth like a kid in a candy store...\" She thought that that might be a good idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBee saw the sign from the highway: Charlie's Candy Emporium. Every day she thanked the God in Heaven that she didn't believe in that she happened to live in the same city as the largest candy store in the Midwest. However, budgetary constraints left her a bit disappointed every time she paid a visit; her wallet could only take so much chocolate expenditure. Until now. Bee licked her lips as she exited her car into the parking lot. UNTIL NOW.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharlie's was more like a warehouse than a typical candy store, specializing in bulk and wholesale candy of all shapes and sizes. Despite its somewhat drab decoration on the outside, it still had the gooey center that Bee so loved. So. Much. Candy. She picked a cart and began the process. Pushing aisle to aisle she picked up cases upon cases of bulk Reese's Peanut Butter Cups, big ol Hershey and Crunch bars, lollipops, Kit Kat bars, Jolly Ranchers, Sour Patch Kids, Cadbury Eggs, chewy caramels and taffies, and so on and so on. She got approximately one metric fuckton of sour Gummy Worms, a personal favorite, and even threw in some of the REALLY big kind. Her cart was heaping to put it mildly by the time she got to the jelly bean dispenser, which was the most important stop. Bee loved jelly beans more than sex. If she were a superhero, they'd be her kryptonite. Normally when she came here she only got a single bag of them, but now? She went overboard. Bags upon bags, pounds upon pounds, she filled them with delight, even turning herself on a little bit when she thought of all that fuckin sugar that was gonna sit in her stomach like a rock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBee ended up spending more than a grand on candy. She filled up three whole carts to bursting, and it was all for her. No sharing, no moderation. Just her and a mountain of chocolate, impatiently waiting to be shoved into her stomach. After loading up her car to candy capacity, she had a thought. You know what would be good with jelly beans? Ice cream. Lots and lots of ice cream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi, I'd like to buy this store's entire stock of vanilla ice cream.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe grocery store customer service desk lady, whose name was Stacey according to her name tag, looked at Bee like she was crazy. I mean, really tall goth girl? Looking like she just woke up from a 10 year long nap? You'd think she was crazy too. \"Uhh, our entire...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, all of it. You heard right. I've got a big party coming up, we're making a big sundae.\" The only party she actually had coming up was in her stomach and later in her panties, but she was a good liar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhhhhh, I guess we can do that. But only the stuff that's already on the shelves, I-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I want all of it. That's why I'm talking to you instead of going to the frozen aisle and getting it myself.\" Bee stared bullets into Stacey. She loved being intimidating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhhh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBee's current apartment was a tight little one bedroom spot on the 3rd floor of some building on the west side. It wasn't particularly fancy, but it was in a good area and it was home-y. Just what she needed. She was always happy that she lived in a city where she could actually afford to live by herself, that way she wouldn't have to annoy her roommates with her weird kinky sex stuff or casual hookups. She was pretty loud in the bedroom and was lucky the walls weren't too thin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBee had just finished shoving all the ice cream in the freezer and fridge, taking out and cracking open a celebratory beer in the process. She plopped down on the sofa, admiring the pile of candy in the corner. Fuck, it was gonna take weeks of a candy only diet to go through all this shit. She glugged down half of the beer and belched. Dammit, she wanted sex now. Hedonism was running through her veins. Might as well text some guy a booty call, but who? She scrolled through her contacts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLogan was ol' reliable. Always down to fool around. Total sweetheart. Great kisser. Even better in bed. If she was into relationships, Bee would totally ask this guy. Thing is, he wasn't that into the food stuff. He'd do it for a blowjob, but she could tell his heart wasn't really in it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then there was Vincent. Bee got Vincent's number off the internet on some feeder dating site and the two texted and Snapchatted each other about kinky stuff all the time. They'd only been on a couple dates, which both ended in some wonderful car belly rubs and make out sessions, but they've never actually had sex with each other before. Was tonight the night?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho to text?</span></div></div>",

            ],
            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Yeah, after thinking about it for a little bit, Bee settled on Vincent. Mainly because she thought he would appreciate her massive candy purchase. She whipped out her phone and hit him up on Snapchat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nB: hey<br>\r\nB: guess what im doing tonight<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere, that should pique his interest. Vincent was a very thirsty boy, probably pretty frustrated he hasn't gotten a piece of bountiful Bee butt yet. She liked teasing him, he was so cute when he got all hard and flustered. She stood up to stretch, tossing her phone onto the leather couch cushion with a dull thunk. While she waited for a response, might as well prepare some dinner. Bee went over into the kitchen area of her little apartment and procured a large mixing bowl from the cabinet. She hadn't used this thing in a whiiiiile, so she gave it a quick rinse in the sink. Then, the preparation. She took a carton of ice cream from the fridge: still cold enough to be slightly solid but warm enough to have a liquid quality. After she opened it and turned it over into the bowl, the rounded rectangular mass of vanilla ice cream fell in with a wet smack, little droplets splashing onto her face. Shit, if Vincent were here she could make him lick it off. Oh well. More for Bee. She walked over to the candy pile, wiping drops off her face with her finger and into her mouth with a loud sucking sound. Hmm... Jelly beans. She grabbed one of her many newly bought assorted jelly bean bags and brought it to the kitchen and unceremoniously dumped some of its contents into the bowl. Shit, what else? Whipped cream? She checked the fridge and came up empty, but found chocolate syrup instead. That should work. After messily squeezing some into her mouth, Bee dressed her very healthy salad generously. Now slurry of soft ice cream stained with sugary colors and brown drizzle, she figured the meal was complete. The final thing: a spoon. Had to be a big one. She was a big girl after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlopping back on the couch, spoon and bowl in hand, she discovered a Snapchat message from Vincent. Hell yeah!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nV: What?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOoh, he's biting!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nB: i just made the most insane dinner<br>\r\nB: and im gonna get drunk<br>\r\nB: you should come over ;)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe never did the emotes. She hoped that winky face showed she was serious. Bee took the ice cream bowl into her lap, dug the spoon in, and took a heaping spoonful into her mouth. Mmmmmm\u2026 Did the Devil make this? It tasted like pure sin and gluttony. Need more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBee was so absorbed in her vigorous ice cream binging that she almost missed Vincent's response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nV: I'm at work til midnight tonight<br>\r\nV: As much as I'd love to come watch you eat dinner I can't<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShit. Where did Vincent work, anyway? Can't be that good a job if they keep him there till midnight. Just then, Bee remembered that she was a multi-millionaire now and got a thought. A juicy, horny thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nB: okay then<br>\r\nB: how about you quit your job and come work for me<br>\r\nB: be my cute manservant<br>\r\nB: cash under the table<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuick response this time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nV: Lol<br>\r\nV: Suuuure<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGod damnit. He didn't believe her. Bee took an angry shovel of ice cream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nB: im serious numbnuts<br>\r\nB: you stand to make a lot under my employment<br>\r\nB: im in the market for someone like you<br>\r\n<br>\r\nV: Oh?<br>\r\nV: What will I make?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nB: idk ill have to ask my financial advisor<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe he was trying to be flirty with that question. Bee didn't care. There was a text silence for a little while. The TV was now on, tuned to the Food Network. Bee liked to watch food while she ate food. More easily immersed her in the experience. Then, another message.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nV: Are you really offering me a job?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJesus Christ.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nB: fuck dude YES i am i already said<br>\r\nB: ill pay you more than wherever you work<br>\r\nB: where do you work anyway<br>\r\n<br>\r\nV: I'm a janitor at the mall<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPfft. He looked like a janitor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nB: ill pay you more than your shitty janitor wages for sure<br>\r\n<br>\r\nV: Don't you work at some sandwich place<br>\r\nV: How are you supposed to pay me<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShit. Should she tell him? As she contemplated, Bee rolled up her shirt, exposing her rounded tummy to the world. Ice cream made her super bloated, but she ate it anyway. It's GOOD, dammit! She put a cold hand to her warm stomach. Mmmm... After a moment of basking in her own body heat, it was time to keep eating. She was making good work of the sweet concoction, and it was just as delicious as she imagined it would be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFuck, wait. Should she tell him?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Shoveling ice cream and beer into her face, she contemplated what Borden told her. If she let it slip that she was now a multi-millionaire to anyone in her life, she'd become nothing more than a tall money fountain with a big butt. That didn't interest her, obviously. On the other hand, maybe she could get down with being a sugar momma. Maybe she could have a harem of cute guys that would tend to her every need, feed her, regular orgies... Shit. She was torn. On one hand, all her relationships would be eroded by her former friends just wanting money. On the other hand, food and orgies. Maybe there was a middle ground... Then, she got an idea. She wouldn't lie or tell the truth. She'd just not say anything. If Vincent or whoever didn't question or care where the money was coming from, it didn't matter. But Vincent was already asking questions...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBee finished the ice cream. Buzzed, horny, and  stuffed to the gills, she laid down on the couch, her long, thick legs draped over the arm. She patted her stomach and burped contentedly. Ahhhh... This was the life. If only Vincent were here... Wait. Idea. Bee sat up and burped again. If Vincent couldn't come here, what if she came to him? She eagerly grabbed her phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nB: hey gimme your address<br>\r\nB: of your work<br>\r\n<br>\r\nV: Why?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nB: are you alone there<br>\r\n<br>\r\nV: Yeah<br>\r\n<br>\r\nB: im coming over<br>\r\nB: whats your address<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe hoped this would work. God, please. She needed some loving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nV: Fine<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sent the address. YES!!! Wait. She thought to herself that maybe she should sober up before driving over there so she doesn't get in a car accident. Then she remembered that she was filthy rich now and could definitely afford an Uber. Another beer!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBee waited outside of her apartment for the Uber. She quickly put on some make-up and a more snazzy change of clothes that was pretty typical of when she was trying to be \"fancy\": a sleeveless Misfits t-shirt that was purposefully ripped into becoming a belly shirt, exposing a very bloated tummy and her red stud, a leather jacket, high-waisted black leather booty shorts that left no questions unanswered about the size and shape of her ass, thick fishnets that clung sexily to her thigh fat, and heeled combat boots that made her seem even taller. She had hastily gelled up her short hair, too, completing her look: high style, high sex appeal. It was a miracle she could turn her previously sloppy vibe into this one on such short notice, and while pretty tipsy too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally a car pulled up and put its hazards on: gotta be David in the 2017 Hyundai Elantra. Bee strutted confidently to the passenger side back door and opened it, giving the driver a quick \"Hey\" as she squeezed her long legs in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid, a young guy with a young face, turned his head around to look at Bee. \"So, where we headed?\" She noticed him sneak a peek at her boobs. He must be disappointed she wasn't showing much cleavage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBee stifled a little burp and gave him the address, which he put in the GPS, and they were off. Bee looked out the window at the houses and storefronts, listening to the decent volume rap music that David had on. After a little while of silence, he asked, \"So, you going out tonight? I've been ferrying a lot of people out to the bars this past hour, shit's popping off.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn't look over from the window. \"Nah. A date.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohhhhh, cool. Very cool. I haven't been on a date in a minute. Maybe I should change that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBee's thoughts were swirling in the back seat, what she would do when she saw Vincent, what she was gonna do with all that money, how good that ice cream was, how it was all gonna go straight to her thighs\u2026 Shit. She made herself hungry again. She just ate a gallon of ice cream and jelly beans and her body was telling her \"No more!\" but her brain was screaming \"MCDONALD'S!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heyyy, driver?\" She forgot his name. \"You should go through the McDonald's drive thru that's gonna be coming up. I'm *URRP* hungry.\" That belch was sending mixed messages. Hopefully he just thought she was drunk, which she clearly was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, sure. Clock's still running though.\" David hit the turn signal and rolled up to the ordering kiosk, rolling down the driver's side backseat window so Bee could order. She scooched her big booty over to the other side, legs pressing against the back of the driver's seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBee perused the menu quickly before deciding on her usual order. \"Hey, lemme get a Big Mac, a 10 piece nugget, and a large fry please.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe voice through the speaker asked, \"What sauce with your nuggets?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShit, she always forgot about this question. \"Gimme a fuckload of honey mustard.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will that complete your order?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGood question. Then Bee remembered she was a millionaire. \"Uhh, actually, can I add a dinner box to that?\"</span></div></div>",

Every contact she had was messaging her, telling her how much they loved her and would do anything she wanted. Allison began to feel wet from the attention, feeling the dopamine rush coarse through her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehehe wooww... this is amazing...\" Allison said, biting her lip from the excitement. \"Well, it seems like I should let these very helpful people help me if they're insisting so much....\" </span></div></div>",

Quickly, she collected a lot of money, clothing, food and property. Allison would make out with hot men and women, finally getting herself laid. Allison was in heaven for the first couple days doing this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, the worlds leaders all got in contact with her, asking for her to be their queen of the world, finally resulting in world peace. Allison gladly agreed, getting on the TV to present her speech as the new leader of the world. In only a weeks time after making her first wish Allison lived in a very large mansion in California while waiting for her palace to be built, she was the richest person in the world, the most powerful person in the world, and the greediest person in the world. Allison had fixed all the corruption issues in the world, since she had taken almost all of the worlds money.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAllison used it for feeding the hungry, fixing the economy and hopefully creating a utopia in the future. However, while Allison was trying to do good for the world, she also still gave in to her greedy appetite. Allison was currently...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Allison awoke in her massive bed, seeing three other people sleeping all across it. Allison felt hungover, and could barely remember her sexual activities from the night before, clearly a sign of over indulging in her alcohol consumption. Allison felt thirsty, and got out of bed to grab herself a glass of water. It had been a couple more weeks since Allison had made her wish, and things were still surreal, feeling like any moment the dream would end, or something would go wrong, but alas, everything was going fine for Allison. She kept indulging herself waiting for the worst to come. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAllisons house was now a monstrous mansion, fitted with almost anything she could desire. Very soon her Palace would be finished, and she would officially feel like a queen, but until that came she'd have to make due with her mega mansion. Since Allison became Queen of the World, things had quickly changed to suit her desire. For one, all violence and war was over, and she was using the worlds money to build a perfect world, one where she would be worshipped by everyone. Allison felt her greed getting the best of her thoughts, thinking of everything she wants to do, and everything she wants to own and possess. One thing Allison did right away was get every scientist in the world to develop a device that can make food easily and sustainably, while also feeding the world. Allison enjoyed getting anything she wanted, it was a fun time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Allison poured herself a glass of water, she looked over her clean house, aware that if it hadn't been for her staff she her home would've been a pig-sty. The past few weeks were a blur of masturbation, massive orgies, drinking and eating. Allison was in heaven, waking up and being treated by her lovers and staff, being fed and taken care of, being pleasured at every moment of the day. Allison loved it, even if it gave her headaches, and a bit of tummy. Allison had definitely put on a few pounds in the past weeks. She wasn't really gorging on too much food, but she was eating a lot of unhealthy food that she hadn't been able to eat in a while, so she planned on eating a little more for the time being. Allison still hadn't used her two wishes, allowing Sam to enjoy being out of his lamp for a little while. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Allison! How's it going? How did you sleep?\" Sam asked her, causing her to wince from the volume of his voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's good, slept good... just thirsty... how are you?\" Allison asked, sounding still half asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great! Just heard a voicemail about your new house! I think it's done!\" Sam said happily, seeing Allisons face light up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My Palace? I'm finally getting my Palace...\" Allison was excited, and suddenly horny. \"I'll be back later Sam, I need to return to my bedroom, the girls need me hehe.\" Allison raced off to her bedroom to enjoy the idea of finally getting her royal palace. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She left the house and got in to her limo, which began driving her. Allison was incredibly excited, since Allison had told them to build it to her exact demands. She had it built on a gorgeous empty property, far from any other homes. She had a massive fence installed, and had plenty of security watching over her at all times. As they pulled up, Allison couldn't believe how big the property was, and just how much there was to do on it. She had her own runway with her private plane on the lot, as well as many other houses for guests and staff. There was an amusement park with plenty of rides and games, a massive pool with water slides and large hot tubs over looking the pool. There was still so much left on the property for her to explore, she hadn't even admired at the building yet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer Palace was huge, without a doubt one of the largest palaces ever built. Inside, Allison had the largest collection alcohol, with almost every type of liquor in her cellar. She had an indoor pool and hot tubs as well as an entire spa built in. She had multiple kitchens around the house, always manned with staff ready to cook. She had a movie theatre, a concert hall, arcade games, and a massive vault full of different foods for her to eat. Allison couldn't believe her eyes, she was in heaven. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my goodness, I'm really the queen Sam. I loooove this, I just can't wait to live the pampered lifestyle for the rest of my life!\" Allison said, strutting to the doors of the palace, eager to start enjoying herself. Sam and Allison spent the rest of the day walking around the grounds and seeing what was fun. Allison was drinking wine from the bottle all day, finishing two bottles before bed, as well as packing away a very full dinner after snacking on various junk all day. Allison was now seated in her bed, grasping her small bloated gut. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*hic* oh my, I can't *hic* believe I ate soo... *hic* muchh. If I keep this up I'm gonna be a chubby girl *hic* hahah *snort*!\" Allison was very drunk, sitting in bed talking to herself. She had finished her wine, and currently was finishing her last bite from a chicken burger. \"Mmmmmmm yessss... honestly, I'm tired of being this skinny little girl, it's time for me to show the world who is queen!\" Allison began to rub her clit, screaming louder and louder as she got closer to climax. Allison came in one long burst, until she relaxed back and immediately fell asleep. </span></div></div>",

She was still wearing her robe from last night, and found an empty bottle of wine in her bed. As Allison got out of bed, she could smell something delicious down the hall. <i>Mmmm that smells great... I must know what it is...</i> Allison thought, moving towards the heavenly scent. As Allison walked towards the kitchen she saw quite a large buffet for her to choose from. A large table covered in waffles, bacon, sausages, french toast, pancakes and many other delicacies. Allison walked over to the table and grabbed a handful of bacon right away, salivating at her first bite. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh myy, this is amazing. Can I get some champagne orange juice?\" Allison asked, as a servant rushed over with the drink. Allison grabbed the glass and chugged it back, belching. \" *Uuurrrpp!* Another please!\" While she waited for her second drink, she grabbed some more food and began eating it. As Allison chugged back more and more of her drink she began to get drunker and drunker, causing her to eat without abandon. She had already put back a pound of bacon, and was moving quickly through the sausages. Syrup was covering her chin and dripping down her breasts. Allison moaned, getting wetter and wetter as she ate. She pulled in her lovers to the room, who pleasured her while she consumed her favourite foods. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter hours of non stop gorging, Allison was bloated and exhausted. She had eaten most of the buffet with her lovers, who were also laying down with her, tired and full. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",
