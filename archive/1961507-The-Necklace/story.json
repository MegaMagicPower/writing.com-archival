The store was a simple store, nothing too fancy except for the fact it sold mystic and spiritual items. These things probably were valuable to collectors. Katy eyed around the store to scan for more evidence. She sighed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n*tap*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaty darted upwards from her crouched position as she was tapped on the shoulder. It was the shopkeeper and owner of the store who had tapped her shoulder. A greyed hair man in his late 40s probably. He wore  scruffy looking brown beanie and had a worn brown apron over his casual attire underneath. The man's name was William.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Detective, anything found?\" William inquired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm afraid not.\" Katy replied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seems the person or people who robbed you were adequately skilled and that they didn't leave much to go on with, rest assured I'm sure we will catch them soon enough.\" Katy continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm, ah well, I'm sure you and your colleagues are working your hardest.\" William said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Here detective, a little something as thanks for your effort and possibly to bring you good fortune in the events to come.\" William said as he offered something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn his hand was a necklace. Rather simple yet elegant. Silver chained and had a small pendant with a deep red gem in the form of a circle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, I will keep in touch if any further developments come up.\" Katy thanked William.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaty left the scene and headed back to her apartment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow what should she do.</span></div></div>",

She also had the feeling that early sleep like this would be rare in the upcoming weeks as she had a hunch alot of events would happen. Katy changed into her night attire and slept. As she slept, the necklace glowed faintly under the moonlight that shone through the blinds. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Life...Expectancy...milk...birth...joy...Mother...\" Thoughts formed as if someone was communicating with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaty awoke with a start as she felt a pain in her midriff area.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Katy decided that it was still quite early to go to bed. She looked at her digital watch and saw it was still 8pm which meant that the gym was still open. The community gym wasn't anything fancy but it had decent equipment and the best part was it was across the street from where Katy lived. Katy got inside and headed for the changing area. She changed out of her jeans and black top into her gym attire. She admired her figure for a bit. Her figure was average but the young cops back at the office were always staring as she walked past their desks. She could see why her form fitting clothes always showed off her moderate chest which were C cups and her butt was always round looking, she giggled a little to herself before leaving the changing area. Inside the workout area she decided to run the treadmill a little. Its important to work on stamina when you have to chase criminals. She did this for about 45 minutes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring all of this, the area was pretty sparse except for Katy, a middle aged man and a pregnant young woman. As Katy was running on the treadmill, the woman approached her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"erm...E-excuse me miss.\" The woman spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaty raised an eyebrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes?\" Katy responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would you happen to know where the Everhill Hotel is?\" She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaty then pointed out the directions to the young pregnant woman. As Katy spoke she thought of how she wished to feel how that pregnant belly felt like. As she thought of it whilst giving directions <i>*flash*</i>. Katy then found her pacing slowing considerably and that her chest jiggled alot more and she was leaning forward a bit more than normal. She looked down and found a pregnant belly in place of her flat belly. She was surprised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M-miss...are you ok?\" The once pregnant woman spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...y-yeah...probably should stop now that the little one is kicking...heh\" Katy said as she forced a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman thanked for the instructions and complimented Katy on still exercising when shes so far along. Katy went into the changing room and changed into her jeans which now were stretched quite far out and her top was no longer form fitting to say the least. Katy looked at her watch and saw it was 8:50PM.</span></div></div>",

She found it a little difficult to walk with the new load and her centre of gravity shifted so she has to adjust to the new addition for now. Katy sat on the bench and pulled out her phone from her pocket. Katy looked through the contacts and found Daniel. Daniel Myers or Dan as Katy called him was a senior officer and lover of Katy the two were from the same neighbourhood and were childhood friends and now lovers. Daniel often worked with Katy in the office and usually took her out for lunch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaty waited patiently for Dan to answer the call. She could only think of some way to explain this and is worried at how he will take it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello?\" Katy asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Katy! How you doing baby girl?\" Daniel answered cheerfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...y-yeah fine, Dan you know I'm...I'm pregnant....\" Katy confessed reluctantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"..Uh yeah, Katy don't you remember that we're engaged now and that we told our parents the news about 7 months ago?\" Dan told Katy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"....o-Oh yeah!

Katy went up to her apartment and changed into her night attire. Katy sat on her bed and started to think about the situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok...so I'm pregnant...everyone around me seem to think that I have always been pregnant and now my relation with Dan is even closer.\" Katy began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It seems that the lady back at the gym should have been the one with this child but now I have it...\" Katy continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cpred\">\"All is well Mistress Katy.\"</span> A voice spoke inside her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT?

They were both best friends since young. Jennifer wore a dark maroon jacket and a dark purple top inside along with a dark maroon jeans. Jennifer was about the same height as Katy. Jennifer was athletic and had a passion for volleyball. Jennifer also has quite an impressive rack that were ranging from the bigger D cups.

Jennifer and Katy then exit Katy's office and they went down the corridor past the water cooler where Katy stopped to get a cup of water before catching up with Jennifer. Inside Jennifer's office, Jennifer pulls out two suspect files. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The first guy's name is Jack and he was imprisoned once a year ago for robbing several antique stores, mystic stuff and all those knick knack items.\" Jennifer says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then there's this lady called Mei Li and she's been seen around the area on CCTV around the robbery site days before.\" Jennifer says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two files lay opened.

Time ticked by and by the time they arrived it was already 4 pm. Katy stepped out and took a look around. The place seemed quite empty. In front of Katy was an old apartment building. There seemed to be no one around then Katy saw a lady dressed in a tight fitting kimono came out. The lady saw the police tag resting on Katy's belly and she ran.

It can only transfer pregnancies from another pregnant woman so if the targeted woman has triplets the transfer will take the triplets into the host. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll pregnancies accelerated till they are of full term. Only the host will know of this and everyone else will just think she was pregnant from the start. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe necklace will stop birth as long as it is worn. If the necklace is taken off forcibly or by accident, the first 3 hours will be mild cramps then after will be contractions and ultimately the water bag breaking. The host will have 9 hours in total to find the necklace but the necklace's magic make it seem that the host is oblivious to the missing necklace until contractions hit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe necklace can either return the pregnancies or sent all the carried babies to another woman so she will give birth to babies and she will be their mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe necklace has no limit to how many pregnancies it can take but the limit is how much the user can handle and it can only work on either the host or others females around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile the user has some babies, the necklace is able to use a secondary functions like time stopping and enhanced protection from physical objects through a shield. The only downside is that you'll be exhausted after using the extra abilities.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u>How does birth work for the main character works</u><br>\r\nOur main character will have 9 hours to put on the necklace as stated above and during this hours cramps, contractions and the water bag breaking. If she manages to put on the necklace birth is avoided but if she doesn't her water bag breaks but the pregnancies will all return to their original mothers and the main character will awake at home with the necklace but with no pregnancy by magic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u>How the necklace guides the main character</u><br>\r\nIn the first few beginning chapters, the necklace's spirit is unknown and guides through thought and later on may be called out either by will or forced to by certain events. The main character usually is forced to take a pregnancy as the spirit inside the necklace overpowers her to do so. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u>How will others react to the pregnancy</u><br>\r\nThe necklace will make it seemed that the main character was naturally pregnant and that they will seem to know as if she was like that the whole time. No one will truly point out how she got pregnant since the main character usually is only temporarily having the pregnancy and will transfer it out <i>eventually</i>... The necklace's magic will haze other's minds to purposely avoid asking whys and hows as it replaces them with regular general observations.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u>How the main character reacts to pregnancy</u><br>\r\nKaty will at first be surprised but her secret want to be pregnant and use it on others will develop as we go along. Whether or not Katy uses it with compassion is up to readers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u>Setting</u><br>\r\nThe story is set in a time that is modern. Your character's name is Katy Starlight and you have moved out of your little hometown and settled into the new city of Unity City. You have a job as a detective to investigate many  murders and so on. You gain the necklace from a crime scene in a mystic shop and the shopkeeper insisted that you keep it. So you did. Unknown to you that the power it grants and the even more powerful it holds once you had a pregnancy kept.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u>Rules</u><br>\r\n1. No Mpreg<br>\r\n2. No other inflations but pregnancy<br>\r\n3. First person is appreciated but you can write in  third person here and there<br>\r\n4. Expand the plot with each addition<br>\r\n5. No sudden massive expansion ie over 20 babies (be logical)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI'll add on here and there when I can.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Enjoy</i></td>",
