They met in an open field pretty far away from the village. \"I have waited for this battle for quite a time... I'm not going to lose!\", Sakura said as soon as they made eye contact. Ino nodded and said:\"Me too... Very well, let's get this started!\" and without wasting any more time, the ninjas engaged into battle. They both fought with all their power and skill and the fight went on for several minutes. No matter how hard they tried, neither Sakura nor Ino managed to really hurt their opponent. They were just as strong and after another 20 minutes, both of them were really exhausted and almost too tired to continue fighting. The sun was burning mercylessly and the ninja girls were now soaked in their sweat from the fight and the extreme heat. It was then when they noticed a smell... It was a very cheesy and slightly sour smell, it smelled like... feet! Ino, still gasping for air, said:\"I think this battle is going nowhere, maybe whe should... *sniff* Ugh, Sakura, is that putrid smell coming from your feet?\" Sakura blushed and responded angryly:\"Uhm... yeah, do you expect my feet to smell like roses after such a long battle? Besides, I think most of that smell is emitted by YOUR feet, Ino, just look how sweaty your toes are!\" Ino looked down and was shocked, her toes really were extremely sweaty and the smell of her feet was pretty strong... but she was sure that Sakuras feet would be worse... Suddenly, she got an idea! \"Hey, Sakura! I know a less exhausting way to continue our fight... But it won't be pleasant.\" \"The stench of your feet is not pleasant, haha! But to be fair, my feet smell horrible as well...\" \"That's what I want to say! We continue our battle by smelling each others feet!\" \"What? That's disgusting, I can smell your reeking feet from here... But actually, I think it's a good idea! Ok, let's do it!\" \"Haha, great, prepare to be knocked out... so, should we smell each others feet or the footwear?\"</span></div></div>",

Their smelly, hot feet were revealed and they were extremely sweaty. The intense smell hit Ino hard, she wrinkled her nose and said:\"Oh my god...\" While staring at Sakuras soles. Ino thought that Sakuras feet looked really beautiful, but she never noticed that they were this large... and sweaty. \"Hehe, yes, take a good look at them... Soon, you will know how it feels like to have them on your face! Oh, by the way... I haven't washed my feet in quite some time and trained a few hours every day... Just that you know it...\" \"Urks, your feet sure smell like that... that's not fair... but how about mine?\" Ino presented her own sweaty soles to Sakura while wiggeling her toes. Sakura took a curious whiff and grimaced. \"Yuck, your feet really reek as well... what a shame, your feet look really cute... But still, you have no chance!\" Ino kept staring at Sakuras big, smelly feet. They were still sweating heavily, a few drops were dripping on the ground... \"Well... I'm not sure if we should do this-\" \"Hey, it was your idea! Take a load of these...\" Sakura interrupted here and pushed her warm, sweaty feet against Ino's unprepared face. Ino was amazad how soft and smooth Sakuras feet were... But after taking one sniff, the disgusting cheesy stench assaulted her nose and her face got drenched in Sakuras footsweat. Ino started coughing heavily, Sakura laughed and said:\"Hey, don't spit on my nice HMMMPFF!\" Ino's feet found their way to Sakuras face and started rubbing all over it. Sakura was surprised by this and took a deep sniff, the strong cheesy aroma of Ino's sweaty feet was poisoning her entire body and all the sweat on her face really grossed her out. The girls contined to smell each other sweaty, smelly feet for some minutes, both of them got weak and dizzy from the extreme stench. After 5 more minutes...</span></div></div>",

Sakuras soles actually felt soft and nice against her face but all the footsweat and the strong, cheesy stench were just torture. With every sniff, Ino's body got poisened further by Sakuras intense footsmell and Ino felt weaker and weaker. Soon, everything started to spin around her. Sakura was feeling the same thing, but Ino's feet didn't smell as bad as her own. Her face was wet with Inos smelly footsweat though, and the horrible smell made her sick. Suddenly, Sakura felt Ino's hands on her feet. She tried desperately to push them away, but was too weak to do so already. This is my chance!, Sakura though and buried Inos nose between in her toes cleaveage. Ino knew that another whiff would knock her out, she tried saying something but Sakuras sweaty sole was blocking her mouth. She hold her breath and tried removing Sakuras feet with all her remaining power. Please! Just let me give up, I can't take it anymore!, Ino thought. But Sakura showed her no mercy and pressed her feet even harder against Ino's face, pushing her nose deeper between her deadly, sweaty toes. Sakura wiggled her toes and waited. Ino's face turned purple, she tried yelling something, but it got muffled under Sakuras smelly foot. She had no choice, her body forced her to take a deep breath through her nose. Instantly, she horrible stench assaulted Ino and totally blew her mind. She saw colorfull spots dancing in her vision and everything faded to black. Between her toes, Sakuras feet stinked even stronger and Ino was forced to smell them furiously. Soon, she got knocked out by the unbareable stench. Ino's hand fell to the ground and her feet slowly slipped off from Sakuras face. Sakura took a deep breath of relatively fresh air and sighed:\"Ugh, it's finally over, I was afraid I would'nt make it... Ewww...\" Sakura whipped Ino's sweat away from her face, it still smelled strong like feet. Sakura left her reeking feet over Ino's helpless face, to make sure that she stays down. She could feet Ino breathing in her unconsciousness, right beween Sakuras horrible toes. Sakura giggled a bit and rubbed her feet over Ino's face for a few minutes. Sakura then decided to...</span></div></div>",

She removed her reeking feet from Ino's face after letting her smell between her toes for a last time and put her boots back on. Ino's face was still covered in Sakuras sweat and the heavy stench was still in the air. Sakura giggled and sat down on Ino's face. That woke Ino up pretty quick. She squirmed under Sakura and said something wich was muffled under Sakuras butt. Sakura then stood up again and helped Ino up. \"Hehe, I won! So, did you like the delicious aroma of my feet?\", Sakura teased \"You can smell then every day, if you want to!\" \"Oh god, it was so horrible... I don't want to ever be close to your feet again!\" \"Haha ok, I can understand that... Well, anyway I have won! Let's go home.\" Ino felt dizzy and weak for the rest of the day and her face stinked like feet for almost a week. Sakura on the other hand was really happy, she never thought the stench of her feet would help her win a battle someday...</span></div></div>",

Both  girl\u2019s faces started to turn blue at around the same time as the lack of oxygen seemed to finally be getting to them. Eventually, their feet were too much. Their eyes started to flutter rapidly until only their whites could be seen.  In unison, their feet slid off their opponents face and both barefoot girls flopped onto the ground in a convulsing mess. Drool started to run out of their mouths and form a little puddle in the grass as their sweaty and stinky toes splayed about wildly. Seems like this fight ended in a draw...</span></div></div>",

Ino curiously smelled her own boot and instantly turned her head away. \"Whew, I didn't know they would smell that bad... You're not gonna last very long, Sakura!\" \"Haha, just wait until you have smelled mine! I wear them every day for training and they had to take a lot of sweat today...\" Sakura moved the opening of her boot dangerously close to Ino's face. Unprepared, Ino took a little whiff and started coughing instantly. \"Haha, I told you! You have no chance!\" \"Hey, that wasn't fair now... Here, I hope you enjoy mine!\" Ino said and pressed the opening of her boot over Sakuras face. Sakura sniffed and gagged, but quickly pushed her own boot over Inos face. With their other hand, the ninja girls blocked their opponents mouth to make sure that they smell. The strong, cheesy stench was absolutely intoxicating. Both of the girls coughed and gagged wich forced them to breath even faster. Soon, they both felt dizzy and weak. With every breath, more of the cheesy, sour smell poisoned their body and they could feel how they get weaker and weaker.

Ino really didn't want to slip into unconsciousness by the cheesy stench of Sakuras boot, so she wanted to give up. But unfortunately, she was already to weak to say something, let alone pushing Sakuras hand, wich was still tightly blocking her mouth away. Everything slowly faded to black and Inos hand fell off of Sakuras mouth. Sakura though this was a trick, though and forced Ino to breath her boot in her unconsciousness for some more minutes. It was no problem for Sakura, since Ino was blacked out, she didn't have to smell her stinky boot and she wanted to make sure that Ino really was knocked out. After 10 minutes, Sakura removed her boot from Ino's face and put them back on. \"Hahaha, yeah! I knew I would defeat you!\" Sakura cheered. She then slapped Ino's face, but Ino didn't wake up yet.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Sakura, who had walked into the fight confident of her triumph, saw victory farther and farther by each new breath she took. Ino's boot was drenched in sweat, with a few drops of hot, salty and above all, dangerously smelly, perspiration falling over Sakura's face. As she coughed, she felt more warm, vinegary, rancid air passing from her adversary's shoe into her nostrils, intoxicating her body, polluting her lungs and filling her head with a feeling of dizziness, emptiness and despair. She could only watch as her hands weakened and eventually fell to either side of her attractive legs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe smell of Sakura's boot seemed to be affecting Ino likewise, but either due to the fact that hours of work in a flower shop had devitalized her sense of smell, or because her feet were simply smellier that Sakura's, she kept on pressing the foul-smelling shoe against the young ninja's face. Sakura was starting to panic, as defeat was more than certain. Her boot eventually dropped half a metre from Ino, who continued to attack Sakura with her smelly chemical weapon. She took a particularly strong whiff of Ino's foot smell, trying to get whatever precious air there still was around her. It was a fatal mistake. Sakura felt her body overrun by toxins, as if she had been bit by a hundred venomous snakes. Her lungs were tired from coughing and her brain barely functioning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing her victim starting to fall under the toll of her foot sweat, Ino carried out the coup de gr\u00e2ce. She quickly unzip her other boot and, giving less than a second for Sakura to react, compressed both of her feet, swimming in sweat and smell, over her old enemy's head. Sakura involuntarily breathed once again and it was over. Her back dropped toward the floor as her head seemingly spun in an uncontrolled manner, her eyes closed slowly and her lips mumbled something incomprehensible. The last thing she could see was Ino evil grin, before everything went black and her conscience departed to the Sleepy Land.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIno shook her fist over her head in triumph. She had passed most of her life living in Sakura's shadow, but now she had her everyday adversary at her mercy! She could already write a list of long things to do with Sakura, from having her be Ino's personal footslave for life to have her smell Ino's feet in public, the biggest humiliation a ninja could endure. But before that, she headed over to a small basin filled with water and washed her face to clean the little drops of Sakura's foot sweat. Even after cleaning, Ino could still tell that she smelled like ninja boots. As she looked into the water in the recipient a strange, devilish idea came to her mind.<br>\r\n\"An hypnotic jutsu! Of course!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore leaving the room, Ino cared to assemble both of Sakura's shoes and, transporting them as far from her nose as possible, locked it in a storeroom adjacent to the hall. Afterwards, she bounded the other female ninja's hand with a tight knot in a rope she had found lying around a few days before. Finally, she exited the room and, with an excited dexterity, open a secret compartment in the house. It was there that she kept the magic writings Tsunade had once given her as a 'welcome back' gift. She browsed through the files until she found a very small one, with a carefully drawn eye in the back. Excited, she began to study so she could relinquish her revenge.</span></div></div>",

Ino smushed her feet all over Ten Ten's face, she stuck her pinky  toe into Ten Ten's nose, assaulting her senses, and then tried to cram her big toe up in there, but did not succeed. So she just went back to slapping and poking Ten Ten's poor face with her soft yet smelly feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahh it feels so good to air out my feet, and it feels even better to finally have a footstool! Heh heh heh heh heh\" Ino giggled innocently. Sakura couldn't help but laugh as well, as she watched on with fascination at the horrendous display in front of her.</span></div></div>",

But let's ask our foot sniffer what she thinks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling, the blonde kunoichi tapped her foot against Ten Ten's cheek to get her attention. \"So Ten Ten, How do my feet smell?\" She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the poor weapon's master could do was cough in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth of her captors laughed. \"Seems she's having trouble answering.\" Ino said smiling to Sakura.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura smiled evilly.  \"Maybe she hasn't had enough of your foot odor to decide what she thinks of them.\" She suggested. \"That's probably why she's not saying anything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTen Ten\u2019s eyes opened wide<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIno grinned. \"Oh is that it?\" She asks faking an innocent expression. \"If you wanted more Ten Ten all you had to do was say so.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiggling, Ino wiggled her toes as she slowly brought her feet towards Ten Ten\u2019s face. Ten  Ten begin shaking her head vigorous much to the delight of the other girls. Using all her concentration, the weapon\u2019s expert tried her best to suppress her coughing.<br>\r\n\u201c*CAK* *CACK* P-Please,\u201d she begged. \u201cNo more!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other two girls were rolling on the floor laughing. <br>\r\n\u201cSo how does it smell?\u201d Ino asked repeating her question and giving Ten Ten\u2019s face a couple of pokes with her foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA-Awful\u201d Ten Ten whimpered. \u201cPlease stop.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou don\u2019t like it?\u201d Ino teased once again rubbing her feet against the poor kunoichi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo\u201d Ten Ten said near tears now. \u201cPlease stop.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIno smiled. \u201cYou know, Sakura I feel kind of bad for her. Maybe we should give her a break from all that foot sniffing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTen Ten looked really hopeful while Sakura looked surprised. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally?\u201d Sakura asked sounding disappointed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah.\u201d Ino said giving her a wink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura smiled knowing her best friend was up to something. \u201cIf that you want\u2026\u201d She said pretending to be reluctant about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIno looked down at Ten Ten. \u201cOk Ten Ten I\u2019ll give you a break from all that foot sniffing if you do me one little favor.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA-Anything.\u201d Ten Ten said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIno smiled. \u201cOk just kiss my feet a bit to show me how sorry you are.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTen Ten felt completely humiliated but she would do anything to avoid more barefoot odor. She begin repeatedly kissing Ino\u2019s feet just to please her. Ino and Sakura watched with amusement laughing the entire time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally after 5 minutes, Ino took her feet off of Ten Ten. \u201cOk Ten Ten, you did good. I think you deserve a break from my feet for that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTen Ten looked relieved. \u201cThank you\u201d She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIno smiled. \u201cBut I think you need something to do in the meantime just so you won\u2019t get bored\u201d She said turning to her friend. \u201cDon\u2019t you think so Sakura?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura nodded playing her part. \u201cOh definitely.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm\u201d Ino said pretending to think. \u201cHow about you smell my sandles while you\u2019re waiting?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTen Ten looked horrified. While Ino at least had to wash her feet ocasionally, she doubted that Ino ever washed her sandals \u201cBut you said\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour not smelling me feet\u2026you\u2019re smelling  my sandals silly.\u201d Ino said grinning evilly.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTen Ten felt like she was about to cry as Ino brought the opening of her sandals over Ten Ten\u2019s face forcing her to wear a mask she didn\u2019t want to wear.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nThe weapons expert began sobbing as the odor of footsweat and leather hit her hard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nwhat happens now?</span></div></div>",

You're the one with the dark nylons and knee high boots! If anyones feet around her smells, it's yours!\" This made Chun-Li have an idea, \"Say Cammy, lets have a bet... We will still have our normal battle, but this time instead of the loser having to buy the dinner, the loser must smell the others feet!\" Cammy couldn't believe what she was hearing! \"Smelling Chun-Li's feet would be the worst punishment I can think of!\" she thought to herself. \"But then again... her smelling mine would be just as bad...\" After only a few seconds of thought, Cammy agreed. \"Alright then!\" Chun-Li shouted, \"Lets fight!\"</span></div></div>",

Chun-Li tried to struggle to move but couldn't, she was still very much in pain from the Spiral Arrow she had received from those boots to the chest; she had no breath nor movement left in her. Cammy took off both boots and peeled off her sweaty socks. \"Whoa!\" Cammy exclaimed, \"I bet these could knock someone out cold!\" The smell was overbearing almost to Cammy, and they were a good 4-5ft away from her! \"Well! A deal is a deal! Enjoy Chun-Li!\" Cammy sung as she slowly lowered her sweaty, stinky feet onto Chun-Li's face. The smell immediately hit her from the moment they touched her face; the sweaty didn't help at all, as it almost made Cammy's feet cling to her face like a gasmask only the gas was ment to stay in, not out. Cammy nestled Chun-Li's nose into her toes and slightly spread them out, just so the smell would be rushed into her nose as she breathed. As much as Chun-Li wanted to breathe, this isn't what she wanted; she was forced to inhale the terrible smell of Cammy's feet. It smelled very potent, extremely powerful that could be a weapon used by S.I.N. to control the world! As she labored to breathe, she seemed to grow weaker and weaker. She tried to grasp the right foot with her right hand, but instead had her right arm pinned by Cammy's right foot, \"Ah, ah, ah! That's cheating!\" She then grabbed Chun-Li's left arm and planted her left foot right over her nose and mouth, \"I think you've been awake long enough!\" She slightly pinched Chun-Li's nose enough to not get enough oxygen, but open enough to where she could still smell her feet. Chun-Li tried to thrash about but to no avail. With every hard-earned breath she took, she only inhaled more and more of Cammy's foot smell. Her eyes were slowly fluttering with every breath, each flutter accompanied by a slight head shake; it was almost like she was dreaming and was hoping she would wake up. But this was no dream, Cammy was indeed smothering her best friend and companion with her powerful british feet. Chun-Li slowly struggled less and less as her eyes slowly shut and her breathing was no longer labored but slow and systematic. Cammy kept her foot on Chun-Li's face for a few minutes longer, but wasn't smothering her; she removed her toes from the nose-lock she had on her and instead just had them rested on her nose. The picture perfect moment of Chun-Li unconcious under Cammy's foot was too good to pass up and Cammy took a quick picture using her hidden camera as a memory.</span></div></div>",

I'll tear you apart!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMai laughed, \"In your dreams, I bet your a dyke just like Cammy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChun-Li stalked toward her rival ready to pound her.  Mai smirked at her, \"What do you say Chun-Li put up or shut up.  We fight one on one, winner gets to own the loser for the rest of the day.  Be her total and utter slave.\"  Chun-Li paused, she finally realized the trap that Mai was trying to put her in.  She had just fought twice she was probably winded - it might be best to postpone the fight or not have it all together.  But then again there was her pride...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoes Chun-Li agree to the terms?  </span></div></div>",

But, I don't need anymore right now.\"  Said Tsunade.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok.\"  Said Shizune as her put the tea on the desk. \" My...today is so slow, huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, it so quit, I just can't stand it.\"  Said Tsunade as she put her head back on the chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, there haven't been no missions in the last 3 days, there no problems in the village, and you got finsh with your paperworks again.\"  Said Shizune.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, it wasn't that much today.  I'm so bored today.\"  Said Tsunade.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, me too.\"  Said Shizune.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, Tsunade just have a idea.  She just remember a game that Shizune and Tsunade play when they was on the road together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shizune, do you remember the time, when play that game together?\"  Asked Tsunade.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my gosh, it been like forever.\"  Smiled Shizune as she hold the small table to her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, would you like to play it again?\"  Asked Tsunade as she put her head up and look at Shizune.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know, Lady Tsunade.  What if something happen?  Or if there some more paperworks coming in today?\"  Asked Shizune.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shizune, you worry to much.  It a slow day, all the paperworks is finsh for today.  We need to take this day before it to late.\"  Said Tsunade.  \"But if you not up to it, I understand.  I guess you might be afriad to lose to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, really?!  Who the one who won the last time we play?\"  Said Shizune as she smile, pointing thump up on herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, so you in?\"  Said Tsunade, smiling at Shizune.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, let do it!\"  Said Shizune as she smile back at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok.  Now first, we need a judge for this.  Anyones have in mind, Shizune?\"  Asked Tsunade.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know.  Hey, Tonton.  Would you like to be the judge for us?\"  Smiled Shizune.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTonton's eyes widing as what Lady Tsunade and Shizune was talking about.  Tonton waste no time leaving the office.  Tonton run to the opening door in full-speed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, There go our judge.\"  Said Shizune with one hand on her hip and one hand on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, Shizune.  I got someone who can be our judge for today.\"  Said Tsunade as she smile with a wicked look on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n25 minutes later...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"KNOCK, KNOCK!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enter.\"  Said Tsunade.</span></div></div>",

Business went about in the walled-in city, Reggie tended to his Pokemon, and the Veilstone Gym Leader was rather enjoying another tough training regiment with her Fighting-types in the open field nearby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaylene was training with her Lucario on hand-to-hand combat with her Meditite and Machoke training seperately from them, continuing to improve their strength and power to provide much more of a challenge to an outsider competing in the Sinnoh League. The sparing match between Meditite and Machoke came to a finish; the one between Maylene and Lucario had just gotten started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's just as you wanted, Lucario!\" Maylene yelled, sending a barrage of swift jabs at her eager Lucario. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucario growled in satisfaction from watching Maylene's performance in battles improve greatly since her match against Ash. Lucario knocked away her fists, throwing in his own punches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaylene backflipped away from him, turning on her foot against the bare grass and dirt and sending a rolling kick, to which Lucario grabbed. She gasped as Lucario flipped her off balance as he began a Bone Rush attack with his aura bone pole. Maylene quickly leapt off her hands, evading Lucario's strikes each time. Lucario then carelessly dove forward as she leapt high in the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gotcha!\" Maylene exclaimed, extending her leg forward at the shocked Pokemon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucario looked up; his face was at the receiving end of her dirt-stained foot. It did not take his aura senses to immediately see the fruits of Maylene's tough, physical labor from one foot. For a young girl her age, her soles were slightly roughened since she still considered hygiene to be important in everyday life. She hadn't washed or took care of her feet as of yet today as the potent aroma struck Lucario's gut harder than Machoke's punches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer youth provided much sweat to her healthy body, and her healthy feet were very smelly. Unfortunately for Lucario's sense of smell, Maylene's sole powdered in earthly dirt did not really help him at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rah,\" Lucario gasped, falling backwards onto the ground, struggling to breath after the risky encounter with Maylene's foot. Meditite and Machoke immediatle ran to his assistance. Maylene was flushed bright red in embarrassment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, my gosh! I... I did not intend to beat you like that!\" Maylene apologized. Lucario had passed out from the smell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohh,\" Lucario groaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I may specialize in Fighting-type Pokemon, but I'm still a girl!\" Maylened pouted, looking at her own two bare feet. \"As cute as they look outside, they're cursed to be stinky after such hard battles, which is why I have Connelly hand out the Cobble Badge when battles get too rough... Ohh!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaylene ran off with her Pokemon dragging Lucario behind. That is until... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

Machoke!\" Machoke shouted quickly, forcing it and Meditite to pick up the pace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaylene trailed behind, panting and fatigued from today's earlier training. She paused to catch her breath, only watching her only three Pokemon with her take off in a dusty flash into Veilstone City. Not even Reggie's Staraptor could match their speed when threatening motivation loomed in their minds...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait! Slow down!\" Maylene yelled, taking in short breaths. She knew their reason for fleeing, but she had no idea it was that dire. \"Guys... I'd never do anything like that on purpose... I'm sorry...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaylene sat down on the grass, cross-legged. She was exhausted, not just from the training and sprinting, but she felt a bit downhearted about her poor foot hygiene.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi, Maylene!\" a perky voice shouted. Maylene did not flinch, too tired to even notice. She turned her hip and discovered Dawn standing behind her, alone and smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dawn,\" she said, standing back on her feet to greet her with a friendly grin. \"What brings you back here to Veilstone? And where are Ash and Brock?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, they're at the Veilstone Pokemon Center! We're meeting Reggie about a situation between him and his rude brother, Paul,\" Dawn explain. Maylene frowned at the name of the latter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it this time with Paul?\" Maylene asked, concerned. \"I can tell it's up to no good if Paul's in a situation.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's what we're here for,\" Dawn replied. \"You are over losing to him, right?\" Maylene nodded, smiling innocently to show she had no problems. \"Anyway, aside from that, I saw your Pokemon sprinting away from you towards the Pokemon Center. They looked scared...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaylene giggled sheepishly, slowly looking away in embarrassment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...,\" Maylene began, \"Lucario and I were training as usual and... um, we had a little accident.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is Lucario alright?!\" Dawn gasped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh! Don't worry!\" Maylene assured, settling Dawn down. \"Lucario had no injuries. It's just... something else.\" Maylene blushed bright red in mortification, unable to convey her smelly secret to Dawn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it?\" Dawn asked kindly. \"You can tell me. We're friends!\" She was right. Maylene thought about it, hoping she would have nothing else left to lose by telling Dawn about her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, one indirect kick overwhelmed all of Lucario's senses,\" Maylene mumbled through her teeth, tapping her fingers together. Dawn was confused, tilting her head to the side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry?\" Dawn said, not havin understood properly. Maylene couldn't take it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh... Here!\" Maylene cried, extending her leg up, her foot directed towards Dawn's face. Dawn stepped back on reflex from the false kick. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDawn's eyes widened from both sight and smell. The bottoms of Maylene's sole and toes were slightly coated in earthly brown. Maylene's foot had a powerful scent of fresh dirt and sweat, strong enough to send signals to her brain that screamed \"GET THE HELL AWAY FROM THAT STINKY FOOT!!!\" Maylene's surprising secret knocked Dawn off her feet and onto her soft bottom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! EWW!!\" Dawn cried, rubbing her nostrils with her arm. Maylene retracted her foot back in shame. \"What was that for?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry!\" Maylene cried, cringing like a scared Growlithe. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDawn realized her mistake of scolding, but something in her mind told her that she could not let Maylene get away with this. She could either remain cool or make Maylene pay for having been shown her smelly secret instead of simply using words. Maylene could have said something instead for a visual, or nasal, aid...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    </span></div></div>",

She pulled open the doors quietly, and began to survey the inside of the building. \"Maylene is in for it big time... I don't think my feet have ever been this sweaty... Now, now, how to exact my vengence...\" She said to herself. Dawn's face lit up as she noticed all those punching bags - each suspended by a long, thick rope. She pulled out her Pachirisu's Pokeball, and tossed it into the air. <br>\r\n  \"Pachi! Pachi!\" The squirrel-like Pokemon exclaimed.<br>\r\n  \"Be quiet, Pachirisu! I need you to cut those ropes keeping the punching bags suspended in the air, okay?\" Dawn whispered. The small Pokemon nodded its head happily, and went to work. In under ten minutes, Pachirisu had cut enough rope to fully bind a Machamp. \"Thanks, Pachirisu!\" Dawn smiled, recalling the Pokemon. She picked up all the thick thread, and bundled it in her backpack. Dawn strolled out of the building, and saw Maylene shuffling her feet with her back turned towards her-soon-to-be worst nightmare. Dawn crept up silently, pulling off her over-worn boot as she got closer. Before Maylene could say \"Pichu!\", Dawn had clamped the opening to her boot over Maylene's nose, and had secured it so well, that the barefoot fighting genius couldn't even manage to free herself the tiniest bit. Within moments, the pink haired girl had slipped into unconciousness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Two hours later...<br>\r\n  \"Wh-where am I?\" Maylene asked, fear running through her mind.<br>\r\n  \"You're where you're supposed to be, and where you will be for a long, long, time... MY FEET!\" Dawn, who was standing barefoot, (her boots and socks in the corner). \"Now, what to make you do first...\"</span></div></div>",

Why are you --- MPPPHHH!\u201d Maylene was cut off by Dawn shoving her unwashed, sweat-stained, rancid sock into her mouth. The second the filthy sock touched Maylene\u2019s tongue, the pink-haired girl began bucking wildly, trying to break free from the thick ropes tying her down. She began to attempt to spit out the nasty socks, but Dawn quickly stopped her from doing so by slamming her sweaty, dirty foot against her face.<br>\r\n\t\u201cThis is revenge, Maylene. It must really suck to be you right now, I haven\u2019t washed my feet since I joined Ash on his journey. Oh! Let\u2019s see how many steps I\u2019ve taken\u2026\u201d Dawn taunted, pressing a few buttons on her Poketech. \u201cOH MY GOD! NASTY! UGH! I\u2019ve walked:  77,985,450 steps since I got this app! And, I haven\u2019t changed my socks, boots, or even washed my feet since!\u201d<br>\r\n\tMaylene, unable to talk, could only suck on the sweaty socks, and hope Dawn would change her mind. \u201cAlright, let\u2019s get on with it,\u201d Dawn grinned, placing both of her bare feet over the poor girl\u2019s face. The second Dawn\u2019s feet reached within ten inches of Maylene\u2019s face, a smell like none other the Gym leader had ever witnessed before overtook her senses. The smell was so vile, it was a stale, cheesy, vinegar-like scent that burned at the girl\u2019s nose. Immediately the Gym Leader was forced into a fit of coughing.<br>\r\n\t\u201cWHEW! My feet have NEVER smelled this bad before! I can smell them from here!\u201d  Dawn teased, waving her hand in front of her nose. Tears began to form in the corner of Maylene\u2019s eyes. With a final try, Maylene managed to spit the rancid sock out onto the ground, and shake the pair of filthy feet off of her face.<br>\r\n\t\u201cPLEASE! DAWN! NO MORE! PLEASE! I\u2019M SORRY! I\u2019LL DO ANYTHING, JUST PLEASE DON\u2019T PUT THAT SOCK BACK! PLEASE!\u201d Maylene screamed.<br>\r\n\t\u201cOkay, I won\u2019t,\u201d Dawn replied, grabbing her other sock from inside of her sweat-soaked boots. \u201cI\u2019ll put this one in!\u201d And, unfortunately for Maylene, Dawn was a lady of her word. The other sock went out, but another one went in, and this one was fresh and full of foot sweat.  Dawn lifted her feet, and planted them right back on the girl\u2019s face.<br>\r\n\t\u201cI\u2019ll give you a choice. You can sniff my feet as hard as you can and as fast as you can for twenty minutes, or you can sniff them for the next four hours. Now, for the first option, just sniff as deeply as you can. For the second, you can just nod your head, it\u2019s your choice,\u201d Dawn said happily.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Maylene saw dawn with hope in her eyes waiting to hear that it was all just, a joke a little payback for getting her ungaurded with her feet, that she won't have to smell dawn's nasty feet. But that didn't happen dawn kept smiling looking down at her waiting for the decision. Maylene had to think fast this wasn't a joke And it was obvious dawn wasn't fucking around she had to decided if she smell her feet as hard as she could then she'll surley pass out, and she was sure dawn would give her another chance. On the other hand if she smell for 4 hours it would be long tedius hours with nothing to do, but smell those wicked feet. Still she would just have to breath normaly she was sure she could take that the hard sniffing not so much. \"Hey I have you enough time to decide tell me which one it is or I'll put you through both.\" After saying this dawn started tapping her toes in maylene's forehaed. Maylene looked up to dawn and gave a little nod. \"Yay! We are going to have so much fun just let me bring some stuff so I don't get bored kay? Alright Now don't move.\" As she said that she got up and put her boots back on this time with no socks with that maylene was left alone in the dark thinking of the hard hours that would follow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey are you ready for my footseis little maylene?\" Maylene just watch as dawn put a chair a pile of magazines, And some manuals full with trainer tips. \"You know I wanted you to choose this there's so many things I wanted to read, And maybe when this is over your face will smell like my feet that would be great.\" Maylene open her eyes wide she couldn't go around with her face smelling like feet. \"Imagine it every room you enter everyone will smell it soon they'll found out where the smell is coming from everybody will probably ask you to leave soon enough everyone will know you as the foot girl.\" Dawn left out a big cruel laughter at maylene's dispear as maylene's eyes started to watered. why?! what has she done to dawn to deserve this?! What has she ever done to anyone to deserve this?! \"Well whatever let's get started little foot girl.\" Maylene closed her eyes as dawn got out of her boots And put both of her feet onto her face, and as that familiar scent attacked her nose. \"I hope you like it down there cuase your staying there for a looong time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDawn's feet weren't smellier than before (maylene actually doubt they could smell worse than before), but they were sweatier in te way that they feel moist actually maylene's face was actually getting wet just being in contact with dawn's feet that time in the boot was really mortal. The first hour dawn move her feet out of maylene's eyes for her to glance and giggle, but after that she stop paying atetion to her except for the ocasional foot shift. At the third hour the smell started to over power maylene even if it was little by little the smell was making as much damage as if she was sniffing as hard as she could she started feeling light headed and had stop vomit more than once the worst was beacuse of lack of movement their body heat started to make dawn's feet sweat so her feet never stop smelling  which means no rest for maylene's poor nose, but finally dawn took her feet away from maylene's face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you liked it?!\" Maylene noded lightly with all the strength she had left. \"Great!! I'm glad you like it! How bout you spit that sock and tell me how much you Love my feet, and how cute they are.\" Maylene spit the sock was dawn serious how was she suppose to lie like that, but before she could think of something maylene was force to look up by dawn's hands forcing her to look up at her face. \"and you better convice me alright?\" Dawn said this with a wicked smile on her face. Can maylene make it out alright?!</span></div></div>",

The harsh sun beat on their body. Their faces drenched in sweat, but neither wanted to lose the battle as their pride wouldn't allow it. So they just struggled and fought, until they both didn't have any fight in them left. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cLooks like your friends left you here all alone, to be captured by me,\" Azula smugly told Toph. But Toph was hearing none of that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cIf anything you're in a position.\" This intrigued Azula.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cHow so, oh wise blind prophet.\" Toph snickered a bit at her 'title'. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYou are surrounded by earth of which I am a bender of.\" Toph told the fire princess. Azula snarled but then regained her composure. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cWell to speed our little fight along. I propose a competition. If I win, which I'm sure I will, you willingly come along and be the fire nation's prisoner. However in the off chance I do lose, I'll stop chasing you and your gang forever. That means if I see you and your group doesn't engage first, I won't attack. Just pretend like I didn't see you. That seems like a fair competition to me. I'll even allow you chose what kind of competition we do.\" Azula grinned while telling Toph all this. Toph herself seemed to genuinely be thinking about the offer. She paced back and forth all the while taking quick glances at Azula. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYou're on,\" Toph finally agreed. \u201cThe competition we will do is called Foot Smell,\" she shouted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Azula facepalmed. \u201cWhat is that, you little brat.\" Toph then grinned at the poor poor Azula. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cIt's really simple. All we do is smell each other's feet and whomever loses consciousness first is the loser. Deal?\" Toph explained. Azula was apprehensive to say the least, maybe not worried, because only the uninformed used that word, yet she had this gut feeling something was off. This wasn't the type of competition she was expecting but she couldn't back out now, she told Toph she could choose the competition. And anything less was disgraceful. And she was all about grace. \u201cDeal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzula thought for sure she would win. Her feet were always extremely sweaty and stinky while inside her size 9 boots that she loved dearly. Her feet roasted not this boots. It didn't help that for the past hour her and Toph had been fighting in the blistering Sun. Even as they fought she could hear the audible squish of her feet.  When she was younger she used to torture criminals and even Mai, Zuko, and Ty Lee. They would beg her to put her boots back on after training. Once she even made Zuko pass out by only passing her barefoot throughout his vicinity. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLikewise, Toph thought she would easily win this competition. She always walked around with nothing on her soles, so her soles were probably filthy, but Azula wouldn't know that until Toph pressed her soles against the fire princess's face. She smirked at that thought. She quickly remembered when she and Soka were out together and Soka had asked to rest for a bit. He had sat on the ground while Toph being an earthbender, made herself a chair to sit on, with a matching stool. Now Soka the ever curious one, decided to take it upon himself to sniff her feet. Well to say the least, he quickly passed out and Toph had to carry him all the way back to camp. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow these two stench warriors, faced each other and sat down on the ground. Azula began to unbuckle her heavy combat boots, while Toph just waited. Once Azula finished  a rancid smell filled the nearby area. Tooth could tell Azula's feet weren't just sweating. They were heavily damp. Droplets of stinky water poured off her feet. Azula sighed. \u201cIts nice to take those off,\" as she wiggled her noxious toes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToph then her lifted feet up showing them off. Azula was visibly taken back. Toph's feet were covered in a heavy coat of dirt. Every adjective that could come to mind, dirty, grimy, filthy, and foul, did no true justice to what was before Azula. Not to mention, they had <i>bugs</i> on them. Azula couldn't believe her eyes. These feet were going to touch her face. Azula paled. Toph snickered knowing what was going through Azula's mind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou can give up now if you're not up to the challenge.\" Toph taunted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzula gritted her teeth. This would be a hard battle. \u201cI would never give up to suck like you. \" She defiantly roared back.  \u201cOh well, I tried to save you from embarrassment.\" Toph responded. They then grew deadly silent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir feet rushed toward each other's face. Azula's sweaty feet versus Toph's dirty feet. Since Azula was a little taller, her feet touched Toph first. The smell assailed her nose. Burning her nose and lungs. Azula's humid feet kept Toph's face moist. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nToph's feet then reached Azula's face. Toph's feet carried the stench off 5 wet bison. And it slapped Azula around. Toph rubbed her feet into Azula's face smearing it with dirt and bugs. It poisoned her whole body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis carries on until....</span></div></div>",

Taking off a heavy coat, she tapped a bit of soil from her boots before she scanned the office around her, finding Asami sitting at a small desk at the far end of the room. Her head seemed to drop as the door closed behind Korra, and the Avatar gave a small, curious cock of the head, uncertain if she was hiding from someone or not.<br>\r\n\"Asami? Working late, I see?\" she spoke boldly, uncertain if she was heard.<br>\r\nAsami was always jealous of Korra since their meeting. The Avatar commanded such respect and power, and being a non-bender herself, she always chaffed at toiling in the shadow of her more capable partner. But for many weeks now, Asami had been scheming of a way to gain the upper-hand over Korra, and knowing the girl's hatred for foot odor and feet generally, she hoped to end the rivalry with Korra once and for all tonight. Putting on a gentle smile, she craned her neck to her friend, speaking softly.<br>\r\n\"Only a little...I think I'm just about finished here,\" Asami spoke with a small smile, nodding a bit as she put her pencil down on the desk. Korra seemed to ignore her as she walked around the office, toying with baubles and looking through papers. Asami narrowed her eyes at the girl's disinterest and cleared her throat to speak once more.<br>\r\n\"Korra? Could you help me with something? I think I may have twisted my ankle...\" Asami spoke with a wince, rubbing her fake injury. \"I heard you water-benders have a way with circulation...I know it's a lot to ask, but could you just take a look?\"<br>\r\nKorra's lips creased as she looked over at Asami. 'Ugh...feet...' she muttered. Swallowing audibly, she nonetheless put on a jovial expression, striding over confidently. \"Well, I don't know much, but I suppose I can have a look...\"<br>\r\nAsami began to unbutton her spats lovingly before she slide them and her short boot from her foot. As Korra approached, Asami already saw the rather unpleasant expression gracing her 'friend's' face. Blinking innocently as the last of the boot slide across her red-painted toe nails, she gave Korra a slight nod.<br>\r\n\"Sorry about this...and the smell...girl has to make a living and I don't think the people here would appreciate me walking barefoot. But I appreciate you doing this, Korra...\" she spoke almost cooing to Korra as she hoisted her foot up slightly, wiggling her toes almost involuntarily. Korra looked around the room, ensuring she wouldn't be spied upon by an other co-workers before kneeling down next to Asami's foot and taking the soft thing into her hand. </span></div></div>",

Least of all did anyone expect the eighty-four year old woman to become fourteen years old again. Avatar Korra was shocked by the news but after a talk with the spirit of Avatar Aang,she learned that effect would only last three months and Katara would revert to normal soon after. Katara herself however,was thrilled!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had never had a real childhood growing up,having been forced to perform the tasks of her deceased mother while her brother goofed off all day. The fact that she then had to fight a war didn't help. Now that she had her youth back, Katara was going to live it up. She spent the next two months in Republic City with Korra,hanging out,pulling pranks, and playing with her grandkids in ways she never could. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne night, she and Korra were in the middle of a game of Dare, trying to top each other in crazy challenges. Both girls were deep in thought over something that would cause the other to give up and win the game for them. After about an hour, they each had an idea they were sure would terrify the other. \"I DARE YOU TO SMELL MY FEET!!!\" Both girls realized they had said the exact same thing and burst out laughing. \"Come on Katara, give me a challenge at least. Your feet will be no problem for me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatara stopped laughing. \"Hey, I'll have you know my feet are pretty nasty, even worse than my brother's and that's saying something!\" Korra frowned. \"Come on Katara, everyone knows I have the stinkiest,nastiest feet in the whole Water Tribe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha! Your feet are nothing compared to mine!\" Katara scoffed. \"Is that a challenge?\"  \"What if it is?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKorra sneered. \"Fine, in one week,we have a smelly feet contest. You can use the use the time to stink up your feet and whoever passed out first loses!\" \"Deal\" Katara said with a glare.</span></div></div>",

Master Katara was visiting the Northern Water Tribe on request from a friend when she accidentally fell in the mystical Spirit Oasis. Everyone knew the water had magical properties but no one had suspected that the eighty- four year old woman would be turned back into a fourteen year old girl, the same age she had been during the Hundred Year War!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChief Unlaq summoned Avatar Korra,his neice, up North when he learned the news. Korra was shocked but after conferring with the spirit of Avatar Aang, Katara's late husband, she learned the effect was only temporary and would only last another month at most. Katara would just have to deal with it until then.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe master water bender was thrilled with the turn of events however. She had never had a real childhood growing up and planned to spend the next month making up for lost time. The Order of the White Lotus had other plans however. They believed Katara was too vulnerable in her now youthful form and made plans to \"keep her safe\" like they had with Korra by locking her in the second compound they had created just in case Aang's successor was born in the Northern Tribe. Katara was forced to comply but Korra agreed to serve out the exile with her mentor and friend to keep her company. This had all been a week ago and the two had spent their time sparring, hanging out,goofing off, and playing pranks on the sentries assigned to guard them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice match Korra\" a sweaty Katara told her former pupil as they completed their latest spar \"you can certainly still give me a workout.\"  \"You too\" an equally sweaty Avatar complimented \"your water bending is strong as ever. What do you want to do now?\" Katara thought for a moment. They weren't allowed to leave the compound for even a moment and security was too tight to try sneaking out. \"Want to see who can eat the most sea prunes?\"  \"Ugh, those things are gross! How about a belching contest?\" \"Definitely\" Katara chuckled \"but not right now. I want to do something wild and wacky, something so crazy nobody will belive I did it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKorra thought for a moment then a smirk crossed her face. \"Okay then, I challenge you to a smelly feet contest. Whoever passes out first loses\". Katara stared blankly at the Avatar for a moment then burst out laughing. \"Oh man, that's perfect! Whoever wins will have the undisputed smelliest feet in all the Water Tribes! Just try not to take losing too hard.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKorra scoffed. \"Dream on old lady!\"   \"I'm younger than you now, whipper snapper. How do we do this?   </span></div></div>",

His socks alone could make YOU beg for mercy though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter this bit of smack talk, the contest began as Korra thrust her foot into Katara's face. The older Avatar then leaned forward to allow the younger girl to do the same. It was an odd sight to say the least.<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes of sniffing Korra's very powerful foot odor, Katara almost turned green. Sokka's feet were nothing like this! Korra was also resisting the urge to gag at her mentor/friend's foot fumes. Both were stubborn however and refused to give in. Who would be the victor in this duel of wills? </span></div></div>",

She sat down and began working one of her boots off,  peeling off a sweaty sock soon after. She tentatively took a sniff and retched at the smell.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was another mediocre, but still spooky day at Hotel Transylvania. Mavis Dracula and her small family had decided to stay for a while with no particular direction in traveling as of yet. That is something they wanted to figure out in order to move on from here. Somehow, Mavis was left in her room with her only and little son, Dennis. Her husband, Johnny, was off doing his own thing. The rest of her family was busy entertaining various monsters and human guests.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, she didn't really mind being alone with her son. Far from it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe loved Dennis and only wants what is best for him. Even though he had shown his hidden vampiric abilities that he inherited from her side of the family, he still kept his adorable human form most of the time. Even that little werewolf girl, Winnie, is still fond of him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow cute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMavis couldn't help but feel a little proud that her son was already attracting members of the opposite gender, in regards to those close to his age. Of course, he would need to be steered in the right direction as to have him not take advantage of girls' emotions, but that would be a talk for many years to come. And certainly, a lot can happen by then.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoving the story along, she sat in a comfy chair while watching Dennis entertain himself with typical human toys. At the meantime, she amused herself with a smartphone, a gift from her parents-in-law. She didn't mind having to get on with the times and found the Internet to be quite the wondrous landscape despite having learned through it that her father nearly endangered her son's life. She even found a site where people around the world upload random videos. At this time, she had decided to look up videos that depicted activities between mothers and sons, hoping to find additional ideas to spend time with Dennis while Johnny was out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few videos that were at the top of her search were titled similarly as \"Getting My Son to Smell Mommy's Stinky Feet.\" At first glance, she was a bit appalled at the idea that mothers were making their children smell their stinky feet. She wanted to get off the page and rid herself of such perverse thoughts, but she still couldn't help but wonder what did go on in those videos. Clicking on one of them, Mavis found that it was not as bad as she originally perceived. There was much laughter between the participants, including the cameraman who happened to be the father. The child in the video did not appear any older than Dennis. The mother in the video just made playful noises while placing her feet by her little son's face, who doesn't seem to know any better and still continued sniffing her toes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMavis wasn't sure what to think right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPart of her was tempted to try this out with Dennis now. But would he be willing to go through with it? If Johnny were to find out, what would he think? What about the rest of her family and their friends? And especially, did her feet have a strong and possible unpleasant scent?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked down from her chair. She only had her striped tights on, no Converses. They were actually at the side of her chair. She noted that she had those shoes nearly forever despite them still appearing in good condition. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Do they also smell?</i> Mavis pondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe flexed her toes and saw them stretch out a bit. Mavis could feel that her feet were particularly warm and slightly wet from her own sweat, only because she had those tights on for a long time. She then wondered when was the last time she also washed them. She moved those thoughts to the side to see Dennis still preoccupied with his toys.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, it was time to test out these human activities.   </span></div></div>",

From her fat little potbelly to her slimy lips and nasty smile(not to mention her breath) she was the object of everyone's desire. But by far the most beautiful thing about her was her utterly cheesy, smelly feet. They stunk so bad that even fans of foul feet thought they were too much. But she loved it. Every time she was sad or angry she'd take a whiff of the vinegary scent that wafted off her footsoles and smiled. Nobody could compete with her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr so she thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey loser!\" She barked, looking up from her magazine. She was getting a talon sharpening on her toes by one of her faithful koopa servants, but the poor koopa could barely stay conscious from the stink wafting off her feet. She wiggled her toes and poked him in the eye with a pointy claw to make sure he stayed focused, \"You be careful down there. Don't you nick my feet or my daddy will bite your head right off! You hear me! You're dealing with the best feet in all of the Koopa Kingdom, you treat them with respect!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe koopa weakly nodded and tried not to throw up. The workers at \"La Fromage\" foot spa were used to rotten and smelly toes, but even their most experienced workers dreaded when Wendy showed up for a talon polishing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Weh weh weh weh!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" Wendy looked up from her magazine again. It was Birdo, the local fashion queen, no doubt her for a foot scrubbing herself. She was notoriously \"beautiful\" around the koopas and her foot odor was something to behold. Some rumored it was even as foul as Wendy's. Of course WENDY would make anyone who said that lick her toejam if she heard them saying that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aren't you cute?\" Birdo said, covering her snout in a ladylike way as she laughed, \"Best feet? Is that what you think? You really shouldn't talk so big, especially when you're in the presence of the kingdom's REAL best feet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBirdo put up her feet next to Wendy's to show off how filthy and smelly they were. The poor Koopa pedicurist was so overwhelmed by the combination of smells that he passed right out. Wendy was steaming now, her face glowing red. She tore her magazine in half and leaped up from her seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-you CHARLETON! How dare you walk in and talk about your stupid, ugly, PINK feet like they're better than mine? You looking for a fight?!? Huh?!?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Weh weh weh weh!\" Birdo laughed her nasty laugh again, \"I think that's exactly what I'm looking for Darling! If your feet are so rotten, why not wager against mine? The loser has to lick the winner's soles!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, I'll wager against you, but when you lose you won't just lick my soles! You'll lick my soles, tongue clean every sock I wear AND tell the entire Kingdom how much you love the smell and taste of my putrid feet!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Weh weh! And when <i>I</i> win you'll do the exact same for me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"DEAL! So how're we gonna do this?\"</span></div></div>",

He was about to cry from sheer misery.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! He's up!\" Wendy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can see that, darling,\" Added Birdo, \"Hello sweetie! I bet you're wondering where you are.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe koopa looked around him: stone walls, torches, chains and his body seemed to be hooked in a floor-level stockade. He was in one of Bowser's dungeons! He struggled, but he knew that there would be no escape until he was released by these awful, stinkfooted women. And that would only be once they had completely annihilated his nostrils.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"P-please\" He started to say, but Wendy cut him off,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen up, sniveling slave! Here's what you're gonna do: You're gonna sit there like a good loser and sniff both our feet and decide which one of us is the stinkiest. Of course, that's gonna be me, but you're gonna humor this ugly hag and make her feel good before you shatter her dreams and tell her that I'm the prettiest with the smelliest feet!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And,\" Birdo chimed in, \"You're going to wear this blindfold,\" She wrapped a cloth blindfold around his face, \"so that way you can't play favorites and you have to pick honestly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh, as if that matters.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh?

Then, she nodded to Wendy and the two went to the back rooms. There were several massage rooms back there that were perfect for privacy needs, so the two merely found an unoccupied one and locked the door behind them. The massage room had dimmed lighting and a large chair for getting foot massages, perfect for their contest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, how do we decide who has to sniff first?\" Birdo asked, \"Perhaps we flip a coin?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NO!
