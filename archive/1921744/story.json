He's carrying far too many books. You also see three local bullies bearing down on him on their skateboards. Before you can shout out a warning or even move, they've knocked the guy down. His books are scattered on the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou run across the street to help the guy - you've been a victim of those three before. When the last of his books are picked up, the guy smiles at you. You notice that he looks different - his eyes are an odd yellow-green and his brown hair has odd, darker stripes in it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Thank you so much,\" he says, in a voice that is almost a purr. Suddenly his books disappear, and he seems bigger. You feel confused... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" says the man, reading your mind, \"I am a magical practitioner. You deserve a reward for helping me like that.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn his hands appear two grey objects. One looks like a lump of artist's clay, and the other has polished facets as if it were a very dull gemstone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This\" he says, holding up the clay mass \"will let you get as big, as fat as you desire. No limits, no health problems.  And this\" he says, holding the gem, \"will allow you to become as muscular as you want, more than you have ever dreamed, stronger than anyone else. You can even have them both, but I should warn you, that there may be side effects to your use of them.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTotally big?  As fat as you can imagine?  Or more muscular than your dreams?  Boy, have your dreams come true?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat could the side effects be? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd do you even care? <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The effects tend to vary on who uses them, but as a male, you will start grow hairier. You won't turn into an animal, but you may become covered with hair.  A few people have noticed itching, and some people developed strange allergies or dislikes.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNothing else? Nothing, dangerous?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, if you ask for extreme things, you'll notice other changes \u2013 extreme fat or muscle may make you grow wider or taller or thicker.

Can I change back?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, if you want I can turn you back to your current state. So far no one has ever asked me to, though.Also, the changes may change as your get older \u2013 or if you don't use them.  If you don't use the muscles, they'll shrink.

And the driver seems plenty cool too!<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cIf you\u2019re looking for a good feed, I\u2019d recommend the \u2018Siberian Mammoth\u2019,\u201d says the bus driver without looking back.  \u201cIt\u2019s got a great selection, and we should be there in about ten minutes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe driver stops right in front of the \u2018Siberian Mammoth\u2019 to let you off.  You slowly walk out the door, savouring the feeling of your newly fattened stomach and chest bouncing as you step down from the bus.  As you head across the parking lot towards the buffet, though, you suddenly notice a delicious smell of cooking, and your gigantic gut suddenly gurgles and rumbles loudly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019d better get that monster fed,\u201d says Alex, zipping ahead of you to open the door.  As you get to the door, a buxom waitress appears, and smiles broadly as your huge form fills the doorway. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTwo for the buffet?\u201d she asks, then turns and leads you to a spot near the steam tables.  It\u2019s a modified booth, with a bench on one side for Alex, and a huge, sturdy, armless chair on the other side for you.  \u201cWhat would you like to drink?\u201d she asks, as you rumble up to the table.  \u201cWe have pepsi, milk, rootbeer, sprite, juices, Russian birch beer, milkshakes, gainer shakes....\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou do a double take as you listen.  Did she just say \u2018gainer shake\u2019?  You shake your head to clear it - surely she didn\u2019t say \u2018gainer shake\u2019 and you hear Alex say, \u201cRootbeer for me!\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cChocolate milkshake for me,\u201d you tell the waitress, then head towards the steam tables.  You pick up a plate - which looks to be the size of a platter - and consider the wonderful offerings before you.  Roast beef.  Lasagna.  Pork chops.  Fried chicken.  Salmon in pastry.  Chicken fingers.  Pizza.  Mashed potatoes.  Fresh bread.  Pasta salad.  And some more exotic stuff - breaded deep fried cauliflower, roasted peppers stuffed with cheese, garlic cheddar potatoes.  You start by filling your plate with lasagna, with a side of breaded cauliflower.  Alex, meanwhile, is taking small samples of half a dozen things.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn what seems like just a few bites, the lasagna is gone.  You head back to the steam tables, and this time fill a plate full of fried chicken, with a loaf of fresh bread and some pasta salad.  This, too, seems to disappear in no time.  Alex, meanwhile, is just finishing off his first plate, and already looks a little full.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know what would be cool,\u201d Alex says, \u201cwould be if you could eat some of everything on the menu here - every course, every sampler, even every dessert.  I could help by bringing you the plates - you wouldn\u2019t have to get up every time.  I\u2019m nearly full now anyway,\u201d he goes on, patting his now rounded little tum.  \u201cWhat do you think?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think that\u2019s ...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The whole menu!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of you zip up to the steam tables, and while you start at one end of the steam tables, filling a plate with each of the fragrant offerings, Alex hits the salad bar, putting a small mound of each salad item - 4 mounds per plate.  You head back to your place, and while you start chowing down, Alex returns to the steam tables for the next load.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeef stew.  Braised salmon.  French fries.  Celery sticks.  Potato salad.  Cauliflower soup.  Wiener schnitzel.  Glazed veggies.  Beer Battered fish.  Stir fried veggies.  Sliced tomatoes.  Romaine lettuce.  Cucumber salad.  Three bean salad.

On one of his shuttle trips back and forth to the tables, Alex asks one of the waitresses for a jug of chocolate milkshake, and you snag a jug of rootbeer from another.  Alternately chowing down and sipping, you make steady progress through the menu.  The chili is so good that you send Alex back for a second bowl - which appears with a whole loaf of garlic bread, and a second plate laden with macaroni salad, corn salad and bean salad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou need some real Mexican accompaniments with all that chili,\u201d Alex remarks casually before disappearing again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy now, the waitresses are catching on to what you and Alex are up to.

You know Gram likes to eat - you've seen the lunches he brings to school - and now that you're fat, you figure you'll need a fat buddy. Besides, Gram always seemed to have a date for parties and dances, and it might be fun to meet girls who like fat guys.You pick up the phone and dial Gram's house.<br>\r\n\"Hello?\"<br>\r\n\"Is Gram there?\"<br>\r\n\"Sure, just a minute.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello?\"<br>\r\n\"Hi, Gram, it's IYNH.

You're not fat.\"<br>\r\n\"I am now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? Oh, I bet you've put on five pounds and now you're worried.

Taking a whole bag of chocolate chip cookies and a jug of milk with you, you waddle out to the porch to wait for Gareth to arrive.

She shimmies up beside him, and as he expands, she puts her hands on him... and all over him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Gram, this is so cool, so sexy,\" she says, her voice almost trance-like.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou realise that Gram must have surpassed your 395 pound size by now, and he's still growing, ... and growing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, enormously, the growth stops.

But now, you realise you could join them as football stars - better, you could be bigger if you wanted! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteve, the taller of the two, was very muscular, while Mark, who was a couple of inches shorter, was supposedly just as strong but had a good sized belly pooching over his jeans.  Steve used to kid Mark that he\u2019d hit 300 pounds if he didn\u2019t cut back on the fries, you remember.  Steve would have been what, about 6 foot 3 and 250?   250 would be 90 pounds more than you weigh now - well, then you weighed before you added that little bit to your chest just now, you think, and stretch a little languorously to feel your new chest muscles move.  You open your eyes as the lady beside you pokes you.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOoops, didn\u2019t mean to hit you,\u201d you say as you open your eyes.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOK,\u201d replies the woman, \u201cbut..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You may care for him deeply and want to make his wish come true, but if there is any sibling rivalry between the two of you and a deep, dark part of you wishes to sabotage him, he may start to fatten up to such an extent as to ruin his chances of even being on the team.

If you use the powers on someone and they have very different results than the ones that you intended, then you may have some unresolved feelings for that person that you may have to confront before I am able to revert the changes.\"  You nod slowly, realising that using these powers may not be quite as straightforward as you first thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What if I use them on someone I hate?\"  The man blinks and for a moment you could swear that you see a third eyelid in the corner of one of his eyes.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hate is a very strong word...\" he says in a quieter tone.  \"For such a destructive emotion, the results would be unpredictable but almost always extreme and devastating.  It may also overwrite your connection to me with the object of your hate and any changes you force on them may become unpredictable and bounce back on you in unpredictable ways too.  Similarly, someone who wishes harm on you should never be allowed to handle the trinkets.  They will have control over the size of your body and the destructive will to push it to extremes and potentially warp it in very unpleasant ways. Guard them well.\"  The wizard puts a strong emphasis on the final sentence and you mentally mull over the places that you can store things to keep them safe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So!\"  Your new friend says, clapping his hands together and pulling you out of your thoughts.  \"Are you ready to make a decision?  I have some books to return.  I hope that they don't mind a few of them being scuffed...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat do you decide?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

If you just hold the clay and think about being fat, but don't eat any, then the clay makes your appetite grow until you have eaten enough to grow to the weight you dreamed about. You'll be able to eat as much as you want - without limits - until you've reached that weight.

You decide that to try out holding the clay and thinking about being fat. You take the clay in your hand and hold it, and think about Brian, the fat guy in your English class. You know that he plays on the football team, but you can hardly believe it - he's big, but he looks so fat - you sit near him, and you've seen how his gut parks itself on his lap when he's sitting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, a wave of hunger overcomes you. Well, the first thing to do is to finish off the lasagne you started. In what seems like only moments the lasagne is gone, along with the full bowl of salad and carton of milk. Your hunger isn't though, so you open up the fridge. You don't remember that whole roast chicken being there, or the bowl of potato salad, but you take them out and powerchow through them as well. You look down to see your belly swelling further out over your pants. No surprise, given how much you've eaten in the last couple of hours. But don't your pecs look bigger and softer too? You try to slide your hand into your pocket, and find that your jeans are tighter than before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning to the cupboards, you find a couple of loaves of bread, a full jar of peanut butter, and jam, and within minutes those have taken up residence in your belly as well. Poking through the cupboard, you come across an apple pie - whose six pieces vanish in four bites each. Now your gut has really taken on a bulge - and your butt is definitely filling your jeans. There's even a hint of flesh across the backs of your hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling slightly less hungry, you decide to head out and see if Perry, your best bud, is around. Come to think of it, Brian lives in your neighbourhood too - maybe he'd like to go out and eat something. You could see if he's gotten any fatter over the summer.

His thick bull neck widens, and his double chin swells, growing downward and outward so rapidly that he suddenly seems to have no neck at all.  His stomach now thrusts against the table, and a  look of pain starts to cross his face as the waist band of his once-loose shorts digs in cruelly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWish for your clothes to grow to fit you!\u201d you say urgently to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI wish for my clothes to grow to fit me!\u201d he gasps out, and suddenly relaxes.  He starts to sit higher in his seat, too, as the growing layer of fat on his butt and thighs lifts him up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, you and Troy can see no more growth, except for broadening grin on Brian\u2019s face.  \u201cThis is so cool!\u201d he exclaims, running a hand over his now-vast pot belly.  \u201cBoy, am I hungry, he adds with a grin, and starts to get up.

You pull off a chunk which separates easily and then sits, warm, between your fingers. As you pop it into your mouth, you wonder what it will taste like. Strangely, it seems to taste of nothing at all, though it is chewy. As you chew, you notice that the ball of clay seems smooth and complete again, as if you hadn\u2019t taken any. <br>\r\n <br>\r\nYou shove the clay back into your pocket, and wonder about being fat, and how big you\u2019ll end up. Big Pun, one of your favourite hip-hop artists, is a really big guy - he\u2019s supposed to be 600 pounds or something, but he still gets on stage and he sounds great. You\u2019re sitting there, thinking about what it would be like to be as big as Big Pun, 600 pounds, when a wave of hunger courses through your stomach. You grab the big serving spoon and dig into the lasagna again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA thought flits through your head, that maybe your mum had intended this lasagna for the whole family - but you discard that thought as soon as it appears. In between mouthfuls of lasagna and the salad you pulled out of the fridge earlier, you walk over to the bread box, to find a new loaf of bread there. You tear into it, alternating with the lasagna and salad, until all are finished. You swallow the rest of the carton of milk and sit back, feeling full again. You look down and notice that your stomach is developing a distinct bulge - as are your pecs, and even the backs of your hands look a little padded. You wonder what sweet stuff there might be in the house for dessert. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wander into the pantry and find there an unopened jumbo package of chocolate chip cookies, and two freshly baked pies, one apple, one peach. The pies are already sliced, so you grab a slice of peach and slide it into your mouth. It tastes delicious, and suddenly you are ravenous again. You finish off the two pies, then take the cookies and wander back out to the kitchen in search of something to drink with them. You open the fridge, thinking there might be juice there, and find another new carton of milk. Bingo! The two pounds of chocolate chip cookies and two litres of milk soon vanish. Your stomach, feeling full again, leads you to think of taking a nap. You go up to your room and lie down for a few minutes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFifteen minutes later, you\u2019re feeling refreshed and also hungry. You decide to go out for a burger - after all, you\u2019ve already finished off the lasagna for supper - so you walk out to the backyard and down the cycle path to the mall. There\u2019s a couple of fast food places there, and it\u2019s not too far to walk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time you get to the first burger joint you are ravenous again. You order the double burger combo, thinking that\u2019s all you have money for, but when you pull out your wallet you find an extra $20 bill you had forgotten about. You ask the girl to supersize your order, add another double burger, and a couple of pies. You take your tray over to a window seat, and wolf down the meal. Still feeling ravenous, you line up at the counter again - at a different cashier. You find that there is another $20 bill in your wallet, so this time you order three of the double burger meals, and a half dozen pies. By the time you have consumed this pile, you are feeling much less hungry, though you wonder about going next door for a banana split.

A fat little tub. Then puberty hit, my dad let me use his weight room, my mum put me on a diet, and I went out for football. I grew muscles, but the fat all vanished. Well, mostly,\u201d he went on, patting his small spare tire. \u201cI never get rid of the last little bit. But I\u2019m tired of dieting all the time. I want to be big, like Dad. He\u2019s over 300!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, here\u2019s the clay,\u201d you say as you pull it out. \u201cFelix said it would let me get as fat as I desired, but he didn\u2019t say how to use it. Ever since he gave it to me, though, I\u2019ve been really hungry - I tried eating a bit of it at home, and it just made me hungrier. All that eating has made me fatter, though,\u201d you add, looking down at your gut, which now overlaps your jeans by some inches. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve read about this kind of stuff,\u201d replies Brian. \u201cYou\u2019re supposed to make a wish while you eat it, or rub it, or whatever. Here, give me a piece.\u201d You pull off a piece and hand it to Brian. When he takes it in his hand, you notice it changes colour, getting paler to match his skin. Brian rolls the little piece in his hand, then lifts it to his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI wish to be as big as dad,\u201d he says as he pops it in, chews and swallows. As you watch, Brian\u2019s stomach and shoulders start to grow. His arms and hands get fatter, and his pecs soften and develop a thick layer of flab. Brian looks down and the two of you watch, fascinated, as Brian\u2019s stomach grows and starts to strain against his polo. Brian\u2019s face fills in, and a double chin appears. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHeck, these jeans are tight,\u201d says Brian, reaching down to pull at the waistline.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUndo the top button,\u201d you suggest. \u201cYour polo will hide it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a couple of minutes the growing stops. Sitting across from you is a guy who looks a little like Brian, but is the size of his dad. Brian says, \u201cBoy, am I hungry,\u201d and gets up to refill his plate, his new gut rubbing and bouncing against the table. You notice that the seams of his polo and his jeans are straining to cover all his new flab. As he loads up at the buffet, you pop a piece of clay in your mouth and wish:<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

As you sit there, eating a little, you feels strange sensations across your body.  Looking down you see your belly beginning to swell seriously forward, and you\u2019re suddenly acutely aware that your clothes are too small.  The feeling of tightness spreads from your beltline to your thighs, your shoulders - all over your body.  Brian comes back with two loaded plates loaded with pizza, and the smell makes your mouth water.  You resume noshing with intent, hardly noticing that after a minute or so your body had stopped growing.  Your clothes, though, tell you you\u2019re bigger - they are impossibly tight, and you can see the buttons and seams straining when you look down.  Brian says, \u201cWant more?\u201d and you nod and the two of you push back your chairs and get up.  You both waddle over to the buffet tables - your vastly constricting pants make anything but a waddle impossible - and you start to load up your plates with more pizza.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you return to your table, you hear a garrulous older woman over in the corner say (more loudly than she intends to), \u201cLook at those two!  Do you suppose they\u2019re twins?  Don\u2019t usually see fat twins!\u201d  You and Brian look at each other, and smile - you have similar hair colours, and you\u2019re both equally packed into your too-tight clothing.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGotta do something about these pants!\u201d says Brian as he sits down.  They don\u2019t rip, but you can hear the seams of his jeans creaking in protest as he moves.  Your own are equally tight, but you can\u2019t exactly take them off in the middle of the restaurant.  \u201cGot any ideas?  New jeans are expensive, and I\u2019ve already outgrown a couple of pairs this year.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d you reply.

You concentrate on becoming the size of your uncle Louis - you\u2019ve always liked him, partly for his size and good humour, partly because he did what he wanted to - whether eating, or dressing, or acting - regardless of what the rest of \u2018the family\u2019 thought. Noting that Brian\u2019s clothes nearly split when he grew, you also wish that your clothes would grow along with you. You sit back, and look down at your gut, which is swelling gently but steadily. As you look, you see your pecs and legs swelling as well. Your jeans don\u2019t feel any tighter, though - neither does your shirt. Your clothes are growing along with you! This will be convenient. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point Brian comes back with three loaded plates. \u201cHey, man, you\u2019re really growing,\u201d he says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve found out another trick,\u201d you reply. \u201cIf you think about your clothes growing along with your body, they adjust too.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, then I can fix these tight jeans,\u201d Brian replies. \u201cTo tell the truth, they\u2019re killing me. Give me some more clay.\u201d You break off a piece and put it on the table in front of him. Your own growth seems to have stopped, and now your gut hangs down and touches the top of your thighs. You wonder about standing up, but you are suddenly, ravenously hungry, so you push the chair back with one fattened leg and get up. As you waddle off to the buffet tables, Brian is popping the clay into his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you come back with three plates full, you find that Brian has ...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Brian's gut is now so vast that it has pushed the table away from him, and his fat arms look bigger around than his thighs used to be. His now massive pecs are so fat that they drape across the top of his belly, and his butt hangs down over the sides of the chair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I wished for another 200 pounds,' Brian replies. His chair groans in protest as he shifts his mass around to get up. 'I thought Dad was up somewhere around 320, so I wished for enough to get me up to 500 lbs - a quarter ton! But I guess Dad must be closer to 400 pounds, 'cause I ended up bigger than I expected.' He thumps his vast paunch, which rippled in response. 'Still, this is cool. And my jeans fit - that was a great tip! And I'm hungry again!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'How do you know how big you are?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Well, I just kind of wondered how big I was, and closed my eyes for a moment, and I knew.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Wow.' I closed my eyes, and suddenly I knew too. 'I'm 435 pounds! I never knew Uncle Louis was so big.'<br>\r\n(NB, Brian is 593 lbs.)<br>\r\n'Hey, that's cool,' said Brian, as he waddled off to the buffet tables. He returned shortly with another three platefuls.

You have no right,\u201d the manager gasps as he wriggles and tries to get an arm free.  Brian leans into the wall and spreads his arms so as to add pressure to his gut pinning the guy.  Finally the manager gets an arm free and tries beating on the side of Brian\u2019s huge gut, but Brian effortlessly catches his wrist with one meaty hand and holds it.

The manager takes a couple of deep breaths and then walks into his office to call the police to have both of you removed.  Both of you, meanwhile, have filled a few more steaming plates each - you with roast beef and mashed potatoes and vegetable strata, while Brian is dipping heavily into the oriental section with chicken balls, breaded fish, and egg foo yong.  When you return to your table, Brian sets his chair so he\u2019s sitting sideways.  \u201cHave to get my gut out of the way of my eating!\u201d he says with a smile as he drops into his chair.  The chair groans and shakes for a moment under the sudden load, but holds.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHope this chair is up to a healthy growing boy like me!\u201d  He grins madly.  \u201cElse I\u2019ll end up on the floor!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gorge your way through your full plates, and as you waddle your fattened self back to the buffet tables for more, you notice red and blue flashing lights have appeared outside the buffet.  The manager reappears from his office and rushes out the door.  As you fill your plates, he comes back in, slowly, trailed by two police officers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you watch the two police officers trail in behind the manager, you nearly drop your plate of food.  They are by far the biggest, fattest policemen you have ever laid eyes on - they\u2019re even fatter than the really fat security guard down at the Westwood Mall.  The bigger of the two looks like he can barely squeeze his gunbelt-toting gut through the door.  You look down at your bulging waistline, then at them, and mentally figure that the smaller one has to be over 300 pounds - and the bigger one is well beyond that.  Broad shoulders encased in dark blue uniforms that dive under enormous bullet-proof vests, which in turn slope outwards to huge waistlines - more like equators - where broad, thick belts are snugged tight support the usual policeman\u2019s paraphernalia of gun, radio, flashlight, sticks, cuffs, etc.  The huge uniform pants stretch to cover massively thick legs, and fat arms strain the sleeves of the uniform jackets...  These two cops are just huge!  If they weren\u2019t in uniform, they look like the kind of guys you and Brian would enjoy eating with, in your newly fat and hungry states.  They stop inside the door and look around, as the waitresses come up and the manager continues talking to them.  You amble back to your table with your full plates, and start to chow down on fried chicken in gravy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two enormous policemen begin to follow the manager as he comes closer to you.  You note that the floor seems to shake slightly under their heavy footsteps, and that their bellies move as they walk, making their gunbelts bounce gently.  As the manager comes near you hear him whining about Brian and you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c...he assaulted me officer.  He just shoved me up against the wall and threatened me.  Then he laughed, and just went back to eating.  It was horrible.  Please arrest him.  Please arrest them both.  They\u2019re destroying my profits.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cArrest them for what, though?\u201d asked the bigger of the two big policeman.  \u201cYou claim he assaulted you, but you\u2019re not injured, and he looks peaceful enough, sitting there eating his lunch.  Eating isn\u2019t a crime, last time I checked, and he hasn\u2019t refused to pay, so he hasn\u2019t stolen anything.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut he\u2019s eating away all my profits!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWell, your sign out front says, \u2018All you can eat\u2019.  Maybe you should change that if you want to restrict how much a customer can eat.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWell then, arrest him for trespassing!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cYour restaurant is open, sir, your doors unlocked, and you don\u2019t have any \u2018No Trespassing\u2019 signs.  I\u2019m not sure how I charge them with trespassing - they don\u2019t appear to be creating a disturbance.  How are you doing, boys?\u201d he asked, as he turned towards your table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust great, officer,\u201d you reply.  <br>\r\nBrian adds, \u201cThe food here is really great.  Once you\u2019ve had some, you just get hungrier.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou see sir,\u201d the policeman said, turning back to the manager, \u201cjust two peaceful boys having lunch.  I think our call here is ended.\u201d  He turns and heads towards the door, his weighty partner rolling along behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen,<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Trailing behind Brian, IYNH figures that Rob, the bigger policeman, is still not as big as Brian - stripped of his enormous bulletproof vest and belt, he\u2019s probably about IYNH\u2019s 435 pound size.  As Brian and IYNH load up another plate each, the two policeman each take two plates.  Rob catches Brian\u2019s eye at one point and says, \u201cWe\u2019re old hands at the buffet game!\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWatching the two big policeman eat is a treat for the boys.  Rob and Randy don\u2019t seem so much to eat their food as to simply inhale it.  They finish their first two plates in record time, and then head back for more.   Observing them go at it, plate after plate in rapid succession, rivets the boys.  The two policemen elevate gourmandising to an art form, as they are clearly intend to eat as much as humanly possible in their 60 minute lunch break.  Plateful after plateful of chicken, beef, chinese, lasagna, salad, casseroles, seafood, potatoes, rice, stew, and rich desserts vanishes into the two cops's ravenous bellies.  The sight of the two big officers stuffing themselves without apparent limit is breathtaking!

Wow, I\u2019ve put on five pounds in the last few minutes!\u201d With that, he happily chewed another mouthful of glazed ham, licking the sticky sweetness off his fattened lips with a contented smile.

You rise in your chair slightly, as the pads of fat on your butt and thighs thicken. Even your hands fatten - you watch as the lines on their backs get replaced by thick pads of smooth fat.

Oh, and make my clothes grow too.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c250 pounds!  That\u2019s make you nearly 850 pounds!\u201d you exclaim in surprise.  You\u2019d wanted to be big, but...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd your point?\u201d ripostes Brian, as he looks down at his swelling waistline.  You and Helen, who has just returned with yet more food, watch as Brian balloons from mere extreme obesity into a tycoon of tonnage, a monarch of mass, an emperor of fatness. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLayer after layer of new fat appears on Brian's body, thickening his arms and legs, enlarging his fat pecs, ballooning his belly, padding his face. The backs of his hands develop smooth, thick pads of fat.  Fat cheeks swell below his eyes, and run down into a thick ring of fat on his neck.  His love handles widen out beyond his shoulders, and his lushly fat pecs spread out and down until they\u2019re riding near the top of his now extraordinarily expansive gut.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe expansion slows and stops, and after a moment, Brian pats his newly enlarged paunch with one fattened hand and grins.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, now I\u2019ve got room for a whole lot more food!  First though, I need to take a little trip...\u201d  He shoves the chair back and leans forward to get up, then rises steadily as his massively fat, yet also massively powerful thighs take on the job of getting his tremendous torso vertical.  As he wheels his attention-getting anatomy around towards the men\u2019s room, his massive potbelly lags behind in the turn, moving more slowly than his shoulders.  After his shoulders stop moving his gut doesn't, overshooting and then bouncing back to centre as Brian's tree trunk thighs thrust him foward.  \u201cCool, my gut has a mind of its own!\u201d he remarks as his first strides make his belly bounce.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelen watches, entranced, as Brian guides his massive body towards the washroom, his belly leading the way.  Several other buffet customers also notice the now hugely fat Brian hoofing it across the floor, and you can see intrigue on some faces, disgust on others.  One guy who you guess might be about 350 pounds (a size until recently you would have described as \u2018really fat\u2019) stares at Brian's stately, bouncing progress with longing in his eyes and on his chubby cheeks, and you surmise that he must want to be superbly fat too!  Your thinking is confirmed when you notice the guy\u2019s girlfriend looking with unabashed lust at Brian as he waddles past.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust like him,\u201d you hear her whisper to her guy, who immediately digs in to more food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Conveniently, your plans will also provide this guy and his gal with clear evidence of the clay\u2019s power, as you use it to keep up with Brian - no, go Brian one better. Well, a few hundred (pounds) better. You're thinking so big, that Brian will be super shocked when he gets back. <br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"I know, it's hard to believe, but let me give you a demo.

Your enormous gut nearly doubles in size. Your arms become giant barrels of fat, resting on a huge billowing growing layer of fat that is your chest. Your cheeks puff out to huge, hungry blobs. As your girth continues to grow and grow, both the guy and the girl look totally amazed and fearful. They have to move out of the way of your increasing bulk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you finally finish growing, your enormous  620 pound body has become a supreme, record shattering 1,120 pounds.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As the bus pulls up, you laugh a little at the name of their mascot, the fighting cocks. \"Interesting...\" you say.  The bus driver opens the door and you see the coach driving the bus.  \"Sorry, the air conditioning is out on the bus, but we'd be happy to have you on board and give you a lift.\" He's a handsome man in his early 40s.  He's got his coaches whistle around his neck and a pair of coaching shorts on.  Otherwise, the coach is barechested and still extremely well fit for his age.  \"Hop on, the guys will make a spot for you and take care of you in the back.\" he says.  \"The Cocks are here to serve you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn sideways as you enter the bus and begin to walk through the rows of seats.  The whole team is dressed in their speedos, bright orange with white lettering spelling 'cocks' on one side.  The whispers don't escape your ears as you pass and they comment on your enormous size.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you walk back, one handsome (heck, they're all really handsome) stands up in front of you in the aisle.  \"Hi, I'm Rod.  Please, have my seat.  The bus is pretty full with all of us on here, but we'll make due.\"  You squeeze into the open seat and the Rod sits on the very edge of the seat, the only room left.  The whispers continue around you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks Rod.  I'll have to find a way to repay all of  you for your kindness.\" you say with a big smile.  You hear a moan in the seat behind you.  \"Why don't you have the windows open on this bus?\" you continue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The locking system is broken\" Rod states. \"And it's not getting any cooler in here.  Not that we usually mind, we're used to the heat and well.. \" he pauses for a moment. \"...we're pretty much used to being nearly naked all the time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NEARLY???\"  you hear a yell from behind you as a speedo is flung towards the front of the bus.  \"COMPLETELY!\" the voice follows up.  Within seconds there is a flurry of speedos flying around the bus like leaves falling in the the autumn with the gust of wind.  The bus erupts with laughter.  \"Come on Rod!  you too!  You're the king!\" the voice yells.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Rod stands up in the aisle and faces you.  He gives you a quick smile as he peels off his speedo to reveal the biggest cock you've ever seen.  You hadn't had a chance to check him out as you were getting seated.  But now you can see him in full glory.  His muscular toned body is well tanned, and apparently he, along with the rest of the team must not be lying about being naked nearly all the time, because there isn't a tan line to be found.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's pretty warm, so feel free to make yourself more comfortable and join the rest of us if you'd like.\" Rod says as he stares at your micro-thong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRod steps back just a touch as you step into the aisle.   Every eye in the bus is on you, including the coach who is watching in the mirror above him. \"Need help?\" Rod says.  \"No, I'm fine.  I can handle this quite simply.\" you say with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou flex your cock and ass muscles just enough to pop the last few remaining threads that held the speedo on.  It breaks looks from the back shooting forward to the front of the bus hitting the coach in the back of the head.  The rush of release of constriction and blast of air, give your manhood a bust to full erection.  3 or 4 of the guys within earshot moan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're bigger than me!\" Rod says flabbergasted.   He reaches for it as you hear...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'd better find a place for the night to park.  Men, we've got a long hard night ahead of us.\" the coach says.  \"And it looks like I've got me a souvenir.\" he finishes and he grabs the shreds of fabric of your speedo and drapes it around his neck.  \"And besides, you guys had the luxury of dropping your trunks, I'm still stuck in these shorts and sweating like a mammoth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou suggest to the coach they spend the night....</span></div></div>",

The sausage smells good, and if you\u2019re going to become big, you figure, you might as well start to eat like a big guy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bratwurst tastes good - so good, in fact, that you get another. This time, you get it \u201call dressed\u201d, buried in sauerkraut and mustard, and you get another rootbeer to go with it. When the second bratwurst is finished, you find you still feel hungry. You notice there\u2019s an ice cream shop across the street, and you run across and order a double scoop cone of chocolate. It\u2019s the best ice cream you\u2019ve ever had, so you track back in and order a big banana split.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling a bit satiated after finishing off the mounds of ice cream, sauce and banana, you catch your bus.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Something is definitely off here.  You've eaten so much food and you don't even feel close to being full.  You lean back in your chair, and put your hands on your rounded out belly. Giving it a gentle rub, you wonder how something that was so much bigger than it used to be only a couple of hours ago could feel so empty.  <i>If only you had asked Felix more questions!</i>  Maybe this was some kind of side effect from the clay?  But to suffer the side effect of something, didn't you have to use it first?  Speaking of which, how <i>were</i> you meant to use it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take a deep breath and close your eyes, trying to centre yourself and work out how to deal with this.  He may be many things and have terrible judgment about himself, but you had to admit that your brother was good in a crisis and he had helped you out with an occasional decent insight.  What would he say about this...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>So you used magic and it didn't turn out the way that you thought it would?  What a shocker, dummy.</i>\"  You open your eyes back up and mutter under your breath, but it was a solid point.  Either you messed up or you somehow managed to use the clay without realising it.  Whatever the cause, there's no way that you can sort this out on your own.  You need to call Felix, but first you decide to check the clay and the gem to ensure that there are no signs of any obvious damage or usage so you can let him know exactly what's up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs your hands move down to your pockets, you hear and feel a long, low gurgle come from the centre of your gut and they quickly move to the front of your belly, pushing and lightly sinking in to the doughy new fat there, as if they could somehow supress or force down your ravenous and rapidly growing hunger.  The gurgle is causing your belly to quiver slightly and you can feel its soft outer shell begin to wobble ever so gently in response.  You grit your teeth and slowly start to lean forward in your chair, hoping that your stomach is just upset and shifting slightly might help.  Before you get all the way forward, the thick scent of the creamy lasagne hits your nostrils and you remember the ice cold milk and can imagine how it would quench a deep thirst that you didn't even realise that you had.  Your mouth waters, your will slips and  everything around you that can't be shoved into your belly seems to dull and fade into the background.  Another thought or emotion rises within you, but the hunger swallows it before consuming you whole.  Your hands thrust forward and forego the spoon that you were using previously for the lasagne - no time and it couldn't hold enough anyway - and dive straight into the tray, grabbing large fistfuls of the food inside, before stuffing it into your eagerly waiting mouth.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour taste buds explode and you wonder for the briefest of moments if this is even the same lasagne that you were eating just a moment ago.  Your cheeks bulge out and as you slowly chew, you run your tongue over the food and savour the perfect combination of temperature, texture and taste.  Your stomach gurgles impatiently and you reflexively swallow, your hands already digging in to lasagne dish for more food.  You have even less time to appreciate the flavour this time as your need to fill the emptiness inside you takes over.  You quickly get in to a rhythm of stuffing food into your mouth, chewing only as much as is necessary and swallowing and although you are broadly aware of what you are eating and that it tastes good, the only thing that of any real importance is that you don't stop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou have a vague impression of returning to the fridge and feel a biting cold that must mean that you went through the freezer drawer, but anymore than that is a mystery.  The only things that you are aware of is the near constant chewing and feeling of having a full mouth and an empty belly.  At one point you remember moving across the kitchen, driven by the desire to find more to eat.  The distance between food is almost unbearable, the soundtrack of the afternoon is the rustling of plastic bags and the ripping of cardboard boxes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlack spots dance at the edge of your vision, the world lurches slowly back into view and you become slowly aware of your ragged breaths.  You take a moment to groggily look around the kitchen and are at first confused by the fact that the ceiling seems to be so much higher than you remember it, until you come to realise that you are sat on the floor, slumped up against one of the walls.  As feeling returns to the rest of your body and the numbness retreats from your legs, you realise that they are splayed wide open.  Your forearms meanwhile are resting on the outer edges of your thighs and your hands are cupping and cradling...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour head groggily tilts forward and as they catch sight of your belly, your sleepy eyes dramatically bulge open.  Now that you see the sheer size of it, you can feel your gut resting on your thighs and your underbelly grazing the cool ceramic of the tiled kitchen floor.  Steadying your hands on the floor, you slowly push off from the wall and lean forward, feeling more of your belly push and spread forth on the kitchen tile as you do, like dough being pushed out on a bread board. Bringing your legs up, you awkwardly push yourself on to your side and have to shuffle around feeling your belly shake and wobble as you do so.  Once you're on all fours, you grab hold of a table leg, tuck your leg slowly up at a wider angle than you're used to and gradually start to pull yourself up to your feet.  You plant your feet in the floor and slowly straighten your back and as you do so, your belly rises up and expands outward.  By the time that you're fully standing, your belly is a big round globe of plush flesh.  You wrap your arms forward and around your new girth and are only just able to interlock your fingers at the front.  You start to slowly rub and squeeze as you move your hands back to the sides of your gut and suddenly realise that just like before, in spite of the sheer amount of food that you have consumed that you don't feel stuffed at all, more like satiated, or as if you have managed to quieten a voice \u2013 for now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou have no idea just how much time has passed since you began your binge, but you do know that it's only a matter of time before someone comes home.  You also suspect that it won't be too long before your hunger returns, so you need to act fast.  \"Felix,\" you call out as you begin to move around the table, gathering up empty packets and pooling together any crockery.  You recognise the lasagne dish on the table which looks surprising debris clear.  A vague feeling washes over you, more a memory dressed as a sensation.  Did you... lick it clean?  Looking around again, you spot the salad bowl on the other side of the kitchen, it's contents spread out on the floor.  Salad never was your favorite food.  In fact, there seemed to be a lot of wrappers and cardboard, not to mention crumbs and chunks of food, spread across the floor.  Your hand moves to your gut as you frown.  Cleaning the floor can wait until last.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Felix!\"  You call a little louder, trying to focus on him whilst tidying the kitchen as fast as you're able to whilst adjusting to your new body.  Moving around, you notice how you've had to change your stance to accomodate your girth and the way in which your walk has developed a definite sway.  You think you like it.  You're about to call out the magician's name again when you hear someone walking up the path to the front door of the house and your heart starts thudding loudly in your chest.  You hold your breath, hoping that you were mistaken but you can hear whoever it is fumbling around on the other side of the door with something.  The route up to your room runs right by the front door and whatever your top speed is at your current size, there's no way you can get there in time.  The utility room that runs off the kitchen has a back door that you could sneak out of; the only other alternative is to face the music and whoever it is that is on the other side of the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat are you going to do?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>From the amount of noise being made and the way that the door is roughly shoved open, you know instantly that it's your brother Garrett that is about to come through it, even before you hear his heavy footsteps. You're not sure if you're relieved or not, but you're not sure if you could find the words to properly explain to your mother what has happened, if you could even get past your embarrassment.  Besides, it's too late to 'slip' out the back door now.  You can hear the thud of his footsteps from the hall and Garrett lets out a loud sigh.  \"I'm home!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hold your breath as Garrett seems to fumble around in the hall and for a moment it looks like he might head straight up to his room and spare you the trouble of an explanation - for a while at least.  Then suddenly, the kitchen handle dips down and he starts to comes in.  You have just enough time to glance quickly around at the remaining rubbish scattered about the kitchen whilst briefly trying to tug your t-shirt down to absolutely no avail.  As he walks in you cringe and start to think that you've made a serious mistake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGarrett throws his keys down on the counter closest to the door before turning toward you and stopping in his tracks.  His eyes bulge and his mouth drops open as he slowly looks you up and down.  Other than blinking hard, he spends a few moments rooted to the spot in what you can only assume is disbelief.  As mortified as you are, you try to splutter to life and take control of the situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look... Garrett... I know that this looks...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b>WHAT THE HELL HAPPENED TO YOU?</b>\"  Garrett says loudly, perhaps understandably  You're not entirely sure of the best way to explain the situation to him, but fortunately enough it quickly becomes apparent that he isn't expecting an answer.  \"<b>YOU'RE HUGE!</b>\"  As he finishes the sentence, Garrett takes a couple of steps gingerly forward his face a combination of shock and sheer horror.  It was as if he had seen a ghost, or a bomb, or at the very least a decent sized spider.  \"So... did you use some kind of... industrial... strength girdle or something?  Is that how you hid it?  Did it finally explode off?  Are there little pieces of it scattered across the...\" As Garrett looks around the kitchen to emphasize his point, he trails the sentence off as he takes in the many empty boxes, bags and packets of food still strewn across the floor.  \"Did... you eat all this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's almost more disturbing hearing Garrett talk in such a shocked, low tone and you look around, fully taking in the aftermath of your evening of gluttony.  There was a shocking amount of food that found it's way into your belly and you can't believe that before now you just seemed to accept it so nonchalantly.  It was ridiculous, impossible and almost certainly magical.  Maybe the magic made you more accepting of what had happened somehow... but there was no point second guessing what was going on.  You had to get Garrett up to speed, sort out the kitchen and get Felix's help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that...\"  Garrett suddenly says, looking at some of the debris on the floor before quickly moving toward and opening the fridge, giving you a wide berth to stay out of your orbit.  He gasps again before slamming the fridge shut.  \"My chicken breasts... you ate all of my chicken breasts...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chicken breasts?  You mean... raw chicken breasts?\"  Your stomach feels decidedly queasy at the thought.  \"Do you think I'm going to be alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you have any idea how much they cost?\" Garrett says, turning around slowly to face you.  \"There were ten chicken breasts in there... <b>TEN!</b>\"  Although his volume had gone back up, he didn't really sound angry as such \u2013  more exhausted, confused and incredulous.  It was as if he was going through the poultry version of the five stages of grief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, I'll replace them I swear, I just need...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was going to have a couple of those tonight after the gym,\" he says, his voice returning to a defeated whisper. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean... at least they helped one of us to bulk up,\" you say, gently slapping the side of your belly and laughing weakly.  Garrett glares at you, his features twist and he opens his mouth to spit something out, but you manage to cut him off.  \"OK, sorry, that was a stupid thing to say and I'm sorry about your food too.  I will replace it, all of it, but if you've seen all the wrappers and how empty the fridge and cupboards are...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You ate through the cupboards too?\"  Garrett says, his voice rising in pitch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but please let me finish.  I know you're pissed and confused, but if you've seen all this then you must know I have a problem and I need help.  Help from my big brother,\" you say pointedly, looking straight into his eyes.  He groans and raises a hand to his forehead, beginning to rub it slowly whilst clamping his eyes shut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hate it when you use the big brother card...\"  Garrett's arm falls back down to his side and he opens his eyes again to look at you and sighs.  \"OK fine, but you better replace my stuff.  Now tell me what's going on and what you need me to do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd you do.  Between trying to accurately relay what happened and still getting used to living in your new body, you don't keep a really close eye on Garrett's reactions but he seems to take most of it in his stride.  You tell him about the bullies knocking down Felix, coming to his aid and being given the magical clay and stone before moving on to the bus trip and the multiple stops at various food outlets; then coming home and beginning your eating marathon and ending as Garrett walked in the door.  Although you're not exactly brief, you realise that for all of the big changes that have happened a relatively small amount of time has passed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK, I believe you.\"  Garrett says flatly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You do?  I thought for sure when I mentioned magic and about Felix that...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just got a good look at your face while you were talking and it's a lot fatter too.  A girdle might have covered up your gut, but you couldn't hide your face the same way.  Although if you did have a girdle around your head, you probably wouldn't have eaten all of my food,\"  Garrett says sourly, folding his arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I had a girdle around my face, I would have suffocated.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then you definitely wouldn't have eaten my food.\"  Garrett deadpans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine,\" you mutter, \"but if we don't sort this out soon, then if \u2013 <i>when</i> \u2013 the hunger returns and there's nothing left to eat here, who knows what I'll do?  Roam the streets, break into next door and pick their kitchen clean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I doubt it.  You'd probably go through the bins first, they're closer and it doesn't look like you're all that picky...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b>GARRETT</b>!\"  Garrett chuckles softly to himself and uncrosses his arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's OK, calm down.  Just empty your mind of all this, the worry about another 'incident', sorting out the food and cleaning up.  Just focus on your weird... cat, man... friend and call out to him again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK,\" you say, taking a deep breath and smiling at your brother.  You close your eyes and begin to picture Felix, his yellow-green eyes and stripey hair, the way he looked knocked down on the ground and standing up, talking to you.  You try and relive the moment that he handed the stone and clay to you, desperate for him to hear your call.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Felix!\"  You roar out loudly and open your eyes.  Garrett flinches a little before quickly regaining his composure and in the moments following, the silence is deafening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Scared you,\" you say to Garrett with a grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up.\"  A little more time slowly passes by and nothing happens.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is useless.  What am I going to do...\" mid-sentence you're interrupted by Garrett gasping and before you can ask him what's wrong, his arm slowly rises up and points to the kitchen wall.  You ponderously turn your bigger body around to look and as you resettle yourself you see the end of a sentence appear on the painted beige wall in a living, glittering gold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<span class=\"cyellow\">--- * ---\t\t<b><font class=\"size4\" style=\"\">GO</font> <font class=\"size35\" style=\"\">TO</font></b>\t\t---*---<br>\r\n\t \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0--*-- -*-\t\t<b><font class=\"size4\" style=\"\">THE</font></b>\t\t\t-*- --*--\t<br>\r\n\t\t \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0**-*--\t\t\t<b><font class=\"size5\" style=\"\">MIRROR</font></b>\t\t--*-**</span>  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of you are silent for a moment, before Garrett speaks.  \"Which mirror do you think it means?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It must be the one in the hall, right?\" you say, still marvelling at the shimmering message that punctuates the bland wall.  If it weren't for getting really fat in the space of a day, then you'd say that this glowing writing appearing was the weirdest thing that has ever happened to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK.\"  Garrett says energetically, clapping his hands together.  \"Let's go!\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As you make your way slowly out of the kitchen and into the hallway, you're made much more aware of your size.  Although you spent a little time moving around the kitchen and tidying, that was little more than short sharp bursts.  Now that you're moving somewhere with a purpose, you can feel how slow and deliberate each step is, how your body gently rocks from side to side as you move and how your body \u2013 mostly your big, round belly \u2013 shakes and jiggles each time your foot hits the ground.  Passing through the door frame you feel the need to clamp your arms into your sides, where they sink into your love handles, belly and chest fat, and wrap them underneath your belly at the bottom, to ensure that you pass through without incident.  You pass through more easily than you would have expected, but the shaking and wobbling feels more pronounced now as your fat quivers against and over your arms.  You have no idea what Garrett can or can't see as he's following behind you, you're just glad that you can't see his facial expressions and that he's kept any smart comments to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRounding the corner into the hallway you begin to relax a little, until you catch sight of the mirror.  Even at an angle you can instantly see that it isn't reflecting the stairway, wall hangings and side table with photo frames on it, but instead it seems to be showing someplace completely different.  The image seems to be a little hazy but you can just make out some fuzzy bookshelves and what appears to be a desk or table with some bottles on it.  As you move around to face it head on, you notice that the image doesn't change perspective with the differing angle.  It's like some kind of arcane video conference - the only thing missing is Felix.  \"Hey, move up.\"  You turn your head to take a look at Garrett and realise that you're taking up most of the space in front of the mirror, so you awkwardly shuffle slowly to the side to let him get a better look.  You find yourself idly thinking about how small the hallway feels, before quickly realising the fault in your logic.  Will everywhere feel much smaller and more enclosed now?  Before you can finish the thought Felix slowly appears in the mirror as if from nowhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa!\"  Your brother says, shrinking back slightly before quickly gathering his composure.  \"So he's real then...\"  You glance over at Garrett and frown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought you said that believed me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I believed that <i>you</i> believed it.\"  Garret replies nonchalantly.  \"Me, I thought that you were going to need sectioning as well as some SlimFast.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, ah...\" Felix interrupts, looking between the two of you.  \"You'll have to excuse me, but I'm having some trouble telling the two of you apart.\"  You and Garrett exchange disbelieving looks before looking back at Felix.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you really not recognise me?\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe the guy that looks like he hit the all-you-can-eat buffet, finished off all the food and then inhaled the furniture for dessert is the one that you gave your little magic toys to.\"  Garrett says, his voice thick with sarcasm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's my brother Garrett.  You can tell us apart because he's the one with the smart mouth and wears t-shirts that are so tight that they're meant to hug his non-existent muscles.\"  Garrett begins to scowl, but it quickly turns into a sickening smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha!  You don't get to use the too tight clothes line anymore, butterball,\" he says, giving you a couple of soft punches in the side of the belly.  \"Your t-shirt has turned into a crop top.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see what you mean about his smart mouth.\"  Felix says drily.  \"I'm sorry, I find it difficult to tell huma... I mean, people apart sometimes.  But now that I look again,\" he continues, squinting between the two of you, \"I suppose that you are a little larger.\"  You don't know if you're going to see Felix again after today, but if you do you don't think you'll ever get used to his \u2013 <i>eccentricities</i>.  \"Well, it was very nice to meet your brother and I'm glad that you're putting the clay to good use, but I have a lot of work to be...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But that's just it, I haven't used the clay.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh.\"  Felix says, drawing the word out.  \"I see.\"  He takes an uncomfortably long time to stare at you, before seeming to catch himself with a start and look away.  \"Do you have the gem and the clay with you now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I have one in each of my pockets.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How long have they been in there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I put them there just after we said goodbye.  I haven't touched them since.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm...\" Felix says, dragging the word out again.  \"Then you truly haven't used them.  The clay you use by tearing a chunk off and consuming it, whilst imagining the change you wish \u2013 it will grow back soon after.  The gem you merely need to hold and concentrate on the musculature that you desire, just in case you were curious.\"  Although his tone doesn't change, you understand Felix's point and feel pretty embarrassed.  \"Now, tell me exactly what has happened since we parted ways.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour explanation to Felix is much briefer and to the point than the one you gave Garrett, focussing exclusively upon your voracious hunger, lack of any discernable stomach capacity limit and inability to feel full despite eating huge amounts of food.  Felix listens intently, nodding at various points as you speak.  After you finish, he remains silent for a time, stroking his chin slowly in deep reflection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So... do you have any idea what might be happening to him?\"  Garrett is the first to speak up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There are several possible explanations.\"  Felix says eventually, sighing.  \"The answer may lie in the field of magical psychology, which is not my area of expertise \u2013 your subconscious may be responsible for your weight gain.  Or you may be magically sensitive and using the clay in a manner that most ordinary people would not be able to and without meaning to.  Alternatively, some outside force may be responsible for your condition, using the clay as some kind of... conduit.  They would need to be powerful but it is possible.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's our next step?\"  You ask, a little anxiously.  Although you've always wanted to be bigger, the idea of having no control over your growth is a little scary.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will need to consult some colleagues and do a little research.  It really is quite fascinating, had I had you under lab conditions since the beginning, then I could have made some really important discoveries.\"  Perhaps sensing your discomfort, Felix moves on.  \"I will place a magical barrier around your subconscious to stop it from interfering and interacting with any form of magic.  However if food is the trigger and not your mind, then you should keep away from all forms of food, no matter how big or small, otherwise it may trigger another... bout.  You may be fine being close to it, but do not eat or drink until I say otherwise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What if I keep gaining weight anyway?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then we will narrow down our options.\"  Felix says very matter of factly.  \"If you want to do something while you wait, then take this.\"  Felix waves his hand and you feel an object appear in your hand.  Raising your arm, you see what appears to be a wand in your hand, although at the base it splits into two distinct prongs that splay apart, making a v-shape.  \"In layman's terms, this is a magical dowsing rod.  It can be used to divine the location of a source of magic that is affecting the user.  If the reason for your expansion is external to you, then this well help you to find the cause.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait a minute,\" says Garrett, \"wouldn't that involve leaving the house?  I mean it doesn't exactly look like he's at a good size for investigative work and wouldn't that potentially bring him into contact with food?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your brother is perfectly healthy.  His mobility may be a little compromised by his size, but much like with the clay his overall physical fitness should be much the same as it was previously.  Speaking of the clay,\" Felix goes on to say, turning his attention back to you, \"I would recommend against using the clay or the gem until we know more.  They may have unexpected consequences when interacting with whatever you are being affected by.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I understand.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As soon as I find something out, I will let you know.\"  You go to say something, but suddenly the image fades and you're left looking in the mirror at a man that looks much like you, but with a prominently round belly and a t-shirt that stops several inches short of his belly button.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What a day.\"  Garrett says, shaking his head slowly.  \"So what are you going to do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't have many options.  Either I hide away in my room and away from food or use the rod to see what I can find out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or you could come to work with me.  I could keep an eye on you there and you could make a bit of money.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But isn't there food there?  Some of the stock handled there is food, isn't it?  I'm not sure if the money is worth... Oh, I get it...\" you say, suddenly aware of why Garrett suggested it.  \"You want to make sure I have enough money to replace your food.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK, you got me.\"  Garrett says with a grin.  \"But you're not that much safer here.  You know mom is constantly cooking something or other and we're going to have to replace the food you ate.  Plus the 'wizard made me fat' line worked on me, I don't think it's going to fly with her.  I genuinely can keep an eye on you at work.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGarrett makes a good point, but using the dowsing wand could bring you closer to finding out the truth and keep you busy.  What if you suddenly started getting fatter at Garrett's job?  But then what if you suddenly started to blow up while you wandered around using the wand.  Holing up at home seemed like the least pro-active thing to do and even that had its fair share of risk.  As fat as you are, you couldn't be sure that your mother wouldn't try and palm off some more food onto you.  None of the options seemed particularly safe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, you decide to... </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>If you stay at home rattling around in your room until Felix comes up with something, you're going to go crazy and there's no guarantee that you'd be safe there anyway.  Going to work with Garrett doesn't sound like a terrible idea in theory, but you know that the warehouse employs a lot of people.  People who eat food and people who would be around to witness any further 'growth spurts' that you may go through.  Getting out there and using the wand to try and find out what's happening to you will keep you busy, your local knowledge means that you can avoid the food stores and places where a lot of people congregate and will keep you pro-actively involved in trying to find some answers to your predicament.  You may even be able to find a solution before Felix.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK.\"  Garrett says a little flatly.  You can tell that he's disappointed, but he understands your desire to find answers.  You spend some time helping him tidy up before he heads out to replace the food based on the boxes and wrappers that you left in an identifiable condition, reminding you once again as he does so that you owe him big for this \u2013 in both time <i>and</i> money.  You head up to your room, taking the stairs slowly and noting the low creaking sound that they make despite your attempts at treading on them as softly as you can with each laboured step.  You spend a little time in your room briefly looking through your clothes, none of which really seem any better than what you have on, before you decide to test out the dowsing wand.  As you hold it out in front of you and slowly turn around, you can feel a gentle tugging as you turn toward the centre of the city.  You idly wonder if the answer to your randomly increasing size can be found out there and think of your newly fattened body and the pull becomes stronger; it is as if rather than guiding you the wand has magnetised your body and you feel the almost irresistible urge to find the source.  You panic, your mind starts to race, trip over itself and lose focus, and the compulsion quickly begins to fade.  You take a moment to centre yourself before starting to experiment some more.  You think about things differently, focussing on your hunger pangs and feeding frenzies rather than your size and although the dowsing wand still pulls you in the same direction, you can feel it 'reset' before it does so.  When you angle the wand downward rather than straight ahead, you notice the pull is much more subtle.  You tentatively think about your size again with the wand aimed downward and although the pull becomes stronger again, it does not become unmanagably so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGarrett gets back as you're experimenting with the wand and trying to plan out in your mind the best way to walk as to avoid any unnecessary risk.  You can hear him unpacking and putting things away downstairs and after a while you hear a knock at the door.  \"I swung by the big and tall store on the way back.  I didn't know your exact size, so I just kind of motioned how big your belly was to the assistant there and he gave me these.\"  Garrett hands you a plain bag and gives you a moment to try your new clothes on.  Taking off the t-shirt takes a little effort, even though your belly has done half the work by pusing it up your torso, your thicker chest and wider shoulders make it a struggle to remove.  You eventually get it up and over your head, but not without a lot of effort and the sounds of a few seams ripping.  Inside the bag is a blue polo shirt that slips on and over your head pretty easily.  You have to be a little careful putting your arms through the holes but it fits fairly well, although it is a little snug around the widest point of your belly.  Taking a look in the full length mirror on your wardrobe, you're reminded once again that you're far from the average guy that you used to be.  Your shoulders and arms look much thicker than before, perhaps partly because the sleeve of the polo shirt stopping an inch or two down from your armpit really emphasises the size of your upper arms.  Whilst you know it's all fat it does give you a big, bulky, substantial look that is replicated by your bigger softer chest.  The main attraction though is, of course, your gut.  However well fitted the polo shirt may be, there's no hiding or flattering it \u2013 it is your dominant physical feature, a large, round, unaviodable mass not helped by your skin tight jeans forced down and sitting right underneath it, causing both your belly and love handles to cascade over the sides of the denim waistband.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlso in the bag are a pair of khaki cargo pants, the label of which stresses words like, \"EXTRA DURABLE!\" and, \"STRETCHY!\"  They look to be a good size but putting them on would involve removing your jeans, which also prove to be incredibly durable but with a severely limited ability to stretch.  You manage to get your fingers down to the button under your belly, but unfastening it proves to be impossible.  Between your gut, wider hips and fatter thighs, the button is pushed right up against the edge of the hole that it is fastened through and no amount of forcing it or trying to suck your gut in helps to make it budge at all.  You try and find a point along the waistband where there may be some give, but you come up with nothing.  Felix warned you against using the clay and the gem given what's happening to you, but that isn't even a consideration; even your pockets are stretched out and impossible to push your fingers into.  A short while later, Garrett knocks on your door again.  \"How are things going in there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The shirt fits great, but the cargo pants are a bit baggy so I'm going to stick with my jeans,\" you lie, after you let him in.  Garrett looks you up and down, but he doesn't say anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you going to head out then?  If you are, mom's back so you're going to have to be careful to avoid her.  Want me to distract her?  I can probably keep her busy in the kitchen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Any chance you can get her into the garden?\" you ask.  \"On my way up the stairs, I... let's just say that my days of sneaking around are over.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, well just remember that when you're lumbering around out there playing Miss Marple.\"  Garrett says folding his arms.  \"Sure, I can probably do that.  Wait at the top of the stairs and when you hear the back door slam, that's your cue.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks Garrett.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem.  I'll send you an invoice for those clothes.  Figure I deserve a finders fee for locating that much fabric.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGarrett makes his way downstairs and you wait at the top, dowsing wand in hand.  You can hear the muffled voices of your mother and Garrett in the kitchen, until they gradually become fainter and then disappear.  A  moment later, the back door slams shut and you make your way downstairs as quickly as you feel safe to.  You go out the front door and much to your relief, you realise that the sun has almost fully set.  Between your huge weight gain and the strange yellow glow of the cities lamplight, you're fairly confident that anyone who knows you wouldn't find it easy to recognise you.  The dowsing rod still points you deeper into the heart of the city, so you slowly set off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don't need to worry much about being recognised.  You don't know for a fact, but you suspect that your size encourages people to give you a wide berth, with some preferring to cross or walk on the street rather than get too close to you.  Some may steal quick glances at you and they may have a comment or two to make once you walk by, but they seem happy to scurry by and avoid your attention.  You keep walking, along and across streets and the wand doesn't seem to deviate much until you reach a well maintained thoroughfare that runs underneath an apartment building.  The pull on the wand had started to become weaker and as you turn it to try and re-oriente yourself, the wand seems to pull you toward the apartment building itself, or perhaps beyond it, into the commercial district on the other side.  Of course, rather than a place it could be guiding you toward a person which could make things a little more difficult.  As you consider your options, you notice...</span></div></div>",

You put your hand into your pocket and bring out the piece of clay from earlier. Quickly you decide to duck behind some bushes as it starts to grow warm in your palm. You look down at it curiously and fish the gem out of your pocket, along with a piece of paper you didn't notice was there before. Written on the paper is a small set of instructions: <br>\r\n<br>\r\n 'Gem\u2011 hold it and concentrate on what you want <br>\r\n Clay\u2011 eat some and (again) concentrate on what you want (don't worry, its non-toxic).<br>\r\n It'll grow back right after you rip some off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n PS.

You also notice that your gut is rapidly growing inside the spandex shorts - very rapidly. \u2018How much can spandex expand, anyway?\u2019 you think to yourself. You decide to pop on the t-shirt too - none of the strongmen go barechested, you notice, so you figure you\u2019d better cover up.

Admiring yourself in the full-length, you bend and flex a couple of times, noting that, already, your gut has grown into a small ball, and you have the start of love handles.

So, as you sit down to finish off the lasagna having swallowed the awful tasting clay, you think about doubling your weight with fat. You figure that, with all that muscle, you must have been pushing 250 pounds, so doubling will put you easily into the quarter ton range. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n <br>\r\nRavenously digging into the lasagna, you notice that your body is already starting to grow. Where the muscle wish had expanded your chest, it is now distinctly your gut that is growing. Your dragon t-shirt had been greatly stretched across the chest, now it is getting stretched across your gut (a body part you didn\u2019t have before!) and the dragon design is getting destroyed. Your pants are suddenly terribly tight, so you undo the waist and the growing weight of your belly forces the zipper down. Part of your brain wonders what you\u2019re going to do about clothes - but the rest of your brain ignores it, being too busy savoring the lasagna and watching your body flesh out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout a third of the way through the lasagna, there is a ripping sound, as the left side seam on your t-shirt gives way from the pressure of your expanding belly. A moment later, the seam over your right shoulder does the same, leaving you with a rag of shirt hanging from one shoulder, and an increasingly tortured ring of shirt material stretching around your right bicep. You don\u2019t stop eating, as your hungry drives you to plow on through the full tray of lasagna. A few minutes later there is a gentler ripping noise from the right leg of your jeans, as its inseam starts to fail. It had been badly strained by the muscular 36 inch thighs you had grow with the gem, and now, with a thickening layer of fat being added, the sewing started to give way. As you eat, further ripping noises are heard, as first the other leg inseam and then the seam at the butt slowly give way to the growing rotundity tide of your fattening body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gorge your way through the rest of the pan of lasagna, growing steadily all the time, and at the end chug an entire two litre carton of milk. Feeling suddenly less hungry, you sit back and examine the changed in your body. Your once lean body, only recently a muscle-bound Greek God image, now is round and jovial, though evidence of the muscles hiding underneath shows in your monstrous upper arms and barrel sized thighs. A massive belly hangs out most of the way to your knees, and pushes at the table. It laps out to either side, giving you love handles that hang out over the remnants of your jeans that are still clinging to your butt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are suddenly very thirsty, and decide to go see if there\u2019s any soda in the fridge. You push back on the chair, which groans in protest, and get to your feet. As you rise there is a further ripping sound as the tortured seams of your old jeans give way, and some of the tattered remnants fall off. You stand in the kitchen with your new layers of thick fat wobbling. A couple of pieces of t-shirt cloth hang from your thick shoulders and fattened arms, and the remains of a pair of a pair of Levi\u2019s loose fit size 34s still cling to your calves. You experimentally flex a calf and are greeted by further ripping noises. You\u2019re thankful for the muscle you added earlier - you got up much more easily than you\u2019d expected. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe floor creaks beneath your feet as you rumble over to the fridge, and you wonder vaguely how much you weigh - you must be well over 500 pounds! In the fridge you find a full two litre of Pepsi, which you guzzle on the spot as you rummage for more food. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou suddenly remember that hanging in your bedroom is a huge tartan housecoat that your uncle Larry had sent you as a gag gift last Christmas - at least, you thought it was huge last Christmas, you hope it\u2019s big enough now. Only one problem - your bedroom is upstairs!  <br>\r\nYou take a two litre of rootbeer, a loaf of bread and a 5 lb bag of apples out of the fridge. As you head down the front hallway, you wonder if you can get your vastly fattened body up the stairs to your room. This will really test all those brand new muscles, you think as you start up slowly up the stairs. The bottom stair flexes slightly as you step on it, and the next step groans under your weight. Amazingly, it seems that only balance is really a problem for going up the stairs - your new leg muscles must be even stronger than you thought. At the top of the stairs you head into your room and drop the food beside your easy chair. You tear off the remnants of your t-shirt, jeans and underwear, and dig in the closet for the housecoat. You put it on, noting that it barely meets across your gut. Wow, you think, I am enormous, as you drop your fat butt onto the easy chair which groans and settles under the sudden mammoth load. You hit the remote, to find that the comedy channel is showing a re-run of the Nutty Professor, and you\u2019ve tuned in just as he inflates to enormous size. Looking from the screen down to your huge protruding gut and back, you wonder just how big you are, and whether this is permanent or what. Didn\u2019t the wizard say you could call him if you had questions or wanted to change the effect? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFelix, Mr. Wizard, can you hear me? I\u2019ve got some questions...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the phone rings. You clamber out of the easy chair - not as easy as you thought, your belly gets in the way - to grab it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is Felix.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHi.

I can reverse it, of course, and if you don\u2019t eat enough to maintain the fat, or do enough exercise to maintain the muscle, they will slowly shrink, just like any fat or muscle.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, so I\u2019m always going to be this hungry?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you want to stay fat you are.

I\u2019ll plant a charm so that anything you currently own will change as your weight changes. But anything new you want to buy - you\u2019re on your own.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSweet, thank you, this is great!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t mention it. I reward those who do me a good turn.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUmm, one more thing. How big can I get? I mean like, is there an upper limit?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow big do you want to get? The clay and the gem will keep you healthy at any size, but there are other problems with being big. Remember, you still have to fit through doors...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n <br>\r\nThe phone is suddenly dead. You look around the room and see that, yes, the pair of jeans lying on the floor beside the bed look a lot bigger than they used to. You amble over to your underwear drawer, your huge thighs rubbing gently, to find that your boxer briefs all look big enough to fit...even you. You\u2019re suddenly hungry again, so you sit down again on the easy chair, which groans and sags beneath your weight. You gobble down the apples and bread, and guzzle the Pepsi while watching a bit more of the Nutty Professor. Even at his biggest, he\u2019s not as big as you are now, you think. Pretty good for not even out of high school yet! What to do now that you\u2019re a huge, strong fat guy, you wonder. Become a WWF wrestler? Or a powerlifter? Join a circus? Do those strong guy events, like they have on TV or at Scottish festivals? Model fat guy clothes? The world\u2019s heaviest football player? There are lots of fat computer geeks, aren\u2019t there? And engineers? And truckdrivers? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou come out of your daydream of being the world\u2019s biggest strongman and truck driver to hear the doorbell ringing. As you try to hurry to put on some clothes, you find that your new layers of flab bounce enough to really slow you down. Moving slowly and deliberately, you pull on a pair of boxer briefs which hug your fattened rump like a glove. The jeans follow, and you are impressed to find that they\u2019re big enough to fit across your belly, not just under it. A black t-shirt, blown up huge, follows. You go over to the window and yell, \u201cJust a minute.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoing downstairs proves to be trickier than going up - the balance is tougher, and you grab the banister a couple of times, hoping it won\u2019t break. When you get to the front door you find that it\u2019s:<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After your intense effort at hurrying your vastly fattened body down the stairs, you open the door to find your mother waiting there. \u201cI\u2019m sorry dear, I forgot my key.\u201d She bustles in, her arms full of shopping bags, and you look out past her to see the minivan with its tailgate up. \u201cThere\u2019s lots more groceries in the van - could you bring them in?\u201d You head down the steps, balancing carefully so your new gut doesn\u2019t pull you over, and as you stride out to the minivan, your vast gut bounces with every step. You find the back of the minivan is full of grocery bags. It looks like your mother has bought enough for at least a month! This is convenient, to say the least, as your appetite has grown so much. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n <br>\r\nAs you pick up grocery bags, you find that you can balance them on and against your belly - using it like a shelf. You fill your arms and waddle back, to find her waiting at the door. You wobble a bit as you head up the steps, but you make it safely and she takes the groceries from you. You head down the steps again, and find the balancing much easier this time. As you stride out to the minivan again, you feel happy and confident and capable of almost anything, despite your vast size. You decide to go out for football, wrestling, weightlifting - all the big guy athletic stuff you weren\u2019t big enough to do before. And if your new fat slows you down, then you\u2019ll just add more muscle to help out - after all, Felix said you\u2019d be healthy no matter what size you grew to, and that there was no limit, really. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith these happy thoughts in mind you sweep up a load of groceries and practically float back to the house. Well, you bounce, really, or at least your fat body does as you walk. You vault up the front stairs without trouble and carry the groceries into the kitchen. The floor in the kitchen creaks as you halt in front of the counter, and then it hits you - your mother hasn\u2019t said anything about your gain? It\u2019s as if she hasn\u2019t noticed. As you help her put the groceries away, you note that she has bought all your favourites, and in big quantities - huge pan lasagnas, frozen pies, lots of potatoes and hamburgers, a big sack of apples, lots of chocolate chip cookies. She gets everything put away and then microwaves you a \u201csnack\u201d - a one pound frozen Shepherd\u2019s Pie. You dig in - after all that effort, you are feeling peckish - then decide to head down the street to Brian\u2019s place. Your mum tells you not to be late for supper, as she\u2019s bought a chocolate cream pie for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you walk out to the curb, your massive body bouncing, a little old lady drives by, a sneer of disapproval on her face. A couple of 13 year olds race by on their bikes, pointing at you and yelling, \u201cDon\u2019t crack the sidewalk, fatty!\u201d As you arrive at Brian\u2019s, you wonder how he will react to your newly enlarged size. You knock and he comes to the door. <br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cHi, Rick, c\u2019mon in,\u201d he says. \u201cAre you hungry? I\u2019ve just downloaded a great new video game, you gotta try it.\u201d He says nothing as you waddle through his front door, and the two of you head up the stairs to his room. Balancing on the stairs this time seems easy - you don\u2019t grab the rail at all - but the stairs groan continuously under your weight. Brian hasn\u2019t said anything about your weight either....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn Brian\u2019s room, you drop onto a chair beside his desk - which creaks beneath you - and he offers you a jumbo bag of BBQ chips and a box of granola bars, taking a much smaller bag of cheezies for himself. He resets the game, and once the two of you have played for half an hour, he pulls out a rootbeer for both of you. Again, yours is much bigger than his - you get a two litre bottle, he gets a can. And still he hasn\u2019t said anything about your massive gain. So, you ask him, \u201cDon\u2019t you notice anything different about me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, you\u2019ve put on a few pounds, but it looks good on you! And I knew you wanted to go out for football this fall, so I figured you\u2019d be bulking up.\u201d  <br>\r\nA few pounds? When you\u2019ve gained over 400 pounds? What\u2019s going on? When Brian ducks out to the washroom, you ask out loud, \u201cFelix, Mr. Wizard, what\u2019s going on?\u201d The phone rings, and you pick it up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019ve discovered one of the side effects, have you?\u201d asked Felix in his thin voice. \u201cYou never asked me about side-effects, you may remember.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, I didn\u2019t.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWell, you\u2019ve discovered the first one: those closest to you, those you care about most notice your weight gain the least. Your mother hasn\u2019t noticed it at all - Brian only thinks you\u2019ve put on a few pounds. That little old lady saw all of your 600 pounds, though.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre there any other side effects?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWell, it depends on the person. Most people find that, after a gain, they\u2019re ravenously hungry until they\u2019ve eaten as much weight of food as the gain they\u2019ve had. But the clay tends to facilitate this too - that lasagna your mother cooked, and those huge snacks Brian is giving you, are not accidents.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cIs that all?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt depends on the person. Watch and observe!\u201d and the phone goes dead just as Brian stepped back into the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho was that?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cJust my mum, reminding me about dinner.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cOK, I guess you\u2019re going then. See you later.\u201d Brian turns back to the video game as you rise out of the chair and leave the room. Going down the stairs seems really easy this time, but as you get to the bottom your gut is suddenly wrenched by hunger. You hurry the two blocks home, stopping only at the corner store to buy an ice cream sandwich - and find the store is having a two-for-one special on those.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou arrive home, your hunger driving you to walk very quickly, and as you come in through the door your mother says,<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I hope you brought your appetite - the store only had big birds.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure mom,\u201d you reply.  \u201cYou know me, since I got big, I\u2019m always hungry.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, I know.  But this bird is so big, I think it will satisfy even you!\u201d  She takes the turkey out of the oven, and you can see that it\u2019s enormous - easily 30 pounds!  It smells heavenly, though, and with your stomach practically gurgling with hunger, you lay the table.  Garlic mashed potatoes - a huge bowl.  Stuffing - two pans.  A huge bowl of french beans.  A huge bowl of squash.  A big sweet potato casserole.  A shrimp salad.  A macaroni salad.  A loaf of cranberry bread.  A big tureen of gravy.  As you lay all these things out, and your mother carves the turkey, an old part of your brain says you could never eat all this.  Another, new part argues that yes you can!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sit down at the table - noticing briefly that your chair is much broader and stronger than you remember - and begin to tuck into the food.  Your mother takes a small plate for herself, and eats slowly, talking to you about her work, your cousins, the news, while you shovel the food into your mouth as if you haven\u2019t eaten in weeks.  You\u2019re amazed at the urgency you feel in eating - it\u2019s as if your body can\u2019t wait to inhale the mountain of grub before it.  Your mother, though, seems to take this as normal - she only pauses to carve more meat off the bird, push another dish towards you, and, amazingly, to refill the mashed potato bowl when you\u2019ve cleaned it out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou eat, and eat, and eat.  The part of your brain that said you couldn\u2019t eat all this is in awe of your gormandizing capacity, while the rest of your brain is enjoying the act of stuffing yourself with food and looking for more.  Steadily, the huge mound of food on the table vanishes into your voracious maw.  In your old body, you would have felt stuffed in no time, but the gut on this 600 pound version seems to be bottomless - though you notice it swelling out in front of you, your gut doesn\u2019t feel full.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou carry on eating, and eating, and eating, stuffing food into yourself until all that\u2019s left on the table are the bones of the turkey, the stems of some beans, and the tails of some shrimp.  Somehow, the whole tableful of food has been transferred into your gut, less only the little plateful your mom ate.  She looks up sweetly at you and asks,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",
