Things had been going well enough for you this morning - it didn't rain like the forecast said it would and you could enjoy walking to Royal Woods Elementary, nor were you feeling jittery or unprepared for Mrs. Johnson's test - but as soon as you stepped inside the building you began noticing it.  Well, whatever <i>it</i> was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor reasons you couldn't explain, you felt like you were being prodded and poked by hundred of sharp needles.  It took everything you had not to draw attention to your situation, even though it was becoming increasingly difficult for you focus on anything.  No need to make everyone else worry or feel as uncomfortable as you.  It would be best to just tough out the class and complete the test.  Of course, Mrs. Johnson noticed you fidgeting in your seat along with a clear sign of agitation written on your face as she was handing out the tests.  When she asked if you were well, your initial response what that you were still a little tired but you were otherwise feeling alright.  She continued to dispense test papers, although you could tell she was not satisfied with your response.  About ten minutes into test time, Mrs. Johnson took notice of your discomfort and agitation once more.  She had correctly deduced that you were unwell and, out of concern for your health, requested that you go to the school infirmary.  Despite your insistence that you were \"fine\", which you weren't, Agnes would not hear of it.  She said she would postpone your test until later - after you visited the school nurse - but you had to leave immediately.  Out of respect for your very caring teacher, and because you didn't want to fail a test you studied your brain out for, you complied with her request - even if she kind of twisted your arm a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo here you are now, walking towards the school infirmary and lost in your thoughts.  What exactly is wrong with you?  What did you do to trigger it, or if not you then what happened to you?  You aren't the most physically active kid in this neck of the woods (no pun intended) so you know it isn't a sports injury.  If anything you aren't so much in pain as you're feeling...sensitive?  Also, you never had a reason to visit the infirmary, much less the nurse, so what would she be like?  Is she nice?  Is she uptight?  Can she even figure out what's wrong with you and fix it with one visit?  You don't want to see any doctors if you can help it.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seems all of those answers, or most of them, lay just beyond the door in front of you.  After a moment of hesitation, you open it.  The room looks about what you would expect from an infirmary, but that's not what grabs your attention.  Standing beside a cupboard is a rather attractive brunette wearing red lipstick and a teal nurse's uniform tightening the lid of a medicine jar.  As she finished screwing the lid back on, she notices you in the corner of eye and looks in your direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreeting you with a smile she said, \"Hello there.  Who might you be?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can't help but feel a little giddy.  You've only been in this woman's presence for only five seconds and you've already concluded that she's as nice as she is pretty.  So you smile back and tell her your name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think I've ever seen you before, but it's still nice to meet you.  I'm Patti, the school nurse, though I think you might have guessed that already.\"  She followed that introduction up with chuckle.  \"So what brings you here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuch a charming woman.  You can't help but like her already.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" you begin as you gently rub your arm, \"I don't know why but ever since I got to school I've been feeling really... sensitive?  It's getting been harder to deal with by the minute.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe nurse's expression turns to one of light concern.  \"Sensitive?\" she asked, \"How sensitive?  Are you in any pain?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not really,\" you say, \"but it's getting harder to deal with by the minute.  Even Mrs. Johnson could tell something was wrong with me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see,\" said Patti.  \"Well, don't take this personally but if you're really not feeling well then you shouldn't try to hide it or pretend it's not there.  I'm sure you had your reasons, but it's important to look after yourself.  You're nothing if you're not healthy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo kid likes being lectured, you included, but when Nurse Patti did it to you it didn't come off as patronizing to you at all.  It sounded like genuine concern and that she was speaking from the heart - or even past experience.  In any case, she was not only right but she had chosen the right profession.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, Nurse Patti.  I'll remember that for the future.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPatti nodded in satisfaction and gave a tiny smile.  \"That's all I can ask from anyone, student or no student.  So where are you feeling sensitive?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hesitate before telling her.  \"Well...\"</span></div></div>",

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">It seems \"Tickle Fever\" has struck Royal Woods, Michigan - and you are in the midst of it.*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut yeah; the premise of this interactive is pretty straightforward: you can choose to be male or female and to either tickle or be tickled by female characters from The Loud House, especially those from the <i>loudest</i> family in this otherwise quiet town.  There's not much else to say except the following guidelines.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><b>RULES</b></u><br>\r\n1. Try not to veer too far away from the tickling aspect of this interactive.<br>\r\n2. No nudity - except for comical purposes.<br>\r\n3. No sex.<br>\r\n4. No short/troll/zero effort chapters.  I shouldn't have to include this rule, but it's there.<br>\r\n5. Please proofread before submitting something (because I do read this stuff).  I don't mind helping out, but if I have to rewrite a whole chapter then I'll just delete the addition.  That's me being nice.<br>\r\n6. Use 2nd person perspective in your writing, seeing how your character is a POV avatar and all that.<br>\r\n7. Female characters only.  Lincoln is the one exception to the rule (he's girly enough <img loading=\"lazy\" style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/golucky.png\" alt=\"*GoLucky*\" title=\"GoLucky\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\">) although you may choose his genderbent counterpart, Linka, if you wish.  I'm not including Lily as an option for obvious reasons.<br>\r\n8. Have fun. <img loading=\"lazy\" style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/smile.png\" alt=\"*Smile*\" title=\"Smile\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<sub>*This part is not meant to be taken literally; it's just a figure of speech.  Or is it?</sub><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>UPDATE:</b> It has occurred to me that this interactive is almost a month old now and nearly 700 views within that time.  I have to say I'm both surprised and amused by this turn of events.  I mean, all I've done so far is write stupid selection chapters and scenario set-ups for our main characters, the Louds (and do <i><b>one</b></i> actual chapter).  I admit that coming up with concepts for Loud scenarios took even longer than I had intended, but I hope to make up for it in substance.  The following screenshot pretty much sums up the creative process of the whole thing.  That and my unforgiving schedule.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a class=\"blue2roll\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/theloudhouse/images/b/be/Animatorcommentary.png/revision/latest?cb=20180412172338\" target=\"_blank\">https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/theloudhouse/images/b/be/Animatorcommentary....</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlso. I didn't realize there were this many LH fans hiding out in this place.  Hopefully, I (and perhaps anyone reading this) will be able to add more to this thing in the future and watch it grow even further.  And remember: if you don't like the scenarios I've come up with, feel free to come with your own.  That's why I've given you the option.  Anyway, that's it.  Cheers and stay loud! <img loading=\"lazy\" style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/thumbsupl.png\" alt=\"*ThumbsUpL*\" title=\"ThumbsUpL\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"></td>",
