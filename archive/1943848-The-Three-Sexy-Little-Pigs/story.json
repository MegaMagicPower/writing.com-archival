Their mother knew it was time to let them go out and see the world, so she told them, \"Oh, my three little daughters. Please go out and see the world, for I cannot take care of you any more. You must build your houses, one for each of you, and stay safe. Watch out for the Big Bad Wolf too! He preys on young female pigs like you!\" They all nodded, \"Okay mother!\" And set out into the forest. Paige Pig made a house out of straw, Petunia pig made a house out of sticks, and Penellope made one of bricks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLittle did they know, around the corner in the forest was the Big Bad Wolf. He sniffed the air and smiled, licking his muzzle. \"Oooh, I smell tasty little female pigs. A great meal for me.\" He could feel his huge cock erecting. He thought, \"Hmmm.... which one should I go hunt first?\"</span></div></div>",

Let me into your house!\" Paige oinked, \"Oh, I will when pigs fly!\" The wolf growled, \"So that's how it'll be then?\" His cock throbbed. His stomach rumbled.

She began crying as she felt his huge cock glide over her pussy. It finally found it's mark as he rammed it in as she squealed, lifting her legs up. Her vagina felt like it was burning as he raped her cunt, pushing it deeper. She looked at the knot as she saw it coming, \"Oh god no! Not the knot! Please, STOP!\" she cried. The wolf growled, \"I won't stop until you're bred like the slut you are! You will be my mate!\" Paige continued crying, tears streaming down her cheeks as the knot entered.

He was surrounded by crates and chests, all lining the walls of a five-foot-square chamber.  He didn't remotely care about the contents of those, though.  He came down here for something far different.  The only thing he could possibly want from this room was the small kerosene lamp that was conveniently left on one of the boxes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I could certainly use some light...\" he said as he plucked it from its perch and wandered out into some underground hallway.  \"What on earth is all of this..?\"  A few steps forward would reveal he was...</span></div></div>",

The hallway was short, and the wolf could see a room beyond it; a few steps would bring him inside of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe room in question did seem, in fact, to be a bunker.  It was built out of concrete, mostly, and moderately-sized to fit a number of amenities; one corner of the room fit a dining area comprised of a table, an electric range and a chair.  Another held a radio, a ragged loveseat, and a television; just between these two corners sat a gas-powered generator.  Yet another held a wash-basin and a dripping faucet.  The last had a cot pushed into the corner, covered with a single sheet and a pillow, with another lantern beside it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolf wondered aloud:  \"Why..?\"  Why would the pig put so much effort into a concrete bunker when she'd put so little effort into the straw hut above?  Couldn't she have built the above-ground structure out of concrete, as well?  And, maybe then, she'd have felt justified in actually furnishing her house.  The wolf shook his head as he wandered about the room, looking for the escaped swine.  This was, presumably, the only place she could go.  If she wasn't here...  Where was she?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolf glanced outside of the room, back into the hallway, just to make sure he didn't miss anything.  Lo and behold...  He didn't.  The hallway simply led back to the ladder room.  He certainly didn't see anybody in there.  What was he missing?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt dawned on the wolf, after a moment of thought, that if the pig had bothered to build an underground bunker...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe'd have made an escape hatch somewhere inside of the bunker, as well.  While the sow was still missing, he now had some inkling as to where to look for her.  Coming back into the bunker's living area, he began to scan the walls for any inconspicuous latches or hinges; anything that seemed out-of-place.  Failing to find anything hiding in plain sight, he figured he'd move the one piece of furniture that could actually hide anything:  The loveseat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShoving the ugly green thing aside, he found exactly what he was looking for, hiding just behind it...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The Wolf decided he'd pursue the Penellope, the oldest of the pig sisters.  He knew she'd be the most difficult to get at, though; he could huff, and he could puff, but he could not blow a brick house down.  And she certainly wouldn't come to him if she knew what he had in store for her.  He'd have to use some of his cunning -- No, <i>all</i> of his cunning -- if he wanted to have his way with the pig.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, first thing's first,\" he thought to himself.  \"I'll have to watch her for a bit.\"  He'd need to learn about Penllope, figure out how her day progresses, what she does...  When she's most vulnerable.  You know, the usual espionage stuff.  He'd see how she lived, from sun-up to sun-down.  Being midday, however, he'd already missed the boat, so to speak.  \"It's alright.  I'll just come back tomorrow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"> <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/vignette6.png\" alt=\"*Vignette6*\" title=\"Vignette6\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"> <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/vignette6.png\" alt=\"*Vignette6*\" title=\"Vignette6\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"> <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/vignette6.png\" alt=\"*Vignette6*\" title=\"Vignette6\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"> </div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd come back tomorrow, he did.  At around 7 AM, he stealthily approached the small brick house, tip-toeing up to the front door.  The pig didn't have much in the way of a lawn or any sort of outdoor decor; no fences, no hedges, no plants, no paving, not even a welcome mat.  The Wolf couldn't help but be struck by just how plain the swine's house was...  On the outside, at least.  He shrugged; it shouldn't be too hard to make his way around the house.  He stepped away from the door and began peeking into Penellope's windows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first window, as the Wolf had thought, looked into the living room.  It was rather sparse; there were a few portraits, here and there, of other pigs (presumably relatives), a small loveseat, a coffee table, and an oddly-large fireplace, with a closed door on the left wall.  The fireplace, nearly taking up the entire 8-foot-wide back wall, was clearly the focus of the room, dwarfing both the table and loveseat that sat in front of it.  The wolf's mind was brought to thoughts of cozy winter nights spent sitting in front of the fire...  With a fat, squealing pig bound, spitted and rolling above the flame, roasting alive.  The wolf shuddered with pleasure, but regained his composure and crept over to the next window.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Big Bad Wolf was now looking into Penellope Pig's kitchen, which was somewhat more elaborately furnished than her living room.  It had all of the amenities you'd put in a kitchen:  Stove, countertop and drawers, utensil rack, refrigerator...  All huddled together on the back wall.  The refrigerator was fairly large, one of those double-door industrial refrigerators, fixed into the wall, the kind you'd expect to find in a restaurant...  And not in a small house with a single occupant.  Right next to the refrigerator, and at the very end of the wall, was a door that had been left ajar.  The inside was dark, but the wolf could make out a few jars and cans; clearly, this was a pantry.  He couldn't tell how big it was, but if the refrigerator was any indication, it was probably a significant size.  Other than all of these things, the only thing of note in the kitchen was a doorway connecting it to the living room.  \"On to the next window, then...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolf had to make his way around the house to find the next window.  It wasn't a long trek, and it certainly wasn't eventful; the pig's \"backyard\" was about as non-existent as her front yard.  He spied a stand of raspberry bushes nearby the edge of the forest clearing, but otherwise?  Nothing at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis next window looked into the pig's bathroom.  If the Big Bad Wolf were a more whimsical character, he'd restate the previous sentence, taking care to place heavy, <b>heavy</b> emphasis on the word \"bath.\"  There was only about five square-feet of tiled floor-space available in the whole thing, as what wasn't occupied by the toilet and sink housed an enormous bathtub.  The wolf didn't even know if he could call it a bathtub; it looked more like a jacuzzi.  The behemoth basin was nearly 7-feet-by-5-feet wide, taking up the entire wall in which the window was fixed, as well as a good portion of the two adjacent walls.  As the wolf boggled at the size of the \"bathtub,\" his attention was brought to loud snoring beyond the doorway next to the toilet, through which he could see a dainty hoof.  The wolf knew he was getting close to his target.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdging over to the next window, he found himself looking into Penellope's bedroom.  It wasn't very elaborate, in and of itself, but it did contain some interesting things.  Against the back wall, beside a closed door which presumably led into the living room, was a 45-inch flat-screen television, which impressed the wolf somewhat.  Against another wall was a calendar, a bookshelf...  And a bathroom scale, conspicuously placed somewhere that <i>wasn't</i> a bathroom.  Atop the waist-high bookshelf was what appeared to be a journal and a pen; the wolf couldn't tell what it said on the cover, as it was too far away.  Beside the bookshelf was a small table, only a foot high, which held a lamp, a digital clock and an empty plate.  The wolf's eyes continued along the wall, only a couple inches more, to find the pig's bed, a single king-sized mattress on the floor, piled high with pillows, comforters and other assorted bedding...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a 5'4\" 180-pound pig-girl laying right in the middle.  The wolf was taken aback slightly by this turn of events; he thought he'd smelled a sexy <u>little</u> pig, not...  This.  She was still kinda sexy, if you were into that sort of thing, I suppose.  With nice, wide hips, thick thighs, a fat, juicy ass, and probably at least DD-cup breasts, he'd still fuck her.  Cherubic cheeks, a sizable potbelly with a set of burgeoning love handles, flabby arms, and toneless legs, however...  He'd <i>still</i> fuck her, but perhaps not as enthusiastically.  He'd still be enthusiastic, but he might feel a twinge of shame afterwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEither way, the wolf thought, she definitely looked like good eating.  He could probably eat off of her for at least a couple of days.  The wolf's mind wandered away from sexual predation into <i>actual</i> predation, fantasizing about how she'd tasted, how tender her meat would be...  How much fatter she could get...  The wolf drooled at the thought of tearing into her fat gut, pulling away chunks of greasy bacon and lard that would melt in his mouth...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Big Bad Wolf stared, transfixed by the portly Penellope, not realizing that he'd let a couple of hours pass from first seeing her.  As she stirred, the wolf was brought back to his original task, ducking down so as not to be seen by the waking pig.  As if on cue, the nude swine rose from her nest on the floor, stretching her flabby arms skyward as she yawned to greet the day.  Her back was to the window as she got on her knees and lifted her thick ass into the air...  Before losing her balance and tumbling backwards into the window.  \"Whoooooooahaahahahaaa!\" she cried, as her buttocks hit the pane hard, pressing into the glass and giving the wolf a lovely few of her rump as it spread against the flat surface.  The wolf gazed onward as she squealed, struggling to right herself as she shimmied against the window, pulling the 'cheeks left and right...  He swore that he even saw her asshole for a moment!  How arousing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually she managed to regain her balance, muttering to herself with her back still to the window, and made her way over to the scale, her flesh jiggling with each stride.  She stepped onto the scale, and a moment later, stepped off, looking quite pleased with herself.  She took the nearby journal and jotted down a note; the wolf thought it might have been some kind of weight-loss journal, perhaps?  Finished with this part of her morning routine, she made her way over to the kitchen.  The wolf quietly followed her over to continue watching the pig as she was digging around in her refrigerator.  A moment later, she pulled out a pizza box, with half a pizza still inside, and brought it into the living room.  As soon as she plopped herself down on the loveseat, she almost literally dove into the cold pizza, scarfing down all of the meat, dough and cheese as if it was common pig-slop, finishing what appeared to be ten large slices of pizza in only five minutes.  \"That's a blue-ribbon appetite if I've ever seen one...\" the Big Bad Wolf mused to himself.  \"No wonder she isn't so little.\"  The pig paused for a moment, and the wolf tensed; did she hear him?  They were both relieved, in different ways, a second later, when Penellope lifted her ass slightly to let loose a noisy, wet fart.  The wolf looked disgusted; the pig looked pleased with herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Wolf watched the pig sit on her fat ass for a few moments before she got up again, this time she was...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, fuck, she's heading for the front door!\" the wolf hissed as he dove around the corner.  The pig opened the door and headed outside, leaving the wolf's sight a few minutes later.  The wolf <i>would</i> follow her, but this was a wonderful chance to enter her house, the entrance of which she had rather stupidly left <i>wide open</i>.  The wolf waltzed right on in, making a beeline for the swine's room to sate his curiosity as to what the pig kept in her journal.  Already, the he could see that he was right about his earlier guess as the words \"Penney's Weight Journal\" were emblazoned across the top.  He cracked open the book, and began taking in all of the numbers...  To find he was only <i>half</i>-right; this wasn't a weight-loss journal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>This was a weight-<b>gain</b> journal, of all things!</i>  The wolf's eyes darted across the pages, taking in all of the records of calories consumed, pounds gained, and excited little notes about how fat she was getting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlready, the wolf had a good profile of Penellope pig.  Lazy, fat, gluttonous, crude, <i>dumb</i>, and a feedee.  Perhaps he could...  Encourage her interest in growth a bit?  He could eat a fat pig tonight, or he could eat an <b>enormous</b> pig later.  Plots whirled in the wolf's head, so much he could do.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The Big Bad Wolf spent a good five minutes mulling over all of the information he'd gathered from his relatively-short scouting mission.  As soon as he'd finished considering all of the useful facts (of which there were probably only five, maybe <i>eight</i>, tops), he began to fantasize about \"little\" Penellope, and how much further from \"little\" she could possibly go.  He was a hungry wolf, no doubt about it, but he <i>could</i> be a patient wolf, whenever he wanted.  If he needed to wait a couple of months for Penellope to pack on some extra poundage, he would.  But, maybe the wolf didn't have to be patient, didn't have to stand idly by as the swine ate her way up to greater size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYes, he could have a much more active role, if he played his cards right.  He wouldn't have to watch; he could guide her to morbid obesity himself, and much faster than she could on her own!  But how?  He'd need to get closer to the porker, and it wouldn't be as simple as entering the house was.  He'd have to gain her confidence, become a \"friend\" to her...  But there were some clear obstacles to doing so, most plain of which was his species.  Pigs don't typically trust wolves, and for good reason, of course.  Wolves were cruel, ravenous, and destructive; you know, just all-around unpleasant.  And Big Bad was no different from any other wolf; in fact, he was probably worse.  Standing 7 feet tall, weighing 300 pounds of mostly muscle, a hulking physique not covered by clothing...  No doubt a pig would look at him and run (or waddle, perhaps) for the hills.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolf shrugged, as he often did.  Even if the odds of making productive contact with the pig were almost non-existent, he'd try, anyway.  What did he have to lose?  Failure only meant that he'd be eating a relatively \"small\" pig instead of the ball of pork and lard he was envisioning.  He had a new mission, now:  Befriend the pig.  And his job was to figure out the best way to do that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. Wolf took the liberty, so long as he was still in the pig's home, of perusing through all of her belongings.  In her room, he still only saw what he'd seen through the window; the only thing new was a small phone placed right next to Penellope's bed...  Along with a stack of dirty plates.  He took a peek in her bathroom, seeing more of the same from earlier.  He took note of a few of the various soaps he found lying around the jacuzzi-tub:  Lilac and rose.  Was this important?  Possibly.  He spied a can of scented spray sitting on top of her toilet:  Rose-scented.  She certainly likes rose, it seems.  A thought flashed through his mind:  If <i>he</i> could smell the pigs...  Could <i>they</i> smell <i>him</i>?  The wolf winced as he realized how much \"evidence\" he was leaving in her home; surely, she'd smell a wolf if it had been in her room.  He'd just have to take the can of spray with him, and spray it every time he left a room; hopefully, rose-scent would overpower wolf-scent, and hopefully, the rose-scent wouldn't make her suspicious.  He liberally doused the bathroom with canned spray, and shot some into the bedroom, as well, before darting into the living room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe living room was just as boring from the inside as it looked on the outside.  The only thing different was that the loveseat seemed even smaller and the fireplace seemed even larger.  The wolf's eyes scanned the walls, looking at all of the various portraits and photographs scattered about, all of which were very boring...  Except for one which he found quite...  <i>Interesting.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a photograph of a somewhat slimmer, smiling Penellope Pig sitting on a bench...  With a slender, smiling red fox.  They had their arms around each-other, the pig leaning into the fox...  And the fox feeding the pig an ice-cream cone.  So, Penellope was...  <i>Open-minded</i>, when it came to suitors, if she'd let a predator (albeit a weak one) be so close to her.  The wolf grinned as he realized that he wouldn't have as hard a time as he thought he would in coming into the hog's life...  Well, he knew it would still be rather difficult, but not impossible.  He blasted the room with spray and ventured into the final room of the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolf was struck with a...  Almost indescribable odor as he entered the kitchen.  It wasn't exactly a <i>bad</i> smell, but it was quite overpowering.  It was a smell that seemed like it was made up of at least ten other smells, probably more.  Greasy fried chicken, melted cheese, garlic, sponge cake...  And roses.  The wolf held his breath as he wandered through the small room.  He pulled open the refrigerator, finding it to be full of various flavors of soda and a number of take-out boxes.  Checking the pantry, he found it to be larger on the inside than it first appeared.  Not <i>much</i> larger, mind you, but large enough to house at least a hundred cans of soup, bags of potatoes and onions...  And a chest freezer.  The deep chest freezer was full to the brim with multi-gallon tubs of off-brand ice cream; not exactly surprising.  The wolf blasted both rooms with another shot of rose-scent before heading back to the bathroom to replace the can.  The last thing the wolf did before fleeing the house was loosen the window in the kitchen so that he might come back at a later time...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Big Bad Wolf declared the day to be <i>very</i> productive, heading back to his own home to brainstorm ways to win over fat \"little\" Penellope for the rest of the day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/vignette6.png\" alt=\"*Vignette6*\" title=\"Vignette6\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"> <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/vignette6.png\" alt=\"*Vignette6*\" title=\"Vignette6\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"> <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/vignette6.png\" alt=\"*Vignette6*\" title=\"Vignette6\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"> </div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Big Bad Wolf, feeling ambitious, decided he'd make his move as soon as possible; and today seemed like a pretty good time.  He'd arrive, looking as finely-groomed as he could manage.  He'd thought up a \"welcome to the neighborhood\" script that he'd recite to her, trying to sell to her that he was simply being neighborly.  He'd present her a bundle of roses in a little wicker basket with assorted fruits, as a nicety, but figured what could <i>really</i> win her over was the large chocolate cake he'd brought with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe strolled up to her door at roughly 11 AM, figuring she'd certainly be awake at this time (and hopefully, still in the house), knocking twice.  The wolf took four steps back from the door, hoping he wouldn't intimidate her, and waited to be greeted.  He waited...  And waited...  And waited.  Was she home?  A few moments later, he had his answer when the door flew open, a slightly agitated and dripping-wet pig-girl standing behind it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, hello?\" Penellope flatly stated, having not quite registered who her visitor was.  \"I was in the middle of a bath.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, my apologies, Miss!\" the Big Bad Wolf exclaimed, as cheerfully as he could.  \"I didn't mean to bother you!  I just wanted to drop by and say 'Hello,' you know.  I was walking by just yesterday and realized that you'd moved in, and I thought to myself, 'Gee, I should really come by and introduce myself!'\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pig shifted uncomfortably, finally realizing that she was talking to a big, bad wolf, the kind her mother told her would devour her on the spot should he catch her.  \"O-oh..?  Really?  ...  Th-thanks...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awwwww, why do you sound so frightened?  There's no need to be frightened...\"  The wolf feigned an expression of hurt.  \"I don't mean any trouble, honest!  See, I just saw somebody new in the neighborhood, and I wanted to make them feel welcome...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-oh, really?  I'm...  I'm sorry,\" Penellope stammered.  The wolf thought she sounded a little...  Guilty.  That certainly works.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...  I know I'm a scary-looking wolf, but I'm not scary.  I guess I'll just...  I'll just go, then...  But I'd be remiss if I didn't give you <i>these</i>.\"  The wolf motioned towards the basket, which Penellope smiled weakly at as he handed it over to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, thank you!\" she said hollowly as she placed it on the floor.  \"That was very nice of...  Erm, what have you got there?..\"  Penellope had just noticed the large cake the wolf had brought along.  Her weak smile grew bigger and more genuine by the second.  The wolf half-smirked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, this?  Just a <i>triple</i>-chocolate cake that I baked...\"  The wolf, of course, didn't actually bake it, but that's beside the point.  \"I baked it yesterday, made the icing myself, and filled it with chocolate mousse.  My friends love this recipe...\"  Penellope licked her snout in anticipation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is...  Is that for me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah!  I thought a home-made cake would be a great way to start a new friendship.  But I guess you don't really feel like talking...\"  The wolf faked a pout, despite feeling good.  <i>Was this working?  Was his ploy actually <b>working</b></i>?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, no, no!  Come in, come in!  Please, I insist!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, if...  If you <i>insist</i>.\"  The wolf smiled genially at his host as he hunched through the pig's doorway, brushing against the swine's bare gut as he made his way over to the loveseat, placing his cake on the coffee table and his ass on a cushion in one graceful movement.  The pig, still sopping wet, bounced after him, clearly excited by his baked goods, flopping onto the loveseat with a hearty <i>poomph</i> and an ominous <i>crrrreeeeak</i> from the strained furniture.  \"Shall I get some plates?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, yeah, yeah, sure!  Uh, they're in the kitchen, right on the counter...\" the pig said, her eyes transfixed on the rich chocolate cake.  The wolf got up, only making it to the doorway before he heard the pig dive into the dessert face-first.  She attacked it much like shark would kill a seal, and the wolf couldn't help but smile as the pig behaved just as pigs do.  He simply stood in the doorway, watching the fatass devour all 20000 calories by herself in only four minutes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, my...\" the wolf sighed.  \"<i>Somebody</i> liked my cake!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pig grimaced, realizing that she'd left none for the wolf.  \"...  Sorry.\"  Icing and mousse coated her face and breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, think nothing of it!  It WAS for you, after all!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha, ha, I guess it was.  Thanks!  That was great!  Um...\"</span></div></div>",

Greedy swine, didn't save any for your guest!</i>  She admonished herself mentally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why, that sounds <i>delightful,</i>\" said the Big Bad Wolf, with his continued forced charm.  Into her bedroom <i>already</i>?  \"Where is the television?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...  It's in my room.  Well, uh, follow me, then.\"  The naked pig hefted herself off of the couch, chocolate icing running down her snout, neck and the top of her now-distended belly.  The wolf could guess that the cake hadn't been her only meal today, and she was already churning away at another half a pizza, or maybe a whole rotisserie chicken or something.  <i>My, my, what a pig,</i> he thought to himself, as he watched her ass wobble with each plodding step.  He waited for her to enter the room before he rose from his seat, striding into Penellope's room in half the time she'd taken.  She'd already plopped her fat ass down onto her rat's nest of a bed, switching the flat-screen television on to some stupid reality show, or something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike a good guest, he waited to be invited onto the bed with the swine.  Watching the pig attentively as she absent-mindedly scooped globs of icing off of her body and put them in her mouth, he stood a whole four minutes before the pig had acknowledged his presence.  With an awkward throat-clearing, the wolf had the pig's attention.  <i>Well, strike two, Penellope...</i>  She just couldn't help herself; she just couldn't stop screwing up.  She awkwardly waved him over to sit beside her, and like a good guest, he did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your, uh...  Your room smells nice,\" the wolf said.  He figured small-talk might help break the ice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, thanks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pair silently stared at the television for over an hour before one of them said another word.  The wolf glanced over at the obnoxious porker, who was clearly entranced by the television and oblivious to the wolf.  What does he do, now?  They're not exactly hitting it off.  He's in her room, but he might as well not even be there, for all the attention she's paid him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Might I, uh...  Use the restroom?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, yeah.  It's...  It's over there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolf brought himself to his feet and padded lazily over to the restroom door.  Out of the corner of his eye, he saw the scale that she kept in her bedroom.  \"Oh, what's this?\" he said, feigning curiosity.  He stepped over to the scale, snapping the pig out of her trance only by virtue of blocking her view of the television.  \"A bathroom scale?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...  Uh, yeah,\" Penellope grunted out, obvious discomfort overtaking her face.  \"Ha ha...  There's not much room in the bathroom for it, so I guess it lives in here...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see...\"  The pig fell into abject horror as the wolf did exactly what she'd hoped he wouldn't:  Pick up her \"journal.\"  \"And what's <i>this</i>?  A journal, it appears?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...  Put it down, please.\"  The pig was never ashamed of being fat, but she was a little embarrassed about her obsession with getting larger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"'Penney's Weight Journal?'  Are you on a diet?\"  The wolf said, as he opened to a random page.  \"Oh, silly girl, you don't need to diet...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...  I know.\"  If pigs could sweat, she'd be sweating buckets.  All hope of keeping her little fetish under wraps was quickly dying.  <i>Maybe he won't read it...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh, but he did.  \"Why, you're not on a diet at all!\"  He exclaimed, twirling a bit.  He wasn't quite sure what he was doing at that moment, but he was sure that it was effective.  \"No, it looks like you're trying to <i>gain</i> weight!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pig fell silent as the wolf smiled.  \"...  Yeah...  I do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, what's the problem, love?  See, I've got a secret, too...\"  He leaned in closer to the pig as he was about to drop his bombshell.  \"I like 'larger' women.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh!..  You do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, my, yes!  A woman with meat on her bones,\" the wolf cringed at his own wordplay.  \"...  Drives me absolutely <i>wild.</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It does?\"  The pig sounded...  Excited?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, you beautiful creature!  Say...\"  Here it comes; the \"final blow.\"  Here's where he seals the deal.  \"I don't suppose...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I don't suppose...  You've got a boyfriend?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not...  Not at the moment...\"  The pig was blushing furiously, her pink, jowly cheeks turning bright red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, how would you like it if...  <i>I</i> was your man?  I'd help you get even bigger...  I know it must not be much fun to go at this alone...\"  The wolf flourished a moment.  \"Wouldn't it be wonderful, love, to have a big, strong man hold you as he feeds you slice after slice of rich, chocolate cake?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pig was clearly excited by this offer.  \"Oh, yes!  Yes, yes, yes!  I'd love to be your girlfriend, Mr...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, love...  Call me Bi-\"  The wolf caught himself before he offered his \"title.\"  \"Call me Bill.  Bill Wolf.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you can call me Penellope Pig, Bill.  This is the beginning of a <i>beautiful</i> relationship.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I'm sure...\" the wolf grinned.  He won.  Easy, unlimited access to his prey.  An active part in her fattening.  And hey, he wasn't even lying about liking fat women!  He was a bit thrown off the other day when he saw her, but you know what?  He didn't hate what he saw.  He'd enjoy her both carnally...  And carnivorously, in due time.  The wolf settled down into the bed with his new \"girlfriend,\" curling up behind her as he placed a large paw on her doughy gut.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Soooo...\" the swine giggled.  \"How many calories do you think were in that cake..?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...  Probably a good 20000.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe porker grinned; she was going to do just what a pig should:  Get fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey sat quietly for hours, her licking frosting off herself and him kneading her flabby belly, each only stopping to retrieve something from the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>A beautiful relationship, indeed...</i></span></div></div>",

Just drop a voucher or a gift card through her mail slot, and she'll (hopefully) just waddle on down to the restaurant and eat as much as she could without bursting.

Yeah...\"  But, if she ever decided it was too much trouble to actually move her fat ass all the way to a restaurant that was less than two miles away...  Well, he'd cross that bridge when he came to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile he didn't have anything lined up at the moment, he had faith that his network of \"acquaintances\" would come through for him...  Given the right prodding and arm-twisting, of course.  The wolf ultimately decided that both options were \"feasible enough,\" given his potential means.  The only thing left to do was to decide which he'd go with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...  He'd also probably head to Kinkos to make a nice looking \"congratulatory\" card to slip into her mail slot.  Can't forget to do that.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The Big Bad Wolf decided he'd give Penelope a lifetime of free food at a buffet in the nearest town.  That'd probably give her the most bang for his proverbial buck.  Plus, he knew the owner...  <i>Somewhat</i> well.  The wolf would just have to have a little talk with him...  The wolf set off on his way to meet this acquaintance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn hour or so later, the Wolf found himself in town.  It wasn't a particularly large town, being that it was right on the edge of a forest in the middle of nowhere, but it had all of the amenities and luxuries one could expect from urban life.  Such as restaurants, for instance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Wolf didn't need to travel far before he passed by one such restaurant:  An all-you-can-eat buffet, to be more precise.  This would probably be where he sent the pig to feed herself to greater levels of obesity, but it wasn't his destination.  No, <i>that</i> would be a two-story brick building just a block down from the buffet, where he'd be paying a surprise visit to his \"dear\" friend, the Sly Fox.  He strolled up to the front door, took a deep breath...  And gently exhaled, stopping himself from blowing down the door; it was simply a reflex at this point.  He rapped on the door rather loudly and stepped back, waiting to be let in.  After waiting a minute or so, the door opened a crack, revealing a small brown paw reaching through, followed by a vulpine muzzle, and the face of the fox it belonged to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, Mister...  Mister Wolf...\" said the Sly Fox.  \"What a...  Pleasant surprise, you coming all the way to see me.  I wasn't aware that you, ah...  Knew where I lived.\"  The fox shot him a forced smile, which the wolf returned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, Mister Fox...\" the wolf returned the vulpine's sarcastic greeting.  \"Yes, I was just in town, and I would be remiss if I didn't come visit my <i>dear friend.</i>  Please, might I come in?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe brown fox sighed, opening the door to let the wolf into his den.  \"Yes...  Come in.  Welcome to my humble abode...\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt certainly was a rather humble abode.  From where the wolf stood, he could see a modest living room, furnished with your standard loveseat, a coffee table, a couple of end tables, an armchair...  All arranged just as you'd expect in front of a television.  The walls were painted a rather boring white, scarcely decorated with some framed photographs and a cabinet holding a few pieces of china.  The wall opposite the front door housed an archway leading into a stairwell, and just to the right of the pair was a closed door.  \"Please, do pardon me a moment...\" the fox muttered before he turned around.  \"Vivian!  We have company!\" the fox shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, do we?  I wasn't expecting company...\" a voice drifted down from the stairwell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Neither was I...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm...  Well, I'll be down in a moment.  Hold tight, hon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, dear.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, that's right...\" the wolf said knowingly.  \"I'd heard you'd gotten married.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes...\" the Sly Fox said nervously.  \"I'd have, ah...  Sent you an invitation to the wedding, but it was a...  Small, private affair.  You understand.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, of course...\"  The wolf flashed the fox a toothy grin.  \"I certainly wouldn't want to show up somewhere that I wasn't invited.\"  The fox was clearly unamused, which of course the wolf found quite amusing.  \"Now, now, Mr. Fox.  Where's your sense of humor?  I suppose you've never had one, though...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you want, Big Bad Wolf?  I know you didn't come here for small talk...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sly!  Don't be so rude to our guest,\" came a playful feminine voice from behind the fox.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I'm sorry, dear...\" the Sly Fox stammered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe face of an orange vixen popped in beside the brown fox's, giving him a quick peck on the cheek.  \"Dear...  You <i>know</i> I'm playing...  Perhaps our guest is right about your sense of humor..?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe brown fox chuckled as he returned her peck.  \u201cWolf...  This is my <i>beautiful</i> wife, Vivian.  Say 'Hello,' Vivian.\u201d  The Sly Fox stepped to the side to let the wolf get a good look at his bride.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolf was, quite frankly...  Surprised, to say the least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe'd never seen a fox quite so...  Fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom her face alone, the wolf wouldn't have guessed her size.  Her muzzle, jaw, face...  No excess fat, no jowls, no \u201ccherubic\u201d cheeks...  There <i>was</i> a bit of fat on her chin, but the wolf could have easily dismissed that as the consequence of a \u201csoft\u201d city life.  Her neck was just as average, but as her throat met her shoulders, things got a bit...  Thicker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer narrow shoulders had a bit of padding, which contoured into fairly flabby biceps, tapering in at the elbows to once more curve out into only-slightly-less flabby forearms.  Her bust practically <i>exploded</i> from her chest; a pair of lovely, large ta-tas forming a shelf beneath her muzzle.  They sat heavily upon the vixen's gut, which spread out a good foot or so in front of her, with thick love-handles to either side, which he could see quite clearly through the orange fox's tight blue dress, hugging her body as if it were spandex.  A \u201croll\u201d formed halfway between the breasts and her groin, bifurcated by a deep navel, with a modest crease beneath it.  Her wide torso gave way to even-wider hips, flaring out to either side of her.  Though the wolf couldn't see it from his vantage point, he assumed the vixen's ass was just as thick, if not more so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wasn't quite as large as the pig he'd come to discuss (probably by virtue of being a few inches taller than the swine), but...  She could probably give her a run for her money.  The wolf never really considered himself a \u201cchubby-chaser,\u201d but with his new fixation on Penelope and her size, he realized that his interest in making her grow might be more than carnivorous...  The vixen's size, as well, was stoking his fire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the while the wolf was surveying the vixen, the vixen was surveying the wolf.  Vivian giggled and curtsied, her entire front wobbling even through the constricting blue dress.  \u201c'Hello, Vivian,'\u201d she said wryly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello, Vivian,\u201d the Wolf replied as he took in the spectacle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Sly Fox embraced his wife with one arm, gesturing to the wolf with the other.  \u201cThis is the Big Bad Wolf, dear.\u201d  The two foxes, side by side, were quite the contrast:  A tubby orange vixen, practically stuffed into a shiny satin gown, leaning on a slightly-shorter brown reynard only half her size wearing a pressed white shirt and black pants.  An odd couple, indeed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPleasure to meet you, Ms. Fox...\u201d  The wolf outstretched a large paw, which the vixen took in her smaller one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLikewise, Mr. Wolf,\u201d she smiled genially as their paws moved up and down.  \u201cI...  See that you're not much into fashion.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment, the wolf realized he was terribly under-dressed, having only arrived in a tight pair of short cotton pants that only reached his knees.  The wolf would have been a bit embarrassed for himself, if he was capable of anything resembling shame.  He shrugged.  \u201cI suppose I'm not, Ms. Fox.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat's...  Quite alright, Mr. Wolf,\u201d she said, smirking as she eyed the wolf's bulge.  \u201cAnd please.  Call me Vivian.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWill do, <i>Vivian</i>.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Sly Fox, having said nothing for the past couple of minutes, gestured toward the arranged furniture in front of the television.  \u201cShall, uh...  Shall we adjourn to the living room?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course, dear...  But first, let me fetch us some refreshments,\u201d the vixen cooed as she turned around and sashayed back to the hallway from whence she came.  Both the wolf and the Sly Fox hungrily eyed her wobbling ass, which was just as thick as the wolf had thought, making a nice shelf for her bushy tail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as she'd left the room, the wolf snickered.  \u201cI'd <i>also</i> heard you had a bit of a...  'Thing' for fat girls, Sly.  I suppose I heard right.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fox shifted nervously.  \u201cYes, well...  <i>There's nothing wrong with that, Wolf,</i>\u201d he said sharply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, of course not, of course not...  'More cushion for the pushin',' right?  <i>Lots</i> of cushion...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGo sit down, Wolf.\u201d  The fox stomped over to the loveseat while the wolf took the armchair.  \u201cNow, why are you here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow, is that any way to talk to a guest?\u201d  The wolf kicked up his foot-paws onto the coffee table, grinning as he noted the fox's annoyance.  \u201cI thought we were...  Friends.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fox frowned.  \u201cWolf...  Enough of your games.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGames?  Whatever do you mean?\u201d the wolf said, feigning confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fox fell silent, frustrated by the situation.  He wasn't exactly fond of the wolf sitting in his armchair, and he was almost certain the feeling was mutual; any sort of relationship they'd had in the past was purely of business.  Their continued contact would, clearly, be more of the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolf allowed the silence to linger for a moment or so, enough to let his host calm down slightly, before beginning his proposition.</span></div></div>",
