Here to take this Chimchar to the lab, so he can become a starter.\" My parents tried to save me, but the Zangoose beat them too it. Then they took me away. My parents cried \"CHIMCHAR!\" I cried \"MOMMY! DADDY!\" That was it. I could never see them again. \"Now back to the lab.\" We made it, but no one was their.

Elekid, stand by!\" Then the Pok\u00e9mon came out. \"Ready, sir!\" \"Use Brick Break, but just on the Zangoose!\" I cheered even more \"He is going to save me! How nice of him!\" Elekid does it \"Here I go! Take that!\" He hit them and I was free. I yelled \"Thank you!\" And started to run far and far. But they followed me somehow. I kept running despite the attacks they used on me, but I came to a cliff. Down was water, and I don't like water since I'm a Fire Pok\u00e9mon and even if I wasn't I still be no match for that wave. Then the Zangoose were about to get me. But then I got scared, that my Blaze kicked in and I beat them all with my powered up Flame Wheel. I then breathed as it was over. I needed to get back home, or was there no way home. Just then, the same boy and his Elekid who saved me came. \"Hey.\" He said. Elekid said \"Hello...what is this me and my master is seeing.\" I looked up. The boy says \"Chimchar. Look what you did.\" Elekid says \"For only once I'm gonna say, you're powerful. But how powerful?\" I said \"I was just protecting myself that's all. Thanks for helping me.\" Elekid says \"Yeah, whatever.\" I'm confused. Then the boy got out a Pokeball. It wasn't Elekid's, it was an empty one. I was concerned about this. He said \"Come with me.\" Should I?</span></div></div>",

How may I help you?\" The Pokemon asked, it's voice of a male. \"H-Hello, uh, sir...M-My names (name)...I'm from the orphanage from down the street...I was told I got adopted and told to come to this adress...\" I said nervously. \"Oh! (Name)! The one who understands Pokemon, correct?\" I nodded. \"Well, allow me to welcome you to our family!\" He said, grabbing my hand and shaking it. Then, he pulled me inside the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter showing me around the house, Rick, the Floatzel who answered the door and my older brother, led me into the kitchen where I saw two other Floatzel sitting at the table, both playing a game of cards. Next to the kitchen was a living room where two Buizel. One of the Floatzel looked up at Rick and I and smiled. \"Hello, there. You must be (name).\" I nodded. Everyone got up and walked over and crowded around me. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright! Alright! Give the kid some space!\" The eldest Floatzel shouted, and everyone just backed away a little bit. \"Sorry about that. Anyways, it's great to finally meet you, (name). I'm your new dad.\" He said to me, patting me on the back. \"Anyways, you've met Rick already, so I'll just introduce ya to everyone else.\" He said, throwing an arm over my shoulder. \"So, this is your older sister, Cece.\" Dad said, pointing to the other Floatzel. She gave a small wave, and I waved back. \"Next are your little brothers; Evan and Devon.\" He pointed to the other two Buizel who were standing by my feet. \"Hi!\" They both shouted up to me. \"Hi.\" \"Alright, now, your mother should be home in just a few minutes. Just, get ready.\" Dad said to me, moving me away from the crowd and over to the couch. \"Why?\" I asked. \"Just...\" That's when the front door opened. \"Wait here.\" Dad said to me, before getting up to see who it was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI then heard someone running down the hallway and into the kitchen. As soon as they came into the kitchen, I froze. Standing there, was not only a shiny Floatzel, but...the same one my mom had. \"P-Pearl?\" I asked, my voice starting to break, tears forming in my eyes. \"(Name)...\" I stood up and ran over to her, and we both hugged each other. I broke down sobbing. \"There there...shhhhhh...let it out. Let it allllll out.\" She said, rubbing my back.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Chancey stood at her desk reading over the paperwork of recent arrivals to the adoption agency, smiling softly as she felt tiny movement near her tummy, \"Aw, looks like somebody has a severe case of the giggles now.\" setting the papers down on the desk, Chancey had the freedom of both hands as she reached into her small pouch and pulled out a cute little baby girl with soft winter pink hair, \"What is mommy going to do with you, my little Joy?\" Joy Giggled as she was booped on her nose as the door to the outside slid open. Chancey looked up as she saw a Kangaskhan kneel through and step into the building, feeling sorry that such a large Pok\u00e9mon like her was forced into such an uncomfortable position like this. \"Oof.\" Groaned the Kangaskhan as she slowly made her way up to the counter, accidentally banging her head against a light before resorting to walk painfully on her knees. \"Ma'am, you should have rang the bell outside: there is a waiting room meant for larger Pok\u00e9mon after all.\" spoke the Chancey apologetically as she put her Baby Joy back into her pouch for safekeeping, \"Aside from that, welcome. I trust that you're here for the 'no hassle' adoption program?\" The Kangaskhan grunted affirmably as she reached behind her and slid her arms out of a backpack strap as it was opened. \"I managed to finish all of the initial paperwork necessary for this moment. Took me a good chunk of the month to finish writing it all up and I'm ready to go.\" Chancey looked through the signed papers carefully, seeing that everything was in place. \"Okay. well congratulations Ma'am! turns out that your particular license is sound, but I don't think that it'll rate you for any of our children from newborn to six years of age.\" The Kangaskhans' expression softened into a slight frown at this, \"However it does let you adopt from the 7-10 years bracket. If you can take a seat over there you can read over any of our recent arrivals for adoption while I go and prepare them for you.\" Chancey passed a small folder across the desk to Kangaskhan before stepping around the desk and through the doors leading further into the orphanage. \"Okay then, lets see who will it be...\" cooed the Kangaskhan to herself as she knee-walked over to the chairs lining the walls. Sitting down Kangaskhan regarded the folder as she checked the children that were available for adoption. The practice of Pokemon being captured by human Trainers were commonplace in other parts of the world, but here Pokemon sought to make it different by taking in human children to be raised like their own. Oftentimes Pokemon would actively go out and steal a child for their own, but its a practice that is slowly dying out thankfully as more and more Pokemon seek to only take in either orphaned and abandoned human children instead. Already the results of their efforts were apparent with Humans and Pok\u00e9mon living as true equals. The door opened as a Froslass and Gardevoir both walked out, the Froslass held the hand of a boy who walked next to his brand new mother, the Gardevoir on the other hand was cradling a red-haired baby girl, cooing affectionately. Before the door closed an Arcanine held the door open as he laughed playfully at a pair of twin blue-haired toddlers riding on his back, telling the Arcanine how much they loved their new daddy. \"Daddy loves you too Jenny and Jeannie. Let's take you two home to meet your new brothers and sister.\" Watching as the three adopted couples left, Kangaskhan began contemplating on her own child until the door opened another time as a massive Nidoqueen lurched through the doorframe herself, clutching her swollen belly with bliss and pride as she crawled out of the agency, as she wedged herself out through the door, the Kangaskhan looked in shock as she saw the flailing legs of a girl hanging out of her cooch. As soon as the Nidoqueen stepped outside she looked down at the legs and spoke calming words before grabbing the legs and pushing them inside of her body with a loud moan, removing her hand from her crotch, the girl was gone: sent on a one-way trip into her new mommys womb for 8 months. Satisfied with it, the Nidoqueen walked away. The Kangaskhan remembered hearing about certain cases when an adopted child was sick and needed help genetically, or were too young to properly eat foods that their new Pokemon Parents did; so a medical technique was born allowing Pokemon to literally take human children into their wombs, even as young as newborn babies were taken in up their new mommys wombs, it became so widely popular that certain Pokemon decide to continuously unbirth their human children as a means of entertainment or pleasure. The door opened yet another time, this time the Chancey from before stepped through, her baby girl sound asleep in her egg pouch. \"It's okay Tomo,\" cooed Chancey to a person on the other side of the door, \"I promise she's super-nice and wants to meetcha.\" \"O-o-okay Ms. Chancey.\" Spoke a soft voice as a figure stepped out from behind the door, it was a small human boy, possibly no older than 7 judging by his lanky shape, he had swirls on his cheeks and had spiked-up dark green hair. Kangaskhan also noticed a slight crinkle heard as the boy stepped out and looked down to see a small round bulge hidden underneath a pair of shorts. Even if Kangaskhan didn't know, she had seen this boy before and had read over his information in the folder she was given. His name was Tomo and he was found abandoned and alone in the Kanto Region as a baby by a sympathetic constable that was raised by Arcanines herself, that constable sent the baby boy to the orphanage where he grew up. Due to bullies in the orphanage for making fun of his appearance, the boy was called 'Toppo\" due to his hair looking like the top of a Pineapple and his swirls reminiscent of spinning tops. The bullying got so intense that one day the boy lost total control over his bladder and was reduced to wearing diapers for the rest of his life. Fortunately, the bullies themselves were punished bybeing adopted... and reborn by an Electabuzz and a Magmar. Since then Tomo has been patiently awaiting adoption. Looking up at the Kangaskhan, he glanced downwards at her tummy before backing away in fear behind nurse Chancey \"I-I'm Tomo.\" Spoke the timid boy as he peeked around from behind Chanceys' shoulders, \"I-I heard th-that you were g-g-going to adopt me today.\" Kangaskhan so wanted to go to Tomo and pick him up, hug him tightly and tell him that his life was going to be alright from here, but she refrained from it, she had to be professional here until he got used to it all. \"Yes Tomo. I am going to become your new mommy and will be living with me in my home.\" Tomo shrunk back further as he glanced upat the Kangaskhan again. \"Y-you're not going to eat me are you?\" Eat him? What was this nonsemse all about. \"Why do you think I'd want to eat you?\" Chancey explained that a few weeks back, an Arbok and a group of Ekans went on a crime spree,eating small Pokemon and even Human kids and babies. Fortunately the snake Pokemon criminals were captured and all the victims were returned home safely, Kangaskhan herself already knew it, she herself worked on the police taskforce responsible for arresting them, sentencing them to the Lost Pokeball Penalty after the charges were filed and finished. \"I'm not going to eat you, or do anything to you. I just came here because I want to have a human boy of my very own. The two of us have had a rough life apart. How about we have a life together?\" Kangaskhan held her hand out slowly towards Tomo, smiling softly, \"Will you let me be your mommy?\" Tomo walked up slowly to the Kangaskhan before putting his small hand in her larger one as it closed gently, looking up, Tomo for the first time she's seen, began to smile. Chancey herself smiled happily to herself as she walked back around the counter as Kangaskhan lifted up Tomo and cradled him in her arms, sliding him into her pouch as he began to feel drowsy. \"Now then, I know that this is sudden, but I want you to know that Tomo himself is unable to be potty-trained at all. Constant bullying has left physical trauma on him that will be hard to get rid of.\" Kangaskhan nodded slowly, remembering how he was wearing a diaper just now, \"Medical science is a long way from curing problems like this, but fortunately there already exists a sure-fire method of healing the damage, and it's within your body.\" Kangaskhan herself was totally aware of what Chancey was suggesting as the matron began stroking away tufts of Baby Joys hair as she slept in her egg pouch, \"My little Joy here when I adopted her was suffering so much from growth issues that would have kpt her from walking at all. I pulled her in, waited 9 months, popped her back out and now she'll be able to walk as soon as she grows too big for my pouch. Not a problem for yours though by the looks of it.\" Chancey herself smirked as Kangaskhan stared back down at her own pouch, it was greatly bigger than the Chanceys' and would let her carry Tomo possibly for the rest of his life if she wanted to.<br>\r\nKangaskhan began to mull it over...</span></div></div>",

It had took alot of effort to make it here, but it certainly was worth it! He had seen many pokemon he had never witnessed in person before! He had already caught a Togepi, and a Pidgey, he didn't even think you could find those in Hoenn! He grinned widely at the five pokeballs he had attached to his belt, He almost had a full team! <br>\r\nHe was taking a break now at the moment, looking through the garden's of mansion...<br>\r\nOr that was what he was telling himself, the truth was, the Mansion had a hedge maze, and he ended up getting lost in it. His stomach growled as he made a yet another turn in the maze. \"Crap... why didn't I bring lunch, or even a snack?\" He talked to himself, a bad habit he always seemed to have. \"Lunch box, or a jelly filled donut...\" His stomach made a low grumble as he made YET ANOTHER TURN in this stupid maze! This time at a dead end! He groaned, looking the dead end over... we're those berries growing out of the hedge? They are! Little, pink, berries! He didn't recognize them, but he didn't care, almost all the berries he knew, oran, Leppa, Aspear, and many others, we're all safe to eat. With out giving it a second thought, Green picks a handful of berries, stuffing them greedily into his face, they we're so sweet, so savory, so good! He picks each one he can get, stuffing his face. Satisfied at refilling his stomach, he turns around and goes back to exploring the maze.<br>\r\nHe was starting to get a little worried, the hedge walls seemed a little... taller honestly, that's probably just his mind playing tricks on him though, nothing to worry about. He was trying to pick up the pace though, the sooner he could get out of this place the better, but... it felt like it was getting harder to move? He was making long strides with his legs, but he wan't moving as far as he should, his bag felt heavier, and his clothes we're getting baggy, and... his manhood had felt funny. \"Ok... Don't panic, don't panic, maybe... maybe theres something in the guidebook.\" He tried to keep his wits about him, pulling out a Hoenn guidebook he had bought a while ago, looking underneath the food section, and then to a wild berry's subsection, as he slowly shrank in his clothes, he flipped through the pages as quickly as he could, when suddenly...<br>\r\n\"HA HA HA HA HA!\" Loud evil laughter, right behind Green made him jump in the air, the guidebook flying out of his hands as he let out a high pitched scream, turning around, was a high level Haunter with malicious intent, it grins aggressively, a shadowy aura around it. <br>\r\n\"Ah...Ah...AAAHHHHHH!!\" Green lets out another highpitched scream, booking it in the other direction, as fast as his legs could take him, tightening his belt so his baggy pant's wouldn't fall off.<br>\r\nAnd he ran, and ran, and ran, not stopping for anything, because he could hear the laughter behind him, and he was too scared to turn around, his cap, clothes, bag, we're all so big now and heavy, but he did his best to hang onto them, he turned a corner, and another corner, and another corner, and another corner, until he turned a corner, and collided with something soft, knocking himself on the ground.<br>\r\nHe sniffles, looking up, he sees a Gardevoir above him, staring down at him. <br>\r\nHe needed to think, and fast!</span></div></div>",

He started bawling on the ground, curling up into a fetal position, worst of all, he was wetting himself... which felt... really weird for some reason, though he couldn't think of why, mostly do to how distracted he was about his 'Impending' doom. He sobbed grossly, blurry eyed, hands over his face, he peaked through a crack in his fingers at the Gardevoir. She was charging a dark energy into her hand, a shadowball. This is it! This is how it ends! <br>\r\nThe shadowy blob reaches about globe size, it launched from the Gardevoirs hand, making Green brace himself... And it sailed right over him! Confused, he let's his hands go from his face, looking around, the Shadowball sailed past him, into the Haunter that was chasing him!<br>\r\nThe Ghost Pokemon screeched in pain, it's shadowy aura disappearing almost immediately, as it slowly began to dissipate, the Haunter escapes by slowly floating into the ground. <br>\r\nGreen looks around, mind still reeling from what happened, his stuff was scattered all around, his bag, pokeballs, and hat, pokedex, we're all around him, his clothes, didn't even remotely fit, they we're too massive for him! And... he finally realized what was feeling off... Oh Arceus! Was he a girl!?<br>\r\nHe, or rather now, she, sniffled, looking up at the Gardevoir, who was staring down at Green. She flinched and gasped, screwing her eyes shut as the Gardevoir reached out and... Slowly stroked her hair?<br>\r\nGreen opened her eyes again, the pokemon, this Gardevoir, was... smiling at her? Trying to comfort her?<br>\r\nThe Gardevoir offers one of her hands, to lift up Green.</span></div></div>",

She then looked over the things she had brought in, a back pack, clothes, a poke ball belt, and a trainer's hat. She searched the bag, looking through each of the pockets, pokedex? Broken. A map of Hoenn? Useful! Trainer I.D. card? Clearly not the girls, she tosses it into the trash, along with the badges recorded on it. Actually, this raised alot of questions, where did Green get this stuff? It clearly wasn't hers. Was it stolen? We're the pokemon stolen? Did she not know better? Maybe she was alone, out on the streets...<br>\r\nGardevoir shook her head sadly, putting some of the items back, discarding others, and then promptly putting the backpack on, along with the Trainer's hat. She looks at the pokeball belt. <br>\r\nDid Green steal these pokemon? How could a little girl even get pokemon like these? Pidgey and Togepi we're understandable, anyone could get those, but there was also a Snorlax, a Gyrados, and a Blaziken. There was no way she trained any of these! Could green handle them?

That she would not put up with this behavior at all, and the only way she could show that was with tough love.<br>\r\n\"Let me go you stupid pokemon! I don't want to be Poke-food! What the- Heeey!\" Green had been sobbing, ranting, and panicing in Gardevoirs Psychic grasp, surprised and terrified as he started to float towards her.<br>\r\nGardevoir had sat herself on the ground, sprawling Green across her lap, pushing up her shirt to expose her bottom. \"What the hell are yo- *Slap!* -Ah!\" Green had jerked, crying out in pain as Gardevoir's hand made contact with her rear, she began thrashing and jerking around in Gardevoir's lap even harder, doing her best to escape as Gardevoir held her down. \"Let me- *Slap!* Eep!\" Gardevoir had smacked again, cutting her off. Green tried to push herself away with her hands, inviting a wave of slaps towards her already sore bum. *Slap Slap Slap!* \"Please!\" *Slap Slap Slap!* Green sniffled, her eyes watery, her thrashing degrading into a squirm, her cheeks burned a stinging apple red. *Slap Slap Slap!* She tries to push away one last time... *Slap Slap SLAP!* Green had gone limp, sobbing and sniffling into Gardevoir's lap.<br>\r\nGardevoir smiled as green had finally given up, believing that she had learned her lesson, she began stroking Green's hair comfortingly, causing her to look up weakly, tears streaming down her face, looking at the warm smile Gardevoir was giving her. Slowly, Green was lifted into a hug and being nuzzled by Gardevoir, and given a kiss on the cheek, which she had to admit was oddly comforting, after a moment of comforting, Gardevoir rised to her legs, taking hold of Green's hand, she started to lead her out of the maze.<br>\r\nGreen was still scared, tired, and sore, but she knew that struggling with this Pokemon would just make things worse, she bit of the nail and suck her thumb to take her mind off the soreness and pain as she walked, holding unto Gardevoir with her other hand.
