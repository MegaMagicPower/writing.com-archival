It's been spreading since last night and they've been trying to locate the source to stop the spread, but they can't seem to find it. They've only been able to slow it down by quarantining the infected...and uninfected. That's why they're coming here right now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat did you say Pres? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho are \"they\"? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nand<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow do I know all this?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHa! You.

I know all this because my dad is the mayor and he was talking to the \"they\" (government officials, obviously) last night. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nApparently they were transporting some sort of experimental disease to another testing site when something happened and it got loose. I think they may be looking for the guys who were transporting it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, now that you\u201dre caught up, what's next for you President.

But you look over your shoulder anyway...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBehind you, there's nothing, but a window and a few stragglers heading to class. You start to breathe a sigh of relief. Start to turn back toward the kid to tell him to take a short hike off a even shorter cliff when you notice something outside the window. The window faces the front of the school, the visitor/teacher parking lot is out front. In the parking lot you see vans taking up multiple spaces. At least eight of them. The early morning sun, not even an hour ago just peaking past the horizon, glints off their glossy surfaces. Absurdly you think, Turtle wax. The thought contributes nothing to the situation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn back to where the guy with all the information was standing, but he's gone. There's no panic from this revelation. It seems more plausible than what's running through your mind a present anyway. You turn back to the wide window. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOther people have noticed too. You see a huddle of teachers, administrators, and the principal standing by the flag pole out front. It's empty of the stars and stripes because the three freshmen that were suppose to send it up the pole are standing outside of the huddle looking at the vans parked in the parking lot as well. After what feels like long deliberation, but what couldn't have been more than a minute of talking, you watch the principal (He's a short man with a goatee, a Beatles haircut, and full rim glasses. Everything below this is far more formal, tweed coat and brown loafers) walk across the dropoff lane to the parking lot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel kind of relieved at this. You're thinking about order. That's what principals stand for. Order amid the cause of teenagers and children. They right wrongs. And make sure their schools work like clock guts. Mr. Hep (Joseph Hep is the principal's name) will bring things to order. No government men will be quarantining the school today. He'll make them get a warrant or something. Threaten to go to channel 8 news with the story. Once he gets across to the parking lot, he'll talk to whomever's in charge and set right this oversight, because that's probably all it is. Some kind of a mistake. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou watch him approach the parking lot, but then suddenly a stray thought scats across your mind leaving its clear footprints behind. What if it's not a mistake? You see clearly in your mind Mr. Hep making it across to the vans. You see a van door slide open. Mr. Hep pauses, is a little nervous now that he's closer to the reflective shine on the van, probably sees his own frighten face on a vans surface, but he continues on anyway. He's the principal, he must. You can't see inside the van even though it's bright enough outside. There's no overhead light nor any other kind of light. A man steps out of the blackness. An unsmiling man in a suit and shades as black as the vans, as black as the darkness inside the van he step out of. The principal starts to smile as he approaches the man, ready to make friendly conversation and fix all of this, but the man has other plans. Stony faced, he signals and all the other van doors open. Other men who look just like him, dark suit and shades, unsmiling step out of the vans. The principal drops his smile and starts to turn, but he's caught before he can even run. The other men walk forward in unison. They seemingly move slow, but it doesn't take long for them to catch the ones, the teachers and staff flaggers, scattering but not yet screaming. They'll come for me after that, you think. Unless...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnless you make like Crazy Guy and disappear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow you have a choice. Stay and see what happens next. Or find a way out before any bad stuff goes down. Which do you choose. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It doesn't matter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou have to run and keep going until you feel safe again. Because right now you don't feel safe, at all. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don't even take a look at the scene that's unfolding outside. You just turn and run. Past the front office. You turn right down the freshman corridor. Left past the cafeteria. You can hear a few students in there. Some of them eating lunch, others just waiting for the morning bell to ring. You would be in there too. Schmoozing with your constituents, but something big is happening. You think to stop and try to get them to run too, but that wouldn't work. You've seen the movies. An idea pops into your head. The fire alarm. You'll pull it, but not the one right outside the cafeteria. The one on your way out the school. You plan on going out back to the student/school bus parking lot. You don't have a car yourself. Your parents are going to get you one for graduation. But maybe, maybe you can get someone else to leave with you. If not maybe you'll have to do something else. You don't know what that \"something else\" might be, but you don't take the time to think about it. The thought felt disturbed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou make a right at the end of the hall with the cafeteria on it. You see the double doors at the end of the hall. The home stretch. You are home free. Then something snags you and snatches you to the ground, dragging you back into the dark. A hand is covering your mouth. An arm is braced across your throat. You flail and try to scream, but you're caught. As they reach out to close the door with the hand that's against your throat they tighten the one on your face. Your try to escape anyway. You flail harder than before. The attempt is unsuccessful. They get the door closed and resume holding you with the second arm. You continue to struggle, but can feel yourself getting tired. The place smells antiseptic and moldy with the door closed. The person shushes you. You do not intended to do any such thing. You're still struggling and kicking. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey aren't that big. Why is it so hard to get loose? Why are they so strong? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe talks into your ear, quietly though harshly. Only two words. Stop it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou do stop and for two reasons. One. He sounded scary serious, especially when he punctuated the command by tightening his wiry, too-strong grip on you. As if to say, I can do this all day. (You believe him. Anybody would.). Two. By his whisper you realized he's the crazy kid you were talking to earlier. The so-called \"mayor's son\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe slowly loosens his grip then even slower he releases you completely. You stand, backing away as you turn toward him. You don't say anything. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour foot kicks something, a bucket from the sound. He shushes you again. The sound is light and barely there. Now that you've calmed your eye are finally adjusting to the darkness and you can see an outline of him as he raises his arm. Most likely, you assume, his hand to his face and finger to his mouth in that universal gesture for quiet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis you think about. You could be quiet. He might have a good reason for capturing you and bringing you to this utility closet. You could stay and find out his reasons or you can make like a cheetah and run. If you do that you'll probably get recaptured by him or run into whatever trouble he just tried to save you from. It's a difficult decision, a real Sophie's choice, but it's the only two options you've got. Seems like the only two options this strange day's going to bring. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlight or... well, flight? Which to choose? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Geek. Nerd. Loser. All the usual lovely titles. Luckily I don't go to classes with the other students. The Honors classes are in a small two story building sitting outside the main campus. It overlooks a tranquil little garden which includes a mass variety of plants ranging from the common grass to the little apple trees. A pleasant sight which can whisk you away from the hustle and bustle of classtime and into a realm of pure delight. That's where I sit with Amy. Her and I sit softly against the trees and feed each other exotic fruit as the little pond bubbles away in the background. Oh, Amy, your glossy black hair smells like a rose garden......<br>\r\n      \"You'd better wake up Leo, or else you'll miss the bus!\" screeched Angela. Er, I mean, my mother. My eyes were cloudy, the room was a blur of uncertain colors and shapes. I reached over near my bed to the end table where my glasses were set. A quick routine process produced a full range of vision for my eyes. I picked myself up from the bed and began to do ... what I do everyday. Get ready for my venture to High School. As I was scraping plaque from my teeth I remembered the voice in my dream, what a strange dream. But that was all it was. A dream. Forgetting about such things, I was out the door in no time, lugging along my clunky backpack. It held my Psychology, Astronomy, English Literature, Anthropology, Government and Statistics textbooks. The extra strain did put a little discomfort on my spine, but it was a small and mostly harmless price to pay to advance quickly in the realm of knowledge.<br>\r\n       Outside it was cold and dark, like an oncoming storm was approaching. It felt rather ominous to me. I walked out wearing a large blue coat which looked to me like the coat I had seen pictures of Winston Churchill wearing. That was the main reason I had picked it out. I thought it might be a funny little anecdote to explain. But alas, another failed opportunity gone by. There was the bus, my own personal ferry down the River Styx. I boarded it and found my place in an empty compartment in the back. Unfortunately this bus was for any student who attended Archwood High School. I could see faces of those who had laughed at me during the dance two years ago. That had been dreadful. But I must move on. Today is not like two years ago. I have Amy's friendship, and soon enough we shall be a couple.The thought of bliss clouded my head as the vessel made its way to the end point.</span></div></div>",

I want to scream, I want to dance! Don't. Not now, wait until prom. Past the B buildings the great Leon darts like a speeding bullet. Quicker than the human eye. Oh, there it is! Nearly there, closing in. One, two, three....<br>\r\n            \"Oh, there you are. Here.\" A blue sheet of paper gets thrusted into my hand by HIM. I, I mean, Johnny gives me the guide as usual. Johnny West, bloody captain of the class. No, he's a good guy, mostly. Except for his overbloated ego and luck to ... no. Cool your jets Leon. He's not your rival here. He's your fellow student. A tall, perfectly shiny teethed, funny, confident genius of a fellow student. One who just happens to like to put his arm around Amy! No, keep calm. Hold it in. Like a real man, a polite man. Acting like a gentleman is the right thing to do. Ow! What the...<br>\r\n             \"Well, Leo?\" Jenny asked. But what did she mean? Oh no, she wasn't talking was she? She looked annoyed, her nostrils flared, and her eyebrows twitched. I could clearly see her lip clipped under her teeth. She didn't look happy, she looked as though she was in her usual mood of impatience. I just hoped it wasn't going to spill out at me.<br>\r\n           \"Uh, I'm sorry, but ...\" I began in my tone of mousiness, but was cut off by her long growl.<br>\r\n           \"Ughhhhh... Leo, wake up will ya? Your speech for tuesday. What's it gonna be?\" Ah! Now that I knew. I had spent all night last Friday thinking about it. I had pegged it somewhere between the technological advancements of today and how they are killing the ways of life of the past, and if technological advancements in science fiction could ever be accomplished in reality and if so, how they might affect the government. Of course, I chose the latter. I was looking forward to bringing in a model of the TARDIS and showing how leaders could easily use it to create an insane form of governement like that of 1984. I smiled and opened my mouth to ingeniously explain it, when she turned her head and walked away.<br>\r\n            \"Oh Amy, thank god there's someone who read the assignment...\" Well hey that's not.... Oh well, there's no need to fight her. I looked over to see her standing there. Her glittery jade eyes sparkle at me as I look her over. A cute pink blouse, a lovely black miniskirt, and that grin that seems to say ' Hi Leon, I fancy you, do you fancy me?' I certainly do Ms. Chen. Getting up I walk over to where Amy's being interrogated by Jenny and pull out my crumpled confession. I hide it like a secret plan for my eyes only. Should I ... could I? I should, It's about time I tell her how I feel ... but uh, maybe tomorrow will be better. Yeah. Today's not the right day. tomorrow will be much better. Or ....</span></div></div>",

I don't want to seem like a weirdo, going up so close to Amy. I watch her from afar. She looks a little distressed though, I wonder why. She chose her topic right? Of course she did, she's brilliant, I bet she's already planned the steps to what she'll do. It will be a real success, better than her poem even. Poems. I looked down at the crumpled piece in my pocket. My poem wasn't that bad, I think it was pretty ... but who knows what she might think. It might really be terrible. It might...<br>\r\n             \"Not really. I, I'm probably going to have to think about it. I mean, I have a couple of different ideas, but, I'm not exactly sure what ... what I should do, you know?\" I know exactly what you mean Amy, the assignment was a bit hard. I mean, it's important to choose the right choice. Kind of like choosing your major - it was life and death! If you chose the wrong one, you had a lot of fixing to do.<br>\r\n             \"Aw, geez. Johnny and I are the only ones who actually chose theirs. Ha. Mrs. McHaggan isn't gonna be pleased about this.\" We sat in silence for a while thinking about Mrs. McHaggan - our teacher of English Literature. She was nice enough, but strict and very particular. I hope she wouldn't be too hard on them. She should understand. But, where exactly was she? As if reading my mind, HE blurted out at this exact moment,<br>\r\n             \"Where's the old Hag anyway?\" He said in his shrill yet loud confident voice. He always talked this way about his teachers when they weren't there. I didn't like that about him. It showed he was twofaced, a liar. I nodded, however, in agreement to show my concern. I looked over to Amy to see her reaction to my concern, she was giggling away. Was she giggling at me? That's cute, I thought. I grinned in her direction.<br>\r\n             \"And Lily, too. I didn't see her all today.\" Jenny chimed in again.<br>\r\n             \"I.. I hope that they're alright.\" I spoke my concern. Amy had put her head down, as if thinking of a shameful or sad event. I suppose we were all worried a bit. It wasn't like our teacher and Lily to be late. Lily usually arrived earlier than us, so that she could be brought up by her aid before the other students came. Lily had been in an accident when she was about twelve, it left her paralyzed from the legs down. Seeing her like that always made me feel depressed. I don't mean to be mean, she's not a charity case, she's really bright, and one of the few kind people I know here. But I just kept thinking about what she could do if that accident didn't happen.<br>\r\n            \"They're just late, doesn't mean they're dead.\" HE shot out. I heard laughter and turned to see Amy smiling and looking over at Johnny. Why would she laugh at that cruel thing he said? I don't think it was funny. I don't know why she did. But I could see she didn't want to be depressed. Maybe that was a good idea. Laughter is sometimes the best thing in times of stress. But I couldn't help thinking of Lily and Mrs. McHaggan, and some horrible accident. No. That's crazy. They are probably just sick. Calm down Leon. While I sat there thinking, Johnny apparently went over to Amy and again put his arm around her. What a jerk. Poor girl. Get off her. I was about to get up and say something, when he said something instead,<br>\r\n            \"Hey, while the Hag's gone let's check out Myhouse! My band put up a new single that's gonna blow your minds!\" He said the last part like a ... strange clown or something. Amy laughed. I couldn't help laughing at him either. But then I realized. What they were doing was kind of wrong, we should probably be working on our projects instead of fooling around on the computer. Besides, what if Amy liked his single? I felt helpless. But I had to do something. God, I hate taking action like this...</span></div></div>",

But then, HE put his arm around her again.<br>\r\n\"Yeah, besides, the guards are out there prowling the streets.\" He snorted.<br>\r\nAt that moment I lost it; I stood up. The romantic trance broken. I couldn't care less about the guards outside, I could go to detention, all to show how wrong he was. To show her what I knew. To tell her the truth. As I went to the door and looked back upon my classmates for the last time, I didn't feel stupid, I felt different.<br>\r\n\"I don't care about guards. I'm gonna find them.\" I said bravely and left. Walking down the sterile Honors halls I felt mighty. I had left, just like that. They had told me I was wrong, but I felt like Churchill in my coat; they had tried to sit back, but I knew that I had to take action. I had to do something to get them back. This was just it.<br>\r\n      <br>\r\nI was full of adrenaline walking down the sleek hall, past the open doors and classes; every step squeaking and jeopardizing me being found and caught. But I continued until I was down the numerous white steps and out into the open area of the campus. I had done it! I was free! But just now, it had dawned on me that I had a plan, but that I knew nowhere to look for them. What if they weren't even in school, but sick? Or somewhere else. I felt a little stupid acting the way I did. Maybe I could go back, but no. That would mean I was wrong, I would be admitting I was an idiot. I couldn't. No, I should start looking for them. Where though? Maybe I could check out the back parking lot? Or maybe I could             ask Mrs. Kehlmir in the library, she knew Mrs. McHaggan well. Well, I knew I had to go somewhere, standing here would only make me even more nervous. And possibly get me caught by the patrol troops.</span></div></div>",

Luckily I did not see a single faculty member outside, so I was in the clear. I had just gone past the offices when I heard a loud noise. It was the speakers all around the school. I could just hear it, the speakers shouting out, \"Yarset L 23605! What are you doing outside of your designated learning sector?!\" \"W...Well I was just trying to find a couple of people. See if they were all right.\" \"Nonsense! Helping others is not part of your training! EXTERMINATE!\"<br>\r\nThis, of course was only a dream, not a reality... yet. What the speakers really said were,<br>\r\n\"Due to ... unforseen circumstances, all students who are afflicted with .... colds, are to report to the Auditorium at once for treatment.  Teachers please stand by for further notice.<br>\r\nThat is all.\" The haunting message echoed throughout the school. At first I wiped the sweat from my forehead, but then I realized that in moments students would come bursting out of their classrooms and scurrying to the Auditorium. I had to get to the parking lot and fast. I ran like the wind to the destination.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStrangely enough, however, as I got there, I saw the cars, but even more interesting, was the people I saw. I think I had seen them here before, but something was amiss now. Two girls were running away screaming from a man who was on the floor. It was odd, and none of my business really. But ... that was my cowardace speaking. I was in fact, going on a \"rescue mission\" , why not help this guy. Or at least see what was going on. I had to. But should I go ask the girls, or should I ask the man on the ground? <br>\r\nI was beggining to wish I had stayed inside. But I put that behind me and ...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>I looked down at the guy on the floor, possibly hurt, possibly needing help, and I quickly ran in the opposite direction towards the girls. But it wasn't cowardice; actually it was ..  well, just logical reasoning frankly that drove me to my current outcome. I mean, he looked kinda bad, and I might not be able to understand what happened to him by taking it from the horse's mouth, so I thought I might try the girls, who although running away, could probably tell me what I needed to know better than the guy on the ground. Then in turn,  I could help him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh, all of this action stuff gave me a bit of a headache to tell you the truth; I mean, thinking's fine, but this was something entirely different. I ran over to the girls, who being regular teenage girls weren't exactly the quickest animals in the kingdom, not saying that I'm a track runner, it's just that well, I can catch up pretty good. So I ran forward, hearing their panting and shrieking and wondering why in the world they would be so afraid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking back at the guy on the floor, I noticed a few things about him,  high spiky black hair, long dark clothing, lots of jewelery and stuff all over him - I could pretty much tell that he was one of those gothic or punky guys that hung out here, behind the parking lot. I had heard things about them, and boy, I'm not sure if it was true or not, but it sounded awful. When I squinted I found his name to be ... uh, Vince, I think. I had one class with him in 9th grade; we never talked or anything, but he'd always come in late and fight with Mr. Arlon. He seemed to have a bit of an attitude, but maybe that's exactly why he's on the floor right now. Hope it's just a fight. But I wonder....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls, I could sort of remember them. One was Samantha, terribly pretty and a bit bossy, into odd stuff like magic and Halloween but that's kinda cool, as long as you don't really believe in it. The ones that do, well, they're kinda odd. The other one, I knew her a bit, but only barely. We sat next to each other in the 10th grade, her name was Vicky Candel and she was really nice. I began remembering her and her deep piercing green eyes and her long black hair, it all came back to me as I ran beside the two, but then they turned their heads and I was dropped back in reality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who the heck is that?!\" Samantha screamed out as she stumbled in another direction as fast as she could, almost tripping in the process.<br>\r\n\"I'm just....\" I thought of a word to stop their screaming; I wondered what could make them shake like that. I really hope nothing was going on; I thought about our teacher and Lily and hoped that everything was alright. I thought about Amy and how I hoped that this was only happening out here. I wondered what I could possibly say to calm these two down when I myself was also afraid and unknowing to what was going on around us. But never the less, I spoke up and said something,<br>\r\n\"...a guy... what's going on?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe chase stopped. The girls ran behind a wall, and then careened their necks out, looking me over quickly and then saying,<br>\r\n\"He looks kinda normal.\" Samantha and Vicky glanced at each other with oddly ominous expressions, then gazed behind me. We all turned to see Vince moving a bit, trying desperately to get up.<br>\r\n\"Oh ****! He's getting back up!\"<br>\r\n\"Vince! Vince, what the hell is wrong with you?! Are you ok?!\"<br>\r\nI couldn't help but wonder why they didn't want him to get up.. Then I saw his mouth, it was all red, dripping with droplets of blood and foaming like a rabid animal. Rabies? Was all I could think of when I noticed that the girls weren't near me anymore.<br>\r\n\"Hey! What's wrong with him?\" I stuttered loudly.<br>\r\n\"He's insane....!\" Samantha yelled back,\"you should run!\"<br>\r\n\"He bit her! For no reason.... I think he's sick or something... he wouldn't do that otherwise...\" I could see the fear and pity in Vicky's eyes. I wondered how I looked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI watched them leave, running towards the gate and I wondered what exactly was happening here. I was one of those guys who hates to not know something, and some crazy guy sputtering all over the place, biting people, and then this announcement about colds. What exactly was going on here, and more importantly ... what the hell could I do about it? Looking at Vince, his foam dripping to the floor in gushes, I knew I should move. What good would come from talking to him now. My cowardice got total control of me and I ran. I ran...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>I barely knew the two but I felt a bit confused, and hopelessly afraid of being caught by Vince so I quickly followed them, believing that there really was safety in numbers. The two ran towards the gates of the school, but they were shut. I could see Samantha with her, now clearly visible without all of the added pressure, blood-stained sleeve banging against the gates and clawing at them. I was basically frozen, really unsure what the hell to do. I mean, what do you do in this situation? I guess run was the best bet, one that Samantha clearly had her heart set on; but looking at Vicky's cold and distant eyes, I could see that she had  an air of uncertainty hanging about her. Her eyes kept darting back and forth from Vince to the gate. I stepped forward a bit, but it didn't seem that either noticed me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the ****, come on you stupid *******!!! ...\" Samantha screamed and clawed with both her arms, obviously too horrified to care about the pain, \"...OPEN UP!\" She screamed a shriek I had never heard before. It was really loud and high-pitched, I had to cover my ears for a bit, and then I peeked back to make sure that she hadn't drawn too much attention to Vince. Oh, right, as if that wasn't already done. With Samantha yelling and Vicky doing absolutely nothing, I kinda felt that I had to do something productive. So I thought - the best thing I do, anytime I need something to do I thought. I thought about the possibilities of what was going on, all of them ranging from the drunk little accident to the insane legion of villainous vampires knocking at our doors. I couldn't stop thinking, and while I was on a roll I blurted out a question - usually I don't ask much questions to people I'm not comfortable with, except for times that I need to. This certainly was one of those times.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, what the hell is going on with him? What kind of illness does he have?\" I asked hoping to lighten up and analyze an otherwise hectic scene. But they just stared at me, nonchalantly saying,<br>\r\n\"I don't know! Like he just started puking blood, and then ... he kinda ... bit Sam,\"<br>\r\n\"I think he's insane!\" Samantha yelled, rather harshly.<br>\r\n\"No, he's just not well. I swear Sam, he's never ever done this before; I... I think we should take him to a doctor...He really doesn't look too good...\"<br>\r\n\"..Do you think he's got the same thing that they announced on the speakers about?\" I asked, wondering if there was any connection. And I hoped not, because any second now those sick students would be opening their doors and wandering all over, and if they all started acting crazy there'd be real problems. But, for some reason, I don't think they heard me or anything, and just kept on talking,<br>\r\n\"No way! I'm not going near him! He could try it again...\" Samantha, touched her blood stain and winced at the slightest brush against it.<br>\r\n\"No, he wouldn't! We just ... like gag him, I guess,\" you could hear the uneasiness in Vicky's voice when she said that, \"and take him ... I guess down to the nurse..\"<br>\r\n\"The nurse?! What'll she do, give him tea?! No! I'm not having anything to do with that! I'm getting out of here! You can stay if you want. Just try not to die...!\"<br>\r\n\"Oh come on, Sam, don't you think you're being a bit melodramatic?!\"<br>\r\n\"He bit me, like a hungry animal for God's sake! How am I supposed to be acting?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of them went back and forth arguing over what to do with their poor friend, who was apparently sick, but with what was still a mystery. I was getting annoyed a bit just standing there and doing nothing; I mean usually when people talk on and on I either listen to them, or I try and tune them out, and I'm usually pretty successful at doing both - but now, I was too damn mad to wait. I wasn't angry at them, but at not knowing what was happening to Vince, to Mrs. McHaggon, to Lily, to Amy. I had gone out to find my friend and my teacher and I hoped that whatever was happening to Vince had nothing to do with the two missing people. I could help these two, but what they were considering was crazy, and a bit of me really didn't ever want to see something as terrible as Vince again, so I turned around and started walking toward the library - no one else was in the parking lot, only a handful of cars, so I figured that Mrs. Kehlmir in the library could still help me out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd that's when the place erupted with sounds, not bangs or booms, but many little squeaks and creeks yards away, the numerous tramples and shuffling of sneakers through the grass. It was the kids that were sick, and knowing most of the students at Archwood, many of those that weren't sick literally but in an aspect of learning were virtually comatose, who wandered the fields and halls. And with that, I was ready once again to do something, I...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>I dashed away from this little group and went straight away a couple of doors down and around a few corners until I got to the library. The doors were closed, and as usual there was no sign explaining why no one was allowed in. They just expected people to leave for the day and possibly come back tomorrow, without any concern about whether their book was to be turned at that date or not. It irked me a bit, especially the fact that the days they closed the library were usually the cold, wet, rainy days. But I hoped that today was different, I expected to get a reply when I knocked, or at least I really hoped so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThree little knocks I pressed into the door, politely, but good enough to signal that an expecting patron was waiting outside for assistance. And that is exactly what I ended up doing for a bit. Waiting. Luckily the Nurse's Office wasn't easily accessible from the library, so I didn't see any ill walking on by. But I could hear a few sputters and coughs echoing in the background clutter. There wasn't much students - I figure, possibly one tenth at most in each class, but that's just judging from my own class; still it just seemed like one of those days that no one really wanted to come to school - but they chattered and straggled loud enough to echo throughout the place really giving it an eerie vibe. I didn't want to wait anymore, and as my paranoia got a hold of my better senses, which always seems to happen in odd situations like this, I forgot any code of conduct and began banging on the door as loud and quickly as I could. The thuds echoed throughout the campus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door, finally, was opened, and instead of Mrs. Kehlmir answering the door, I saw it was Betty slowly dragging her feet across the floor. She looked irritated but I didn't care so much at the moment. Scowling and glaring at me a bit she asked,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Geez, what's your problem?\"<br>\r\n\"I need to ask Mrs. Kehlmir something.\" I stated, in a rushing, pushy way.<br>\r\n\"...Mrs. Kehlmir's not here right now.\" She bounced back my hostility.<br>\r\n\"Where is she?!\" I demanded. She stared at me, confused.<br>\r\n\"Sh..she went to do something with some other teacher; told me to open up while she did.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOther teacher? It had to be Mrs. McHaggon. But where were they now? One piece of the puzzle was in place but I needed to know the rest. I asked further.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, what's she doing?\"<br>\r\n\"I don't think it's any of your business.\" She aggressively yelped at me. \"Why are you here anyway? Did a teacher send you?\" I didn't respond, I could have told her no, but I really didn't think it mattered. At my silence she basically figured it out anyways, \"Ah! Did you sneak out of class?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI knew a bit about Betty Jackson, not much, but a little. Spending a lot of your time in this library, where the students and teachers behind the counter never cease to stop chattering, gets you to overhear a bit about people. From what I could tell about Betty Jackson - she was really into reading, especially manga; she loved animals, and to argue about things with the other very opinionated students; and, and here's the real kicker, she had high morals; an upright uptight christian woman who seemed to regard anything illegal as bad. Which is ok, I don't like lazy good-for nothing mean people who always HAVE to disobey the law either, in fact probably more so than most; but now was not the time to be worrying about getting out of class. Knowing her, and knowing that there really wasn't any need to fight her, I tried this whole thing again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Look, I'm sorry for yelling, but can I please know where Mrs. Kehlmir is. It's an emergency.\"<br>\r\n\"Why?\"<br>\r\n\"Well, I think something might be wrong.\" Betty looked shocked and confused at this statement.<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\"<br>\r\n\"...Was that other teacher... was she called Mrs. McHaggon?\"<br>\r\n\"....I..yeah I think so, why?\" She said quietly, concerned, after thinking about it for a while.<br>\r\n\"Well. Mrs. McHaggon is missing, she usually shows up early to class, but she isn't there today.\"<br>\r\n\"So? Maybe's she's sick.\"<br>\r\n\"But this other girl ... Lily... she didn't show up either, and she has to be here early everyday.\"<br>\r\n\"Well they're both probably sick. There's a virus or something going around, you know? People are getting sick.... Why are you getting so worried?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhy was I so worried? Well Vince could be one thing. But I was worried even before I saw Vince. Maybe it's just because the state of things just don't seem normal. Or maybe I just really want to understand what's going on. And heck, maybe I should just put all this crazy stuff behind me, go back to class, have fun and hang out with Amy. Yeah, I mean, if something serious is really happening, wouldn't it be best to spend my last remaining moments with the woman I love? I began to move around a bit, pacing, thinking. I bet Betty must've thought I was batty, because she finally asked me,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing?\" I thought about it, but I still had to know.<br>\r\n\"Uh, do you know where Mrs. Kehlmir went? Or when she'll be back?\"<br>\r\n\"..Uh, well, no. She's supposed to call when they're done..\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but what are they doing?\"<br>\r\n\"..I don't know. She just said that like... she had to... I don't know, but I think she went to help that other teacher at her house.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt her house? I didn't know where she lived. Besides it seemed like a bad idea breaking out of school to go find my teacher when chances were this whole insane thing I was doing would turn out to just be my imagination again. Imagine that, I get there and they're moving boxes or something. I wasn't quite so sure anymore. It sounded pretty foolish. But I could go to the Main Office, try and check out her address... oh, no! It was crazy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh... Yeah. Ok. Can I use your phone?\" I asked, defeated.<br>\r\n\"Why?\" She asked very defensively.<br>\r\n\"I.. I want to call ... someone up..\"<br>\r\n\"Don't you have your own?\"<br>\r\n\"...Uh, no.\" That was true actually. I was like the only student in any high school that actually didn't have a cell phone, an i-phone or any of that. It embarrassed me sometimes, like now, but I did most of my chatting online anyways.<br>\r\n\"...Well.. you can use the one in the back.\" She frowned and reluctantly pointed to the back, turning her attention back to her manga, which had a title called \"\u30be\u30f3\u30d3\u30d1\u30a6\u30c0\", whatever that meant. I strolled on to the back, where I saw the phone and used it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI wanted to see if Mrs. McHaggon was ok, but I felt kinda embarrased calling her up. What if everything was fine, then I would be totally embarrased and look like a complete idiot in front of Amy and ... HIM. What about Amy? I could call her up, make sure she's alright. I could easily put all of this behind me and try and act like a normal human being for once. I could even read her my poem. But what if she asks me about Lily and Mrs. McHaggon? Do I lie to her, do I tell her the whole stupid truth. Hmmm.... I picked up the phone and...</span></div></div>",

So I stopped thinking about that, grabbed the phone tighter, bringing it closer to me, and finally dialed Amy's.... oh wait. Did I remember her number? I tried to think of what I had once overheard in class. I think it was from HIM, and he had asked her for her cell phone number. In seconds, the digits popped into my head via her sweet voice, but were quickly replaced by the screeches that HE emitted. I shook off my rage and before I could forget dialed her up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\".....Uh, hello?\" She picked up the phone and immediately I blushed with embarrassment and anticipation. My hands were shaking, and my mind was racing, I could only squeak,<br>\r\n\"Hey.\" It was very fast. But the silence told me she didn't understand.<br>\r\n\"..Wh..who is this?\"<br>\r\n\"Uh, it's just me. Leon.\" I hope she knew my name at least. She probably did. I talked to her a few times in the past, so I'm sure she knew my name like I knew hers. But a little piece of me deep down in the dark kept shaking its head and growling \"No she doesn't you geek....\" But I tried not to notice it and move on.<br>\r\n\"Oh, yeah! Leon!\" She said something muffled, probably talking to the others off the phone; I'm not sure what she said exactly. \"I..ha... We thought you had left!\" She was laughing, and I wasn't sure whether to take in the beautiful melody of it, or to wonder what it was all about. I chose to be oblivious and picked the former.<br>\r\n\"Oh, no, actually I'm still here...in the library.\" I wasn't sure whether to say the last part or not.<br>\r\n\"Oh, ha! So what happened with the search?\" There it was. What happened? I really didn't want to hear those words, but there they were. What would I say to them? Tell her the truth, that I got scared, too cowardly to fulfill what I was saying. Or maybe I could tell her that they were right, that I was being an idiot. Well, given the two, I chose the latter. I'm an idiot, but I had good intentions, right? And besides, what if I was right? Then everything would be okay again.<br>\r\n\"I... I guess I was a little too ... uh..\"<br>\r\n\"Crazy?\" She chuckled. \"I mean, I've never seen you talk like that. I mean, I thought you were gonna swear!\" The statement ended in an eruption of laughter. But I don't think it's very funny. I can swear. ****. See. I can do it. Oh well.<br>\r\n\"..Ha..yeah... well, I guess they're ok. You know? No reason to go all Rambo.\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah, yeah. I mean, I hope they're fine and all. But people do get sick...\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah. I know... Um, I, I think I'm gonna just go back. To the classroom. See you guys.\" I hope that didn't sound too obvious.<br>\r\n\"Oh, well, we're at the Soccer Field..\"<br>\r\n\"Soccer Field?\" What the heck? Now they're not in class either? I've started a revolt. Ha. Imagine that, next thing you know people will write stories of Leon Yarset, the rebel without a cause. Ha! They'll all skip school and name a holiday after me.<br>\r\n\"Yeah. Just playing a quick game. Johnny's really good.\" Figures. I bet it was all his idea and he'll get all the.... ok, calm down. Save it for the whole... vampire invasion thing. Ha.<br>\r\n\"But we left the room unlocked in case you wanted to go back in. I think you left your backpack there.\" Great, HE gets to have fun with Amy, and I get to go be the troll in the classroom - the geek who would stay inside while everyone is outside having fun on his own accord. Oh well. I suppose somethings aren't for everyone. And I don't want to play ****ing soccer anyways. See Am's, cussing.<br>\r\n\"Oh, thanks. Yeah.\"<br>\r\n\"Bye, Leon, I gotta go.\" There was a quick yell of excitement from the rest of the crowd, then a loud click that ended the conversation. I stood here. In a daze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI listened and I thought. About, well, about being alone. Alone's good. You know? I can do a lot of things without the others, things that they would think boring, or uncool. I can read some comics too, maybe check out a book, or... save my teacher and Lily. God. But the thing that got me. The thing that really pissed me off about the whole thing was that, I .... whatever. I guess I should at least go get my backpack. Leave maybe. What time was it anyways? Had 1st period even ended yet or not?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo. Checking my little blue plastic watch, I can see it hasn't. Good, I have a bunch of time to kill .... in my teacher's room, when she isn't even there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI left the library, without even saying bye to Betty, and I kept walking to the classroom. My mind was still actually thinking about going to the Soccer field and checking out my \"friends\". But that part of my mind was the extreme optimist - the very stupid fool that would see a total alien invasion as a new rule at least, could be good. No, mind, it's not good, and they aren't your friends. Yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking along, I saw a couple of kids just running around. I even saw an older woman walking by - I had seen her before, and I think she was a teacher or a T.A or something, but she didn't say anything to me. I saw her quick casual glance fall upon me, and then she turned as though she had seen a creature so hideous that the only thing to do was to not think about it. Great, I don't even get the nod from the faculty anymore. It really does show how GREAT I am.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was getting towards the B building when I noticed two guys, security guards it looked like, the School Police, one carrying a radio, the other a brown paper bag holding something, probably a Roast Beef Sandwich. Who cares I thought, but then my instinct kicked in. You know, the part of me that isn't a complete fool; it thought \"Hey, you know what? I think that these guys, might want to know what you're out during classtime.\" But my other brain, the affected foolish one which didn't care just scowled and pouted saying \"Yeah right. They don't give a damn. Everyone's out now; that teacher didn't care, who says these guys will.\" I had this struggle for a few seconds as I tried to look inconspicuous enough that they might not notice in case, but only a seconds later they looked, or rather glared, directly into my eyes, and I could see a bit of fear, or hatred in them, or that might have just been my mind. Either way, the one with the bag raised it up, pointed it at me, and yelled out,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kid! What are you doing here?!\" Geez, I guess my other mind was right, although I have to wonder why he's threatening me with a bag of roast beef. I didn't answer straight out, as I was a bit moody, and shocked. The other guy grabbed the bag, and tried to talk the other guy down,<br>\r\n\"Abe, man, he looks ok to me. We don't want to scare him. Let's just drop the bag.\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah, ok now, trying to rip your ****ing head off lat..\" The other guy tried to hush him up, but unfortunately, I had heard what he snarled, and I was more concerned than ever. This little bit of fear, believe it or not, made my spirits a little brighter. Gave me something to focus on rather than just my crippling social life or lack thereof.<br>\r\n\"..Wh..what do you mean? Is everything ok?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everything's fine, son. We've got everything under control.\" He smiled the same smile that people give you when they know everything's gone to hell. Yeah, that made me feel just at home now.<br>\r\n\"This illness, you don't think..\" I began to wonder,<br>\r\n\"How'd you know about the illness?!\" Abe barked and growled.<br>\r\n\"Well, from the announcement. People are sick with the cold, right?\"<br>\r\n\"...Yeah. The cold. Ha.\" The man named Abe went back, but still looked as threatening as a tethered up Pit Bull. The other man came up to me and explained,<br>\r\n\"It's nothing to worry about. It's a slightly different variant of the common cold that we're not exactly quite sure of yet. But, scientists are working on creating a new vaccine, and so everything should be ok.\" I didn't know what to believe in that little speech. Looking at Abe's facial expressions, more than half of the things he said were lies. But I really hoped that Abe was just a nut job, and not the other guy. Abe I could handle being crazy, but if he was the sane one, well that's what tells you that something's up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok...\" I said, trying to tell them that I understood this and that I meant absolutely no harm. Kinda what you have to do secretive people like these two.<br>\r\n\"You got the cold?!\" Abe yelled.<br>\r\n\"Uh.. uh, no I, no I don't.\" I tried explaining but this time the other guy pulled out some sort of mini flashlight and held it right up to my face, shining it in my eyes. They held my arms down so that I couldn't cover them, and then in a few moments it was done.<br>\r\n\"What the hell?!\" I yelled, forgetting who I was talking to.<br>\r\n\"Sorry, son, standard procedure. But you seem to check out fine.\"<br>\r\n\"Well, I'm glad.\"<br>\r\n\"Just, one more thing. Don't go the area near the Small Gym, or the Nurse's Office. And don't leave school yet.\"<br>\r\n\"Why not?\" Slipped out of my mouth.<br>\r\n\"Just don't do it.\"<br>\r\n\"It could jeopardize your health...\" Abe barked at me.<br>\r\n\"..W..well, what about class? Do I go to my 2nd period?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two turned back around, and the other guy looked at me, giving me a very serious stare, and then said slowly and truthfully,<br>\r\n\"Do whatever you want. We don't care, just as long as you don't leave and stay around this area.\" Then they turned their backs again and walked off into the distance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat whole meeting didn't sound right. Once again the air felt way too ominous for nothing to happen. I sighed a deep sigh and then kept on moving. I could go to Mrs. McHaggon's class, the empty room - where I could wait with my backpack; maybe see Amy when she finally came back, maybe have some fun. But I could go see them right now. Or, and I knew very well that this idea was seriously the dumbest one I've had in years, but seeing those two kinda gave me a bad feeling, and I really did want to see what was going on here. ......</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>So I walk back through the empty outdoor halls, and went up to the honors building. As I pushed open the door, at the very back of my mind was the idea of me getting caught by a teacher, or staff, or someone else because I was out of my classroom during school time. But this really didn't bother me too much as what could they do during an emergency anyways? Then I realized that I did think that something was up, in the deepest reaches of my mind I couldn't believe those guards, or anyone. I felt that Vince was proof enough of what was going on, and half of me just wanted to lay down and cry awaiting obliviously the end of days. But of course, my other half hoped that I was overreacting. And this side led me back through the halls, and into Mrs. McHaggon's empty classroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI opened the room with a creek of the door, and then switched on the lights. The windows were open and one could still see that no matter how bright the lights were on the inside, the outside was as gloomy and depressing as ever. But I went over to the TV, turned it on and sat down at one of the comfortable chairs stationed near the computers. My glasses allowed me to see pretty far and clearly even from this distance. I surfed through the channels monotonously, sadly it didn't look there was going to be much on. Day Time Soap Opera, nope; Cheesy old crime drama from the 80s, not right now; Court TV, I certainly didn't need that. News Program, I didn't feel like the news right now, I felt more like cartoons...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut as I switched the channel, my subconscious yelled out to me \"You moron! Did you see that man? He looked like Vince!\" And I guess I hadn't really seen the man because I didn't notice that. So I quickly turned back to see in Big Bold Letters \"New Illness Spreading Across South Haventown\". We lived in South Haventown! The school was here, right smack in the middle. I turned up the low volume to listen to the ominously serious news anchors' grave voices,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Leading medical experts in the area are investigating what the cause of the new variation on the disease was, and what can be used to suppress its tenacity. Government officials are taking community centers such as Glorensten Valley Catholic Church, and the City's Courthouse and are using them as Rescue Shelters for those unfortunate people still trapped in the area.\" The only thing that I could think right now ... well, ok, two things. One, very small percent, was asking \"Is this a joke?\", but the majority was saying \"Oh ****. We're ****ed.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And to those people trapped in the area who are watching, what, what can we say to them, what can we advise that they do or don't do.?\" The anchorwoman asked a man to her right dressed in a white lab coat, who stared straight into the screen with haunting spectacles with deep bags and said in a shakey voice,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, as I have been saying, those who are in the area, are not infected and are in their homes, I advise not to leave your homes. Lock all doors and windows and board them up. Do not let anyone suspicious in, especially, as I was saying, if they have a tint of green around their eyes, or are foaming even the slightest bit. Do not let them touch you, get near you and especially not bite you or get any liquids into your blood stream. This is how the virus is spread. And.. just wait there until help arrives. You... you're much likelier to live if you just stay inside and stay away from anyone who has the signs of infection. The best case scenario is that you live close to the Rescue Centers and can make it there safely, but otherwise, if you don't think you can make it, it's best to stay where you are and wait for the firefighters..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI.... I was horrified. Badly. I was seriously in a state of shock. This was big. It wasn't just the school but the entire city. And what if it spreads? What if it infects the entire world? Oh god. We could all die. I just sat here like an idiot, staring blankly in an almost catatonic state at nothing. I was probably shaking, and rocking back and forth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, I thought of something instead of pure terror. Something that was more important than feeling sorry for myself and cowering - I thought about the windows, and the doors. I could look right outside and see to the cold concrete outside, and probably, eventually, see the hoards of infected students crawling on by. I shook my head of the vision and felt quite alone in here. Alone and with nothing to protect myself against the Vinces. ...Vince. That means that Samantha's probably gone, she was bit, so she's probably one of them. And poor Vicky too. Probably the whole Nurse's Office - that's exactly why they checked me, that's what they were looking for! Oh, it sparked up in me, and showed just how stupid I was. And then, the worst image possible came flowing into my mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA drooling, white eyed, bloody mouthed Amy running after me. Ripping my... oh God. I shook it off, and thought more about her. About them. They had to know. But I didn't have a damn cell phone! Damn! Looking out, I remembered that the Soccer field wasn't that far. And because right now I was driven entirely by rapid, mad instinct I didn't think about it but ran down through the halls like a wild man, probably making loads of noise against the shiny tiles of the floor and ran all the way outside until I was halfway to the Soccer field.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was still freezing cold, but I thought about nothing else but the field. I began running when I heard something in the distance. Noise, loud noises. First a scream, sounded like a chorus. Then a few loud bursts of what I could only make out were gunshots in the same area. This put a pretty clear idea into my head. The terror had begun, and i was right in the middle of it alone. Scared. Helpless. We all were. We didn't know a damn thing and now all of a sudden we would end up bitten and dead. I shook my head. But that was on the right side of the campus, and the soccer field was on the left, as was I.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo I began sprinting toward the field when, like hell's lightning, I heard bursts right behind me. I stopped, had to catch my heart from leaping out, and looked backwards down the hall. Behind me, a few doors down the outdoor hall, were a couple of large guys, carrying some sort of gun in their hands. I could only assume that they were shooting the infected, but I didn't take much time to look as I...</span></div></div>",

Another day of teaching senior English at Archwood Public High School, followed by a glorious staff meeting.  And by glorious, Ben meant boring, predictable, and altogether pointless.  Well, not altogether pointless.  There was the free food - snacks and coffee - and the opportunity to flirt with the younger teachers.  Aside from that, the meeting was pointless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSometimes, Ben wondered why he had left the military to enter the classroom.  Then he remembered the dirt, the cold, and the waking up too entirely early.  At those times, Ben remembered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the three years since leaving the infantry, Ben had only missed the ability to punish disobedient and disrespectful subordinates - like some seniors - in a very forthright manner; you either hit them in the pocket and cut their pay, or you hit them in the face and settled matters then and there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, though, the worst he could do was suspend a kid, and that wasn't even seen as a punishment for the kids who needed punishing.  It seemed like for every great kid, there was a shitbag.  The shame of it all is that as seniors, even his best and favorite students were slipping up in anticipation of graduation in the spring.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was nearing the time of year when senior pranks would start happening - toilet papered trees, plastic-wrapped cars, pigs and chickens released in the halls... things that happen at every school every year, yet this year's class had already been bragging of something big and new and shiny.  The administration wasn't sure exactly what was up, but they were watching for anything out of the ordinary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for Ben, he pulled into the teacher's parking lot and parked his dirty red Jeep Cherokee under the lone tree - a benefit of being early.  Moving to the back of the muddy vehicle, he opened the back and shifted a large heavy backpack off of his briefcase.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBriefcase in hand, he closed the door, pressed the autolock button on the keychain, and headed towards the three-story school, whistling an obscure song.      <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Placing his scuffed brown briefcase on the desk, he continued across the room towards the windows, so he could raise the blinds and try to cool the room off.  The air conditioning for the whole second floor had stopped working late last week, and still was not fixed.  Ben stared out the last window, gazing out across the campus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe its a skip day,\" he thought as he noticed the paucity of cars and students below him.  Normally the parking lots and commons were full of motion and noise and color as students woke themselves up for another day of school.   Cars and students today just seemed... lacking.  \"Have to be a skip day,\" he continued his thought, \"I guess that means pop quizzes and free reading, no, a short essay for those who do come to class.\"  Ben grinned at that thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. Simons, the English teacher, had a reputation for being a prick. This was primarily because he liked to have quizzes on days of low attendance, based on content that came from the night before's readings. That his loudest detractors routinely did poorly in his classes due to their nonparticipation, nontrying, nonbehaving, or just plain nonattendance had little to do with the matter.  Ben didn't pass out free grades, so he was a prick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCasting his brown eyes around his classroom, Ben ran a hand through his short-cropped blond hair and looked for things out of place.  He moved about the room in a frenzy, straightening desks and placing books back on the shelf as his head kept checking the clock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n7:00 - time to move into the halls and watch for wandering kids.  He smiled as he picked up the Louisville Slugger that he used as a pointer in the classroom and the halls.  When he first started teaching, Ben had taken the bat and written the words, \"Subtle Persuasion\" down it in bold black letters with a big fat Sharpie.  Now, the running joke among his teacher friends was that it should read, \"Compensation.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarrying the bat with him, Ben locked his door and headed down the hallway, whistling. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Whistling Megadeth's \"Skin o' My Teeth\", Ben walked briskly towards the stairwell.  Not only was the coffeepot downstairs in the teacher's lounge, but Ben knew that students liked to sit in the stairwell.  Sometimes to get out of the wind, other times to make out, sometimes to do both.  This morning, though, the only thing Ben noticed was what looked like blood sprayed across the wall and then a crimson trail of blood spots aimed at the bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Probably a short fight this morning,\" thought Ben. \"I wonder why I didn't hear anything? I should probably investigate.\"  With a sigh, Ben started towards the restrooms, and called out, \"This is Mr. Simons.  Is everything okay in there?\"  When no one answered, Ben moved cautiously into the restroom, following the blood spots to a closed stall.  It was apparent that someone was in there, still bleeding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you alright, in there?\" Ben was concerned, because light injuries could be glossed over, but ambulance calls always made the evening news.  Besides, Ben didn't really hate the students - not all of them, anyway - and helping injured students fell into his job description.  Knocking on the stall door with the bat, Ben said in a louder tone, \"Are you okay?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn inarticulate groan and a shuffling of feet answered him.  At least the student was conscious.  Ben debated the merits of calling for help or opening the stall door for immediate aid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe student fell heavily against the stall door with a meaty thud, and seemed to be trying to push open a door meant to be swung inwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kid is so confused, he can't even open the door,\" continued Ben's inner dialogue, \"Might be a concussion.  Frack!  Gonna be on the news tonight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Stand back in there, I'm going to open the door!\" Ben Simons called as he pushed against the cool steel door.  The student inside pushed back, turning the episode into a bizarre tug-of-war, only in reverse.  Ben's superior leverage gave him the edge, though, and with a shove, the door burst backwards, knocking William Horner backwards into the toilet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, Will.  What is going on? Are you alright?\" Ben voiced his concern.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat Ben saw was a skinny 16-year-old kid, wearing beat up work boots, faded blue jeans (that fit - an anomaly these days), and an open flannel shirt, displaying a white undershirt with the word \"Budweiser\" emblazoned across it.  The rolled up sleeves of his flannel shirt revealed a nasty bite wound on one his arms.  From the soaked through toilet paper wrapped around it, it looked like Will had tried to bandage it, but failed miserably.  Now he just looked... wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Ben took in the scene, Will continued groaning as he awkwardly lurched to his feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will.  It's Mr. Simons, I'm here to help.  Let's lie you down on the floor and see about a pressure dressing of some sort for your arm.\"  More moaning as Will stood there, his eyes unseeing.  \"Will.  Come here, please,\" Ben said as he gently reached for Will's good arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt which point, Will bared his teeth and lunged at his English teacher.  Mr. Simons stumbled backwards, surprised at the turn of events.  Keeping his feet, Ben managed to turn and start slowly backing out of the restroom, all the while pushing Will away with the bat and saying, \"William Horner! What has gotten into you? I'm trying to help, calm down!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWill never stopped his moaning-groaning as he kept shuffling forward and lunging jerkily for Ben.  Ben kept pushing him away but was growing more and more concerned and annoyed at the whole situation.  He was tempted to use the bat more offensively, or at least tackle and subdue the boy.  Just not in the bathroom.  No camera eye to cover his ass in a court of law.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo Ben backed himself out of the bathroom, Will following with a glazed, almost hungry, look in his eyes.  Now in the hallway, Ben Simons, English teacher, had to make a choice - baseball bat, wrestle Will, or run away while calling for help.</span></div></div>",
