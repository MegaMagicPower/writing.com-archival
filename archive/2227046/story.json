Your mother is trying to hold back tears, of joy or sorrow, you cannot tell. Your father just gives you a proud smile, and they both wave goodbye as you ride away across the property line of your family's farm towards the capital. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince the age o f five, you've always wanted to join the ranks of the Heroes. Your parents would tell you stories of the most famous Heroes from when they were your age, and their mighty and noble deeds. Slaying monsters, rescuing those in danger and distress, battling evil overlords who sought to enslave the land. Even as a child, you knew you wanted to be one of them. Today, you are finally of age to set out on your own, and fulfill your lifelong dream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor three days, you ride West across fields and through forests until you reach the capital gates. Having grown up on a humble farm, you can't help but marvel at the sights of the magnificent city as your horse clops along through the cobblestone streets, not even noticing the stares and a few sneers you receive from the nobles dressed in their satin and velvet outfits. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou find yourself at the entrance to the Hero's Academy, where all Heroes train before officially joining the Guild. You hitch your horse by the entrance and enter a grand hall, the walls lined with tapestries bearing the Guild's insignia. At the end of the hall is a large desk of polished wood, a female elf sitting behind it, surrounded by parchment and writing quills. As you approached she looks up and says \"May I help you?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wish to enroll at the academy.\" You state proudly. The elf sighs before reaching under the desk and heaving up a massive ledger bound in leather and emblazoned with the Guild's symbol. \"Name?\" \"Taren Feldrake.\" \"Preferred class?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Before we go any further, is your character male or female? Also after selecting your class and sub-class, don't bother describing your time spent at the academy, and just skip ahead to when you graduate. This story is supposed to focus on Heroes, not Heroes-in-training.)</span></div></div>",

Better off just sticking with Good Enough.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is it really that hard to be Lawful Good?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, if you end up serving a Lawful Evil king, you'll come to a point where you'll have to pick between Lawful and Good,\" the elf said. \"Luckily, the requirements for being a Paladin are much easier than they used to be. Actually, a lot of things are easier. The whole alignment thing practically got chucked out the window a couple of decades ago, allowing for bards and barbarians to be Lawful, druids to be one of the corners on the square, paladins and clerics to be Chaotic, and all of the other classes too.

Also, things change more often all over.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, things change?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"About every six months, someone learns something new about the class,\" the elf said. \"Used to be that only Necromancers and paladins that broke their oath could summon the undead. These days, there's of course Necromancers, Oathbreakers, who are Evil by the way, Death Domain Clerics, who can be Neutral  or Good by the way, Circle of Spores Druids, they need to lay off those mushrooms as those make their breath stink, Eldritch Knights, Arcane Trickster rogues, wizards in general, and, our most recent addition, Oath of Death Paladin.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oath of Death?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was started by some reformed Oathbreakers who found out that they still had those Necromancy-type spells, and other such features, despite renouncing the ways of Evil,\" the elf said. \"They can even get their zombies and skeletons to do more than just be arrow fodder and trap bait - cooking, cleaning, general servant duty, night watch, carry loot, and be better at scouting out for traps and ambushes. They can even speak to them as if they were living.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Interesting,\" you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Also, if you don't have it, you get Darkvision, and if you already got it, an improved version,\" the elf said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Useful,\" you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright,\" the elf said. \"Now, let's look at your options.

Fire-based spells, summon a fire-based being, which could include fire-breathing dragons, resistance and later immunity to fire, and this red suit of armor, which lets you talk to fire-based creatures easier.\" A red suit of armor showed up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hot,\" you said, feeling the heat radiating from it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever you say,\" the elf said. \"So, one of these, or do I go to the next section of the List?\"</span></div></div>",

Granted, Jim, Jeb, and Juanita didn't like it, but you'd been smart enough to ask them to help out, and let the one that did help out have the day off, and not need to do as you said, which made the trio a bit more willing in that regard. That being said, you were smart enough not to <i>force</i> them into doing something they <i>didn't</i> want to do. Teachers had drilled in that lesson quite clearly.

She then shoved you, and ducked her head, as an ax smashed through the wall, where both of your heads would have been.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, you two think that you can take me on,\" the half-orc said. He held out his arm. The ax smashed its way back into the tavern, and flew to the half-orc's hand. \"I don't think so.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guess that story's true,\" the cat lady said. She whipped out a dagger, and threw it into the barbarian's gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe half-orc growled. \"I'll skin you alive for that!\" He pulled out the dagger and threw it at them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cat lady held out her hand, catching the dagger the hard way. \"Run!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou ran out the door, the cat lady just behind you, and, from what you could hear, the half-orc behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked back at her, and saw her pull the dagger out of her hand, blood coming out. \"You're bleeding!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll live!\" she said. \"Keep running!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grab her injured hand and, as you ran, you uttered the healing words you'd been taught. A bright light enveloped both of your respective hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, thanks,\" she said. \"Mind letting go? Got a plan!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mind sharing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Head down that alley, summon your skeletons, and have them grab him when he gets down it,\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll have to trust me on that part,\" she said. \"Now go!\" That was when she sped past you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guess she was holding back,\" you muttered. You then ran down the alley, which had a lot of shadow, so your armor allowed you to hide for a moment. You managed to mutter the words to summon Jim, Jeb, and Juanita, just as the half-orc came into the alley as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know you're here,\" he said. \"I can smell you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Grab him and keep him from moving,\" you commanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three skeletons rushed forward, to do your bidding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe half-orc threw his ax, chopping Jim in half.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gasp in shock for a moment. Then chuckled as Jim reformed, and kept running towards the barbarian.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, all three had grabbed a hold of the half-orc, pinning his arms and legs. But, the half-orc kept fighting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was when it happened. The half-orc started to stiffen. \"What?! Paralysis? How?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou heard the chuckle. You looked up to the rooftop to see the cat lady playing with her dagger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not the only one with tricks up their sleeves,\" she said. She took out a vial and shook it. \"Kind of useful when one wants to slip past a guard. In your case, placed it on my dagger before I threw it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked at her. \"What about you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe chuckled. \"When you use something like that, make sure to have an antidote. I'm good.\" She jumped from the rooftop. \"Let's take him to the guard house. They can contact the Dragon Lords, so that he can be picked up to be executed.\" She then got rope out of her pack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks for the help,\" you said. \"I owe you one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cat lady chuckled. \"Might be the other way around. You healing my hand made it easier for me to get my antidote to stave off my own paralysis.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks anyways,\" you said. \"I'm Cedric.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cloud is my name,\" the cat lady said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou offer your hand, and she shook it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, come on,\" Cloud said. \"Fifty thousand gold isn't just going to swap places with him if we jabber all day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right.\" You look at Jim, Jeb, and Juanita. \"You three, pick him up and carry him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe skeletons nodded, and pick him up, probably a little more roughly than you'd prefer, but you couldn't really blame them - he'd almost killed you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough, you got to a guard station with your package, which was still struggling. You pounded on the door. \"Got a Bounty to turn in here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA moment later, the Head Guard opened the door's viewport. \"I see. Been wanting them for some time. Give me a moment.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou heard the door unlock, and watched it open up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How'd you get them,\" they asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I had some help,\" you said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your skeletons that good?\" the guard asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I had some help from -\" You looked and saw that.....</span></div></div>",

With eighty thousand gold, you could afford to be picky. Then again, getting better weapons wouldn't hurt your chances either, same with getting potions and a few other things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you looked it over, noticing that there was a bakery dealing with a large rat issue, something caught your attention. Standing next to you, also staring at the Notice board, was one of the Yuan-Ti, in the getup of a cultist. However, the other thing that also caught your attention was a poster that had the snakeman's image upon it. He was worth ten thousand gold. Alive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Three criminals in one day?\" they said quietly. \"Don't push your luck. Besides, you might be of use, according to our mutual friend, Cloud.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was when you saw it. A coin-sized amulet that quickly disappeared up the sleeve of the Yuan-Ti's cloak. An amulet carried by the City Guards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you want?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Guard could use you as an Extractor,\" the Yuan-Ti said. \"Sometimes it's hard to get one of us out of whatever group we've infiltrated, especially since using the Guard might bring about the wrong kind of attention. A Bounty Hunter on the other hand, one with no Official connections to the Guard beyond using them as a place to exchange criminals for receipts, that's a different matter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You want to use me to get your people out of trouble, by turning them in as if they were criminals with a price on their heads?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe snakeman nodded. \"That's about the size of it. Of course, most won't bring in as high a price as Cloud, but you're still looking at a few thousand gold apiece. Of course, it's only good if we're alive, as per the Request.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I understand,\" you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good,\" the Yuan-Ti said. \"Contact you later. By the way, the antidote for the poison is in your side pocket.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What poison?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was when he sprayed venom into your eyes, all but blinding you, causing you to blunder into a table. As you tried to wash your eyes out with the contents of your drink, you fished around in your pocket, grabbing a bottle. You pulled it out, uncorked it, and drank the contents. Your eyes recovered in a few seconds afterwards. You looked around, and saw that the Yuan-Ti was gone, and that everyone else was looking at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou chuckled nervously. \"I don't think he wanted me to bring him in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis caused the rest of the tavern to laugh out loud, and soon the drinks resumed flowing. Some even landed in front of you, and more than a few more experienced adventurers slapped your back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can't get them all!\" one said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's always that one that gets away!\" said another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At least it wasn't a goblin like yours!\" the first said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're one to talk,\" the second said. \"There's still kobold who laugh about the fact that you couldn't catch one of them in broad daylight!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh really!\" That was when the first jumped over the table, and started a wrestling match with the second. \"You're the one that slept with a succubus!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Better that than a hag!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou moved over to the counter as the two continued to wrestle. \"What a day.\" You looked at the owner of the place. \"A room for the night?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe nodded, indicated payment, you gave him some coins, and he gave you a key. \"Room Eleven.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks,\" you said.

He was mildly disappointed to find that I was more interested in the arcane ways than those that dealt with spirituality, as I was always reading wizard books and scrolls, and he was especially upset when he found me reading the tome of this particular necromancer he and his group had beaten back during his traveling days. He sat under a tree and meditated for a week when that happened. When he came out of it, there was this look of relief on his face. He looked at me and said, 'If I cannot stop you from learning the ways of a wizard, then it would be wise to at least be guided in their ways.' Thus, he brought me to the Academy and before he left, he gave me this staff, saying 'This way, I will be there with you on your journey, along with your grandfather and great-grandfather.' After all, wizards can carry staffs, and everyone knows that monks don't need weapons.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's an interesting story,\" you said. \"How long have you been an Adventurer?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBaka chuckled and said...</span></div></div>",

Just said that I didn't know it as well as Kosj. What I know about the area is likely out of date. If you'd asked me fifty years ago, I'd be able to tell you who ran the bandit gangs here, where their territories were, how to deal with them, how to avoid them, numbers and composition of the various groups, if they were on good terms with each other or not, and if we could take them on. I don't have the answers to those questions these days.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A hundred years? You must be pretty powerful,\" you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBaka scoffed. \"Depends on how you measure power. I know a lot of spells, true. More than a few are very powerful. That being said, I can be beaten, as can anyone.

There's even a few versions of the tale - one being that Folra stole something from Stabor, one being that Folra was promised to Stabor but she refused him, and a third being that Folra liked playing hard to get whenever Stabor wanted to mate with her, and that he'd have to catch her first. Either way, Stabor is always chasing after Folra.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wonder which version is true,\" you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Depends on the group,\" said Baka. \"Some say that all three versions have some sort of truth to them. After all, it's not uncommon for Leonin and Tabaxi to marry one another, and have healthy children. Granted, they aren't as tough as a pure Leonin, nor as quick as a pure Tabaxi, but they are reasonably healthy. I've even traveled with a few.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lots of that seems to happen,\" you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" said Baka. \"So, want to keep watch with me, or are you going back down?\"</span></div></div>",

Their families have pooled together a hefty reward for whoever can discover their whereabouts, whether they be alive or dead. \"So, we're to investigate these disappearances then?\" You ask \"Exactly.\" Said Grildo \"We've also been given a list of the missng person's names. We think it would be best for us to split up and scour the city for any leads, then we'll all meet at the Center Square at midnight to share whatever we've found.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, sounds good to me.\" You say \"I'll see you all at Midnight then.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take a look at the list of names, and decide you may as well begin with the one at the top, Ben Aurelius. You start by asking patrons at the tavern if they've heard of him. Most say no, but then the barkeep tells you that Ben is a frequent customer, and if he's not at the tavern he's probably at the Golden Rose. You'd never heard of the place, but the barkep gives you directions. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou come to a lavishly decorated Inn, but as soon as you step inside, you realize what it actually is. Judging by the dozens of women in skimpy outfits and the men that were ogling them or otherwise enjoying their company, there was only one thing the Golden Rose could be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA brothel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello there, handsome.\" Said a seductive voice. You turn to see a woman with fiery red hair, a curvy figure and a red velvet dress speaking to you. \"Anything I can do for you? Or would you like one of the other girls? Maybe more than one?\" She asks with a sultry tone and knowing wink. \"Actually, I'm looking for someone.\" You say You tell her about the series of disappearances. To your surprise, she beckons you to follow her, as though she knows something about what you're looking for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe leads you upstairs to a private room with a luxurious four poster bed. She motions for you to lay on the bed. You are confused, but do so anyway. The instant you do, she snaps her fingers and chains snake up from under the bed posts and wrap around your wrists and ankles. \"Hey! What's going on!?\" You exclaim, and the woman's voice turns from soothing and seductive to something more sinister as she chuckles maliciously, and she begins to change into her true form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHorns sprout from her head as he skin turns blood red, and her eyes turn a glowing yellowish orange. \"Foolish human.\" She says \"I never thought you'd be this easy to trick!\" \"You're a succubus!?\" You say. \"Everybody in this brothel is. Well, the women are anyway. Those missing men you were looking for were patrons here, or they were until we drained their souls dry! And now, my dear, I'm afraid I'll have to do the same to you. But since you're kind of handsome, how about a little fun first? I promise to make it enjoyable. Think of it as a gift before I suck out your life force.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe conjures a whip in her hand, and you are beginning to break into a cold sweat. You would summon your skeleton minions, but you doubt they'd do any good against a demon like this. What happens next?</span></div></div>",

One of the first rules you learn - always have backup, especially when forced to split up. Let's go.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of you busted out of the room, where you saw a fight in full swing.

Then, there was a bear by a a crowfolk, who was controlling a wheeled personal ballista, with bolts piercing multiple targets, after which, they had to reload it. You ealized that you were looking at a tortle, a leonin, and a kenku, but the bear looked like an ordinary bear, until you got a good look at their eyes, and saw the reptilian traits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A monk, cleric, artificer, and a druid?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, the tortle's a necromancer,\" said Cloud. \"But the staff was indeed used by monks, and has absorbed more than a bit of spiritual power, meaning that it messes up demons.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked at her. \"Really?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCloud laughed. \"No - but being whacked with whatever wood that thing's made of messes up anyone who gets hit with it - usually in the form of a headache!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then heard a roar, and saw as the druid-bear tore a demon to pieces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And the druid?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lizardfolk don't scare easily,\" said Cloud. \"Baka the tortle necromancer, Kosj the lizardman druid of the beasts, Xior the leonin cleric of healing, and Tinker the kenku tinkerer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, where are the other customers?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, when a group of armed adventurers bust into the place using weapons, and the woman you were about to have sex with turns out to be a succubus, I imagine that your first reaction is to get the heck out of that place,\" Cloud said. \"Now, get in there, and chop off some demon heads!\" She shoved you into the fray.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first succubus you bumped into, turned, and tried to claw your face off. You managed to jump back far enough to avoid being hit, and swung your sword, lopping off her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA shriek came from her throat, as her hand turned into ash. \"You!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was when a dozen or so jumped onto you, trying to tear you to pieces. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fill your hands with healing magic and start punching!\" came a deep voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou muttered the words for healing, and a glow came from your hands. You started punching, smashing in faces, and after two or three punches, the rest hopped off, one screaming as a blade pierced her back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was taking me a little while to get to you even while stabbing them in the back,\" Cloud said, pulling you to your feet. She picked up and passed the executioner sword back to you. \"Better off with this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did my healing magic really give me the power to smash their faces in?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, but it kept your fingers from breaking as your hand went through their skulls,\" the leonin said, smashing in the skull of another demon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's the expert on healing magic here,\" said Cloud. \"By the way, summon your buddies - I have weapons that they can borrow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou muttered the words, and Jim, Jeb, and Juanita appeared before you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCloud pulled out a battleaxe, a war hammer, and a war pick, as well as some shields, from her pouch, and gave them to the skeletons. \"Ask them to help us take care of the rest of these succubus, in sending them back to the Infernal Planes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright,\" you said. You looked at the skeletons. \"Kill any demons that try to harm us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe skeletons nodded, and jumped in to take on any succubus that tried to attack those in trouble. Soon, the succubus were torn between having to deal with the Adventurers and your summoned skeletons. You also noted that the Adventurers avoided harming your skeletons. That was when the tortle pointed, and three more skeletons appeared. Cloud ran over to them, and armed them with weapons and shields. The tortle stated his own command, and soon, those skeletons were also taking on the succubus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough, the demons were dealt with, and had been send back to the Infernal Planes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bear changed into a lizardfolk, and looked at you. \"Unsummon your skeletons.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right,\" you said. You muttered the counter-spell, and Jim, Jeb, and Juanita vanished once more, as did Baka's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks for showing up,\" you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your welcome,\" Cloud said. \"Of course, given the noise we've made, I'd best be off. Don't need certain folks knowing that I helped you again, especially rookie Adventurers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about them?\" you asked, pointing at Baka and his group.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not our first time working alongside of her,\" said Baka. \"We <i>know</i> what she is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One who helps the Light from the Shadows,\" said Xior. \"Kind of like you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lets not get into that debate,\" said Baka. \"Suffice it to say, we know her to be a good person, and a friend. We won't betray her secrets.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe ran back up the stairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait,\" you said, running up after her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou managed to follow her into a room, she turned to look at you and that was when you got a good look at her. That was when you saw just how good looking she was.

Xior, mind taking care of it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe leonin nodded. \"Not a problem.\" He walked up the stairs, began opening up doors, and started muttering a cleansing spell. Eventually, he came to you, and muttered one over you. He then went onto the rest of the rooms. When you looked to where Cloud had been, the tabaxi had vanished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's gone,\" you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a tabaxi woman for you,\" said Xior. \"They never stick around after they get what they want.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You familiar with them?\" you asked, as you stood up, your pain mostly gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nXior chuckled. \"There's stories about our two races having a common history when we were created.

You humans tend to mate with almost anyone and anything. There's reasons half-elves, half-orcs, tieflings, aasimars, yuan-ti, and other such things came about.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Some of those races were brought about through less than romantic methods,\" you said. \"Some were even products of deals with powerful beings, like the yuan-ti and their serpent gods.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The deal could have been made out of love, depending upon the being of course,\" said Xior. \"After all, if your kingdom is being destroyed by natural forces, and there's no way for your people to escape, you might pray to the gods for your peoples' survival - perhaps a kind one will indeed help you, but only by transforming your people into something else, to survive in the new environment.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why not just teleport the people?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Transformation spells are easier to do than teleportation spells,\" said Xior. \"Other times, even the gods don't know where a safe place for their people is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see,\" you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's still lots of stories we don't know,\" said Xior. \"For instance, for the Yuan-ti, it's said that evil nobles had sacrificed a number of their slaves in order to take on the forms of their evil gods, correct?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" you said. \"Everyone knows that story.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What if I told you that there was yet another group of snake worshipers, who had turned themselves into that very race, in order to try to persuade others that hadn't gone too far yet, to turn their back on the evil gods, and worship the good ones?\" Xior asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's an interesting story,\" you said. \"Is it true?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not sure, but I have indeed met Yuan-ti that didn't worship the evil snake gods, and instead worship more benevolent snake gods, like Thamos, whose snake servants protect fields from rodents that would otherwise eat the harvest, Ascelape, a goddess of healing, and Cadus, god of travelers and wanderers,\" said Xior. \"A couple of them, you might want to look up actually.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see,\" you said. \"Something to keep in mind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, now get going,\" said Xior. \"You're going to have quite the story - two criminals, and a bunch of succubus, all on the same day. You're going to have all kinds of women throwing themselves at you, and I doubt the dragons have shown up to reward you yet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked at Xior. \"Seriously?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nXior chuckled. \"Perks of being a Hero.\"</span></div></div>",

There'd been plenty of cheers about what you'd done, about how you'd beheaded one of the leading succubi of the group that had been killing people, and about your mighty fists knocking off demon skulls in a single blow. It took you a few drinks before you could leave and head upstairs to sleep. You were barely conscious of the fact that you had undressed before crawling into bed for sleep, and blowing out the candle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThus, it came as a shock when a hand gripped your mouth, and a blade touched your throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't say a word,\" said a familiar voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes strained against the darkness, but without your armor, all you could see was a dark shape looming over you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, I've never given anyone an undeserved cut, so don't move unless I do it for you.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blade moved from your throat, to just under your right ear, and the person moved their fingers. Then, the blade began to scrape down your face, going with the grain of what facial hair you did have.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's funny,\" the person said. \"Among my kind, we see being shaved as some sort of humiliating punishment. Among yours, you see it as part of grooming.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wanted to say something, but didn't feel like getting yourself cut. Besides, you had figured out who your self-appointed barber was - Cloud. Thus, you relaxed, somewhat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good. I'm glad you know that it's a friend, and not an enemy who has a blade to your face,\" she said, as she moved her blade, and turned your head, to do the left side. \"By your actions today, you've made a few enemies - by now, there's demons who have heard of your deeds. They will have placed a price upon your head.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes widened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stay still,\" said Cloud. \"That being said, there's quite a bit of good news - the Dragon Princess Askeera wishes to personally reward you. She's a powerful ally to have on your side. I would know - prevented someone from abducting one of her cousin's eggs a couple of years back.\" She shifted the blade to under your nose. \"Of course, in order to keep my cover, she agreed to declare me a thief who'd stolen some valuable jewels from said cousin, and to give credence to said story, I was allowed to 'steal' s number of them.\" She then shaved under your lower lip. \"In case you're wondering, I'm not quite sure what she'll reward you with. It could be a marriage proposal, some draconian abilities, money, give you a title, or to be one of your lovers.\" She then worked under your chin. \"All of course have their uses. Money's always good, extra abilities make fights easier, titles are good to pass on to your children or other relatives, and having a lover is useful for unwinding. And, that's done.\" She removed her blade from your face. \"How do you like it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt your face. \"Smooth.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good,\" said Cloud. \"I know its customary among single human males to shave their faces, and since you looked like you hadn't shaved for a couple of days, I thought that it would be a good idea to give you one, and teach you an important lesson at the same time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What would that be?\" you asked, as you sat up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Make sure you check the room before you actually enter,\" said Cloud. \"If you had sent in one of your skeleton buddies first, they would have spotted me for sure. After that, secure the windows and door, in order to reduce the odds of someone entering without your notice. Also, make sure that have at least one of your skeleton's on watch at all times. Again, they can wake you up, or make enough noise to wake you up as they delay an intruder.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see,\" you said. \"Still, you could have just woken me up and told me this stuff in the morning. You didn't have to shave me yourself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCloud chuckled. \"True, but not but a few hours ago, you were all set to kiss me, when I convinced you otherwise. I was wondering if you were still interested, and possibly if you wished to go further.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou chuckled nervously at the memory. \"I'm not sure. I mean, we're of different species.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Close enough where it really counts,\" said Cloud, as she sat on the bed. \"Your kind merely lacks the barbs that male Tabaxi and Leonin, and other feline-types, tend to have.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds like that would hurt,\" you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It does the first few times, or it it's been a while since one's last time,\" said Cloud. \"But, if you have a reasonably active sex life, you get used to the barbs scraping the inside of your vagina, or anus if you like it that way, enough to the point that the sensation becomes almost normal. That being said, healing potions and spells make things easier. That Xior's not a bad substitute for a male tabaxi, and as a cleric, he has those healing hands.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, you've done this before?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCloud chuckled. \"Few Adventurers remain a Virgin for more than a few months after graduation. At some point, there's that barmaid you invite to your room, some damsel you've rescued, or even another Adventurer, especially after you've been through one of those moments where you were almost killed. That being said, I'd strongly advise one very important thing - protection. You don't want to have to deal with an unwanted child, as that really sours any prior good relationship you've might have had prior.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay,\" you said. \"Useful to know. So, do you have this Protection?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCloud chuckled. \"Yes, and I got some for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe placed a box in your hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Academy gives them out to those who ask, and plenty of Healer shops have them behind the counter,\" Cloud said. \"You simply slip them on over your maleness, and they'll prevent unwanted pregnancy, providing that they are in good shape of course. Different species require different ones for greater strength for some, but it will do the job. Also, the barbs on a male Tabaxi or Leonin are less noticeable too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds useful for you,\" you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, do you think that you're up to it?\" Cloud asked.</span></div></div>",

So, is that a 'Yes'?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is,\" you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good.\" Cloud slipped in under the covers, and positioned herself on top of you. \"Now, since this is your first time, we'll keep things very basic, face-to-face, plain old-fashion, sex.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, aren't males supposed to be on top?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCloud chuckled. \"Only if you're able to put me beneath you, or I let you be on top.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then felt something slip onto your maleness. \"Is that the Protection?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not my first time dressing my partner,\" said Cloud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, Cloud shifted her position slightly, and your maleness felt a certain amount of pressure, and warmth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, for the oldest and most basic of instincts,\" Cloud said. \"That of mating.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnything else you might have thought about saying was silenced when she placed her mouth over yours, and you, all but instinctively, placed one hand on the upper part of her back, and the other on the lower part, as both of your bodies began moving in that most basic of rituals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA little while later, you were very much exhausted. In some ways, you'd felt like you'd been engaged in one grappling maneuver or another as you had tried to roll on top of Cloud, but she always shifted herself in some way that made such a thing impractical. As such, you'd remained on the bottom, and she on top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe chuckled. \"Guess you need to work on your strength and stamina a bit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will that improve the sex?\" you gasped out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, but it will make you have a better chance of rolling over on top of me,\" said Cloud. \"Other than that, not bad for your first time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Does it get better?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCloud chuckled. \"Best sex to have is the sort you have with the special someone you love. It's not the most exciting, and it can be boring at times, but at the end of a Quest, when the gold has been rewarded and the magic weapons have been given, and you're free to take your leave, they are the person you return home to. They are the sort of person who doesn't care if you're a Hero or a farmer, because its you that they fell in love with, and they are the reason you'd be willing to do almost anything to protect them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anything?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCloud nodded. \"About thirty years back, a demon abducted a young farmer's wife. That farmer went after that demon, with some Adventurers of course, and fought that demon, armed with nothing more than a pitchfork and a long knife, and a few other things the average farmer has. The farmer's love for his wife was so great, there was a power that was like that of a paladin flowing from him into those farming implements, like when a paladin empowers his weapons, and he was able to slay this demon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds like a Hero to me,\" you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, just a farmer who loved his wife,\" said Cloud. \"He took her back home, and they rebuilt the place. While the Adventurers tried to get him to become an Official Hero, and tried to get him properly rewarded for slaying said demon, he said that the only reward he wanted, was knowing that his wife was safe at home. The Adventurers actually respected his request, and left things at that. That being said, they would stop by every so often, and would give them a share of whatever coins they'd gotten, so the farmer didn't lack financially, and even became like uncles and aunts to the farmer's children, telling stories about their adventures. After a while, a daughter of that farmer, growing up on such tales, decided to become an Adventurer herself, becomeing a rogue with a reputation for pulling off incredible heists, or so they claim she does, when in truth, she's actually an undercover guard.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, that farmer, who killed a demon, was your father?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCloud chuckled. \"Maybe, or maybe I'm just telling a tale tail.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then slipped out from under the sheets, and you watched as her shape put her clothes on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"By the way, when it comes to picking out lovers of races other than your own, pick someone close to your size and shape,\" Cloud said. \"Makes things easier on both of you. Tried it once with a centaur - that was tricky. Then there was an orc - he was a bit too big for my tastes. Then there was a halfling - he was a little short. Still, there's always a way. Later.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then slipped out through the window.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guess that's a tabaxi female,\" you said. \"Got what she wanted, and left.\" You then went back to sleep.</span></div></div>",

Otherwise, you leave us no choice but to fight.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo your surprise, Kiaka let out an amused chuckle \"I think I may actually be starting to respect you, Cedric. You actually have the balls to come into my land and ask me to leave, or threaten me and my clan. Never thought a human could be so bold.

It grants you protection in Dragon Lands, should your travels ever take you through them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou perk up at this. \"What kind of protection?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Diplomatic protection, providing that you, more or less, behave yourself,\" said Askeera. \"Providing that you don't intentionally cause trouble, you will be free to travel through the lands, without needing a dragon with you, and other dragons are required to help you if you ask for assistance.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds useful, as I know that the Dragon Lands can be tricky to navigate for those who don't live there,\" you said, as you looked at the diamond with renewed interest. \"Still, why would they help me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That diamond marks you as an Honorary Member of the Royal Dragon Family, and as such, those of lesser bloodlines are honor-bound to help you,\" said Askeera.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes bulged at this. \"That's quite the reward.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you'd been of dragon blood, you'd of ended up being my Mate,\" said Askeera. \"Hope was that a dragon would do the deed, and that I'd end up having a husband out of the deal. But, since humans don't live much longer than a hundred years, a long term relationship isn't a good idea.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I understand,\" you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That being said, there's nothing wrong with me having a dalliance with a Hero who brought the murderer of my brother to justice,\" Askeera said, with a grin. \"Sometimes an entertaining diversion from politics can refresh ones mind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou chuckle nervously. \"Um, I didn't do the job alone. I had help.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, the Tabaxi rogue known as Cloud,\" Askeera chuckled. \"As far as the Public is concerned, she stole from the horde of a minor noble dragon family, and will be punished by having to serve that family for a maximum of two years. Truthfully, she foiled the theft of said family's eggs, which are, as you can imagine, more precious than even the gem I just gave you. It was she who suggested that you get <i>that</i> particular, as I was going to give it to her, along with a 'Pardon' for her involvement for capturing my brother's murderer, but she did have a point - as far as the Public is concerned, you brought in two highly wanted criminals, by yourself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, Publicly, what's going to happen to Cloud?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She has a reputation for <i>escaping</i>,\" said Askeera. \"Escaping the servitude of a dragon's household isn't as easy as escaping your human-type cells. Truthfully of course, she'll merely be an Honored Guest to that household, as she does need to stay out of the area for a few months, as it were. Still, she's very good at <i>escaping</i>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what about Crog?\" you asked. \"Has he been dealt with?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAskeera snorted, flames coming out of her nose. \"That one's on his way to becoming dragon shit, among other things.\" She looked at you. \"I dealt with him personally. If you listen closely, you might hear him still cursing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, given that he tried to kill me, good to know,\" you said. \"Doubt even a powerful necromancer could raise him from that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That, and he's short a Ring of Acid Protection, among other such things,\" said Askeera. \"Cloud accepted a few of the smaller items. She says that you can have the ax - it's one of those returning models - back to your hand thirty seconds after you throw it. It doesn't fit her style.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll have to tell her 'Thanks' next time I see her,\" you said. \"Might be useful as a backup weapon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" said Askeera. \"By the way....\"</span></div></div>",

Especially if it was as a reward for a favor or other deed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't blame you if you want to think this through.\" Askeera said with a shrug \"I'd be pretty surprised too, were the roles reversed.\" To say you were surprised was a huge understatement, but still, you were rather curious as to what a dragon marriage entailed. \"Suppose I say yes...\" You say \"What happens after that?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd fly you to the Dragon Lands to meet the other members of my House, we proceed with the ceremony, then we...well...consumate the union.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wouldn't that be, well, kind of awkward?\" You say somewhat shyly. \"I mean, no offense, but you are much larger than I am.

I could swallow you into my Krom, that's a sort of second stomach we have, and let you there for a few days and when you emerge, you would have to ability to become a dragon at will.

It's not unusual for a dragon to have more than one mate, especially if the one was for purely political reasons, whereas the other was love from the beginning.

Furthermore, that gem cannot be stolen, unless you allow the thief to steal it. It can't be removed from you by more than three feet, without summoning a dragon, unless you had put it on a shelf and no one else took it. Also, if you were to die of anything other than purely natural reasons, a dragon would come.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What if I gave it to my wife?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAskeera chuckled. \"You'd still get the protection, and the summonings, but now, she would as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see,\" you said. \"Um, do you know of the Tabaxi Rogue known as Cloud?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, and I already have made arrangements for her to be placed into my custody,\" said Askeera. \"She stole some valuable gems from one of my nobles, and will thus be spending the next five years as his family's servant, unless they decide she's made up for her debt.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wondered if you should tell her the truth about Cloud being an undercover guard. Your worry lessened when Askeera chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That being said, that feline has a habit of <i>escaping</i>,\" she said. \"After all, some things are more valuable than gems, like unhatched eggs that someone else tried to make off with.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right,\" you said. \"What about Crog?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's got other issues now,\" said Askeera. \"Dragon stomach acid is rather powerful, especially without a Ring of Acid Protection, which he no longer had after a very thorough search of his body to locate such things. By the way, next time you stop by the Guard Station, they have a few things for you, like his ax. It's the kind that you can throw, and it will return to you.

Up until now, a rather useless specialty, but everyone has to have a hobby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmong the many, many properties attributed to the Ceathrucub is that it exists in many places at many times, including different planes. Depending on the legend, it was created by an archmage to help him travel from place to place, or by a god of mischief to drive mortals mad with its geometrical complexity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMost druids are, to be it bluntly, mathematical morons. They can keep of the seasons and the years, but that's about it. One, two, a few, a lot, a whole lot...that's their concept of numbers. You, on the other hand, are a genius, and your quarters are full of treatise on mathematics, as well as a few correspondents from various mathematicians who probably don't know that the scholar they are exchanging discourses with is a hot little druid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd even if they did, there's nothing you or they could do about it. Your a druid stuck in the middle of nowhere, and that's where you're going to stay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr where you thought you were going to stay. Until Rabgud showed up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wonder if he has any new knowledge of the location of the Ceathrucub. Legend has it that, more than a millenia ago, it was cast into the Starry Void, to ensure its powers were never  misused again, as it has been in ancient history. However, it was said to appear from time to time in your world and, if a capable and learned mathematician such as yourself knew the last place and time it had appeared, they could predict its next time and place of appearance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rabgud will stay with us for a few days, while you two exchange information and make preparations for your journey. Birchvene, if you would show our honored guest to the Billowous Caves?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Billowous Caves were actually a large cavern about half a league from the Sacred Grove. It was spacious enough, with a large spring heated pool, to be a comfortable place for a man the size of Rabgud to sleep comfortably.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd Rabgud was quite a sizeable man. As you walk up to him, you find him to be taller than you initially thought. You barely reach up to his knee. You idly wonder how big other parts of him are. Of course, they'd be too big to use on you in the traditional way, but perhaps some exotic and erotic rubbing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shake your head, getting those thoughts out of our mind. Fortunately, Rabgud doesn't seem to have noticed your speculation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you head toward the Caves, he asks, \"If you like, you can ride my shoulder on the walk over.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

That being said, considering your disparate sizes, it might be easier on Rabgud if he was able to set the pace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo you decide to let him pick you up and put you on his shoulder. After all, you two will be adventuring together, and he'll probably have to pick you up from time to time. Better get used to it early, you decide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBesides, the last time...actually the only time...a guy touched you in any way was right before you decided to head to the big city to become a hero. It was Johnny Fourhuts from the next farm over, and you were kissing in the haypile in your barn. He was just about to go for your pumpkins when your father walked into the barn and almost caught you. Johnny scurried away and you were left frustrated and straw in your hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd since then, nobody's hands but your own has been around your pumpkins or the rest of your harvest ever since.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVery frustrating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe frustration continued by the way Rabgud picks you up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou may be the shortest druid in the bunch, but you also have the biggest pumpkins. Gravity defying pumpkins, you might add.They're the size of nice sized cantaloupes, and look even larger thanks to your narrow waist and short stature. Considering the fact you wander around in light green semi-translucent grecian style robes with only green panties underneath, and you figure their natural jiggle would be enticing enough to Rabgud would try to cop even a small feel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNothing doing. His hand wraps around far enough down your body that your pumpkins don't even get a chance to let your pumpkins a chance to rest on the top of his fingers. And his hand wraps around your hips in such a way that his fingertips don't land on either your bum or your no-no place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVery, very frustrating. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Rabgud sets you on his shoulder, you discover his giant face is just as handsome when you're right next to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"May I ask you a question about your personal appearance?\" he asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Absolutely,\" you ask breathlessly, wondering what part of your body is enticing to your extra large companion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I notice that all the druids have different colored hair, including some that you don't always see on a woman, including purple and orange. Yours is the only dark black hair I've seen,\" he adds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah,\" you observe, trying not to sound disappointed. You unconsciously touch your hair, which is currently up in the morning song style. Normally you would have let it your thick, dark, slightly curly hair down, where it would normally fall almost all the way down to your waist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, my hair was actually just a shade or two lighter before I came to the Grove to study,\" you explan \"So it really didn't change that much, compared to what happened to other of my sisters and cousins and aunts and mothers and whatnots,\" you explain. \"Our hair color reflect what aspects of nature we are most attuned with. Mine is this dark because it reflects the night sky and the stars, from which a druid can discover the inner workings of nature.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fascinating,\" Rabgud remarks. \"Is that why you also have darker skin than the rest of the druids.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm afraid the explanation is a little more mundane,\" you laugh at is observation about your olive skin. \"My family migrated here two generations back from a kingdom further to the south.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay,\" he chuckled as the two of you reach the entrance of the Billowous Caves. He's about to reach for you to set you down on the ground when he asks, \"I have some interesting sketches of how I think the Ceathrucub will manifest itself. Would you like to see them?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you left, your mother warned you that men would often invited you up to their residence to see their sketches.

Most supply stores sell it - tends to be behind the counter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay,\" you said. \"Um, this trip, will it be just be you and I?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRabgud chuckled, and said.....</span></div></div>",

Monk's a Leonin - that lioness has no issues using her fists or claws. Barbarian's a kobold - that little lizard can be right scary when he's angry.

Ranger's a Triton - what that fishwoman doesn't know about the waterways, probably isn't worth knowing. Sorcerer's an Aarakocra - that eagle's got dragon-like scales, and he can fly - good at the scouting. Warlock is a Winged Tiefling, and she's also good at the scouting, and due to making a deal with a Celestial, she's good at the healing. Then, there's you, and I.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mentioned an Artificer,\" you said. \"What about them?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Simic Hybrid, with the ability to climb trees and walls, with a set of crab-like claws as extra limbs, and seems that she likes to make these contraptions to aid her in battle,\" said Rabgud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds like an interesting party, as those are races I haven't heard a whole lot about,\" you said. \"Simic Hybrid? Haven't heard of that one much.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One of those folks whose ancestors got over-exposed to magic during the Mage Wars a couple of centuries back,\" said Rabgud. \"Magic altered them, and they picked up traits of certain animals.

The day prior, you had managed to pass the ceremony that stated that you were now a Druid, and thus, you were free to leave the Grove. One of the elk that lived in the area had let you ride on its back, until you got to the outskirts of civilization. You looked around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Been a while since you've been in a town I take it?\" Rabgud said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Four years,\" you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Father always said, leave a place for a few years, and when you come back, it's changed,\" said Rabgud. \"On the other hand, he also said, leave a place for a few years, and you find that nothing changes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How does that even work?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The species makeup of the locals might change, or they might get a somewhat different status, and yet there will still be the same sorts of issues,\" said Rabgud. \"Bound to find an inn, bound to find a store, bound to find some sort of temple to the gods, and you're bound to find someone trying to pick your pocket.\" At this, Rabgud reached down, and grabbed something that was beneath your waist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked, and saw that Rabgud was holding onto a kobold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice to see you Roko,\" said Rabgud. \"Hard to steal from a rogue, you know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just making sure that you were paying attention, you big lump,\" the kobold said. \"Mind putting me down.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRubgud held out his other hand. \"Give it back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoko took something from his belt, and dropped it onto Rubgud's hand. \"Nothing really in it. No money by the sounds.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't steal from a Druid,\" Rabgud said. The half-giant passed the object to you. It was your pouch of materials needed for some of your spells.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't notice him take it,\" you said, putting the pouch back into your robes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not much of a druid if she can't see,\" said Roko.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I'm a rogue who can't sneak, just as you're a barbarian that's not that intimidating,\" Rabgud said, dropping the kobold. \"Birchvene, meet Roko, Roko, meet Birchvene.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If she can't spot a pickpocket, what good is she?\" Roko asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She can help us find what we're looking for,\" said Rabgud. \"That's more valuable. Besides - let Thunder and Mirik, and a couple of the others worry about spotting thieves. I caught you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Point taken,\" said Roko.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked at the kobold. He was barely two feet tall. \"This is our Barbarian?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Judge me by my size, do?\" Roko asked. \"Bad idea, unless you fancy losing your legs. Roko Legchopper is what my enemies call me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right,\" said Rabgud. \"And the rest?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In the inn, waiting on Cyan to show up,\" said Roko. \"Innkeeper has a spot on the floor for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell me that you guys got a good price,\" Rabgud said. \"I remember the last place.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't remind me,\" said Roko. \"There's times I'm <i>still</i> finding straw and dried manure in my stuff.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked at Rabgud. \"What does he mean by that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Place wanted twenty gold apiece, just to sleep in the barn, and we're not talking about a nice warm, and relatively clean, one either,\" said Rabgud. \"Last time we're ever doing a job in <i>that</i> town.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're telling me,\" said Roko. \"This place is clean, good beds, good food, and the innkeeper's wife's not bad-looking either, and he doesn't mind. Of course, he's not too shabby either.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whom did you do?\" Rabgud asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe little lizard grinned. \"I ain't saying.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Knowing you, the innkeeper,\" said Rabgud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe,\" said Roko. \"Still, come on. Lunch should be ready soon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough, you came to an inn, the doorway of which, Rabgud had to crawl through. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked around. The place looked nice, and there was a table filled with the folks Rabgud had described. There was even an empty table next to it, with a sign that said \"Reserved for Rabgud.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very thoughtful,\" the half-giant said, practically crawling to the table, before he sat up, sitting on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Our innkeeper is very understanding about such things,\" said Roko, as he climbed up some distinctly ladder-like rungs, up to a high chair that would fit a smaller person. \"He's a goblin. And the wife, she's a firbolg.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guess he likes bigger women,\" said Rabgud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look at the rest of the party. There was the tabaxi and hobgoblin, both in their armor, though that worn by the tabaxi seemed more flexible than most. The satyr was drinking a thing of wine, and not her first by the looks of it. The tortle was looking through a wizard's book. The Lizardfolk was strumming something, and occasionally looking at you, with a slightly predatory look. The Triton was working on her bow and arrows. The Aarakocra was checking their feathers, and the Winged Tiefling was checking her face in a hand mirror. Then there was the Leonin. She was in a spot where she could watch things, by the looks. The feeling was, again, that of a Predator watching their Prey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked over at Rabgud. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe half-giant gave you a smile. \"Minor precaution. One always on lookout, even when resting in a place like this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright,\" you said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA goblin came to you. \"What would you like? If you'll forgive me, you look to be a druid, and I know that some sects are against the eating of animal flesh. So, what's your interest for lunch?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, thank you,\" you said. You told them what you wanted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll get on it,\" they said. They went back behind the counter, calling out something to another person.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked, and saw a muscular blue being. You figured that was the firbolg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tabaxi looked at you, and chuckled. \"You meet all sorts when you Adventure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess so,\" you said.</span></div></div>",

The room immediately goes quiet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou've been training under Master Khobo for the last three years at the Heroes' Academy.  Although there are a number of fighting masters at the Academy, Master Khobo trains only those whom he thinks will become the best. And for some reason, when that scrawny little girl who was you showed up at the Academy, cow manure still between her bare feet, Master Khobo thought you were worth training.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tavern has grown quiet because of your first visit to the tavern two years ago. You had been training under Master Khobo for fourteen months, and had blossomed. You left the farm at age eighteen, all skin and bones, your hair a tangled mess that hadn't been addressed for a lifetime.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFourteen months in to your training, you had become both a beauty and a badass. And by badass, there wasn't a student in the school you couldn't take, either armed or unarmed. Even a few of the other fighting masters avoided having to spar with you. And your skill with the Malamus (a slightly curved, single edged blade approximately three and half foot in length that was unique to the kingdom) was unequalled by any at the Academy, save Master Khobo himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour time at the Academy was spent training, eating and sleeping, and occasionally reading those tomes Master Khobo suggested for you. Some of those tomes were silly poetry and such, but Master Khobo said he wanted you to become something called a \"Well Rounded Individual.\" Your admiration for Master Khobo was such that you would indulge what you considered his foolish whims.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter fourteen months of training, Master Khobo suggested you join your comrades when they went to a tavern in the town. You were quite reluctant, but Master Khobo's suggestions had the force of law with you. So you borrowed clothes from another woman, \"dressed up\" and headed to the tavern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first time you entered that tavern, all talking stopped. But that's because you weren't that scraggly farm kid you were more than a year ago. You were a tall, statuesque beautiful redhead (worn in a single braid that stretch to the small of your back) with a face that launched ships and green eyes that rivaled stars.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe group of students you were with made their way to their normal table, and you felt all eyes on you as you made your way through the tavern. When your group found their table, free drinks began arriving from all across the tavern. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen one particularly burly patron came over to your table, and bluntly asked if your breasts were \"real or ensorcelled.\" He announced to one and all that he could tell the difference with a simple squeeze, and promptly reached for your right breast to demonstrate his technique.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaid hand not only didn't reach its destination, it took several weeks to heal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe brawl that ensued would become legendary, When the city guard arrived, they found three groups of people.You and your friends, the patrons and staff of the tavern who wanted nothing to do with the brawl, and the unconscious. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou never had any problems going into the tavern again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as the bards saw you, they began singing<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>She's got legs, she knows how to use them<br>\r\nShe never begs, she knows how to choose them</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou flash the bards a grin as you make your way to a table. Around you, the noise level began to return to normal. Despite your first night here, you've come to love this tavern. And the Heroes' Academy (especially Master Khobo) has earned a place in your heart. But this will be your last night in the city, for tomorrow you w8ll travel to<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Anyone wanting shelter after us, will either be sleeping in the dining area, or in the barn with the horses. Too be fair, neither option is all that bad. At least we ain't sharing a room with Cain and Dano - they'd keep you up half the night.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are they actually lovers?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only have eyes for one another,\" said Zeed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked at the bed. \"They expect us to share this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Be lucky you're not sharing it with Roth or some of the others,\" said Zeed. \"As you might have noticed, some of them are big and heavy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that Roth must eat like a horse,\" you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZeed chuckled. \"Yep, especially if he doesn't have his specific rations. A bit from one of those will keep someone like you and I going for like a week. For him, that's just to keep his stomach content until he gets some actual food.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Doesn't solve the issue with the bed,\" you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wouldn't worry too much about it if I was you anyways,\" said Zeed. \"Putting it bluntly, I'm not interested in mammals for things that involve mating and the like.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, okay,\" you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZeed chuckled. \"Wouldn't worry about that sort of thing with any of the others either - they'd ask for permission, and they'd make sure to use Protection. That's one of the things we agreed upon when we first started working together. When one is in a strange town, you don't want to get tossed out, or worse, because someone dragged some bar wench into a room, only to find out that not only is she the innkeeper's daughter, said innkeeper has a brother who has a high position in the town guard, and has a cousin who holds influence over the local gangs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds like an oddly specific example,\" you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Happened a few years back,\" said Zeed. \"We'd traveled to this elven town, got there a little late, so there wasn't any room available, beyond the dining area and the barn. During the night, some elf maiden working in one of the rooms was murdered, among other things, and Cronk was blamed, just because he was an orc. Funny thing is, Cronk had quite the alibi - he'd tried to outdrink Berov, and that Loxodon can really hold his liquor - with all he'd drunk, he couldn't even get off the floor, let alone do anything else. Another thing to note, when you've trusted your life to someone more than once, you don't abandon them right away - you do whatever you can to protect them. For any of his faults, Cronk always has our backs whenever we're in a tight spot, and as such, we couldn't do any less for him. Funny thing is, clerics can speak with the dead - Teoz had a nice little chat with the elf maiden. She was able to confirm that Cronk wasn't the one who had harmed her, and, more importantly, revealed that her attacker had been human. That was when Berov did his own checking - Loxodons have very good noses, and figured out who it was, some merchant. Well, whatever else that merchant was, he was good with a knife - mortally injured the innkeeper, causing them to go unconscious, killed some of the other guests, seriously injured the other ones, ran out as the guards were coming, and portrayed us as a pack of murderers. Let me tell you this - anyone can use a crossbow to plant a bolt between someone's eyes, but constantly putting said bolts into their feet and hands, that takes skill. Didn't want to kill any of the guards, again for obvious reasons, but those elves wouldn't have given Cronk or us a fair trial, given what that merchant had claimed we'd done.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did you get out of it?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Got Owag to thank for that one,\" said Zeed. \"He talked to the Captain. Pointed out rather clearly that if we were indeed murderers, the wounded guards would all be dead, instead of having issues with their hands and feet. More importantly, he allowed the Captain to enter the inn, to talk to the injured guests. The other guests and the innkeeper backed us up. That Merchant soon had problems bigger than us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He escaped the guards, but he couldn't outrun the gangs,\" said Zeed. \"One of these gang members could manipulate plants. Seems he was choked to death by some rather thorny vines, and was found hanging from the branch of a tree with said vines growing on it. No one bothered looking into the reasons beyond that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why did he do it?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZeed shrugged. \"Doesn't matter. He thought that he could frame our friend, and get us killed. We proved him wrong, and he paid the price.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see,\" you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's why you can trust us in any situation,\" said Zeed. \"Be it with your life, or your body.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright,\" you said.</span></div></div>",

Said doppelganger made the mistake of using that form when the Changeling was using another. It's always interesting when some merchant decided to ask the one who 'looked' like our friend questions to which only we and they should know. Seems that there was a reason that changeling liked that form, and it had to deal with the fact that the half-elf, whose form they'd used, was a murdered friend of theirs, and thus used that form as a way to honor them. Imagine folks surprise when the merchant turned into the very half-elf, and said 'You ain't my friend. I saw them die. Reveal your true form, or I'll kill you!' Bit of an interesting fight, to watch them go at it with daggers, and changing their forms during the fight. Eventually, the one ran, and that's when we asked the other questions to which only we knew the answers to - like the half-elf's name - as we already knew that our friend was a changeling, and we knew the friend's name.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Since we knew about the doppelganger, we came up with this little ritual, for the old 'Just in case' situations,\" said Zeed. \"You might want to learn it for when you wander around places alone. Might save your life.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright,\" you said. You looked at the bed. \"How are we going to do this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll take the wall side,\" said Teoz. \"You get the middle, and Zeed gets the edge. Fairest way I figure, to go by weight and size. You might have issues crawling over me, but I have none crawling over you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright,\" you said. \"I just hope that there isn't any other issues.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTeoz looked at Zeed. \"She knows that she can trust us with her body, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZeed nodded. \"Mentioned it already.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good,\" said Teoz.

This was to prevent certain issues that would be detrimental to training, least of which being Pregnancies, another being Animosity between fellow trainees. Still, in any case, the beds had all been the same general style, and generally only had room for one person. In fact, the beds were all but sized to the person - halflings slept in halfling-sized beds, orcs in orc-sized beds, and so on. In any case, there was no room for two people, especially as the beds had some sort of enchantment that basically kept say two halflings from jumping into an orc-sized bed, because it would become halfling sized.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs it was, you were surprised to see the bed expand to accommodate Teoz, as he laid on it. A moment prior, it had looked like you and Zeed would have had to, all but entangle, just to even fit on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One good thing about the innkeeper,\" said Teoz. \"He at least makes sure that those who <i>do</i> get a bed, will sleep comfortably.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose so,\" you said. \"I was wondering how we'd fit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you were thinking that we'd be tangled up, could still happen,\" said Zeed. \"At least we'd be tangled up in comfort.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTeoz chuckled. \"Small price to pay, for a good bed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, besides Cain and Dano, is anyone else here, um, into members of the same sex?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZeed chuckled. \"Most prefer females, but after doing a job for some time, and there <i>hasn't</i> been any friendly females for a while, sometimes one asks for assistance with <i>that</i> issue.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jay was good with that one,\" said Teoz. \"One good thing about a changeling, beyond using their ability to slip into places, is their ability to be the perfect sexual partner when you need one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou watched as Teoz took his outfit off, leaving him in his loincloth, and you got a good look at his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see you like muscular guys.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked at Zeed, and saw him also wearing little more than his own loincloth. He wasn't as muscular as Teoz, but his wings were interesting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZeed chuckled. \"The attraction wears off after a while.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right,\" you said, as you took off your own outfit, leaving you in the wrap you used for your breasts to keep them from bouncing around, and well as your own loincloth. \"Still, I'd be a liar if I said that Teoz's muscles were not attractive.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTeoz chuckled. \"I do get plenty of women. More than Zeed here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like I said, not into mammals,\" said Zeed. \"Still, even I can get a woman when I want one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right,\" you said. You then got onto the bed. You had to admit, it was very comfortable.........<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you awoke, you found yourself looking at Teoz's chest. You also noticed your arm draped over his side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see you're awake,\" came Zeed's voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turned, and saw Zeed was dressed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mind getting out of bed?\" he asked. \"There's some things that Teoz would like to do, but he's too much of a priest to just shove you off of him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked up, to see Teoz staring down at you. There was an amused look on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Morning,\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, sorry,\" you said, as you moved away from him. \"It's just that, um, um....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry about it,\" said Teoz, as he scooted down to the foot of the bed. \"It's only natural to huddle up for warmth.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One of a thousand things they fail to teach at the Academy,\" said Zeed. \"Another being that few Adventurers remain a Virgin for more than a few months.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked at Zeed. \"Seriously?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZeed chuckled. \"There's a reason we all carry Protection.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Another thing that they <i>don't</i> teach you, is how to respond to the death of a friend,\" said Teoz. \"Or how to respond to your first kill.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mentioned a Changeling that was in the party,\" you said. \"What happened to them?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's just say that there was a reason we talked to Khobo about picking out our thirteenth member,\" said Zeed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's like this,\" Teoz said, as he got his outfit on. \"Jay -\"</span></div></div>",

Good fella actually, protected the village from those who'd do harm to it. Slight issue, he fell for a pretty woman, who poisoned him. That woman was Sharian. Sharian had summoned a demon to attack that village. The Champion had a special sword, of the sort of material that <i>seriously</i> messes up a demon's day. Issue is, only the Champion could wield it, as it was bonded to him. Jay thought that they could trick the sword into accepting them as a user.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did it work?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not exactly,\" said Zeed. \"The sword was one of those intelligent weapons, with powers of its own. It knew full well that Jay <i>wasn't</i> the Champion. It only allowed Jay to use it, <i>if</i> Jay was willing to take the Champion's place as the village's protector.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I take it they accepted,\" you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTeoz nodded. \"Whatever else one might have said about Jay, they were at least willing to pay the price. He can't leave that village, unless the villagers move, the sword requires him elsewhere, or the sword finds a more suitable replacement.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, then why did you ask for me anyways?\" you asked. \"I mean, you have a Paladin, a turtle whose shell's almost as good as full plate armor, and other folks who'd be good in a fight. So, why me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZeed chuckled. \"Because sometimes, someone who doesn't use magic, can take a blow, <i>and</i> doesn't scare people away with their looks, is useful to have. In some places, folks like me, Teoz, and the others, we look rather odd, and might not get any assistance. Humans however, you're all over. You can at least get shopkeepers to sell you things and buy stuff from us, if they think that you're in charge of us. Likewise, you can get us rooms in the inn, and not in the barn. Also, those who give out Reward Money might pay extra for what they think is a pretty face.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hard to get information unless folks are willing to talk to you,\" said Teoz. \"If anything else, you're not bad looking. Of course, if you need help with the persuading, or if need be, deception and intimidation, we can help you practice those skills.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, you don't need me for my fighting skills, but mainly so that folks will talk to at least someone in the group?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZeed nodded. \"Sword swingers are easy to find. Talkers however, not so easy. A pretty human woman, tends to have an edge at any rate, especially one that can swing a sword too!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTeoz chuckled. \"Like I said, if you need help with the social skills, we can all help - we'll see to it you'll have the skills to lie, scare, and persuade, as need be.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright,\" you said. \"I guess I can do that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good,\" said Zeed. \"I'll be downstairs.\" He left the room.</span></div></div>",

From the time you left the inn, until Owag deemed it was good enough to stop, you reckoned you'd traveled about thirty miles in the space of eight hours. You were near a relatively sheltered area, with a stream nearby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks safe enough,\" said Owag. \"Enough light to locate some additional dry wood for a fire for supper.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll take the mounts,\" said Roth, once the packs were taken off. \"Berov - does that trunk of yours say if that stream's safe enough to drink from?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe loxodon chuckled. Then, he sniffed. \"Safe enough, but if you fancy a swim, do so downstream from where we get any drinking water.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't need to drink horse piss again,\" Cronk muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was only once!\" Roth called back, as he took the mounts. \"And it wasn't mine!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBozzori chuckled. The minotaur looked at you. \"Rookie mistake. We've all made them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just make sure that they don't get you killed,\" said Tovak. The hobgoblin took out a woodcutting ax and passed it to you, then got out another. \"We're on wood duty.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked at him. \"What about the others?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everyone has to do something,\" said Owag. \"Since you're the newest, you get wood duty tonight. Teaches you how to locate your way back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou watched as the rest were doing one thing or another, clearing the area of large rocks, logs, setting up a fire pit, as well as a sleeping area, although Zeed had flown up into a tree, and seemed to be keeping a lookout.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTovak placed his hand on your shoulder. \"Come on. I know humans don't see too good in the dark, and neither do some of the others.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou followed the hobgoblin into the woods, until he found a fallen tree.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you think?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know,\" you said. \"I thought that we were going to cut down trees.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bad idea there,\" said Tovak. \"Place might have pixies living in the live ones, and don't get me started on dryads and others of that sort of nature. Piss off the wrong one, you end up dead at best, or you get turned into a tree at worst, being fully aware of everything, yet being unable to do anything. Saw it happen once.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Was it one of the group?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're usually smart enough not to piss off the wrong people,\" said Tovak. \"It's one thing to have enemies, but never anger someone you <i>know</i> you cannot defeat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then how do Adventurers defeat powerful enemies?\" you asked, as you lifted up one end of the fallen tree. \"I mean, there's stories of Heroes defeating monsters that could easily kill a normal man. How does that work?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Behind every Hero is a Team,\" said Tovak, as he picked up a section further down. \"As far as an orc is concerned, Cronk gets credit whenever our group is mentioned in Orc territory. Zeed could be the one who slit a giant's throat to make sure that it was dead, but, because Cronk's arrows were in the giant's organs, orcs will claim that Cronk killed the giant. Likewise, if you kill a hydra in Leonin territory, Teoz gets the credit because he used his magic to injure it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds like it's stupid,\" you said, as the two of you started walking. \"All that work, and no credit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, but if I kill a demon that was destroying the land, in a human kingdom, you'd get the credit, just because you were spotted trying to fight it,\" said Tovak. \"You could have done next to no damage, got thrown around like a rat shaken by a terrier, and I do all the hard work of killing it, only for you to get all the credit. Does that sound fair to you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No,\" you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yet, that's how this thing works,\" said Tovak. \"You do something, but get no credit. You do little, yet take all the credit. The one who got the credit might say, 'Actually, <i>they</i> were the one to kill the monster,' only for this claim to be ignored by whomever it was told to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what does one do in such a situation?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTovak chuckled. \"Don't go bragging about it. Don't say that you did it, don't say you didn't. Just keep eating the food on your plate, and enjoying your drink.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What if they knock the plate off, and call you a coward?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Order another plate of food,\" said Tovak. \"Never make a hostile reaction, unless you have to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What if they try to grab you?\" you asked, recalling the tavern incident two years back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Grab their hand before they grab you,\" said Tovak. \"After that, to shove them back would be the best thing, but you'd probably end up in a fight anyways.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What if you do have to fight?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't pull out a weapon, or use a spell, unless you have to,\" said Tovak. \"Unconscious fools recover. Dead ones, don't.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And if they pull out a weapon?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Disarm them if possible,\" said Tovak. \"Failing that, remove the hand from the wrist, in a clean cut if possible. Makes reattaching easier.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What if they <i>still</i> won't stop?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sheath your weapons, and head to a temple of healing,\" said Tovak. \"They'll need to visit there anyways.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, basically, avoid fighting whenever possible?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"General idea,\" said Tovak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What if there's no choice, and it's them or you?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Be the one still standing,\" said Tovak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm surprised that, aside from Zilis's <i>Suggestion</i> spell, you've not done any actual testing of my training,\" you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTovak chuckled. \"Worry about that one later. Also, just because you've made it to the top at the Academy, it means nothing to an Adventurer with ten or more years experience. The guys at the Academy train you by the book. We'll train you by practicality.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, what about literature?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You like romance-type stories?\" Tovak asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, but my teacher did say that it was good to read,\" you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTovak chuckled. \"Useful for when there's nothing to do. Occupies the mind a bit. Share you my book, or one of the others will if you ask them. We all have some.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are they about?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Depends,\" said Tovak. \"Cain and Dano like those romance stories though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou chuckle at this. \"Who would have thought?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough, you and Tovak got near the camp, when....</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It happened quickly. A flash of movement, and next thing you knew, you were facedown on the ground. You tried to get up, when your assailant placed their claws on your throat, and pressed. The message was clear - move, and you'd die. You stopped struggling.  A sack was placed over your head, and you were tied up. Then, you were thrown over, you assume, their shoulders, before they began moving. Any attempt by yourself to move was met with claws touching your skin, and some sort of growling warning. Any attempt to speak was met with similar. For a moment, you wondered about Tovak - was the hobgoblin in a similar predicament, or was he dead, or worse yet, behind this!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter, you guess, half an hour, you were tossed onto the ground. You listened to your captor talk to some others. The language was harsh, and full of beastial sounds, and seemed to be predatory. When you attempted to communicate, pressure from your captor's claws was applied, again, seeming to be a warning. As for attempts to escape your bonds, that resulted in them placing their foot on your back, and pressing down, hard. You then smelled something - smoke. You also heard the bubbling of water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was when the rope around your hands and feet was undone, but again, claws were applied to your skin, giving you a clear message.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You speak now,\" said a gruff, and unfriendly voice. \"Why you trespass on sacred land?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We were just setting up camp,\" you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You admit guilt,\" the speaker said. \"Death to trespass on this land.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't know,\" you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No excuse,\" the voice said. \"Human stew taste good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stiffened at this. You'd heard about such folk. However, you kept silent. If you could get a knife, maybe you could escape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Clothes!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStrong arms and hands soon stripped you of your clothing, and you were tied up once more, face down on the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seasonings!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was when something was applied to your back. You weren't sure what it was, but it was warm, and they rubbed it into your body. It would have felt good, if not for the fact that they were preparing you for the pot. There was a fruity smell to it, which would have been a nice perfume, but for the situation. Then you were flipped over, and more of this stuff was applied. Again, it would have been nice, but for the situation. For a moment, you were actually glad you had the sack over your head. Then, a couple of them lifted you up, carried you over, and, rather carefully, placed you in something that, not only had <i>warm</i> water, but felt more like a bathtub than the inside of a large pot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What kind of cooking pot is this?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A bathtub,\" said a familiar voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was when you heard the splitting of the rope around your wrists, and you found yourself able to move your hands, and you managed to remove the sack from your head, and you saw Teoz grinning, a few feet from you, with a dagger in his hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was all that about?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Little bit of hygiene and a lesson,\" said Teoz. \"You haven't had a bath in a few days, and that stench could give us away to the wrong people.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou chuckled nervously. \"Right. And the lesson?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Never assume the camp is safe,\" said Teoz. \"Better to assume that someone killed us all while you were gone, only to find that everything is alright, than to assume everything is fine, only to get taken captive by a pack of slavers or cannibals.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see that,\" you said, as you removed the rope from your wrists, and began working on those around your ankles. \"Surprised you have a bathtub.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Got a few actually,\" said Teoz. \"We all have a few Bags of Holding, so getting at least a couple of bathtubs was possible.\" He then tossed to you a hand towel, the kind used for washing one's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Still, why?\" you asked, as you began scrubbing, also realizing that you were coated in citrus-scented soap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because only poor fools take baths in cold streams,\" said Owag, as the tortle came up, draping a bath towel on a branch, as well as a clean shirt, pants, and undergarments. \"After all, when one has access to money, getting a bathtub is easy. Also, when one has means to make boiled water, it's merely a matter of practice to figure out a good ratio of cold stream water to that of boiled, to make it warm enough to bath in without cooking yourself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That, and a few of them wanted to double-check their human female anatomy,\" said Zeed, as he came over with some cut fruit on a tray, and attached it to the tub. \"Some fresh fruit, and your sword - always useful to have nearby.\" He also set your sword by the tub. \"Some were under the impression that they had six tits.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bozzori?\" Teoz asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That bull already knew,\" said Zeed. \"It was the <i>other</i> bull that guessed wrong.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTeoz chuckled. \"Thought the elephant <i>knew</i> better. Guess he <i>forgot</i>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had to chuckle at this, as you grabbed an apple slice. \"I was part of a bet between them?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZeed chuckled. \"You'd be surprised at what we'd bet on. Just don't bet more than you can pay.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was that language you were speaking anyways?\" you asked. \"Never heard anything like it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Little of Leonin, little of Orcish, bit of Goblinoid, some Primordial, Dwarvish, and Minotaur,\" said Zeed. \"Touch of Elvish too.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Quite literally, each word is from another language from the previous ones,\" said Owag. \"Trick is not to use a language understood by outsiders. Mostly, it's for fun, as it can be annoying to carry on a serious conversation using bits and pieces from five or more languages.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose it would,\" you said. You then looked at Teoz. \"Got something for my hair?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Leonin chuckled. \"I do. Works better in a warmed up liquid form, like that soap I rubbed all over you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blush at the memory. \"Your wife must like your hands.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She does,\" Teoz said, as he got behind you. He then put something into your hair, and began carefully running their claws all over your scalp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you ever get tired of being a cleric, you ought to work in a bathhouse,\" you said. \"Your hands feel good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're welcome,\" Teoz. \"As it was, I <i>was</i> something of a body cleaner.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" you asked. \"Surprised that the God of Death would hold services in a bathhouse.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"More like cleaned them in preparation for getting dressed for their funeral,\" said Teoz. \"There's reasons folks burn incense as part of funeral rites.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why did you become an Adventurer then?\" you asked. \"Priests make good money, right?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I had a vision, one that involved both the God of Death that I serve, as well as a Hero that my people tell stories about,\" said Teoz. \"I was asked to, not only bring honor to my people, but to explain to good things about Death.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That one might be tricky,\" you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTeoz chuckled. \"Perhaps. But, I have faith. Being approachable helps.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose it would,\" you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that should take care of your hair,\" said Teoz, as he wetted his hands in the bath water. \"Stuff washes out easily, once you duck your head under, and your hair will have a nice shine to it, and be in good condition overall.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, thanks for the bath,\" you said. \"Just don't jump me like that again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Take one at least every other day when we're near a stream, and we won't make you take one,\" said Zeed. \"No promises about jumping you though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You need to learn one way or another,\" said Owag. He pointed at a group of bushes. \"We're on the other side of those, when you're done. Yell out if there's any issues. We'll have supper ready soon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And if I don't yell out if there's trouble?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZeed pointed at the tree he'd been using as a lookout. \"If you don't mind me looking at you from time to time, I have a good view of this spot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, as you say, you're not into mammals,\" you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZeed chuckled. \"That's correct.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, the three left, leaving you to enjoy your bath.</span></div></div>",

The way he was positioned had been somewhat behind you, and you hadn't always been able to keep an eye on him as a result. Then, there was the others - again, you had been unable to keep an eye on them for obvious reasons. As you finished putting your sword belt on, you checked your sword, and carefully walked around the brush separating you from the camp, trying to not make a lot of noise beyond that of just the usual types of noise, as you knew that Zeed, or rather, the one that looked like him, was possibly watching you. Eventually, you got to an area, where you could see the entire camp, while staying somewhat hidden, or at least looked like you were just catching your breath at any rate, your main hand carefully near your sword handle, just in case.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZilis turned his head, and saw you. The Yuan-Ti waved you over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, you stayed put. After all, for all you knew, a group of Doppelgangers had showed up, killed them silently, and replaced them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZilis grinned, and started laughing. \"She's getting smarter!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on in,\" said Owag. \"You at least got the right idea of waiting to make sure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't want to get tackled so soon after a bath,\" you said, coming in, hand still near the sword handle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's getting wiser too,\" said Berov. \"She's prepared to draw her weapon in case she got fooled by a potential trap.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As I stated,\" you said, as you sat down on a log. \"I didn't fancy taking another bath.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good enough for me,\" said Zeed from his perch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What were you going to do if I just walked in?\" you asked, as you accepted a hot bowl of stew from Tovak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sleep spell,\" said Bozzori. \"You'd gone to bed without supper.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see,\" you said. \"Never assume that the camp is safe?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right,\" said Hovak. \"Also, while on that note, never assume anyone coming into the camp is whom they claim to be.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've heard the story about Jed and the doppelganger,\" you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's why,\" said Roth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Always learn from someone else's mistakes,\" said Bozzori. \"Especially if they proved to be fatal ones.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOwag chuckled. \"At least you're learning.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were about to take a bite of the stew, when you noticed that Zilis was still watching you. \"Did you put the stew into the bowls before they got passed out?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I did,\" the Yuan-Ti said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, did you put something extra into my bowl by chance?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZilis laughed again. \"She's catching on!\" He turned to Tovak. \"Pay up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's in my bowl?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tovak gave you a bowl of mud and gravel, on with an illusion spell on it,\" said Owag. \"Toss out the contents, and we'll wash it later.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou flung the contents into the brush. \"Almost ate a mud pie,\" you muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOwag got up, filled another bowl, and gave it to you. \"At least it wasn't poison. One guy that tried to kill us, found out that Yuan-Ti make terrible food tasters. Zilis gave us clean plates, and then poisoned the one meant for him, which our foe made the foolish mistake of taking for himself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm good at lying and sneaky-type stuff,\" said Zilis. \"Typical things associated with my kind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hope you don't poison friends,\" you said, as you took a bite. The stew was delicious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not unless they ask me too,\" Zilis said, softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked up at this, and you could swear that there was a tear in the snake-man's eye, which they quickly wiped away.</span></div></div>",

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">You were born a nobody, a measly farmer living in poverty with your parents. But even from a young age, you always dreamed of becoming a Hero. Heroes and Heroines are like the celebrities of this world, admired and loved by the public, raking in the gold and swooned over by fanboys\\girls. You swore that the day you came of age, you would join the Hero's Academy and make a name for yourself. Well, that day has arrived. Biding your parents farewell, you set out with only the clothes on your back, a small pouch of gold coins and a dagger for protection. You journey to the capital to begin your new life. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow This Works<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the end of the first chapter, you shall select your character's gender, followed by your class type and your sub-class. From there, it's all up to you where your adventures will lead you. Will you climb the ranks of the Guild and become the greatest Hero who ever lived? Or will you fail and fall into obscurity, your name forever lost to history?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRules:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. This is meant to be a sort of parody of old school role-playing games like D&amp;D and things like that. Try to add some humor here and there . <br>\r\n2. If you're going to kill the main character, don't make it overly gory or descriptive. Also, let the story get to a decent length first.<br>\r\n3. All chapters are to be a minimum of 3 to 5 paragraphs long. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI reserve the right to add or edit rules as needed. Hope you enjoy the story!</td>",
