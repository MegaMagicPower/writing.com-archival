            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Melissa wakes up in the tiny room that had been made up for her by her parents and realizes she can't move. Figuring it's sleep paralysis she concentrates, and soon enough pops out of bed, landing roughly on the floor. She feels extremely odd as she gets up, her body stiff like she hadn't moved all night, so she helplessly stumbles over against a wall. She looks across at the mirror and close her eyes, trying to clear the sleepiness out of her head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's way too early for this kind of thing\" she thinks. After a few moments, she looks again and sees her body half sunk into the wall. It looks like she's melted onto it, and the color and texture had been stretched over her entire body like saran wrap. She screamed, and started struggling mindlessly. She got the crazy idea that she wasn't just stuck to it, she was PART of it. She could feel where her sense of touch dwindled and disappeared where the outline of her body was. Her body twitched slightly, but didn't move at all from the wall \"I can't move away from it because I'm part of it!\" she thought in a panic. Suddenly her tutors comment flashed through her head. Out of options, she focuses her mind on not being stuck here, and again pop out onto the floor. She catches her breath, and tries to decide what to do...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I need some kind of help here. I gotta get to Ms. Whitaker. This can't be some kind of cooincidence...\" She started thinking of how to get there though. Her parents had gone on vacation this morning, so her sister Amber was home watching the place. That was one possibility, though she hoped she wouldn't have to tell her why she suddenly needed help. She could also try calling her friend Rebecca. She didn't have a car, but could probably get to take her to the office. She always got distracted around her though. She always just passed it off as being her usual flighty self, but damn did she have nice hips. You could never admit that to her though, since she didn't swing that way. Of course there was always Theresa, the snobby miss perfect that had \"kindly\" helped get her to school when she missed the bus. Of course, she usually wound up flattened on something before arriving, but it might be the fastest solution...</span></div></div>",

Sighing in annoyance, she listened and heard the fan in the bathroom running. \"Of course she's not here... better find a good place so I can get her attention.\" she said to herself. She started picking her way across the room, which was no easy task. Her sister considered the floor her laundry basket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter carefully picking her way across the landscape of dirty clothing, Melissa made it to the desk chair and started climbing it. Once she made it up to the seat, she stopped to catch her breath. The door suddenly opens, and the sudden sound startles Melissa. She starts to teeter, literally on the edge of the seat, and then...</span></div></div>",

Out of her mouth comes, \"Well I guess I ought to get dressed for school. . . .damn school. . .and clothes!  Haha!  Now what's clean?\"  She gives a confused look and grabs the nearest items of clothing and carries it to her room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelissa just fell off a chair but bittersweetly had a soft pile of clothes to land in.  She sees her massive naked sister pick up the pile and she feels a familiar rush of flying into the air as someone picks her up.  She has a flashback to an incident where she was in Rebecca's swimsuit.  Laundry always did claim an issue with her.  But damn was it nice being with Rebecca's tits.  And she wasn't harmed.  But hopefully she'll get out.  What if she didn't?  So many questions!  What's for dinner, too?  Dinner is always interesting at this size.  Can I transform into food with this spell?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWait. . . .the spell!  Melissa suddenly realized her legs had infused into a thong of Amber's.  Can she focus before it's put on?</span></div></div>",

Change back change back change back... oh why couldn't think be someone elses? Anyone else would be good. Like that one girl in math class. Or Theresa in history. Or Rebecca... Mmm I can only imagine what being her thong would be like. Pressed against her pussy all day, completely helpless, just soaking it all in. Even the back, feeling her cheeks press against me, squishing me but not hurting me, just part of the clothing. Oh god that'd be so hot. How long could I stay like that, just part of her wardrobe, belonging to her, nothing but..\" Reality disrupted the train of thought as she felt her sister's heel slam down onto her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDazed, she looked up as Amber regained her balanced and put the foot into the leg hole of the thong. She tried to move, but realized with horror that her daydream had merged her completely. She looked like a decoration on the thong, obviously still cloth, just raised like a decoration. Nothing but a series of bumps and curves that happened to look like her body. She could still move her mouth and eyes, but anything else was beyond her. She felt herself suddenly rocketing up as Amber started to pull on her underwear, and realized with horror she was...</span></div></div>",

Hitting the speed dial, she listen to a few rings before Rebecca's sleepy voice comes through \"mmm... 'ello? Melissa, is'at you?... It's 8am... I thought your parents said you couldn't talk to me for a week after I almost walked out of the house with you stuck to my soccer shorts...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelissa train of thought was lost to happy memories of being spread across her friend's plump rear. Rebecca had a wider frame than some girls, but she was athletic so instead of fat, she was just all curves. \"I know, I'm sorry, but it's an emergency. I really really REALLY need to get in to town. I have to that tutor doctor thing I've been seeing. It's a matter of life or death,\" she blurts out in a panic, still lost in her day dream and just operating on instinct. She tries to take a step and sees her feet have sunk into the table and started taking their color. She focused on yanking them free, then sighed \"well, life or something.\" She mentally chided herself for letting her get that side tracked by Rebecca's voice. She started repeating to herself in her head, \"You're just friends, you're just friends, you're just friends remember that you dummy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe hears Rebecca sigh tiredly, \"I can do it, but why don't you tell your sister? She can drive you in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm... t-trust me. This is something I don't want her knowing about. I'm sorry, I'll owe you big time.\" Melissa says desperately. Hearing the doubt in Rebecca's voice, she sighs and tells her everything<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebecca is silent for a few seconds, and finally said, sounding like she doesn't quite believe her, \"Okay, I'll do it, but your sister is still going to want to know where you're going. If you don't want to tell her about this, we'll probably have to sneak you out. Any ideas?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelissa tried to think, but drew a blank. With another sigh, she concentrated and seperated her increasingly plastic back from the phone base. Then it dawned on her \"I can merge with something, then you just carry me out, and I'll snap myself out when we're outside! You've accidentally left enough stuff here that picking something up is an easy excuse!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebecca was still doubtful, and figured if it was true, she'd use this opportunity for a little trick of her own. She'd heard rumors that Melissa had a minor crush on her (she didn't know it was a HUGE crush), and thought she could use this as a way to test her. \"Alright, but I get to pick what i'm carrying you out as, because I'm <i>really </i> excited to see this.\" She said this in a tone of voice suggesting that the thought actually excited her, and heard Melissa clearing her throat awkwardly in response. \"So, I'm on my way over now to pick up my...</span></div></div>",

Bye.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebecca then hung up, grabbed one of her bikinis out of her closet, stuffed the two-piece swimwear into her pocket, and began to head over to Melissa's house. In the mean time, Melissa herself had begun fantasizing over the idea of merging into Rebecca's sexy swimsuit. Her mind wandered hopelessly as it was flooded with images of her crush wearing one of her skimpy bikinis with Melissa still inside it. She imagined her body becoming one with Rebecca's bikini, and she became lost in the feeling of her merged bikini form pressing against the slender curves of her best friend's hot body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeedless to say, her train of thought was anywhere but where it should have been. Melissa soon began melting into the wood of her desk once again, and this time she was too wrapped up in her fantasy to even notice it happening. Several minutes passed, and soon Rebecca's body had merged all the way up to her chest. She didn't snap out of her trance until she heard a knock on the door, signaling the arrival of the source of her distraction. Quickly coming to her senses, Melissa concentrated on separating herself from the desk. As  soon as she had finished getting out, she heard voices coming from outside her door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are <i>you</i> doing here? Didn't our parents say that you couldn't talk to my sister for another week after that incident?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice to see you too, Amber... Don't worry, I'm only here to pick up something that I left behind earlier. I'll be gone before you even notice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh... Fine, but you'd better make it quick! And if you happen to squish my little sister while you're in there, <i>please</i> don't try to take her home with you this time...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, yeah.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that point, Melissa's door was opened and Rebecca walked in. She smiled down at her tiny friend before pulling the wadded-up bikini out of her pocket and laying it on the desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay Mel, your chariot awaits. Just do whatever it is you do and merge with my skimpy little bikini so I can get you out of here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks Becca, I knew I could count on you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelissa then stepped forward to begin merging into Rebecca's bikini, but she paused halfway and began to blush furiously. She hadn't expected to be so embarrassed by doing this when they had discussed it over the phone, but now she was. She was standing inches away from her best friend's bikini, the bikini of the girl that she had a lesbian crush on, the bikini that had been worn countless times as it embraced Rebecca's sweet flesh. Now Melissa wasn't sure if she would be able to go through with this. Trying her hardest to push her embarrassment aside, Melissa considered her options before deciding to fuse with...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Okay, let me get you out of here before I get all ADD and can't stop playing with you.\" She took her finger off just as Melissa's cheeks started burning hot at the thought of her friend 'playing' with her.

Now I've gotta run home first.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelissa was stunned speechless at the moment, the sight past her curvy thigh, over her chest to see her face too much for her. Finally she recovered, but not before her form seemed to spread and sink a tiny bit more, \"What do you mean? Were you going to the beach?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe nodded down at her bikini, and the thought made her chuckle for a minute. \"yeah, some friends are going down to catch some sun and that kind of thing since it's so ungodly hot. I'll just have to put it off. Besides, I guess I should get you to your doctor's first, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-no, that's alright. You can have me if you want... i mean wear me if you want.\" Luckily she's sunk far enough in that she couldn't turn red at her slip of the tongue.

You know, gather data, have more info to give the Doc... that kind of thing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecca stopped at a stop light and pouted a little, \"I don't think the first weight test we should do on you is me. I might push you straight through the bikini into the ground... And on top of that, you're dead in the center of the inside rear of my bikini. If I got a wedgie, my fat ass would probably crush you flat and we wouldn't find you for days and-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelissa cut her off, her libido momentarily subsided by actual concern, \"Stop! You know I hate it when you cut yourself down like that. There's nothing wrong with how you look, alright? I'd be just fine underneath you, and if you keep this up, when I get free I'll merge myself right into your ass cheek just to prove it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking down at her again before taking the green light, Becca stared at her, then grinned as her competitive side overwhelmed her suspicions, \"Oh yeah? How about a bet? I'll wear you to the beach, and if you can't say with a straight face after the fact that it wasn't that bad, you have to do your new trick and be part of whatever I decide for a day. And it's going to be something to amuse ME, not you. Understood little girl?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh god she's got when she gets all competitive and why does she have to remind me I'm so much smaller I mean she could do anything she wants with me anything at all and-\" Melissa pulled herself from her daydream  and managed to stutter out, \"A-and if I win?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a sly grin, Becca shrugged and said \"Well then you get to decide what you merge with.

An ass she was about to become so much more intimately acquainted with. She could barely contain her emotion as she swayed left to right with the motion of Becca's hips, as she strode over to the changing room. She could feel the sexy glute behind her apply pressure and slightly relieve it as Becca walked casually on. Melissa began to imagine what this was going to be like...dropped to the floor, watching Becca's bare feet crash onto either side of her as she is slid up those long, sexy toned legs. staring up at her beautifully athletic friend before all goes dark as she is pulled taut against her butt. Would she be able to see in the light of the beach? What would it feel like when Becca sat down? Laid down to tan? Would she get into the water with her? Play in the sand? Would she get wedged up between her cheeks, rubbed and caressed by them as Becca enjoyed her day at the beach? She imagined her thighs pumping on either side of her....what if she forgot? And sat back into her car with her still on, wore her home? She was snapped out of her dreaming by the sound of a door opening, it was really about to happen...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Melissa frowned, the little mental fantasy shattering at the idea, \"Y-your soccer shoes? Are you sure? I mean, they're kind of...\" She looked over to the corner, seeing the dingy worn down footwear. \"I mean, you've left lots of stuff here. How about your swim suit, or that textbook you left or....\"  'Anything really,' she added in her head. Rebecca wasn't exactly the star of the soccer team, but she was far from the worst, and known for being reliable. She practiced as often as she could trying to be the best she could, and her shoes reflected it, both inside and out. She clearly wanted to be the best she could be at it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well sure, but it'd be pretty easy for your sister to check them to see if I'm sneaking you out. There's no way in hell she'll risk putting her hand into my smelly ole shoes, let alone looking inside. It's the perfect hiding place!\" Rebecca restrained a smile, \"and besides, I love those shoes. It'd be cute to see you as part of them\". As much as she needed to know whether the rumors were true, she realized this might not be the best test. \"She'd have to be crazy to hide in there. There's no way on earth she'd be lovestruck enough to-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C-cute? Oh, uh, sure! That's a good point!! With the hiding place I mean! I'll uh... hurry over, I'll be waiting... in the shoes... looking all cute.\" The phone quickly disconnected, and all Rebecca could do was sigh as she clicked her phone shut. \"That better have just been her realizing it was a good point. I swear if I find out she's just been friends with me trying to get into my pants...\" With another annoyed sigh, she headed out the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelissa meanwhile stood in front of the tattered old athletic shoe. They had been white at some point, but had been worn down to a dingy brownish gray. Taking a deep breath, she pulled herself up to the mouth of the shoe. The breath exploded out of her in a coughing fit as she rank air inside smacked her in the face. Losing her balance, she tipped over it and landed on the insole. Shakily, she got to her feet, wobbling a little bit at the overpowering aroma in the air. Looking down, she could see she was standing in a sunken black spot formed by Rebecca's heel  from repeated wear. She could see smaller such spots appear up by the toe area far ahead. She briefly considered saying she was only able to merge in this spot, but then Rebecca's voice saying how it would be cute echoed in her head, and, taking a deep breath, she marched down to the toe area.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe lay down by the black toe prints, her eyes watering from the atmosphere. \"How am I supposed to get distracted enough to merge in here? I mean seriously, this is gross. I can barely breath, and it's kind of burning my back. I can't believe she wears these things regularly... while she runs around the field in those short shorts... those curvy legs pumping as she chases the ball, hair whipping behind her...\" Despite herself, Melissa slowly sank into the insole and lost track of time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was shook out of her reverie as foot steps approached her. She could barely see a sliver of the world from her vantage point, but saw as a finger hookedinto the shoe and picked it and the other one up. She almost shouted a hello to the person, but then recognized the polish as her sister's favorite color. She felt her world bouncing around as she was carried to the door, glad for a moment that she was stuck to the insole, otherwise she'd probably have been knocking unconscious. Suddenly the shoes stopped moving, and she heard her sister say, \"Here...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Melissa lets out a deep sigh of relief as she hears Rebecca let out a bright happy \"I won't, promise! Thanks!\" and then a different finger appears to hold her temporary home. The bouncing began again as she was carried out of the house, and she moved her head as much as she could to look over at her friend's finger. No polish, she wasn't the type of girl that put too much attention into her appearance. It just naturally came together for her, but she definitely gave off a minor tom boy personality, even if she didn't have the look. Melissa started remembering the few times she'd actually gotten her to dress up. Again her mind drifted, so much that she barely even noticed the aroma coming from the shoe, and for the moment, herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was jolted back when she realized that the finger was no longer in the shoe. It tongue of the shoe had been lifted up, and Rebecca's eyes were peering in, one hand pinching her nose. \"Oh wow! Melissa, you weren't joking! You actually look like part of the insole!... Oh god, I'm sorry! You didn't-\" she started, then her sympathy for what her friend currently was part of got pushed aside when she remembered why she had chosen this.  \"You uh, didn't answer when I called back. See, coach called, and a few of the other girls were all down at the park together, so we're having an impromptu practice. So uh, I'm gonna need to use my shoes... and they're doing it right away, so I don't know how fast you can change back, but...\" True she had driven by a few of her teammates practicing a bit in the park, but it wasn't anything major. She just had to test Melissa's reaction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe misshapen lump of material, previous pressed flat and smooth through repeated wear, started to move a bit. If she hadn't been warned, and if she couldn't see it moving, Rebecca wouldn't believe it. It looked like someone had taken the fake leather like (formerly) white material of the insole, and sculpted a body out of it. If she focused hard, she could make out Melissa's features, but the black toe stains from years of wear made it hard to make out details. She shook her head out of the thought to focus on what Melissa said, \"I'm sorry, I couldn't hear you that well. What'd you say?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelissa had been telling her friend it might take her a while and that she might have to miss a practice. However, when she looked up at her friends big wide open eyes, and remembered how much every minute of practice meant to her, and her inner monologue was basically \"Oh god I'm laying helpless and basically naked in front of the hottest girl I know, I'm almost just part of her wardrobe and oh god I can't believe this what do I do and...\" well, she realized she wouldn't be changing back anytime soon. Grinning a little, she said louder \"I-It's okay. I've been through worse, I'd, um, hate for you to miss a game...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelissa could only see from the eyes and up on Rebecca, but saw as her eyes looked a bit confused and her brow furrowed, \"Been through worse? Mel, I accidentally dropped a sock on you after a game once, and you whined and gagged for 15 minutes. I've had those shoes for two years. Don't try telling me you've had worse. Seriously, honesty now. Can you get unstuck before I get to the park? Or should I call back and cancel?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment, Melissa was happy she wasn't flesh and blood, because she'd be blushing intensely. She knew that Rebecca would likely miss the game if she asked her to, but she also knew that she'd be awfully disappointed. She didn't want to see that expression on her face magnified so large like the frown now aimed at her. \"I... I don't know, I'll try, but, um, if I can't, just go ahead and wear them for the practice. I know how much it means to you. I'm squishy just like the insole, and I don't seem to need to be able to breath, so I should be fine,\" She said, even as she though to herself how she wished not having to breath meant not being able to smell or taste. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe expression on Rebecca's face didn't change to happiness or relief like expected. Instead, suspicion and annoyance spread on her face, \"Alright, I'm going to ask you something, and I want the truth, alright? No matter what it is. I've been hearing a lot of people talk about you, and about me, or rather you and your feelings for me. Are you saying that just because you want me as more than a friend?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelissa looked at the eyes, knowing that the blush she felt earlier would've spread across her whole body at the accusation if she were all person. She struggled for a response for a moment, mouth opening and closing, then finally said, she hoped convincingly, \"Seriously, I swear to god Rebecca, it's not like that. I just don't want you to miss a practice. It's nothing like that, promise. Even if I felt like that, I know we're just friends.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebecca's expression stayed exactly the same for a few moments, and then she said, \"You know Melissa, we've been friends forever, and...</span></div></div>",

Oh well. Small price to pay if it got whateer was happening to her taken care of. She told her sister that she was runniing to town with Theresa. Amber just rolled her eyes, whispered \"whatever,\" and went back to her magazine. Melissa sighed and quickly moved down to the front door to wait for her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough, the front door swings wide open, sending Melissa sprawling. Next thing she knew, she felt a colossal weight slam into her back and flatten her form. Above her, she heard obviously pretending to be clueless voice of Theresa, \"Now where could my dear friend Melissa have gotten to? I really want to help her get whatever her emergency is <i>stomped down</i>\" with this she took another couple steps, with poor Melissa stuck firmly to the sole of her shoe. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe focused as hard as she could, the last thing she wanted was for Theresa to find out about her problem, especially via her being part of her boot. Everyone else saw Theresa as a perfect little angel, which is how she looked 99% of the time. That other 1% of the time was when she had Melissa alone, or with the few friends who knew what she was really like, and she was abusing the fact that she couldn't fight back. Finally she felt the weight let off her and found herself looking at Theresa's face, \"Oh, there you are silly,\" she peeled her off and rolled her into a ball, then clapped to flatten her between her hands. Theresa looked at the blob of flesh in her left palm, Melissa's distorted, pained face looking back at her. \"Lets go get you taken care of. You're in <i>good hands </i>now.\" Melissa groaned at the pun as Theresa squeezed her hand into a fist and walked slowly to her car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelissa struggled to pay attention, but it was hard. She didn't feel much of any pain, even from the stomping (Her doctor had said something about how pain is a reaction to danger, and since she was in little physical danger, she just didn't register it very much at all), but the heat of Theresa's hand was soothing in her squished form, and she had to admit, she wore wonderful smelling perfume. If it weren't for all the years of Theresa being such a sadistic witch to her, Melissa would probably be in love with the blond beauty... okay, she still thought she was incredibly hot, especially those knee high black boots she was wearing, and her pert B cups and.... Melissa's mind wandered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was shocked out of her reverie at the sound of a car door slamming. Light returned to the world and she was looking up at Theresa's evil face again. \"Alright you little twerp. Why am I-WHAT THE HELL!?!!?\" Melissa tried to move off her hand... then realizes what she'd done. During her little fantasy session, she'd merged with the palm of her 'savior's' hand. There was no seam around the edges of her squished body, just Theresa's mild tan that slowly faded to Melissa's pale skin color as it got closer to her face. She tried to focus to pull herself off, but Theresa's finger nails started scraping across her, trying to peel her off. Her thoughts were lost to the mild pain grating across her, which only made her merge more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally Theresa pulled her palm close to her face, eyes full of fury, \"What did you do you little shit!? Tell me now!\" Melissa was filled with genuine terror at the look she was being given, and without thinking of the consequences, sputtered out everything she knew, accidentally including the part about how it was the thought of her body that had derailed her attention so badly as to cause this. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheresa's face slowly turned from anger to shock, to mild disgust, and finally to amusement. She saw the face on her palm starting to regain definition, slowly un-merging from her. The fake syrupy sweet tones returned, \"Oh Melissa, you silly girl. You mean, you really like my body?\" She ran her palm down her thigh, back up her thigh and stopping to brush her panties, then up to her breasts before bringing it back up to her face. She was filled with glee when she saw that her skin tone had completely replaced Melissa's, whose eyes were unfocused and dreamy. \"Is that the case?\" Melissa's face kind of twitched up and down in a yes nod. \"This'd be even more inconvenient for your family. You might need someone to take care of you 24/7 now, huh?\" again, the same inattentive nod with a dazed muttering of affirmation. \"In fact, it'd probably be easier for everyone if you just belonged to me from now on wouldn't it?\" Melissa's purred at the thought, it having a completely different context in her brain at the moment...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she snapped back, realizing what had just been said, Theresa clapped her hands together again, \"Perfect! I knew you'd agree. I mean, I've been treating you like property ever since grade school. Might as well make it real, right my little toy?\" Melissa tried to reply, but the hand she was on tightened on the steering wheel as the car started. \"In fact, I know just what to do with you. You're going to...</span></div></div>",

Want to give up your humanity to be nothing but part of me?\" She saw Melissa trying to shake her head left and right, clearly in horror at the thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheresa put on her poutiest face, the kind that had gotten her exactly what she wanted thousands of times in the past. \"Are you sure? Just think about it.

Would you like that?....\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stopped her soliloquy as she could see Melissa's eyes glaze over at the thought, and actually watched as her body sunk a little more, one of the curves of her palm starting to form across her body. She let out an evil laugh \"Or maybe you're happy right there. Just think, you'd be a captive witness to everything I did. From doing homework, to showering, to my more.... private times.\" Theresa bit her lip seductively before moving her hand back down to rub herself through her skirt and panties. \"So many choices....

Soon she is forced to not only listen to the terrible pop music, but listen to her captor's terrible singing along. The worst part though is that Theresa starts dancing around in her seat. Melissa can't even tell where she is and she's flattened, folded, squished, straightened, and who knows what else. The combination of heat, pressure, and noise, not to mention that it is a very hot girl's ass tormenting her, makes it impossible to concentrate. She soon notices that she's still being crushed, but she isn't moving around anymore. However, all the motion makes it impossible to tell where she'd ended up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a half hour of this, the car pulls to a stop, and she feels Theresa get out of the car and start walking inside. A door opens and shuts, more walking, and then another door shuts. She hears some rustling, and then light appears again.

She really needs to focus to escape. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith what little mouth she had left, Melissa yelled as much as she could, \"You still need to take me to the doctor!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Haha. Not a chance, asstat, you're just going to be mine now. And soon enough, no matter how much they search, they'll never find you. Your mind will exist only to think about my luscious booty and you'll be so deeply intertwined they won't see you if they looked right in.\" The words daunt Melissa for a moment, though the thoughts of her luscious booty also distract her. The struggle to focus is real. \"Were you even listening? Haha, I'll see you in a bit. Maybe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheresa puts her pants back on.

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">The main character is a 6 inch tall 18 year old girl named Melissa. If crushed, she simply flattens like putty, then slowly reforms. The lack of real danger has lead to her being far less cautious and attentive than she should be. Her parents had been sending her to a tutor to try to get her to focus on her surroundings, but without any success. The last session, the tutor had enough and declared \"If you don't learn to focus, you're going to end up just part of the scenery\". Either knowingly or unknowingly, she ended up cursing her with just that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe can merge with living things or inanimate objects if she completely loses her train of thought. Focusing on getting out will pop her out of whatever she is part of, but the longer she is merged, the harder she has to focus. It CAN become permanent, just wait until a few chapters in please. She's gotten a number of other girls, in trouble for crushing her accidentally, so she's not extremely well liked at school. She's also got a 22 year old sister who has been used to squashing her \"accidentally\" her whole life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot many rules, but here they are:<br>\r\nNo scat.  Butts are okay, but no crap. Same with pee.<br>\r\nNo male interaction. I know. I'm boring.<br>\r\nNo underage<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOther than that, be creative.</td>",
