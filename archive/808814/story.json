As you glance at some of the jewelery the naked figurine comes to mind and you quickly pull it out of your pocket. <br>\r\nThe villagers step back from your quick movements but once the figurine is spotted they coo and shout with excitement and huddle around you with grins and pleased expressions. You stand there for a second and then try out your voice for the first time. <br>\r\n\" What does this mean to you?\" you ask as you hld out the figurine. <br>\r\nA random villager gives you a more than willing explanation. <br>\r\n\"That figurine is a symbol of our village, resembling our innocence, freedom and happiness. The fact that you found this, shows that you are chosen to become part of this village and get very far in life as long as you stick with us. I am very excited that we might have a new member.\" The villager grins and as you look around you see many more ecstatic faces.

You scan the area carefully, but all you see is a vast landscape of rock. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere are several birds circling overhead - large ones. The word \"vulture\" pops into your mind and back out again. You shudder, afraid of what they signify. You could die here. You could turn around and go back, but you have come a long way. It might be too far without water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hear the whistling call of a hawk overhead and look up. He is diving straight for you! At the last minute he pulls out of his dive and lands on a nearby rock where he cocks his head and looks at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe has something tied to his leg.

It's that little figurine of a naked girl that you picked up and put in your pocket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly a bolt of lightning flashes down out of the sky, splitting into four bolts that each strike one of the boulders at the corners of the square. BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow you are more than tingly, you are absolutely CHARGED UP with electricity. You strip off your shirt and shorts and sandals and run around naked screaming at the top of your lungs. You might be a little crazy now. In fact, you black out for a moment or two, but when you come back to your senses, you are still running around naked, only you aren't screaming anymore. You are just shouting something that sounds like \"Hey! hey! Hey! Hey!\" over and over. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou clamp your mouth shut and manage to stop your legs from running. It takes a big effort to stand still. You are trembling and shaking and suddenly you can't stand it anymore and start running and screaming again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while, you manage to calm yourself down a little, but you still can't stop trembling, and every now and then a spasm of activity sweeps through you and you have to move your arms and legs, jump up and down and shout, do something, anything, just so you aren't standing still. It seems like hours before you can just stand quietly and think rationally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour first really rational thought is that maybe you should move away from these boulders. You find your clothes and sandals where you threw them on the ground. You walk a little distance from the boulders and put your clothes back on.</span></div></div>",

You pull out the silver figurine and examine it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt is only a few centimeters long and not very detailed. It is a naked girl with long flowing hair. Some of the hair sweeps up and over to form a loop. It looks like a charm for a bracelet or necklace. Could this have something to do with the lightning bolt? You decide to try a little experiment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou approach close enough to the square of boulders so that you can throw accurately.

Standing there is a woman who resembles the figurine except that she is very tall, taller than you. But she is silver. Everything - her skin, her hair, even her eyes - are silver.

She holds it up before your eyes. \"Is this yours?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I threw it in there, but I didn't know what it would do. I didn't know that it would 'call' you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looks at you for a long moment. \"You are one of the new ones.\" It's a flat statement. You don't know how to respond. You don't know what she means.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe continues. \"You don't know who you are, do you? Maybe I can help you. Sometimes I am called the Silver Lady. You may address me as 'Lady'. I am not a being of your plane of reality. What you see is my avatar. It's essence is a pattern of energy, but I have chosen the element silver to give my avatar a form that you can see. My true nature is different from yours. However, like you, I am a conscious being with thoughts and memories. Do you understand what I am saying?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think so. You are a conscious being from another dimension. You choose to appear to me as a silver woman, although that is not your true shape.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. Very good. Now who are you? That's the question you really want answered, isn't it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" you say. \"I want to know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Silver Lady pauses. \"It's not an easy question to answer, because, although you play an important role in something of great significance, your lack of knowledge of certain things is essential if you are to be successful. Are my words still clear?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think so. I'm part of something big, but if I know too much about it, I want be able to do what I am supposed to do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excellent!

And now I must go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait!\" you say. \"I have more questions!\"  But it is too late. The Silver Lady disappears in a clap of thunder.

You sigh and continue walking along the ledge path.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walk all day and then late in the afternoon you realize that you are not as high above the river. The canyon is opening out into a flatlands. By the time the sun sets, you are walking beside the river. The path is well-trodden, but you have yet to meet another person.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are tired after walking all day. You bathe in the river, eat some yellow fruit, and make a bed for yourself in the tall grass. You fall asleep as soon as you lie down.</span></div></div>",

You crawl through the weeds until you are close to the sounds. You peek through the tall weeds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere is a small group of people on the edge of the river. You see three small children and two older girls, and a woman old enough to be their mother. The woman has a bright yellow cloth wrapped around her, but the girls and children are all naked. The girls are washing themselves in the river. The small children are playing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two girls are very beautiful as the rays of the morning sun shine on them. Their wet skin glistens. Their figures are slender and graceful, just beginning to fill out. You catch your breath as one of them raises her arms up to run her hands through her hair. She seems to be looking right at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then she pushes her sister down in the water and the younger girl comes up sputtering and angry. The older sister runs off, just out of the younger one's reach. They twist and turn, zig and zag, as they chase each other. Suddenly, they are headed right for your hiding place!</span></div></div>",

Asleep?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sirus?\" the woman says. \"Sirus?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe old man looks up with watery eyes that seem to sag at the lids so that the bottom lids show some red. \"What is it?\" he asks in a husky, rattling voice like wind blowing through dried cornstalks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This girl has eaten of the yellow fruit during the time of full moon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSirus turns to look at you. \"Child, you know that the moonfruit must not be eaten when Luna smiles.

There was much evil in those days. Young girls like yourself were transformed into depraved monsters that terrorized entire villages.

Perhaps you have to talk directly at the translator ear to make it work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of the girls has been looking at you and she comes over to stand near you.

She only wears a strip of cloth around her waist. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don't know what to say to her so you just say \"Hello, Trilla\" and it seems to be enough. She smiles.

The girl has a waist wrap like Trilla, but the boy wears a loincloth made of woven leaves. At the river's edge, they are not shy about dropping their clothes on the ground and wading in. You only hesitate a moment before joining them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had to leave the translator ear with Tal Bryn, but even though you can't understand what anyone is saying without the translator, you can catch the sense of it, and when the boy splashes water in your face and laughs, you know it's time for a water fight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe four of you laugh and play in the water until you hear a call from the village.</span></div></div>",

You are hungry and everything tastes good. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while, the conversation starts up again.

You look around and the girl that swam with you asks \"You like Trilla?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" you say. \"I like Trilla very much.\" And there is more laughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sun was setting when the feast began.

Her body moves in waves of fluid motion that make your heart sing. You realize that the night has only just begun. A wave of pleasure sweeps through your body and you tremble. You have to dance.

You pick up more of the little black shellfish and toss them into the bottom of Kayak. Then you push off into the current and float downstream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy midmorning you are out of the canyon. The river is wider and there are lots of tall weeds along the banks. You see a boat just like yours pulled up in the weeds. Up on the bank above are three people around a fire - a man, a boy, and a girl. They are all wearing the same straw-colored clothes as you wearing. You wish you had a paddle so that you could talk to them, but the current carries you on past them. You don't think even notice you float by. They seem to be totally involved in their breakfast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy midday you are floating through a region of farmlands. You can see fields of crops and an occasional building off in the distance. You float past a fisherman on the riverbank and he waves back at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe river is wide and sluggish now. Up ahead you see a stone bridge that spans the river. A wagon is crossing over the bridge just as you are floating under it. You wave at the wagon driver, then abruptly stop waving. He isn't human. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou catch a glimpse of reptilian skin with a black and white pattern of swirls and dots. His head is odd, with a short snout, and eyes well to the sides. Then you lose sight of him as Kayak drifts under the bridge. By the time you come out the other side, the wagon is well down the road, a cloud of dust behind it. You shudder. This place is stranger than you thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater in the afternoon, you come to a second bridge. This may be a good place to pull ashore. You are hungry and you can see no reason to stay on the river. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that you know these lizard creatures are around, you are worried that they may not be friendly. You are exposed on the river. It might be better to take to the road where there are places to hide. Maybe the lizard creatures are friendly. But maybe they are not.

You are not the first to camp here. It's only a few hours until sunset, so you spend the time gathering dry grass for a bed. There are no buildings near the bridge. Occasionally a wagon crosses the bridge, but they are unaware of you hiding below. You rest on your bed of grass until it is dark, then you set out to explore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look up and down the dark roadway. In one direction you see a light, so you head that way. As you draw closer to the light, you see that it comes from the window of a small house. The house has a low stone fence and flowers in the yard, although it's too dark to judge their true colors. The place seems harmless enough - if it's inhabited by humans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou enter the yard quietly and go to the window where the light is shining. You peek inside and see a woman sitting in a rocking chair reading. There is a lamp on the table beside her. Safe enough, you think. You go around to the door and knock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who is it?\" she calls from inside without opening the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am lost,\" you say. \"Can you help me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean 'lost'?

I don't know anything. I found a boat on the river. Please help me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe opens the door. \"Come in then. Let's hear your story.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut what can you tell her except the room with three doors, the canyon, the river, the boat, the sandbar, the bridges.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe scratches her chin. That's Nevermore Canyon,\" she says. \"I've got a second cousin that lives up in there at the village of Tal Bryn. But you say you didn't see any village in the canyon?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then your room with three doors must be on this side of his village. If you found a boat on the riverbank, then you must have been very near to Tal Bryn's village. I don't know why you should be there? Are you part of the Sisyski Delegation?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sisyski? I don't know what you are talking about.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've never heard of the League of True Planets? You don't know that this is Nevermore?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know ANYTHING!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman seems to believe you. \"Very puzzling... I don't know who you are or what you are, and obviously you don't know. Would you like me to call a policeman?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA chill runs through you. Why should that frighten you? \"A policeman?\" you say. \"No, I don't think that's needed. I'll be okay.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman looks skeptical. \"But you need some help. Perhaps a doctor can help you get your memory back?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No... No... I'm fine. Well, I guess I better be going. You've been a big help. Thanks a lot.\" And you head for the exit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait!\" says the woman and grabs your arm. \"I really don't think you should be out there by yourself, not knowing who you are and all. Just sit down and don't be afraid.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel a little panic building in you. \"No. Really! It's okay. I appreciate your help, but I have to be on my way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman will not let go of you. Her expression hardens. \"Why? Where are you going?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don't know where you are going. You just know you have to get away from this woman and her policemen. You wrench your arm out of her grasp and run for the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait!\" she yells and runs after you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The wagon crosses a large courtyard, then passes into a narrow alleyway between high walls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom your vantage point in back, you watch the walls pass by. When an open doorway appears, you jump out of the wagon and quickly slip through it. You pause just inside, listening, looking, all your senses on heightened awareness. You detect no activity, so you continue on into the room, moving quickly and staying alert.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt isn't clear what the room is used for. It contains a table and some wooden chests, but you notice a narrow stairway at the back and climb up to the next floor. This is clearly a store room of some kind and there are plenty of places to hide. You decide this would be as good a rathole as any to settle down in and collect your wits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou make a slight rearrangement of some broken furniture and wooden boxes filled with crockery. You even find an old blanket that you can use for a bed. Soon you have a nest made. It's not that you plan to live here for long, but you don't know where the girl is or how long it will take to find her, so you want to have a good hiding place. At night you can search for the girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou drift off to sleep, waiting for nightfall and darkness. When you wake up, you notice a blue glow in your pocket - the viewscreen! You snatch it out, and there is the girl. She seems to be looking right into your eyes. \"Where are you?\" she whispers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou almost drop the viewscreen. \"Can you hear me?\" you whisper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. Are you in the castle?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, but I don't know where.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe studies your face. \"Have you come to save me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes!\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiles. \"I thought so! What is your name?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe name thing again! You say the first thing that pops into your mind, \"Tom. What's yours?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ariana. Thanks for coming to save me, Tom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why are you here, Ariana? What are all these lizard things?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Those are the Tsiuni, Tom. They killed my family. You must save me, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure!\" you whisper. \"That's why I'm here. But where are you in the castle?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Old Tower. The Tsiuni have their guard quarters on the ground floor of the Old tower, but there is a secret passage they don't know about. The Old Tower is the one that has tiny square windows. The other towers all have rectangular windows. Can you find it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think so. What about the secret passage?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll talk again. I have to go now.\" And the screen goes blank.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou settle back into your \"nest\". In a few hours, when most of the castle is asleep, you will make your move.</span></div></div>",

There is a guard down below, but he is not looking up. He seems half asleep, leaning on his long spear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look around at the towers of the castle and easily spot the Old Tower. If you can get past the guard below, you will be able to reach the base of the tower. Unfortunately, when you jump down to the ground as quietly as you can, it is not quietly enough for a dog sleeping nearby. His barking spurs you into a fast sprint across the courtyard and into a dark alley. You pause, slightly winded, but you hear nothing except the guard hushing the dog.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe stones of the Old Tower are old and cracked, with gaps where weathering has cracked loose chunks of rock. It may be possible to climb the tower. That would leave you exposed to view, although the outside of the tower can only be seen by someone outside the castle grounds and it is unlikely anyone would be there in the rocky hills around the castle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd what about Ariana's \"secret passage\"? Maybe that would be the best way to reach her. You pull out the viewscreen, but the little gadget has a dark screen.</span></div></div>",

You realize that you are in a room with three doors of different colors. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look at the little bottle you just sipped from and it has a strange clarity about it, as though it's the prototype bottle from which all the other bottles in the universe were created. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you notice that the other objects on the table each have there own unique existence. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou spend several minutes looking at the grain in the leather cover of the book, admiring the way it seems to be a random pattern and yet makes sense if you let your eye trace the ridges and valleys. It's like you are looking at a landscape and you imagine there might be a whole colony of microscopic animals living on the leather. To them the ridges of the pattern are mountains and they can spend days trudging from one side of the book to the other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen your attention finally leaves the book and goes looking for something else, you think \"Wow! How long was I looking at that leather?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou go to the blue door and open it. It's a straight drop down out there and you immediately feel dizzy. \"Wow!\" you say. \"It's like a hundred miles down!\" And you come back in and shut the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou try the green door, but it's like a jungle out there. You can hear a lion growl and you jump back inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou open the red door into a dark cavern. You stare until your eyes adjust to the dim red light and then you scream. There is a huge monster with a mouthful of teeth coming toward you. You slam the door shut. Was that a naked boy in the monster's arms? But you have no intention of opening that red door again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou go back to the table and pick up the little bottle again. The walls of the room have a strange rubbery quality about them. Everything seems to be moving slightly - the walls, the floor, the ceiling, the table. If this is hip, you think, then I do not want to be hip. I better sip again so I can return to normal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the liquid goes down your throat, an alarm bell goes off in your mind. Wait! Is that what the label said? \"Sip twice be nice...\"  No! It didn't say that. It said there would be a price to pay! As you slump to the floor your mind is thinking \"Oh nooooo.......\"</span></div></div>",

You look at the horror you have become - a soft pulpy worm covered in green fuzz with long black hairs protruding from your head and tail. The hairs are barbed and you instinctively know they are poisonous. You manage to flick one into the giant hand of the naked little boy and he drops the magnifying glass, screaming \"Mommy! Mommy! It bit me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe magnifying glass shatters on the floor into a thousand shards of glass that sparkle like ice and melt and run together on the floor to form a clear puddle that rises up into the shape of a crystal man, a naked crystal man. He walks toward you, tinkling (the sound, not the activity) like a crystal chandelier and you wish you were not so soft and squishy so that you could shatter him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour soft body straightens out and becomes a hard cylinder of stone. You could shatter the crystal man now, but you can't move your rigid body. \"Articulation!\" you scream. \"Segments, plates, anything so I can move!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOminous cracking noises resonate through your rigid body and you feel yourself break apart into a dozen pieces of stone strung like a necklace on a rope big enough to moor a battleship. \"Thank God I can move!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou launch a viscious tail whip at the crystal man which shatters him into a thousand pieces of crystal that sparkle on the floor like ice and then melt and run together into a puddle that rises up into a new crystal man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh nooooo..... \"</span></div></div>",
