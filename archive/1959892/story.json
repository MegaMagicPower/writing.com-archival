He has big oval shaped ears on either side of his head, his hair looks like a hand that's covering some of his left eye, his eyes are pure black, and he has whiskers on either side of his face as well. He normally wears a red and white striped short sleeved shirt with the stripes going left and right, normal jean type jeans, and he walks around barefoot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPersonality: Tim's personality is easily summed up with the following words. Childlike. Carefree. Friendly. Outgoing. Pretty much anyone would enjoy hanging out with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOther info: Tim is bisexual, he prefers to tickle rather than be tickled, and he is ticklish everywhere, but unless you're small like he is, you'll have a very hard time tickling him.</span></div></div>",
