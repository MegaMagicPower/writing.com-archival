In your dream you actually MET Sonic the hedgehog and somehow, he KNEW about <br>\r\nyour foot fetish! Every night since, you have had dreams similar to it, but not always quite the same, some <br>\r\ntimes you were shrunken down to the size of a quarter and made to lick the huge walls of flesh that were <br>\r\npresented to you. Other times, you were just a normal sized human slave to the hedgehog. You even <br>\r\nremember this one time with Espio the Chameleon and Vector the Crocodile forcing you to be their slave.<br>\r\nYou remember it vividly, you also remember a whole bunch of typos too... and these crazy scenarios always<br>\r\nplayed out, but never fully felt like they were finished. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou remember these dreams so vividly, but two weeks ago, without warning, they stopped. Just like that.<br>\r\nYou still could play out the scenarios in your head like it was just last night that you had those dreams, <br>\r\nbut ever since, you've just had normal dreams. You don't think much of it now, but boy were they some good<br>\r\ndreams.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToday is a Saturday, the first day of summer! You're off on your own, just out of college, life is great! You think<br>\r\nback to the dreams you had and decide to pull an all-nighter of Sonic Genesis, for old times sake. The console <br>\r\nis a bit dusty because, well, recently you haven't had all that much time to play it and you think it's not going to work,<br>\r\nbut you'd be wrong to think so. You plug in the Console to your television, and get the cartridge, and you look at it for<br>\r\na second, thinking something was a bit off, quickly shrugging off the feeling, you put the cartridge in and the game starts up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sit down as the signature \"SEGA\" theme plays, but all of a sudden, the screen turns blue, shining blue light all over the room.<br>\r\nYou think, \"Ah the thing must've crapped out from being so old.\" As you reach to take your cartridge out, another bright light<br>\r\nflashes and you fall into unconsciousness. You wake up a couple hours later....</span></div></div>",

As you start walking toward the <br>\r\nhedgehog, you realize something, you aren't wearing any shoes,<br>\r\nin fact, you aren't wearing anything! At first you feel a little <br>\r\nembarrassed by this, but you remember that sonic doesn't wear<br>\r\nany clothes except for his shoes so it wouldn't really matter to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     You continue to make your way to Sonic and eventually he sees<br>\r\nyou, stops, smiles and waits for you to catch up. You finally get to him<br>\r\nand begin to introduce yourself when he stops you and says, \"I know<br>\r\nwho you are, I was the one that brought you here.\" A little stunned by this<br>\r\nyou ask, \"Why?\" \"I think you know the reason.\" He says with a little smile<br>\r\nbecause you do know, you have been a fan of the hedgehog since you <br>\r\nplayed your first Sonic the Hedgehog  game and have always been <br>\r\ncompletely enthused with the idea of going to Mobius and living with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"But then you know-\" \"That's right, I do know your fantasy of living here<br>\r\nwith my friends and I, so I decided, why not?\" You are completely ecstatic<br>\r\nby what you are hearing, not only is your idol allowing you to live with him<br>\r\nwhenever you choose, but is completely real and 100%- *BEEP* *BEEP* *BEEP*<br>\r\nYour alarm is blaring in your ear and you open your eyes, You are completely<br>\r\nsaddened to find out that what you just experience was only a dream.<br>\r\n\"Oh well,\" you sighed, \"Maybe I'll have the dream again.\" and you get up, get<br>\r\ndressed and ready for work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    All the way to work you can't help but think about the amazing dream you had<br>\r\nand wanted so much more of it, but you knew dreams were only that: Dreams.<br>\r\nOnce you got  into work, you went to your office and sat behind your desk,<br>\r\nwishing that it had been real, but you had to focus on the papers that needed to<br>\r\nbe filled. Occasionally you would glance up looking through the glass walls, thinking<br>\r\nyou had seen something out of the corner of your eye, smiled and waved to the girl<br>\r\nwith pink and blue highlights in her hair but dismissed it as nothing. You continued <br>\r\nworking until late in the evening after everyone had gone home, but then you heard <br>\r\nsomething from outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   You  got up, went to the door, opened it and listened, there was definitely someone <br>\r\nin there and you knew that it wasn't Jim the security guard as his shift didn't start for another<br>\r\n30 minutes and all he did was sit at the door to the room with the cubicles in it. You walk out <br>\r\nof your office and ask \"Hello? Is someone there?\" to which no one answered. You continue <br>\r\ninto the room, looking in cubicle  after cubicle when you notice, your clothes were no longer<br>\r\non. \"I must be dreaming.\" You say aloud to yourself, \"Anyway, why would I even dream of <br>\r\nbeing here?\" \"Because this isn't a dream.\" a voice from behind says.

Only this time<br>\r\nyou realize something, Sonic's shoes and socks are missing.<br>\r\n\"You see something you like?\" The hedgehog asks, with an all<br>\r\ntoo knowing grin \"NO! No, no. it's just, your shoes\" You say <br>\r\ndefensively, trying to hide any thought of his gorgeous feet from<br>\r\nyour face. \"What about my shoes?\" he asks. \"They aren't on your <br>\r\nfeet!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, that, well I never wear my shoes when walking in this field, I <br>\r\nlike the feel of the cool grass after a long run in my hot, sweaty shoes.\" <br>\r\nHe says, almost as if he were putting emphasis on the<br>\r\nlast three words. After walking for awhile You and Sonic sit down on a <br>\r\nhill, you can't help but admire his huge feet, so blue that it was like looking <br>\r\ninto water and just like water, you know that you want his feet,you need his <br>\r\nfeet. You find the courage to ask if he needs a foot rub. He says, \"Sure, if <br>\r\nyou want, but mind you, my feet tend to reek after a long day,\" \"Oh, I don't mind,\"<br>\r\nyou say casually not wanting to betray your true feelings. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lay back and relax,\"  You say as you begin the massage. You lay down as well,<br>\r\npuzzled he asks, \"What you are doing?\" You reply, \"I Just want to make it easier<br>\r\nto give the massage, nodding he then puts his leg on your stomach so that his <br>\r\nfoot is right near your face. You take a deep, silent breath, 'He was right,' <br>\r\nyou think, 'his foot really does give off a smell,' fortunately for you, it is the most<br>\r\nheavenly smell ever. You then get to work on his heel, applying much pressure to<br>\r\nit, Sonic is loving it. You work your way up to the fleshiest part of the foot,<br>\r\nyou begin  with your thumbs, holding the foot with your other fingers<br>\r\nand then moving the thumbs in slow, circular motions, making sure that every inch <br>\r\nof the big foot is covered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then move on to the top of the sole, right under the  best part: the toes.<br>\r\nYou start with the pinky toe, move down the row to the big toe.<br>\r\nYou hear Sonic almost whimper as you moved along each individual toe, <br>\r\nensuring that no piggy gets less attention than another. You even, (When<br>\r\nhe isn't looking) take a few sneaky sniffs close enough to smell, but not <br>\r\nenough to give your action away. You wish that you could just shrink down <br>\r\nand play with his feet on a grander scale.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then do the same with the left foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the massage is over, Sonic thanks you and...</span></div></div>",

(I know i misspelled that last name, can the owner help me out here please?) He was walking around with what looked like tracking gear all over his body. He also seemed to be focused on a blinking monitor he was holding in his hands, until he almost bumped until you of course, then he looked right into your eyes and stared intently into them, as if wondering who you were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...hi.\" You said, interrupting the silence and causing Tails to blink and shake his hear for a moment before looking back at you, while smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi there. Don't think I've seen you around here before. You wouldn't happen to be from another world would you?\" As odd a question that was to ask, he was right on the money. You knew you had to be in Sonic's world if you were talking to Tails, so you nodded in response as Tails clasped his hands together, smiling once again. Only this time beaming as he said...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes! I knew it! That mean's my inter-dimensional transporter experiment was a success! I've actuality found a way to send and recover things to and from other worlds! Oh the science board is going to be so impressed with me again. But really, why wouldn't they? I'm one of the smartest...\" Tails kept going on and on about how smart he was and how others looked up to him for all he's done for society and everything. By the time he was done talking, you were finally able to get your own words in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen, I'm glad for you and all, but is there anyway for you to send me back to my own world?\" Tails looked back at you, shocked at what he just heard you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...yeah, about that, i don't think I'll be able to do that for a while anyway.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not for a while? Why not?\" Tails then started kicking the dirt with his shoes as he explained himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You see, The energy source i was using to power my inter-dimensional transporter was transported over to your world by mistake. So i won't be able to send you back until i find another one. Sorry.\" Another energy source? From the sound of things, that sounded like he was using a Chaos Emerald. But if one of them was in your world now, finding one of the other six was going to be tricky, and time consuming. So it looked like you really were going to be stuck here for a while. Tails saw you looking down at the ground, upset, and lifted your chin up with one of his hands and said...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, I'll take care of you until i find another one. It's the least i can do for putting you through all this.\" Then you started cheering up a little bit, smiling and nodding back before saying...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright. Thanks Tails.\" Tail's smiled for a brief moment saying...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No Prob.....Huh?\" Then Tails started looking at you strangely before saying...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did you know my name?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n.......Well shit.</span></div></div>",

And you didn't want to do that. You really liked Tails as a character, though a part of you tried hiding it from yourself, you had to admit it now, Tails was one of your favorite Sonic characters, and you wanted to make sure he was happy and stayed that way. You'd do anything in the whole world to make him feel that way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello?\" Tails was getting impatient, and you could tell by the look on his face. Also he was tapping his feet to the ground repeatedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? Oh, sorry. I spaced out back there.\" Tails sighed and shook his head, then he said...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then tell me how you know my name if you're from another world, preferably before you space out again.\" You knew you had to say something, but if both telling him the truth and a lie were out of the question, then what was left?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd that's when you spotted your answer. It seems Tails had a name-tag hanging on the side of his gear. And lucky you, it did have his full name on it.

I did bring that with me didn't i? I almost forgot. It's a good thing you reminded me.

Tails seemed to be in a hurry, most likely he didn't want anyone seeing you when you entered town, since you weren't from this world to begin with. Also you're human, that's a thing to consider too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here we are.\" Tails said as he led you to a small house in the center of town. Luckily for you, almost no one was around to see you, but Tails quietly led you past the ones who would've seen you. And after a second of unlocking the door, Tails led you inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, this is it. Home sweet home.\" It sure was a small place, not as big as most Earth homes, but it did have that old rustic feel to it. Tails led you into his bedroom which had a XL queen size bed in it that took up most of the walking space, just about the only really nice thing in the whole house, as well as a small desk with some spare parts and grease stains all around it, a small closet, and a small laundry basked loaded with mostly used socks and two pairs of old shoes. Also the room itself had some clothes laying around on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry about the mess, i haven't had a lot of time to clean anything up. Mostly due to trying to get my funding back for my workshop in the city.\" You sat down on the comfy bed before asking...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Funding for your workshop? Why do you need that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So i can keep working on my projects, like the one i used to bring you to my world. The science board closed it down due to a lack of projects. But I've only been lacking in ideas because i wanted to finish this one first. And now that i have, i can show you to the board and prove to them that i can still create useful things and get my funding back.\" So to him, you were just a means to get his workshop running again?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyway, i need to go pick up some supplies from the market before they close. Can you stay here and watch the place for me until i return?\" Tails said as he walked over to the front door.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, sure. I think i can do that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks. See you in a little bit.\" Tails said as he left and closed the door behind him. Now that you were all alone in Tails's home, what were you going to do in order to kill time until he returned?</span></div></div>",

You know it's risky but you just can't hold yourself back and walk into his bedroom and look at the socks and shoes, you gulp nervously and decide that opportunity like that may never come again and that it isn't something that you should pass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou slowly grab one pair of his shoes and one pair of his socks and throw them on his bed before lying down next to the precious items. You shake like a leaf before finally making a move and grabbing one of his shoes and lifting it. You hold it in front of your face and just examine it for now. It looks very iconic to Tails, yet you could tell it has been used for years since it's very worn out. You slide your hand into Tails footwear and just feel the inside of it, you press your fingers into his insole and it feels a little damp and squishy. As you continue indulging yourself you can easily tell that this insole has been used for quite a long time, you finally realize that the years of use left a little footprint in it. You decide that you can't hold any longer and you have to know the smell of the beautiful shoe, so you take your hand out of it and slowly, and with little hesitation lower the shoe on your nose. You wait a while before breathing in, as if to appreciate the oncoming smell more, before you finally inhale deeply. The smell hit you right away, it wasn't subtle at all, clearly Tails spent a lot of time on his feet in these shoes, probably not really worrying about his sweaty feet. The scent is deep and strong, obvious aromas of sweat and socks are present but also some hints of dirt and some smells resembling workshop. You keep inhaling the delightful scent, shivering in pleasure. You reach out with your other hand and grab one of his overused, sweaty socks and replace the shoe on your nose with it. Once again you take a while to appreciate the feeling of the damp smelly and sweaty material against your nose and face, you grab his other sock and hold it above your head just enjoying the view of his dirty sock before dropping it on your face and letting it fall on your eyes. You finally inhale, moaning at the smell of his sock, the material did a great job of preserving the smell. The smell itself was very similar to the one from his shoes, however the smell of Tails foot sweat was definitely intensified...</span></div></div>",

You then shift your gaze down to her feet and examine her orange and yellow shoes, her tiny ankle socks wrap themselves around her ankles and hide themselves within her shoes, your heart begins to beat faster.You just want to dig your fingers down into them and caress the warm, sweaty socks, perhaps even catch an occasional whiff. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCream\u2019s giggle snaps you out of your thoughts.

Her gesture clams you and the panic within you is replaced by warming comfort. 'I know what you want, its okay, you can have them, they\u2019re all yours.' <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes widen at her offer, your breathing becomes steeper and your heart beats faster.

Looking into her smiling face, you run your hand down her leg until it meets the rubber sole of her shoe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou begin to apply pressure to the sole to remove it but Cream brings up her other foot plants in into your chest and pushes you onto your back.

The smell of sweat acts an overwhelming aroma that keeps you passionately desiring for more. You want more of the fabulous smell, so much more that you stick her socked toes up your nostrils and inhale.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mouth acts on its own as it kisses and nips at the sock. You pull your face out of the sock and enjoy messaging Cream\u2019s warm and sweaty socked foot that lays before you. Your hands rub up and down the bottom of the foot as you feel the delighting sensation of dirty warm cloth between your fingers, bringing your nose closer you catch another whiff of the overwhelming aroma that lingers around the foot, you want more and Cream is more than happy to let you have it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe waves her shoed foot in your face and urges you to remove it, you slowly begin to pull it lose. Your hand shakes with excitement as the shoe slides of her socked foot. You plant your face into her feet savoring every sweet moment that Cream has willingly given you; she spreads her toes apart inside her socks and allows your nose to come between them. Pulling your face out yet again, you relax your body; you calmly caress her foot and wander what to do next. </span></div></div>",

These type of things had always been a guilty pleasure since you were in the fifth grade. Sure all of them are unoriginal trite with a story a blind deaf man could predict with the utmost accuracy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut hey, at least it <i><u>enjoyable{/u</u></i> trite. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut just when you just got to the part where Kenneth was about to find out about Barbara's disease. A bright light appeared above of you. Causing you to drop a reheated slice of cheese pizza to the floor to near floor. With an undignified shriek that came from above your head, something <i>furry</i> landed right on top on your torso. Briefly reminding you of that weird blue...hamster that has run all around the country lately. Soon three other large looking objects dropping close behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'Whatever it is...I hate to get it some shoes.'</i> The thought ran past your head as you gawked at your visitor's orange pair of five-toed feet. A faint pinkness starts t form in your cheeks. Damn things are almost roughly the size of your forearms. Peeking back a bit, you noticed two huge shoes behind the couch.  The deep black insole is visible to the exposed sides of the footwear. A wave of not so curiosity starts to hold your mind. A new way to spice up a lazy morning has just opened right up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWordlessly your naughty little fingers start to prod the soles and caressing the moist crevices of its chunky toes. Your alert eyes continuously dart all over the room and back your guest as you continue to feel the very mixed texture of the soles. It's pudgy softness and smooth calluses were like night and day. You simply marveled at the dirt and bits of plants that subtly covered it. Steadily your groin became a \"symbol\" of your curiosity. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut deep down you can't help but feel pretty guilty to doing this to the creature. But your simply hormones won that battle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut unknown to you, the creature sure as hay aware of your \"curiosity\", and it's making <b>her</b> mind a bubbling cauldron with various emotion. <b>She</b> is curious about where she is now and more importantly you. <b>She</b> is pretty darn angry that ya forcibly doing...<u>this</u>. And <b>she</b>....is pretty flustered and find herself liking the feeling of her feet being touched like that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe both of them are quickly reaching a breaking point.

Not hard enough to cause any permanent damage, but enough to get the point across and keep you in place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd what the HELL do you think you were just doing?\u201d She shouted down at you in a thick accent that made her sound Australian. \u201cI fall in here and you start using me to do things like that?\u201d The foot pressed down harder.

After all it\u2019s only fair she get to abuse this person for her own pleasure. It\u2019s what he tried with her. Though perhaps she should take this in another direction. Give you exactly what you seem to be asking for... just in a way that you\u2019ll never look at anyone\u2019s feet ever again.

Hesitantly, you oblige and gradually open your lips just a little. You locked eyes with Marine, and felt Marine's toes gently let themselves in your mouth, a determined look on her face. Unfortunately for you, she got impatient and when your guard was gone, she quickly shoved her whole foot in quickly into your mouth, forcing you to taste the slimy sweat from between her toes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe continued this for a few minutes, playing with your tongue in a rough manner while you also endured the enhanced smell from her other foot placed directly above your nostrils. Secretly though, you loved how much being abused by the small creature but you didn't really want to admit it to Marine. It would be an utter embarrassment. Unlucky for you, Marine caught on to your true feelings and proposed something, while you kept on moaning in your feet heaven.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you like my feet that much, how about I make ya my personal foot slave?\" Marine offered, scrunching up her toes a little on your nose.

I thought that went pretty decently...\" Her boot swings around your head to place itself in front of your mouth. \"Kiss.\" She orders whilst smirking.

Your job is only half completed...oh, and you may rise.\" She smiles back at you, before walking off. You stand yourself and follow her, your legs popping and snapping slightly from the disuse. Jeez your knees were sore... suddenly your gaze snaps downward. Blaze only had one boot on! Her other foot was completely bare! Oh, that TEASE!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStopping at a door, Blaze removes her glove to press a hand to it, a palm sensor scanning her print to make sure it was correct. The door slid open and she beckoned you inside with a grin. She knew you were staring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis... was her private chambers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClosing the door behind you, she removed her other glove, tossing them both on an end table, then sat on her bed and removed her other boot. Tossing that aside as well, she stood again, walking over to you and with naught but a touch on your chest, brought you to the ground in silent love for your goddess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, servant? I promised I'd walk on you with my bare feet.

Again! With no boots on! Her bare feet stepped down with the same care she took with her boots, but occasionally as she neared your head she would gently lift her foot and place it on your neck gently, playing with the idea of choking you underfoot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes-that seemed like hours-she steps off of you and orders you to strip entirely. You'd lost most of your clothes, yes...but you'd kept the one you absolutely needed.

It's a beautiful, mesmerizing dance that you can't take your eyes off. She prances all over you, jumping, spinning and twirling on your body, which is now her dance floor. You whimper and moan in pained pleasure as your cock and balls are, pounded, squished, mashed, and ground beneath her dancing feet. You feel like you can die an go to heaven any second!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon you can't take it anymore and you blow your load, soaking her feet in your cum. She stops her dance, looking down at the white liquid drenching her feet. Wiggling her toes, the princess makes a tsking sound.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What a messy pet you are.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze walks onto your chest, smirks at you...and shoves her foot in your mouth!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Clean up your mess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe orders. You don't need to be told twice! You lick and suck on it worshipingly, running your tongue between her toes and along the sole of her foot, cleaning every inch. Blaze leaves you to it for a bit before taking it away and presenting the other foot to you. When your done, she goes back to her dance. However this time it's much more forceful, making you squirm and moan FAR more. This was your punishment for interrupting her. The princess laughs at your display, very much enjoying making you squirm underfoot. Being someones goddess wasn't bad at all!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she finishes her dance she plops back on the bed, feeling relaxed and happy, her feet tapping lazily on her footrest. As for you, your feeling pretty darned sore, your body super tender from all the trampling it had endured so far today. Yet your happier than you've ever been in your life. Your every dream had come true this day!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I'm going to have lunch now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlazes decides, having worked up quite an appetite playing with you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"An then...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat's our pretty royal kitty want to do next?</span></div></div>",

Soon enough, both feet were free from their prisons, where you caught a clear view of Marine's feet, her toes wiggling in delight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lay down!\" Marine ordered, with a hint of mischief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou eagerly comply, laying on your back on the cold hard ground. Your manhood was fully erected to its extent as Blaze continues to rub your dick with her toes,  playfully motioning her feet up and down on your extended, stroking and pressing at a moderate speed. Blaze forms a small smile as she moves faster and faster with each passing second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, you see Marine tossing her boots to the side before setting her strong smelling orange feet directly on your face, massaging them roughly on your skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay matey,\" Marine chuckled, realising just how much she is enjoying this, \"I hope that yer love these beauties as much as I do! I haven't washed them in several days... ever since I 'accidently' got lost and stranded on some island or something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsing what little movement you had, you followed along to Marine's feet, taking in considerable breaths of her smelly and sweaty feet which had a scent of sea salt to them. Smirking, she began to press down her foot a little, spreading her first two toes in between your nose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right then, how do they smell swabby?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou moan in pleasure, taking deep sniffs of her toes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great isn't it?\" she boasted proudly, \"Yikes, I didn't know yer into this stuff as I'd thought!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe amused herself by rubbing her bare soles over your face, taking a deep focus on your nose. She even placed your nose between her toes where the smell was the strongest. And you were enjoying every single moment of it.</span></div></div>",

Your a real nutter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarine laughs, slapping her knee. She looks down at her human footstool/shoe cleaner with a wide grin.

To be mashed and ground under those blue boots...to kiss them...to see what was inside them...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Ahem!*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were immediately shook out of your daydream.

You remember a bright flash of light, then suddenly finding yourself inside some sort of military looking place. You'd only had a short time to wander around before feeling a VERY sharp pain, then blacking out. Your head throbbed something aweful, like it had been struck by something. You correctly guessed that it was a result of being kicked in the head by a certain rebel princess. Jeeze her legs were strong! You felt like you'd been clobbered with a baseball bat!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I- I'm not a spy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe raises an eyebrow. obviously not buying it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh really?

She could believe the story about being from another world. Lord knows they've dealt with that sort of thing enough times. An she found the idea of having otherwordly fans and admirers flatterying, but...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me get this straight. You want me to, literally, walk all over you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis kid couldn't be serious. Your nod and smile say otherwise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, your highness.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe princess humms thoughtfully, tapping her foot on you. You can clearly hear the dull thump of the sole of her boot tapping against the bone of your chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, lets test this out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe takes a step forward, standing fully on your chest. Giving you a little grin, Sally extends one foot out, leaving it hovering just a few inches above your face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If your serious, then you won't mind licking the forest muck off the bottom of my boots.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe brown squirell folds her arm, giving you a daring look. Not that you could see it. Your entire field of vision was filled with the boot sole hovering over your face. You could see each tread clearly, as well as all the dirt, grass, and other forest junk stuck between them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"An of course your not going to do it, so lets...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSally's eyes widened slightly in surprise when you actually started licking. She remains silent till you were done, then examined the boot sole, finding it spotless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I'll be.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe hummed, letting you clean the other one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your a weird one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSally tapped her chin thoughtfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But...I don't see any harm in it, so I guess I'll let you stick around for now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nActually, she was rather curious about how far you'd be willing to go with this.</span></div></div>",

The sudden and straightforward nature of his questions took you initially by surprise, but you soon responded to both with a simple \" I don't know\". What you eventually came to discover was that you didn't just arrive in a simple flash of light, but you instead fell to wherever you'd arrived at, leaving you with only a select few memories. But, that didn't really matter all that much during your first amongst many visits to the inhabitants of the planet you soon remembered as \" Mobius\", seeing as how all of your lost memories came back overtime, but were quickly overshadowed by the unforgettable moments you experienced in this world of your dreams. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Over the course of the three weeks you spent in Mobius, you were finally able to explore your innermost desires with the characters of your then vague childhood, something you remembered having a few dreams of doing and was finally given the opportunity to do so. The first character you'd done anything sexual with was Espio, a intelligent ninja who truly had a heart of gold. Before then, however, he simply ignored your genuine confusion and insisted upon knowing who you were, to which you replied with the same answer every time. Despite his persistence, you couldn't help but feel magnetized towards him. His enigmatic presence and appearance only helped to add more to your sudden attraction. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \"Well, if you truly don't know,\" he ultimately responded \" then I should apologize for my ignorance. I'm truly sorry for heckling you with questions you can't even answer. If there is a way for me to make it up to you, let me know.\". With that offer being thrown onto your table, you immediately got the perfect vision of repayment. Before the chameleon could rush off to his home, you instantly stopped him and reluctantly told him of your compromise. \" C-could I...could I maybe get...a few sniffs of your feet ? I mean, if that's too bizarre, then-\" Espio gently placed his index finger over your mouth. \" You needn't ask for something else. I'am fully willing to let you do whatever you want with my feet, or perhaps...something else ? It's the most I could do for you, but I don't mind one bit. I just hope that I can FINALLY experiment for once.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0After giving him an odd glance, you steadily shift yourself back on to the soft sand alongside Espio.

After a series of subtle hand movements. you finally removed Espio's dark boot and unveiled his neon yellow socks, which emitted a noxious combination of sweat and foot odor. A truly disgusting scent that would turn away most average people, but you reveled in it entirely by constantly taking slow, deep whiffs from both of the chameleon's boots. The smell was nothing short of pure perfection, and despite later sampling the marvelous aphrodisiacs of all the other characters you always found Espio's the most \"memorable\" of the various pairs you had during those few, yet truly fantastic weeks in Mobius. As your nose pressed harder into the well worn insole of the dirty and dusty boots,you quickly caught a glimpse of Espio's face, which was redder than a rose by that point, slowly wake up from a short nap, causing his eyes to glisten once more from the seemingly permanent sunset. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\" Enjoyimg yourself ?\" he asked in a tired voice, to which you gave a silent nod and smile \" Great, I was hoping that my feet would be satisfactory. That reminds me, didn't I meet you quite a while ago ? Your face just seems so familiar. In fact, I distinctly remember I did this whole foot thing before, but I wasn't really myself. I was demanding and dominant, traits I hardly ever get the chance to even think of  having. It's so odd...Regardless, ummm, j-just keep on enjoying yourself.\". After that strangely one sided conversation, your mind began to form a blurry image that seemed to be nothing more than a mess of colors. What you came to realize just minutes later was that it was actually the first of your lost memories; a scene of Vector and Espio tugging at a leash which encumpassed all of your neck as they forcefully placed their bare feet directly into your face. This one thought sent your brain into a frenzy as an entire flood of ideas came crashing into your subconscious. Your eyes instantly locked with Espio's as your mouth lies on the edge of telling him these ideas flat out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\" Uhhh, Espio right ?\" you shyly muttered out \" I think I may have a few ideas that could maybe subside well with you and add some...\"interesting\" scenarios to this pretty mundane session so far. But, only if it's fine with you.\". After you questioned the chameleon, he let out a quiet giggle before nodding \"yes\".

As the pressure you applied to his feet steadily increased over time, you could hear his voice go from subtle whispers of delight to pleasure filled moans. Underneath the damp set of socks resided a truly wonderful pair of soles that, even when fully covered, felt like velvet course through your individual fingers, especially the large and masculine toes you became quite fond of once the massage was over. Whilst he was in his state of relaxation, you decided to place the ninja's docile toes right in front of your nose, giving the aphrodisiac scent full freedom to traverse your entire body. Nothing but euphoria coursed throughout your entire body as you continued to take progressively larger sniffs of Espio's large and wide feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Each whiff you took sent stronger signals of excitement towards your then flaccid member, eventually creating a more than noticeable bulge in your pants. Soon, however, the chameleon eventually caught sight of your rock hard cock, which flushed his entire face in red. \" Wow, I've had one person tell me they liked feet before,\" he quietly muttered \" but I've never actually seen someone get turned on by touching and sniffing them. Then again, that person didn't do anything like this. Instead, they were the ones who got their feet smelled and such. A-anyways, just don't mind my needless babbling. Enjoy yourself.\". The sudden intrusion took you out of the intense smelling for just a single moment. What you eventually came to hear whilst you continued to rub the ninja's sore feet was that Espio was referring to Silver, who you distinctly remembered from a certain series of dreams in which he dominated over you, but had never actually seen in person, which made some memories of other characters come flooding back, making you think that maybe another person would make the session more enjoyable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Even though you continued to smell away at your hearts content, the urge to get another person to join the fun persisted, despite it being somewhat irrelevant. Silver seemed like the obvious choice, but you began to think of other characters you wanted to have alongside Espio. Vector, Jet, maybe even Scourge. The possibilities seemed endless, yet you had a certain unwanted feeling towards Sonic or Tails. To you, they seemed like the most substantial, and should thus be enjoyed on their own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Because of those feelings, you decided to stick to only the \" forgotten\" characters that everybody in the real world never gave much thought to, but you enjoyed a little. Your mind became more free and open due to the amount of people you could think of. Perhaps one other person wasn't enough. Maybe three or even four seemed like better options. You decided to voice your idea to the still euphoric Espio, who responded with a calm and collected \"sure\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0He even went as far as to say he'd fetch the characters if that's what you really wanted. The ideas of either continuing in the same way or adding someone else seemed to become two greatly enticing possibilities. You had to decide; keep on going with just Espio or bring in another character. The choice became yours to make.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You then think of someone who could take charge of a situation, but be playful with it. Scourge would be a bit too harsh and Vector would be a bit too chummy with Espio so you ultimately decide on Jet the Hawk, While portrayed as arrogant, rude and disrespectful, you think that he could possibly be the best fun of the three.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jet.\" You say after awhile, smiling. Espio cocks an eyebrow, but smirks, \"The Hawk? Hmm, I've had a few dealings with him before, not the most pleasant personality to make friends with, but I see the potential.\" He chuckles slightly to himself, \"maybe he'll find an angle to make this competitive in some way.\" The purple chameleon clasps his hands together and rises, his foot removed from your hands and his socks and shoes back on his feet to your slight dismay, but you know the time away will be worth it, \"Alright, I will fetch the Hawk and we'll have some more fun later,\" he winks at you as he opens the door to exit the apartment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few hours pass, you sit on the couch, patiently waiting for Espio to return. Soon enough you hear a pair of muffled voices approaching the door. You sit up excitedly as the door swings open and in steps the green hawk in all his glory, while not exceedingly familiar with the Hawk, you are aware of his cocky nature. \"So, you're the guy who wanted to meet me? The Purple Pinhead said something about a fun afternoon\" He jerks his thumb to Espio who scowls a bit at the remark but his frown turns to a wry smile, \"Why don't you make yourself comfortable,\" gesturing to the couch, the detective begins to make his way into the living room past Jet who runs to sit before his host, \"Heh, I still got it.\" he remarks, showing his competitive side. Espio merely rolls his eyes and takes a seat next to the Hawk, who shoots a prideful smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what's this you were saying about a fun afternoon,\" he looks to you, still sitting on the couch awestruck still after all this time that you merely had to ask for something and you received it with gusto, \"and who the heck are you?\" Suddenly you are snapped out of your starstruck trance. \"Oh - I- I- um... well I-\" before you can stammer out an answer, Espio interjects, \"Our friend here has been suffering from a touch of amnesia, but he has an interest that he has demonstrated to me a few times before.\" He grins at you, giving the hawk a sidelong glance, \"I do assure you, while his request may be odd, it will be enjoyable for the both of us.\" Jet responds, \"Jeez! If I wanted a lecture I would have just asked Wave what she thinks of TV! Just cut to the chase will ya?\" You shakily answer, \"I would like to... um... play with your feet.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt once, Jet's face is three different emotions of Confusion, Disgust and irritation, ultimately  broken by... Laughter? The hawk begins to bellow with laughter, so much that he falls on the floor, pointing at you, your face is beat red. When he finally settles down he wipes a tear away and speaks, \"So let me get this straight,\" points at you, \"You have no idea how you got here or who you are, ran into THIS knucklehead,\" Jerks his thumb toward Espio, \"Asked to play with HIS feet, totally not creepy by the way, and now dragged me out here to do the same?\" You rub your arm, looking embarrassed, \"Y-yeah... look if you don't wan-\" You are interrupted by being pulled to the floor and a boot landing square on your chest. \"Now now, Who said I didn't want to do this, hmm?\" You are shocked, \"I've been looking for someone to give me the cred I deserve, I think I could even have some fun with this.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe green hawk pats Espio on the shoulder, you see him wince a tad, but doesn't say much, \"Now how about we make this more interesting? Detective, this is your place after all, so I say we make a little wager.\" The chameleon asks, \"What kind of wager?\" \"Our friend here is going to give both of our feet the love that they deserve, if he creams on my feet, I win, if he creams on your feet, you win\" Espio, stoic as ever, thinks for a moment, \"And what does the winner get?\" Jet grins, why a brand new foot-slave of course, but to be fair, others will want in on this, so we'll keep it between you and me for now, the winner keeps him for a month, then we do this again with others, we win, he wins, everybody wins.\" After a few moments of silence, Espio smiles, \"Very well, on one condition,\" \"Name it.\" \"After the winner has his turn for the month, he goes to the loser for a week and then becomes community property.\" Jet smiles at this prospect, \"Even better, now he where shall we begin, oh yes that's right,\" The foot hits your chest again, \"With our boots.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile the terms of the \"game\" were being set, you couldn't help but stare in awe up to the two boys as they discussed you as if you were some piece of property. You were loving every moment of it, you are then snapped out of your trance by Jet's boot hitting you again, \"Wakey wakey sunshine, time to worship our boots!\" You nod and take Jet's boot clad foot into your hand and begin to untie it, to which, surprisingly, Espio's boot pushes its way onto your chest with a gentler force, \"Not so fast, We're saving the main course for last.\" \"Good idea purple, you're not half as dumb as you look\" Jet turns his attention to you, \"That's right, boots first, socks, THEN our bare feet.\" You nod and begin to massage each of their boots, kneading the rubber, even though the can't feel it. Jet shoves his boot in your face, \"I want you to sniff.\" To which you gladly oblige, from what you can tell, Jet takes care to keep his boots clean, there's hardly a scent to them, you notice the material is of a fabric/ rubber that seems as if it would be good for skateboarding. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour thoughts are interrupted by Espio who shoves his foot into your nose, you can certainly tell that there is more of a smell to his, a sweaty/ leathery odor that lightly caresses your nose. The boot trails to your mouth, \"How about giving a lick or two?\" The chameleon asks. Your tongue exits your mouth and is dragged along the rubber of his sole, but you notice that his boots also don't have traditionally thick layers of rubber. You can only guess that these are good for sneaking around with as may be desirable in the detective's profession. You can also tell that they get way more use in terms of walking around than that of Jet's, who at that very moment presses his own boot into your mouth. The rubber/fabric of his sole is rough and grips well, pulling at your tongue far more than Espio's. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on man, you aren't even trying! Get the lead out and worship my feet!\" Jet commands as his other foot hits your stomach, causing you to jerk for a second. You seize the foot and begin to rub it while attending to the two on your face. You feel something on your crotch as you realize that Espio is playing with your manhood, \"Heh heh, you and I are going to have a lot of fun in our month together my friend, I have no doubt in my mind that I will be the winner of this competition.\" \"Yeah! In your freaking dreams maybe! We all know that I've got the goods here, I'm number one baby, I don't lose anything, ever. This kid will be creaming on my feet in no time, just you watch. Keep rubbing and keep licking!\" Espio chimes in, \"Just inhale my scent and you will know who is the true master that you desire\" his foot continues to caress your rod. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter what seems like hours, you finally are told to stop. You are completely hard as a rock. The two look at each other in competitive anger and then smile, Espio looks at you and says:<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The purple chameleon is the first to speak, \"It is now time for your second helping, my friend.\" Your heart practically leaps out of your mouth, only to be blocked and knocked back down into your chest by Jet's awaiting boot. \"Yeah! Get these things off me, I've been wearin' em all freakin' day!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are so excited that your hands fumble with their laces, not to mention the boys' playful prodding of your stiffened member cause your heart to skip beat after beat. Eventually you get one of Jet's boots off, \"Ha! I knew it, the kid love's <i>MY</i> feet more!\" Espio frowns slightly at you, but quickly smirks, \"Don't get ahead of yourself Jet, he still has two more rounds to go and I am more than confident that he will release his seed on my feet.\" \"Pffft Whatever dork. Heh I'll show you a good time guy,\" as Jet says this he plants his socked foot on the side of your face. The warmth and sweat coat your cheeks as the scent of pungent cheese wafts into your nose. \"Cream on my feet and you'll be servicing these babies and more...\" Jet winks at you alluringly, sliding his foot down your face, leaving an odorous trail behind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Jet teases you, you dutifully untie Espio's boot and the detective sighs with relief. Immediately a powerfully foul odor emits from the Chameleon's shoes, filling the room with their raw stench. \"Thank you friend, I've not taken my boots off for a <i>considerable</i> number of days.\" Espio mirrors Jet's actions, planting his foot on your cheek, you feel pre-cum begin to leak from the head of your excruciatingly hard member. Espio smiles and lets his foot do the rest of the talking for him, bringing it down to your waist and unfastening your pants with only his toes, <i>through</i> the stenchy fabric of his sock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You might as well dispense with your pants as we have dispensed with our boots.\" \"Heh, Yeah, fair is fair right?\" You feebly  nod and reach for your waistband, a booted foot pins your hand to your stomach. \"Ah ah ah, Forgetin' somethin'?\" The Green Hawk asks, smirking. You nod and quickly unlace the remaining boot on both boys, each unique smell further intensifying. \"Ahhh good boy.\" Jet teases as he begins to rub your face with his sock clad feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour world becomes topsy turvy as you are forced into a lying down position. You feel on of Espio's feet worm their way onto your face and you are assaulted by raunchy sole after raunchy sole rubbing itself on every square inch of your face. You then almost yelp in surprise as you feel your member get playfully kicked. You are given enough time to grab a quick breath of clean air and to hear a muffled \"Sorry\" as the feet begin to assault you all over once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling as if you haven't gotten enough of their feet, one of the boys commands you to open your mouth and stick out your tongue. You do as you are commanded and instantly they begin to run their fabric covered soles along your pink muscle, the taste is an overwhelmingly indescribable mixture of salty sweat, musk, fabric, boot leather and genuinely filthy socks, your eyes begin to water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, you feel a foot down south and before you can react, your pants are completely off. \"Woah! This kid is pitchin' one helluva tent here detective! Where did'ja find this guy?\" Espio merely chuckles and prods your hard member, you let out a moan. Espio smirks while Jet remarks, \"Heh, whose the <i>cock</i>-y one now? You think you can get one over on me?\" One of Jet's feet join Espio's foot already on your member and you let out a louder moan. The boys playfully trade insults as they begin to fondle your groin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJet lifts a foot off your face to look at you sternly, \"Hey! Sleepy-head, did'ja forget that you're s'posed to be massaging our feet too? Heh heh.\" You blush and attempt to find a foot in the fray whilst being stimulated all over. \"I think he deserves a bit of punishment for that\" Espio says, smiling. \"Heh, good idea Purple! I didn't peg you as the punishing kinda guy.\" \"Fair is fair, Right?\" Espio says with a glimmer in his eye. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey break for a few moments to consider your punishment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter little delineation, the two teenagers smirk at you with sly grins. Wordlessly they begin to slowly remove their socks, almost as if they wanted this to be your punishment. Your heart begins to beat faster, feeling as if they\u2019re going to tell you to go home after teasing you with a once in a lifetime opportunity to indulge in one of the greatest pleasures you could ever- !!<br>\r\nYour frantic thoughts are cut short by the feeling of wet cloth being shoved into your mouth, still agape from licking their socks. The putrid taste coats your tastebuds like an unfathomably potent perfume. You look at the boys, their socks now fully removed and ready to stuff your mouth. They then shove in the other three, forcing the fabric deeper and deeper towards the back of your throat. Soon all four pieces of fabric are wedged inside, your eyes water slighty as the chameleon and hawk duo laugh at your pitiful state. \u201cThat\u2019ll teach ya!\u201d Jet shouts triumphantly as a green foot is levelled at you. Espio follows up with \u201cYes, you should know better than to disobey a direct order from your betters little boy,\u201d the dominating tone creeping into his voice more and more as he too levels his own purple foot at your face...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You kneel before your masters with their feet on your face, socks in your mouth, your pants down and completely erect. \"Heh, it seems as if our friend is ready for the final event of our little game,\" the chameleon comments calmly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Yeah! He's gonna blow for me, I just know it! See this?\" Your member is playfully swatted by Jet's foot causing a jolt of pleasure mixed with anticipatory bracing, \"That's <i>ALL</i> for me!\" Espio snorts, \"Hmph, you've barely caused any of this, it is my feet he lusts after, and I will prove it, when I claim ownership of him.\" \"In your dreams detective.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The two continue to bicker as they smother your face with their feet, forcing you to inhale their cheesy, musky odor. Overall Jet's foot is quite rank, the smell of slick, fresh sweat, while not unpleasant, is extremely potent. Espio's foot on the other hand is very vinegary and surprisingly powerful, seemingly turning salty into a scent, mixed with a healthy amount of sharp cheese. You feel your member being toyed with and can't help but moan with pleasure. Not wanting to agitate the competitors, you reach your hands out to one of their feet and begin to massage it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Oooh! He finally remembered to start massagin'!\" The Hawk's voice calls out, half surprised and half beginning to relax. \"Hm, well enjoy the massage, I have bigger fish to fry.\" You feel dexterous toes begin to wrap themselves around your hard piece of meat, causing you to begin to leak precum. \"Hey! What's the big idea! You ain't playin' fair!\" Jet whines when seeing you enjoying yourself a bit too much for his tastes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Tactical advantage,\" The chameleon says calmly with a smile. To you he instructs, \"Now, my friend, remove the  socks from your mouth. I want you to start licking my foot.\" There's a cool edge to Espio's voice, deceptively quiet, yet overtly commanding, you do not dare disobey. You are able to choke the socks out of your throat, the taste (and residual lint) remaining heavily in your mouth. Your tongue plants itself on the sole of Espio's foot, the salty/ cheesy smell acting as pure flavor, dancing over your taste buds. You drag the muscle along his sole, slowly every inch of surface be touched. Espio shudders in delight and sideways smirks at Jet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 The hawk begins to fume, and his foot is ripped from your hand and you feel Espio's own foot shoved aside from your face, \"Alright Mr. Smartguy, here's how it's gonna go down, he's gonna lick <i>MY</i> feet and blow because of how awesome I am!\" The battle becomes intense as the two Mobians fight for your pleasure, or rather for you to pleasure them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You continue to dutifully lick and kiss Jet's feet as Espio uses his own to caress and coerce your member. You are absolutely baffled at the situation you find yourself in, at the mercy of two teens in a bid for ultimate dominance over you for a whole month. Your mind races with possibility and excitement at the thought of being beneath their feet, serving either one of them and surprisingly, for the first time, you feel the head of your member begin to leak with excitement. You attempt to look down, but your head is forced back by the powerful green feet in your face, covering your vision and air passages completely. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Who gave you permission to stop worshipin' my feet? Just for that\" Five green toes are shoved deep into your throat causing you to gag. Your tongue instinctively caresses the meaty digits that pry your mouth open and making it feel your jaw is stretching. The pain subsides as you moan, spittle coating every inch of Jet's toes as he pinches your tongue. \"Hehe, you're such a little freak enjoying this.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 More pre begins to leak out of the head of your penis. Espio smiles and uses it as a natural lubricant, coating your manhood with slickness and his own naturally sweaty feet. Jet notices this and shoves one of Espio's feet aside. \"Heh, time for the main event I see, FINALLY.\" Espio comments \"I'm not surprised it took this long with your roughly, Neanderthalic attacks.\" \"Well if he wasn't messin' around, I wouldn't hafta get rough with him!\" Espio merely sighs as the foot that was moved from your member returns to your face, manipulating and playing with your senses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 The amount of pleasure you feel at this moment is indescribable, from the feet on your face, the toes in your mouth, to the soles and toes caressing your cock, manipulating it with their heat and soft flesh on soft flesh, you are in heaven. Through this whole time you have been holding yourself from immediately letting go, wanting to enjoy the experience as much as possible, but the pleasure has finally increased tenfold to the point where you feel as if your are past the point of no return. You can feel the crescendo beginning within your lower belly, the pressure building within your balls and moving throughout your hardened member. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You feel more and more pre-cum beginning to release from your cock head, you moan in absolute pleasure, causing both boys to smile and reach their hands almost simultaneously down to their own members. Through light panting, Jet says \"C'mon, cum for me you little foot rag. You and me are gonna have a great time together.\" Espio merely smirks and says \"My feet are clearly superior and you know it, when I win, I will show you what a true master can only show his servants.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPanting and moaning, you feel your cock begin to throb, your hips begin to instinctively buck back and forth as the pressure builds and builds until finally...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Wow that was some game,\" you muse to yourself, starting to groggily open your eyes, \"I guess I must have over-done it... wait a minute, where am I?\" You think to yourself as you begin to take in your surroundings, you aren't in your room, in fact, you had no Idea what this place was. Looking around you see vials of liquid of various sizes and colors, beakers, burners, everything found in a standard laboratory, but something was off, you couldn't place it, but you felt like there was more than meets the eye to this place. You get up, your head pounding a tad, but you don't really notice it. You begin to explore the room, contraptions, gizmos and gadgets as well as pills of every shape and color, notebooks left open, you pause to read some of a journal entry, but it seems far too technical for you to comprehend without the owner of the book present. You also notice something else that's peculiar, there's orange fur everywhere... The guy (or girl) must own an orange pet of some sort, dog, cat, something of that nature. You take a further look around the lab, it's a pretty decent size and- wait... do you smell chili?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou allow the smell to carry you over to a table with a pot resting on a burner, it looks like the owner of the lab must've gotten a bit peckish, come to think of it, so were you... surely he wouldn't mind if you tasted a bit of the chili, right? You dip your finger into the stuff, it was pretty warm, not burning, but pretty warm. You raise your finger to your mouth to taste the chili and suddenly, YOUR MOUTH IS ON FIRE! Your tongue feels like it's shriveling up from the severe burning that it's getting, you then look at a note that says \"Let extra hot chili cool, unbearable spice; in event that chili too hot, White beaker beside pot with nullifying agent.\" How considerate of this person to leave something to cool off your tongue with, but there were three white beakers!! You decide to risk it as the pain in your mouth was becoming too great, so you grab all three beakers and down them. Bad Decision.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe room spins and suddenly you feel as if you are free falling, all you can tell from what's going on is that you are heading for that pot of chili and you try to brace yourself against the table, but instead find that you are above the chili, shrunken and fall straight into it with a plop. You are disoriented and the chili is like a warm bath bordering on slightly hot, but you manage to swim to the surface. You try not to get anymore chili in your mouth, but you can't help it, there's just to much of it, fearing the worst you gulp a little bit of it down, and surprisingly, your mouth isn't on fire! It seems as if the neutralizing agent worked after all. You're treading \"water\" when you hear a slightly familiar voice say \"Hurry up and get that chili ready, bud, I'm starving!\" there's a response that comes from a much younger sounding voice that jars you when you hear the reply, \"Okay Sonic!\" There's no way that you could have heard that right? Sonic? The Hedgehog? He' was just a video game character for crying out loud!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure enough you see the gigantic muzzle of Miles \"Tails\" Prower high above the chili pot. \"Mmmmm\" His voice booms, \"Smells good, Sonic! I think the chili is just right!\" This sends you into a frenzy, you try your hardest and yell your loudest at the towering fox-boy but all his response is an involuntary twitch in his ear. You feel the pot being lifted like a giant elevator, and then carried into another room, \"I think everyone is going to love my chilidogs for the cook-off Sonic!\" Tails says with a great amount of joy, \"Good deal bud, as long as I get first taste, you could come in any place and I would still go back for seconds, your chili is to die for.\" That last bit made you greatly uncomfortable...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout twenty minutes later you could hear voices, music, laughing and see the open sky, it was a clear blue day and nothing was going to halt this cook-off, unfortunately for you. Soon it was time, you hear \"...and Tails has come up with this secret recipe in just the last few months?\" A female voice asks, Sounding like Amy Rose, a male voice sounding like Knuckles the Echidna answers, \"Yeah he said it was so hot, that he had to create a special drink to cool your mouth down.\" \"Wow! I don't envy Shadow right about now.\" Shadow? Why Shadow? Isn't he supposed to hate all of this? Wait, did Amy say she didn't envy him for... eating... the... Chili. The moment had come, a shouting voice could be heard from a distance, \"ALRIGHT CONTESTANTS, YOU MAY NOW BRING YOUR CHILI DOGS TO THE JUDGE'S BOOTH\" you couldn't believe it, in one day your life had gone from playing video games and being relatively normal sized to being shrunken and about to die... Just great.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon a gigantic Ladle descended into the pot and as hard as you tried, you could not escape its range, again you were on an elevator ride from hell, in great smelling chili. You then fell onto an enormous hot dog on a plate that was carried to what you could assume as the \"Judges Booth\" where you first laid your eyes on him: Shadow the Hedgehog. Black and Red fur, Red eyes with dark pupils, with a white tuft of fur growing out of his chest, truly a magnificent sight to behold... that is, if you weren't about to be eaten. He stares down at the chili covered hot dog with slight disdain, \"Remind me, why am I doing this again?\" He asks, turning to the Blue hedgehog, whose mouth was practically watering at the sight of the hot dog, \"Because, We need an impartial judge and who's more of a loner than you, buddy?\" Shaking his head and grunting a bit, the black hedgehog mutters \"whatever,\" as he reaches for your prison. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe takes it into his hands and smells it before deciding it was okay to eat and slowly opens his maw. You try to get up from your position, but swimming in that chili for half an hour killed your muscles, not to mention the free fall and everything leading up to this moment. You enter the dark cavern that is Shadow's mouth, warm breath washes over you. You are terrified for your life as the two rows of giant white pillars pierce through your vessel as if it were no more than tissue paper. You find new energy to jump off of the hotdog and onto his tongue, you feel its slippery surface beneath you, salivating, tasting and maneuvering to get every bit of flavor from the chewed up food. You then get mixed up in saliva and hotdog meat, trying to avoid the chompers as best you can. Good news, you make it through in one piece, bad news, Shadow is swallowing the chunks of hot dog and chili. You are forced to the back of Shadow's throat along with the meat, muscles contracting and expanding every which way, dragging you down, down, down, further and further until you end up on top of your old buddy, piece of hot dog, floating on a sea of stomach acid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are able to at least find some comfort in the fact that you are now in the belly of a video game character and are about to be digested right? You wait for a few moments and then...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>*ThiCommission by 21Parrots, Sorry for the long delay* <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou suddenly realize that the bit of hotdog is receding into the pool of stomach juices, it truly is a weird sight to see.. come to think of it, how are you able to be seeing this right now? Wouldn't it be pitch black? Either way, you don't care, you've resigned yourself to this fate, so you just wait for it, relaxing a little before you have to tread acids, you even are close your eyes and drift to sleep, floating comfortably on the hot dog. When you wake up you realize you are still floating, you look and sure enough your body is floating on top of the acid, it feels slimy, a gooier consistency than water, which makes it easier to stay on top of. Soon enough however you begin to notice that your skin is slowly starting to feel looser, which causes you some alarm, but it doesn't hurt oddly enough. You chuckle to yourself, make this is some dream and you'll wake up, fresh as a daisy and in one piece... you know in your heart of hearts this isn't true, but it does give you some hope. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly you realize something, your leg! It just floated to the top of the acid sea... you didn't even feel it. You look down in wonder as little by little you start to float in different directions, how gruesome, yet intriguing and never painful... Slowly however you start to sink, and your eyelids become droopier, heavier, you just want to fall asleep, you feel the acid envelope your head, funny, you don't even have to breathe anymore, just let yourself sink into the darkness, your last thought before you slip into unconsciousness is that you led a great life, you can also say that you were the first human to pass on in this way. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><div align=\"center\">The End?</div></b> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome time later you wake up.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"What the hell?\" You think to yourself, \"I died, I know I did, I saw myself dissolve and everything, how am I still here? Is...is this the afterlife?\" Everything around you is completely black, you feel as if you're floating in empty space. You try to look around but feel as if you're fixed in one spot. Slowly your senses begin to return to you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst you are greeted with feeling, wherever you were, you were tightly compacted against a cottony blanket of some sort and something else that you couldn't really describe you felt as though you were one form, shapely yet shapeless, your arms and legs stretched above you, or were they below you? The next sense that returned was your taste, a salty, briny taste began to form, but where, you couldn't be certain... odd, it was as if you weren't using your mouth to taste anymore, but rather your whole body was able to taste at the same time, you also felt really sticky and wet... what the hell was going on? As you thought the question to yourself you began to realize that your sense of smell was beginning to return, a pungent yet pleasing, cheesy odor began to permeate your body, you tried to inhale more but found that that was impossible since you had nothing to smell with, however more of the smell began to wave over your intensely warm body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next sense to return was your hearing and what you heard was the muffled voice of Tails and Shadow, they sounded somewhat far away but very close. The pair was conversing about Tails' Chilidogs, Shadow accusing Tails of undercooking the chili, as he was having a slight stomach ache, but tails assured him that the chili was prepared very carefully, that the hotdogs must have been to blame, Shadow was unconvinced but let the fox off the hook with a warning, \"Tails, I swear to mobius, if any part of that chili got me sick, you will not like what I have in store for you...\" You could hear the tension in the air, but Tails swiftly dodged the threat as he turned Shadow's attention to another matter, one about his feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour ears perked up, you always did have a fascination with the details of Sonic characters' feet and you wanted to know if you could get in on the action somehow, once you figured out where you were... \"You said your feet were also aching?\" the fox boy asked cautiously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I know you're not a podiatrist, but...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh don't worry about that\" tails said, cutting off the black hedgehog, \"I have read thousands of medical books cover to cover as well as mechanical studies... heh, I have to have my hobbies, right?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShadow didn't know what to make of that so he just grunted, \"Well... take a look.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as Shadow said \"Take a look,\" your world was flipped upside down in more ways than one, light nearly blinded you, you physically were up ended and you figured out where you were all at the same time. Somehow, in some way, by some weird or cruel joke, you were staring up into the giant faces of Shadow the Hedgehog and Miles Prower, and scarily enough, the more you looked around, the more you got it, you weren't just close to Shadow, you had been transformed into his entire foot! If you had any way to, you would have screamed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTails' face got right next to you, you could swear you saw his nostrils flare and his eyes light up when he got close to you, but you couldn't be sure. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well Shadow, it does look like they're a bit swollen, have you been stung by anything recently?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, the only thing out of the ordinary is this damn hot dog eating competition... What do you recommend I do... Tails?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n In all your years you never would have guessed that out of all the places you had been that this would have been where you ended up, actually hearing Shadow the hedgehog be civil to another person while you were somehow, as if by magic, turned into his foot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, Shadow, I think the best thing for you would be to take it easy, maybe stay off it for a few days, ice it? Do you mind if I collect a few samples and run some tests to see what's wrong?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jeeze Tails its only a swollen foot, but fine, you're the doctor, of sorts, here...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFaster than you or shadow could perceive, Tails had his equipment out and was swabbing your sweat and taking a few flakes, the sensation tickled you and Shadow actually let out a small giggle, to which Tails froze and he covered his mouth with his hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Breathe one word and I swear fox...\" Tails only could nod. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShadow then proceeded to cover you back up with his shoe and his sock and wordlessly left Tails, you began to feel the Earth rise and fall rhythmically, your sensations of tasting, smelling and feeling are kicked into high gear as shadow begins to run, you start feeling warmer and warmer and sweatier and <br>\r\nsweatier, You are loving every second of it, you feel yourself starting to get aroused, unsure of how that is even possible, but you feel yourself starting to slowly inflate, something inside you building up, but you have no idea how to release, the shoe is starting to become tighter and then it happens... after you cant hold it anymore, the feeling shoots out of you and up through shadows' leg, it then causes him to slow down and stop, he takes you out of your prison and you see that you are in....<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The orgasmic smell permeates through the entire length of your body while the glove like feeling of the blue blur's absolutely smelly socks rubbing against your hard cock brings out the feeling of a profound arousal one could only dream of achieving. The feeling only gets better as with one slight twitch of his legs Sonic's toes spread wide open, releasing more of the aphrodisiac that is his sweet, sweet foot odor. \" How long has it been since we last did this ?\" You shutter out as the sensation of the socks massaging your face and underwear grows somewhat tiresome, leading to your ultimate decision of unsheathing your rock hard member into the open. \" I'm not so sure\" Sonic finally responds with \" but it seems to be that you've waited quite a while for your next fix.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDroplets of pre cum begin to ooze on to the hedgehog's warm and damp socks, and that's when the real fun began. Eyeing your stiffened cock with a surprised look upon his face, Sonic decided to let his socks loose and leave his bare feet within your lap. \" Whaddya wanna do now ?\" His cheerful voice sounds out as he could clearly feel the hottest load of spunk the two of you had never experienced before build up exponentially \" Are you gonna finish or are you just too afraid to let it release ? I honestly don't mind either of the two choices.\" The little hedgehog sharply remarks. Your brain is quickly brought back to reality as the decision determines whether or not you finally let one out on to your idol's precious feet or keep the contained heaven inside your body for a while longer. The choice is your to make.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

That's actually pretty cool ! And, um, flattering.\". As you stare at the floor, you notice that Sonic's shoes and socks remain as dormant as ever.

Come on get into it! Get that tongue of yours to work!</span>\" he commands. Intimidated and being pushed into the sneaker you start kissing and licking his shoe clean, picking up all kinds of dirt along the way.

He then lifted his other foot off your head and pushed it into your face \"<span class=\"cblue\">Other shoe mutt!</span>\" \"Yes master!\" you then began giving the same treatment to his other sneaker, after you cleaned it he pushed you off his feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cblue\">Good boy!

Lick!</span>\" \"Yes master!\" you respond, crawling forward and pressing your face against the sole of shoe, once again you could feel the movement of his foot but this time you felt it through the worn out sole of the sneaker, you then extended your tongue out of your mouth and licked his shoe from toes to heel. You continued licking his sole, getting all the dirt you can, all the time sonic laughing and taunting you. He then kicks you a little and switches legs, \"<span class=\"cblue\">Here you go boy, master knows what's good for you, now eat up all the dirt from the other shoe!</span>\" Sonic says having a ball \"Yes master\" you press your lips to the filthy sole of his other shoe and begin licking once more. \"<span class=\"cblue\">All the dirt, grass, everything I stepped in, and you licking it, you're lower than that dirt on my sole you know buddy? You should be thankful that I'm letting you touch that dirt, let alone lick it! Come on be a good dog and thank me</span>\" you swallow some dirt and your dignity \"Than-Thank you master\" Sonic smiles \"<span class=\"cblue\">That's a good dog</span>\".

You feel a certain kind of peace, oddly enough even though this teenager is forcing you to be his lapdog, you can't help but feel that he is becoming your everything. He then breaks the tension by saying, \"So ol' Eggy thought he could send a crony to come steal my kicks, eh?\" What was he talking about? You had no idea, you couldn't even respond, just helplessly stare into his eyes, getting lost into a dream-like trance. \"Well, if you want to see them so bad, why don't you get a closer look?\" Saying that, you can't help but feel that his voice has gotten somehow... louder? And wasn't he shorter than you? Why were you now standing eye level with him? Your clothes also began to feel looser as well. You then come to a horrifying conclusion, he wasn't bigger than you, at least not until now. You are starting to get smaller and smaller by the second, first you were a few heads taller than he was, then eye level, your clothes now looking two sizes too big for your body. As you shrink his big black nose pokes at you mockingly, you then pass his signature, cheeky grin, boy his teeth sure looked sharp, further down you shrink, your clothes becoming baggier and harder to keep on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou arrive at chest level, then bellybutton, it looks like a cavern! By this point your clothes have slipped off, exposing your (admittedly rock hard) dwindling member at this moment you come to his own package, Wait! This is Sonic, how could he have that? It didn't matter for long, because soon you were thigh high, as you dwindled down into the sea of your own clothes. You shrink to his knees, and look up into his eyes, his cock slowly coming out of its sheath with excitement, yours still doing the same, \"Why don't you hurry up, we've got a lot of 'playing' to do.\" He said with a boyish giggle, causing you to blush. Now you were level with his shins, and by sheer curiosity you look down to what waited below, his feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou would be lying if you said you never wondered in your life what Sonic's feet looked like, little knowing that you would experience them first hand. Well they seemed anxious to meet you, as they were rising by the minute, growing higher and higher, bigger and bigger, soon you were level with his ankles and you disappear into your sea of clothing, everything getting darker and darker. You assume that you are now no bigger than Sonic's little toe. The boy himself was now a titan compared to you, an insect, far below his stature. \"Well now, little man, let's say you and Righty get acquainted.\" and with that, his giant form bent over, reaching down and (surprisingly) gently pinching you between two enormous gloved fingers and retrieved you from your clothes. In his left hand he held the famous red and white sneaker that you could smell from where you were, suspended thousands of feet (to you, in reality about 4 feet) above the ground. He then proceeds to move you closer to the giant sneaker, dangling you above for a few seconds, enough for him to say, \"Fasten your seatbelts, it's about to become a stinky ride.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ride down is intense.<br>\r\nIt's a free fall that takes all of ten seconds, but to you takes a lifetime. Hurtling down towards the undeniably wet insole, nothing to restrain you from smashing like a droplet of water on pavement during a rainfall, which is essentially what you are, but nonetheless, you're afraid for you life. You think that this is it, you close your eyes as the insole starts coming up faster and faster and then... SPLAT. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm dead,\" Your first thought is, \u201cThere's no possible way I could have survived that.\" You felt nothing when you hit the ground, well good news for you, you aren't dead! The cushion of the insole and your tiny frame makes it highly unlikely that you would die from being crushed or, well, you know... Splattered. You then wearily stand up on shaky legs and look up outside of the shoe to the giant smiling face of your world. \"I wouldn't put you in harm's way little guy, even if you were trying to steal my kicks, there's no way I could be that cold, it wouldn't be *heh* cool.\" You smile at Sonic and then it hits you, the foulest aroma emanating from not just the floor, but all around you, did he wash his shoes in foot sweat? Surprisingly though, you can't help but enjoy the scent, you actually like Sonic's foul aroma, now that you're covered in it \"Well little man,\" You hear the voice above say, \"It's time to meet your roommate.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then feel the floor give out in the biggest elevator ride you've been a part of, Sonic was lowering his shoe to the ground. You tumble towards the front of his shoe and then see a scene from a horror movie. Five gargantuan toes make their way into the sneaker, slowly wiggling their way in, moving the whole shoe about and you with it, tossing you everywhere, and getting mouthful after mouthful of stale sweat. At first it's vile and you wretch from the disgusting liquid, but like the smell, you realize you love it. His shoe then upends and you are thrown into his toes, which welcome you with open *ahem* arms. Then they squeeze around you like a giant bear hug, caking your naked body and every orifice with sweat, either this is heaven or hell, you would have to ask Sonic later, \"Aww you wanted to say hi,\" Comes a cooing from above, \"I'm glad that you are all getting along,\" he says as the shoe fits into place, \"because we are going for a bit of a run and you might wanna get busy.\" he says with that cute giggle of his.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe takes off and when he does, with every foot fall, you find yourself in a new position, under the sole, on top of the foot, between the toes, back in the heel, around the ankles and so on and so forth for two hours \"a bit of a run\" your ass, that's a marathon! The friction is causing your tiny member hell to no content, you feel like you could explode at any moment and then it happens. Sonic starts to slow down and you wind up between his big and second toes, which he then begins to rub together, exploring every inch of your body, and stopping for a moment when he comes across your erection. You blush and not that you could see it, he does too, \"D- do you actually like, like this?\" A few moments of silence and then Sonic sez... (Just kidding,) Says....<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Your world is turned upside down once again as something merciful happens, the foot is being removed from the shoe! You try your hardest to get unstuck and maybe find a way to escape, but your work comes to no avail, as the sweat and toe jam act as a super adhesive, cementing your body to the putrid foot-flesh not to mention to two pillars that you were stuck between. Soon you are blinded by bright light as you leave the dark depths of the smelly prison, you realize that you are in a place that is unfamiliar to you, which you assume to be the house that belongs to the giant himself, who at this moment is staring at you with those big green eyes of his, just watching your every move, studying you it would seem as you take in your new surroundings. His voice booms like thunder, no longer muffled by the shoe, \"Welcome to my humble abode, it's not every day that I get to introduce someone like you around, but we can get to that later, I think I know what you're craving,\" Did he actually believe you were enjoying this torture? You start shaking your head violently, pounding on his flesh walls, but he seemed to either be willfully ignorant of what you wanted, or actually believed what he said, Well, he did say he wouldn't hurt you, and couldn't if he wanted to, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the moment, Sonic was standing in the middle of a giant living room, a fully furnished, rectangular living area, complete with multiple arm chairs, a tv mounted on the outer wall, and across from the tv, a huge red couch and a coffee table in front of it, a nice large hardwood table. Sonic began to lift his foot, making you believe that he was just kidding about that talk about 'playing,' turns out, (Surprise) you were wrong! His foot then descends like a giant rollercoaster into the ground, causing his fleshy toes to squeeze their disgusting odor into you just a bit more. Foot fall after foot fall brings him toward the couch, which he promptly plops down on, while setting his feet upon the table in front of it. He then shakes his foot slightly and you are broken free into a fall onto the table. The landscape is massive, there was no way you could escape even if you tried, it would take the better part of a day to walk from the couch to the television, let alone go outside. You are broken from your trance by Sonic, clearing his throat. This is the first time you've gotten a proper look at him since you were shrunken, he is gargantuan! You start at the feet and slowly make your way up his body towards his smiling face, You already were acquainted with his feet, His legs stretch for miles, his manhood still clear as the day, his belly is a more creamy flesh color as are his arms, then you reach his face, playful, innocent looking with a hint of mischief hidden behind it, you would be happy to be here if you were your normal size, but you aren't, now are you?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, I think I'd like for you to smell my feet, maybe give them a bit of a rub, start at the heel and work your way up,\"  he sounded as if he were nonchalantly ordering lunch! \"Also, maybe sneak in a few kisses, I won't tell you where, just surprise me,\" he adds with that devilish smirk of his, you could tell he was getting off on this in some fashion because, well it was right there to see. Not wanting to upset the giant, you sigh and set off to his right heel, of whom, you've already met. His single foot towers tall above you, ending in five toes, it's like looking at the stature of liberty from up close. \"I'm waiting,\" you hear him say, giggling. God damn that giggle, you think as you flip him off from behind his gross foot. You get to work, kneading the soft, yet firm flesh of his heel, you hear a soft moan come from the bigger boy, \"that feels pretty good, I think you could do a bit better and don't forget, it does have a scent...\" his voice trails off as you keep going, but as you get to the top of his heel, the foot starts quickly lowering down onto you, faster than you can react, the boy's foot is once again on top of you, this time is has you pinned, \"Sorry, but I thought this would be a better motivator and a little more helpful since you're so tiny, you'll be fine though, there's enough air under there,\" the muffled voice says, softly adding \"I think,\" to the end of the sentence. You admit it's now easier to reach the flesh, but you now have to worm your way between wood and foot, \"Ooh, that feels good, keep doing that\" you hear and you realize that your job may have gotten slightly easier, your wiggling seemed to have the same effect as your hands over a greater area... gross, you think you yourself, but you have no choice. You then start smelling his foot, choking on the fumes, making your eyes start to water, \" Now's probably a good time to mention,  I haven't showered in like a week, so...uh, don't pay it any mind,\" he says a bit nervous, not only is he making you massage his stinky foot, he also hasn't even bothered to wash the damn things, this day just keeps getting better and better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are now about halfway \"up\" his foot, squirming around, up and down giving him the best massage you can at this stature when you hear, \"I've not felt any kissing yet.\" To which you muster up the strength to purse your lips together and actually kiss his foot. Immediately you start wrenching from the salty, slimy grime that is his sole, \"Much better, a few more of those and we're all set,\" You curse the hedgehog a thousand times, but keep going, moving all over the rest of his foot, occasionally planting a kiss when you weren't burning your nose hairs with smelling. Eventually you make it to the toes, going faster and faster, knowing that fresh air and daylight await you. Sonic does something you weren't expecting, his foot becomes restless and he begins to play with your tiny form. Rolling you around the coffee table like a ball, causing his foot to sweat and cover you some more in goopy sweat. He stops and you end up in the middle of his foot \"Ooops, I totally didn't mean that, but while you're there, why don't you give it a once over, huh bud?\" if insults could kill.. well you would probably die from starvation under this hedgehog's foot, because he would be dead first. You do as instructed and eventually make your way back to the toes, you then pop up in between the two smallest toes, covering yourself in toejam. \"Ah great, you're now ready to move onto the last part,\" your host says, as if you've won some fabulous prize, \"I'd like for you to clean up between my toes and give them a good smell, make sure you pay special attention to the toe webbing.\" Is he joking? Apparently not because he claps twice and says \"Off you go.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou do your best, but he doesn't make it easy. You get to work in between his little and fourth toe, this has the least amount of toe jam, you hesitate at first causing the voice from above to say, \"I don't feel anything, Did ya fall asleep down there? Make sure you get your nose in there too\" you bury your face into the toe webbing, you run your tongue all along the flesh, even going so far as to wrap your head in the disgusting flesh breathing in its putrid scent. Immediately you begin to retch, almost vomiting you have to move away to catch your breath. Sonic laughs, \"Ahh man, that's sick, Remember when I told ya I hadn't bath in a while? You must love this, getting to kiss these beauties, How do they smell?\" He asks, knowing full well he'd never hear you, \"I bet they smell like moldy old cheese that's been sitting in the sun, that's what they smell like from up here anyway! I can't imagine what you're going through.\" You start the same process of clearing the toe jam on the next two toes, then practically using the webbing of his toes as a blanket, inhaling its scent, the soft flesh sweating all around you, covering you in its stink, while you begrudgingly lap at the flesh not wanting to upset your giant keeper. The second and third toe is where the toe jam has started to really build up and you are working to clean it when all of a sudden, you are knocked onto the table, to the sound of giggling, you look up and Sonic's face feigns innocence, \"Wasn't me, must've been righty's fault, He's anxious to get his bath you know.\" You go back to work to be knocked over a second time. You finish the job, then move onto the webbing as you had twice already, taking in the deep scent, causing you to nearly vomit as you massage the toe flesh and clean it with your dry tongue. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy now you have a pretty sizeable pile of toe jam. When your back is turned, you feel a force knock you face first into the pile of toe jam. You are steamed, because not only is your neat pile ruined, but because you were forced to eat some of the vile jelly. You sit, listening to the gleeful sounds of giggling above, you take a second to cool off. You then you hear \"Come on, I haven't got all day, lefty is waiting for her turn too. Or would you prefer a little more, 'south of the border, fun'?\" You shudder to think about spending any more time around Sonic's feet, but you don't even want to know what he means by \"South of the border fun,\" suddenly you realize there are two blue toes on either side of your body that close in on you, wrapping you up in the webbing between the toes, you try screaming but foot flesh forces its way into your mouth. You can't tell where you are until his toes release their grip on you. You then see....</span></div></div>",

You begin to dream. In your dream you are in a house unfamiliar to you. The room is Mildly furnished with two hammocks, one raised over the other, almost like bunk beds, a lamp, and a couple of corner tables, but what catches your eye is the figure in the middle of the room. A large brown sheet is covering what you assume is a reclined chair. \"Why would you be covered up?\" You wonder out loud. At that moment you notice something odd, Your voice! It's different somehow, more carefree/ with a slight nasal tone to it. You think nothing of it, walking closer to the mysterious sheet, reaching out towards it, you notice that your arm is blue, and you are wearing gloves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pull back quickly to look down and sure enough, the other arm is the same, as are the legs, with each foot covered by a bright red sneaker, leaving your belly exposed! \"Holy Cow!\" You say to yourself, \"I'm Sonic the freaking Hedgehog!\" You then look to the sheet, which is moving now, and you hear a familiar  voice, \"of course you are, who else would you be?\" You move toward the sheet and pull it off, to reveal Tails! His arms and legs are tied to the chair, which looks more like a table to you. \"Tails, what's going on?\" You ask, \" Well, you were just about to tickle me!\" He says excitedly. This sounded too good to be true, but you decide that you would take the task with gusto, \"Now where are you going to tickle me?\" You just now realize that tails doesn't have shoes or gloves on, which provide many good areas to tickle...</span></div></div>",

Tails smirk grows downright smug at hearing that. He kicks off his shoes and pulls off his socks, sighing again. His feet are all hot and sweaty from all that exercise. You can smell their scent clearly an it makes you want them all over again. He was finally going to let you!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good! Now as a reward, you get to relax my feet any way you want. Get to it!\"</span></div></div>",

You start by grabbing both of Tails's feet and sniffing the fresh scent right away. They smell is incredible and each sniff arouses you greater and greater. You then shove your nose underneath Tails's toes and begin sniffing, where all the sweat and crud builds up along with between his toes. The scent is even stronger there than it was on his smooth sexy soles. You also realize that as you were sniffing, some of his footsweat ended up on your face. You can't resist anymore, you want to taste his feet, his footsweat, his toe jam so bad. You start lapping at his soles; they taste salty and incredible. The taste starts building up your arousal greatly now, greater than it did when sniffing. While all of this is happening, Tails is just watching you with a dominant grin on his face He is also being turned on by your submission to his feet and starts rubbing his re-stiffening cock. You start licking in the creases beneath his toes and in between them as well, dying to taste the plethora of sweat and toe jam and any other crud gathered within. You swallow everything your tongue gathers; toe jam, sweat, dirt, everything on his feet. You begin sucking his toes gathering any salty sweat gathered on them. Tails watches how aroused you are and notices your cock, which is as hard as a metal pole by now. Tails withdraws his feet from you, making you sad, since you haven't gotten completely off to them yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enjoy that, bitch?\" he asks teasingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can only nod in approval, you are left speechless as a result of how fast your heart is beating right now. You then stay on all fours and bow your head to Tails in submission. You whimper a bit, wishing you could have kept worshipping his feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww, you're sad because you still want them?\" he teases mockingly, while wiggling his toes dripping of your own saliva at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I do want them, please..\" you respond weakly, nearly to the point of begging.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, if you want them, you're gonna have to do better than that!\" Tails demands dominantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Beg for them! Show me how much you truly love them! Show me WHY I should let you have them! DO IT!\" he says, pinning your face to the floor by pinning the back of your head with his foot.</span></div></div>",

Tails still has your head pinned down with his foot so your face is to the floor. While staring at the floor, you plead to him<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"PLEASE! Pleeeaaaase!!\" you desperately plead, on the verge of tears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, what?\" Tails asks teasingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please let me have your feet! Please let me worship them, but most importantly, let me worship YOU! I promise! I'll do ANYTHING!\" you cry out to him from beneath his foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why should I?\" Tails responds tauntingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because I love your feet! I really do! I love them so much, they're so sexy, they're so hot, they're so PERFECT!\" you beg as tears start rolling down your cheeks. You even kiss the top of his other foot that isn't on our head a couple of times. All you can do is stare at the floor as you await a reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm... Stay just like that, don't move a muscle. I'll be right back.\" you hear Tails say as you feel the pressure on the back of your head suddenly go away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hear him put his shoes back on, but not his socks as you can see them still lying on the floor out of the corner of your eye. He then leaves the room and you hear the heavy weight of his shoes against the floor. All you can do is wonder what he is doing and what will happen once he returns; will he finally let you cum? Will he let you worship him even longer? Will he trample you again?<br>\r\nAbout five minutes later, you hear his footsteps coming closer. He's back. You heart starts to pick up its pace. He sits down in his seat again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, get on your knees.\" he says to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout responding, you do as he says. He is still wearing his shoes but he looks slightly sweaty. He is holding a leash in one hand and a pink collar in the other. He snaps the collar around your neck, which even has a silver dog tag on the front. He clips the leash to the front of the collar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell me what you think, my pet.\" Tails says in a degrading way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou flip the dog tag over and it reads \"Foot bitch\". Despite the humiliation, you feel excited because the tag can only confirm that you are going to be worshiping Tails's feet even more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I love it.\" you respond softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good!\" Tails exclaims in his classic cheery voice, which actually surprises you. \"Now lay on your back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou lay on your back, your rock hard erection standing up vertically. Tails then tugs on the leash, forcing your head to come up. With this, he kicks off his shoes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heheh, hope you like 'em smelly, foot bitch!\" he says as he presses one against your face, with your nose right beneath his toes. \"I ran out to go get the leash and collar and decided not to wear my socks so my feet could stink even more!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou inhale the scent, which was incredibly strong, stronger than you even smelt it earlier. Not wearing socks in his run definitely made his feet unbearably smellier and sweatier but it was heaven to you. He begins grinding his foot against your face, leaving fresh sweat all over your face. After that, he takes his other foot and shoves nearly half of it in your mouth, leaving the taste of fresh salty sweat all over your mouth and tongue. He also had a lot of toe jam and more crud between his toes, which you swallowed along with his sweat. He takes the foot he previously used to grind against your face and grips your twitching erection his big toe and second toe. The sudden sensation on your cock catches you by surprise and you flinch. As you keep sucking on his toes, he massages your erection with his toes, pre beginning to ooze out and drip onto Tails's toes and even lubricate your cock. You begin moaning in unbelievable bliss as you can feel you climax coming closer. You keep on doing your job and sucking and cherishing Tails's foot as you breaking point nears. Suddenly, Tails picks up the pace with his foot, stroking your member, he shoves even more of his foot into your mouth so now you are nearly deepthroating his toes. You feel yourself tense up and suddenly, your orgasm happens. You cum harder than you've ever came before, and your shrieks of pleasure are muffled by Tails's toes still receiving treatment. You feel like you are going to pass out as a result of the shock from your orgasm. You cum more and more, getting it all over Tails's foot. When your orgasm finally ends you lay flat on your back shivering from the shockingly incredible orgasm. Tails tugs on your leash again so you are sitting up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Open your mouth!\" he grunts, turns out he was stroking himself off as well as he cums all over your face, some shots landing in your mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hope you enjoyed that, foot bitch! Now you can...</span></div></div>",

You definitely are no longer in your own home, you've been transported via Tails' device. You turn you head to see the large red and white sneakers that immediately give you a bit of a shock. You look at the side of the shoe and immediately realize that your height barely crests where leather meets rubber.The brainy boy, that now towers high above you like a skyscraper, is looking at his device with a mixture of pride and absolute glee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"<span class=\"cborange\">I did it! I did it! I DID IT!!</span>\" The mobius-renowned twin appendages seem to wag happily, faster and faster until he begins to hover in  the air with excitement, generating strong gusts of wind that nearly fling you across the room. Tails shouts, \"<span class=\"cborange\">I can't believe it, I successfully harnessed Chaos energy! The ramifications of this alone will help create new methods of transport, who knows what else can be discovered with-</span>\" The boy is cut short when he looks down and sees your little body, struggling to stand against the air current. He immediately drops to the ground with a hard thud, getting on his hands and knees to inspect you. \"<span class=\"cborange\">Wh-what... I don't understand. How is this possible? You were normal sized when we warped!</span>\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The fox seems a bit rattled by this new discovery and carefully picks you up, depositing you into the palm of his gloved hand. He gingerly uses a large finger to poke and prod you. Despite this being a dream come true, you feel a bit indignant of being looked at and manipulated like a little toy. \"Easy, Easy!\" you say. The fox gets a quizzical look across his face. With his free hand, he goes to the messy kitchen table, locating a notepad amongst a sea of parts and wires. You could be lost for hours or days if you accidentally fell in. The boy sets the grid-style notepad on a stable part of the mess, sets you on it and grabs a pencil and a ruler. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0A look of determination sets on his face and his tongue sticks out a bit. \"<span class=\"cborange\">Lie down please.</span>\" You do as he asks and the pencil begins to move quickly. \"<span class=\"cborange\">Now on your side.</span>\" You again follow his instructions as he measures you, scribbling down notes and equations. When he is finished, he sighs. \"<span class=\"cborange\">Always something new to figure out isn't there?</span>\" You look up at him and he pulls a chair over. He looks at you with his piercingly blue eyes, studying you. After a few moments of uneasy silence, you pipe up, \"Um, so what do we do?\" The boy blinks and shakes his head, a smile returning to his face. \"<span class=\"cborange\">Well, there are positives and negatives here. Positive: Your diminished size has altered the volume of your voice, but not to the point where it is impossible to hear you. You also are completely intact, there have been no mutations further than what I can only attribute to matter readjustment. Now is the sticky situation, You have been diminished to an inch tall, relative to your previous size and I have no idea why or how this has occurred.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0A moment passes. \"So I'm stuck like this.\" You ask cautiously. The giant nods, his smile is sympathetic, but unwavering. \"<span class=\"cborange\">The bright side here is that A: You have now become my responsibility and B: I know that you're more than okay with that.</span>\" He chuckles a bit. \"<span class=\"cborange\">But!</span>\" He hops up from his chair excitedly, \"<span class=\"cborange\">This presents a whole new range of options for us to explore and new theories to be tested. And, in the best way possible, you have become my new project.</span>\" He smiles and picks you up again. \"<span class=\"cborange\">So, for the time being, what would you like to do? We have the rest of the day to ourselves.</span>\" You think for a bit and say:</span></div></div>",

You talk with him as you eat and it turns out that he is actually a pretty nice guy. He tells you all about different worlds and how he must've miscalculated something to end up here. And as he was telling you all about his travels your eyes couldn't help but wander off from his face straight to his huge shoes. You really quickly realized that you had thing for his feet.

Look who has a thing for my feet\" He must've read your mind! \"I umm... well... I...\" you start to nervously sweat, you looked down at the floor embarrassed \"Hey, no need to feel embarrassed!

You instantly turn around while feeling shivers down your spine, a gigantic familiar face was looking down at you with a big smile. It was Tails stunning you with his enormous view, which made it even harder for you to get up. \"Come on little guy there is no reason to be scared, I brought you here to run some experiments on you\" Tails explained. \"E-e-experiments?\" you stuttered nervously. Tails moved the hand you were in further down and placed you carefully on a nearby table. He could almost see his entire body from your viewpoint. It was shocking yet impressive how gigantic everything was. \"Yes I needed a human for this experiment so I hope you don't mind helping me. Sorry for shrinking you without your permission but I had a very small window of opportunity so yeah... But to make up for that I let you decide who gets to do the experiment on you.\" Tails added blushing a bit.<br>\r\nSince you are already into this world you decide that the experiment shall be done by...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

So you decided to have Sonic run the experiment on you.<br>\r\n\"Well I would like Sonic to do the experiment on me if you don't mind\" You answered nervously. <br>\r\n\"No problem little guy, infact Sonic might be the best choice for the experiment\" Tails replied. He went over to another table which seemed to be miles away to you. For Tails however it were merly six steps. The young fox grabbed a phone and probably intended to call over Sonic. The excitement began to rise in your body, you would finally be able to meet your idol in flesh and blood. Now thinking about it you started to wonder why Sonic would be the best choice to do the experiment on you. Maybe it was a quiz to figure out if you truly are the biggest Sonic fan. But then again why would they bother with that at all? Your mind was flooded with thought and you were only able to break out of it as soon as Tails started to talk on the phone. <br>\r\n\"Hey Sonic remember that experiment I was talking about all week? Our little friend choose you. So would you like to do...\" before Tails could finish his sentence Sonic popped up behind him in a blink of an eye. <br>\r\n\"Sure thing Tails, you knew I was excited for this too\"<br>\r\nYou couldn't believe it, your idol was so close yet so far for you to meet.<br>\r\n\"So Tails where are you hiding him?\" Sonic asked while tapping his foot on the ground impatiently. <br>\r\n\"Right on that table over there. And do be careful Sonic, remember what happened to the last one\" Tails replied in a hurry.<br>\r\n\"Chill Tails, won't happen again.\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\nYou got nervous as you heard their conversation. \"What were they talking about? Did they do this before with somebody else? And more importantly what happened to him?\" You thought to yourself as the gigantic hedgehog approached you with footsteps that you were able to feel from your very spot. As Sonic came closer the sound of the steps increased greatly and started to scare you. Sonic had a big grin on his face which you weren't able to categorize as a good or a bad thing. But one thing was sure, he was glad to be here. It was hard to say the same thing about you. Sonic took one final step sending your entire body into the air with a loud thoom.<br>\r\nSonic stood right infront of you and watched you carefully as you tried to stand up straight which wasn't an easy thing to do while the giant hedgehog stared at you with a joyful yet intimidating look. Especially because of his size. He could probably crush your entire body with the tip of his finger if he really wanted to. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There you're little fella, I gotta say you sure look pretty excited yourself. Ready for the experiment?\" Sonic boomed at you in a playful tone. He completely paralized you with his voice. Slowly opening your mouth you tried to reply to the giant but ended up stuttering in fear and excitement. \"H-he-hello I-I a-am y-y-yo-your b-b-big-biggest f-fan\". You were a bit embarrassed about your nervous behaviour toward Sonic. <br>\r\n\"Is that so? Cause you actually look like the smallest fan to me\" Sonic chuckled causing you to join into his laughing a bit.<br>\r\n\"Just kidding little guy. I bet you're. But I'm just here for the experiment so you might wanna save your questions for later, alright?\" He explained in a serious tone. After nodding your head he grabbed you with his titanic fingers and brought you closer to his face.<br>\r\n\"No need to be scared, I'm pretty sure you will love this\" he stated.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Your body was thrilling rapidly due to the events that occurred so far. Sonic was holding you between his giant fingers and he was about to start the experiment that they kept on mentioning. Sonic slowly moved you closer to the ground on which he was standing on. Looking down you noticed that Sonic took off his right shoe and had his naked foot on the floor. You started to panic as he placed you into his shoe without giving you any explanation. The inside of the shoe was hugh, it could easily be used as a stadium at your current size. The insole was pretty beaten with a large print of Sonic's foot. You could tell where exactly his foot would be if he inserted it into his shoe. The large footprint was stretching the floor further down with a more grayish color than the rest of the shoe. Just the idea of a foot so big sent shivers down your spine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Having fun in there? Hope you're not planing to sleep on my insole cause this is just the beginning\" Sonic said looking down at you. Just looking at the godly hedgehog from your spot was scary. He could do anything with you right now and he most likely intended to. Suddenly you saw him moving his right leg into the air and placing his giant foot right above the opening of the shoe. Now you knew what was going to come and it made you panic inside.<br>\r\n\"Get ready little fan, this is gonna be one hell of a ride that you won't forget very soon\" Sonic said giggling with a large smirk on his face. His toes started to wiggle in joy as he kept looking at you. You started running to the tip of the shoe so you wouldn't end up underneath the blue gods sole. As you ran you quickly remembered that you were in the shoe of your speedy idol. All the details in his shoe just hinted that he was running alot. His foot completely 'marked' this shoe as his own. The beaten insole, the giant footprint, the ravaged walls of the shoe and the overall grayish color which usually means that a shoe has been in use for a significant amount of time just reminded you that your situation was far worse that you thought. Sonic could keep you at his giant foot and run into his future adventures with you being at his mercy all the time. But Sonic would never do that, would he?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh heh think you can run away from my foot eh? We will see about that little fanboy. I'm the fastest thing alive, remember?\" Sonic said in a laughing manner. His foot finally entered the shoe and boy was it big. You haven't even made it to a quarter of the shoe, yet you were already exhausted. Sonic on the other hand didn't even break a sweat from his action. He wiggled his toes on the insole sending shockwaves towards you. The blue giant was in total control of your situation.<br>\r\n\"Hah guess you aren't so quick after all. But don't worry your favourite hero is here to help you\" Sonic taunted as he lifted the opening part into the air causing you to slide into the tip of the shoe. You reached your goal but noticed that it was all for nothing as you looked at the toeprints. His toes would eventually have their way with you. The toeprints were larger than your house. He could probably fill each toeprint with atleast 100 copies of you. Just the idea of it was terrifying to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lets see how you handle my toes. They are happy to welcome you in their home\" Sonic said with a taunting expression.<br>\r\nThe titanic toes approached you while getting bigger and bigger. Soon his big toes steamrolled over you and you ended up underneath them. Sonic squezzed his big toe deeper into you while holding back his giggling.<br>\r\nThe pressure of his big toe was intense. He knocked out every bit of air in your body and made it hard for you to breath. His big toe began to grind your body deeper into the insole as Sonic moved his big toe from the left to the right and back and forward. You laid there powerless as the giant blue teen had you nailed under his lowest body part. Sonic was clearly enjoying having such power over someone, especially with his ego. The pure fact that a teen hedgehog could fit the entire human population underneath his foot was ridicioules, yet here we had a gigantic blue hedgehog with super speed who could torture anybody just with his toes. As Sonic's big toe kept grinding on your weak body you tried to escape. All the struggle was useless, the smooth flesh of his big toe was sliding over your body giving you a hard time. Just as you stop resisting he stops all movement. The pressure however is still there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSonic wasn't done putting you into your place so he continued the tourment by tapping his big toe onto you. Now things got even heavier. The big toe had you at its mercy once again. But this time the pressure was stronger and unberable due to the constanted tapping. Sonic laughed while his big toe smashed you deeper and deeper into his insole. Every toe tap had enough power to knock out every little bit of energy out of you. You weren't able to escape because of the massive force of the toe. Furthermore it was the big toe of Sonic the hedgehog which was much faster than any other toe you would experience. The big toe went up and down, up and down for over a minute. His big toe went up one last time before smashing you one last time into the insole which actually caused you to moan in pain. You thought it was over but you were very mistaked. The blue god had much more on his mind so he proceeded to wiggle his toes while thinking about it. He chuckled while all his toes had their fun with you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he wiggled his digits you were unable to do anything. You just watched helplessly as dirt from his toe gabs fell onto you. As the toes dragged you into all different directions you moaned out in pain as the pressure was constantly changing. Now each toe did something differently. It was all the experience you had from the big toe combined and multiplied by 5. Up and down, left to right, back and forward. The blue titans toes were a torture device to someone of your size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now that we are done with introducing lets see where we can go to. And don't worry my toes will keep you save, so be nice to them and don't bite. If you do they might get 'heavier' heh heh\" The blue giant said as he tapped the shoe you were in. Just as you thought it couldn't get any worse you were proven wrong by your blue god himself. His entire foot was now going up and down causing even more pain than before. Sonic surely was a playful hedgehog which isn't good for someone of your size. You now grunted in pain instead of moaning. All the heavy weight was rapidly beating onto you. Luckly you were stuck underneath his toes so Sonics sole couldn't harm you... yet. All toes had the exact same movement now, which made your situation even worse. While the toes went up and down on your fragile body, your fear was stunning you from the inside. Nothing could improve your case right now, you just had to lay there and take whatever the godly hedgehog decided for you, even if it was death...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The enormous toes were still flattenting you underneath them while they went up and down. You couldn't even breathe anymore. Sonic was still thinking about the locations he could travel to with you under his colossal foot. He probably took more time to think so he could smash you even more into his toeprints. You could hear him humming to himself calmly while you were getting the beating of your life.<br>\r\nSonic was worse than any bully you have encountered in your life although he was your idol. He would have been the last person you would have considered a bully. Still here he was trampling your body with his famous body part. As his humming got louder the pressure of his toes increased. Not only was the oxygen low in his shoe but he actually had a bone-dry insole which seemed strange now that you thought about it. This is Sonics shoe so where is all the sweat that would be pilled up from all his adventures? He most likely showered recently. The fact that the shoe nor his foot was smelly supported that hypothesis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright I know where to go with you. Since it's such a nice warm day I'm bringing ya to the sunniest areas of mobius. Guess I better start walking you before reving so you get used to it first\" Sonic said as he started to walk. Now the real torture began. Even though he was walking, it still felt like he was running at top speed to you. The pressure was unbearable now. Once again his lower body part went up and down on you but this time with the combined force of his entire body. You wouldn't survive this.<br>\r\nYou were a bug at the blue blur foot and he would eventually turn you into a red stain at the bottom of his sole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not bad little guy, you seem to have a real survival instinct. Now lets put that to the test shall we? Hold on tight!\" Sonic said while beginning to accelerate.<br>\r\nYou started to scream out in pain as the toes landed on you. But your scream was constantly interrupted by the toes smashing down onto you. The toe flesh actually made it into your mouth which caused you to lick and even slurp it. The faster running also made his foot sweat which started to fill up the whole shoe making everything soggy and smelly. His foot was now offically assaulting all your senses. The sweat of his toes dropped onto you which made you choke and spit which was hard to keep up since you were still screaming from the constant pain. His toes were like wet towels beating onto you. It was getting worse and worse. The pain, the smell, the wet condition. It almost felt like a tropical island.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were tourmented like this for the next few hours. Sonic decided to have some mercy on your soul and slow down. As he stopped you started inhaling heavily to get some air which was still hardly aquired in your current surrounding. Like the playful hedgehog he is he stretched his foot and toes playfully causing you to slide between the big and second toe which he then rubbed together with you inbetween them. \"Pretty good little guy, you are still intact. I bet it's was one hell of a ride eh?\". Sonic kept on grinding you between his toes. There was even more sweat between his toes and it even smelled worse than anywhere else in the shoe. The gigantic walls were crushing you with no real effort. You still couldn't believe that Sonic was such a monster. For once he used his power to torture an innocent guy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would like to let you out now little guy but we are not done yet. So hang in there. You had your fun with my toes but now it's time for you to meet another important part of my foot. Don't worry you made it so far without a scratch on your body, I'm sure you will be fine\" Sonic said in a sarcastic tone. He actually thought you were okay even after all that screaming you had been doing inside his shoe. Maybe he didn't hear it or maybe he was ignoring it so he could have his way with you. Your condition isn't important to him at all. The blue giant merly wanted a toy on his foot. That's what the whole experiment was all about. You couldn't escape so you had to survive the rest of the tourment to have a minor chance of escaping the blue blur. The thought that your idol was responsible for the worst beating of your life was still scary to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe titanic hedgehog god lifted the front part of his shoe while leaving his heel on the ground. He proceeded by wiggling his toes and moving his foot around playfully. This caused you to slide away from the toe section and aim for the heel. If he was going to put you under his heel you would be finished and you knew it. But luckly he brought his entire foot back onto the ground before you reached the heel. You were stuck under his sole. What is he going to do now... <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As you laid completely buried under his naked sole you felt the need to give it a touch. Movement seemed impossible under the massive foot of the giant hedgehog. Yet you managed to use both hands to inspect his blue sole. It was surprisingly soft and even felt good in your hands. You couldn't get yourself to stop rubbing his godly sole, it was just too perfect. Strange that the foot of the fastest thing alive wasn't rough at all, considering all the running he did up to this point, his colossal foot constantly beating onto the same insole more often than any average person would do. You weren't the only one who enjoyed this moment as you heard the titanic hedgehog moan in delight as you kept toching his sole almost massaging it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I knew you couldn't resist for long little fella. Come on show me how much you value me as your idol\" Sonic said in a joyful tone while wiggling his toes. You didn't want to worship him after all the torture he put you through so you brought your hands back onto the insole of the giant shoe.<br>\r\n\"Aww I think you need a bit of motivation little guy. Don't worry my foot will make the first move for ya\" Sonic said while pushing his titanic foot deeper into you. His gigantic sole became unbearably heavy now. You could hardly breathe while the blue wall was pushing you deeper and deeper into the insole. The pressure stopped increasing for a moment letting you think that Sonic had applied his entire body weight onto you. You found yourself panicing and screaming once again as the blue sole squeezed you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Still not motivated hmm? Hold on let me help you some more heh heh\" Sonic said lifting is left foot from the ground and chuckling at your current state. The pressure on the right foot was too strong now which slowly started to smash your bones. The blue god wasn't done however. The heel of his right foot began to lift into the air aswell. Some of your bones started to break underneath the full weighted sole. While you screamed in pain The blue blur was laughing louder and louder. You couldn't even move a single finger at this point. Sonic would end your pathetic life very soon and there was nothing you could do about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds like you enjoyed it. I'm not done yet though. Hope you can last under there for a few more hours\" Sonic said while rotating his right foot. The soft flesh of his gigantic sole smeared you greatly into his insole. The sole slided smootly over your tiny body leaving back a lot of reeking sweat onto you. His enormous foot went left and right grinding your already broken bones a bit more. It even went back and forward several times enhancing the pain and leaving your body with bright red skin. The sweat was pilling up and you had to force yourself to swallow it. It was disgusting yet very unusual from what you had ever tasted in your life. The speedy hedgehogs feet had their own unique smell. His large foot kept grinding you while you were about to faint. Fainting could have made your situation much more bearable but unfortunatly the pain was keeping you away from passing out. Sonic smiled down with his hands on his hips knowing that he was beating up a lower lifeform just with a single foot. The titanic hedgehog enjoyed having such domination over someone, especially with his trademark bodypart. Eventually with a bit of mercy left in him he stops grinding his foot onto you and even lifts his foot a bit giving you a big relief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't wanna go rough on ya little guy but I will if I have to. Now be a good sport and do something to return the favour. You could hmm...\" Sonic was trying to figure out something you could do for him. Once again he tapped his titanic blue foot onto you but this time you were stuck under the sole. You screamed as the blue ceiling was crushing you constantly and breaking even more bones in your body. Tears started coming out of your eyes as you realised that this could become your daily life now. Stuck under a foot of a massive hedgehog who would use you as a toy whenever he wanted to. The repeated movement of his giant foot going up and down over your shrunken body also blew some hot air towards you which smelled terrible. Each time his foot came down, you and your surrounding got wetter from the sweat dripping of his huge sole. Your skin wasn't just suffering from the permanent foot tapping but also from the disgusting sweat. The worst however were his bonebreaking actions. The blue god could probably crush your entire body just with a single toe. Maybe he would actually do it and end your suffering once and for all. Right now he simply wanted to have some fun with a bug at the mercy of his foot. Sonic pulled his foot up one last time and brought it down with incredible force breaking several bones in your body and causing you to cry like a baby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know what you could do. Since you had so much fun and guidance from my toes it would be nice of you to repay them\" Sonic giggled as he lifted his heel and shacked his foot making you slide back to the tip of the shoe. Your journey ended in one of his toeprints. It's much more wetter than you remembered. His toes were sweatier than any other of his bodyparts. Strangly you couldn't see his toes as you looked around in the shoe. A drop of sweat forced you to look right above you and there they were, being wiggled by the blue giant himself. As they began to play with your peeble sized body, the hedgehog started laughing with one hand on his hips and the other scratching his head. It didn't really take much effort to deal with a runt like you and Sonic knew that. His toes moved your body in various directions getting more sweat into your mouth, more stink into your nose and more pain into your body. His titanic toes finally slowed down bringing you between his big and second toe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of a sudden you remembered what happened earlier when you were in this position so you tried your best to crawl away. Unfortunatly the blue giant had crushed too many of your bones at this point and even drained your body out of every little bit of energy. It was impossible to do anything now, you would most likely be toelint in the future while being stuck between Sonics gigantic toes while he would run into his adventures. His toes approached you from both sides slowly getting attached to each other. It was like one of those pyramid traps where the spiked walls moved towards the target. Sonics enormous toes were much worse than that however. You stopped crawling from the gigantic toewalls and accepted your fate. As you were buried between the giant toes you started screaming as the squeezing began. The titanic hedgehog was once again crushing you between his big and second toe. Sonic smirked as he increased the pressure and felt your worthless body between his toes. Squeezing you between his toes wasn't enough for the blue god so he slowly rubbed his toes together bringing one toe up and the other one down. He continued doing this, examining your tiny form on his favourite way. He laughed while you were being squeezed between both toes and slide into various locations between the toewalls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou screamed and cried as the tourment proceeded. The sweatyness of the toes enhanced the torture since it made the sliding easier and forced you to swallow the sweat. The sweat and the smell between his toes were extremly toxic now. If you wouldn't be crying from the pain your eyes would still produce tears due to the disgusting atmosphere itself. Sonic kept on sliding his toes towards each other while crossing his arms infront of his chest and grining down at you. The blue god was obviously proud of his work. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm you can't really do much in that miserable condition. Lets see if I can still get something out of you heh heh\" Sonic chuckled as his toes rapidly loosen their grip on you and squeezed you back between them. He was aware of your terrible state, maybe he would finally bring it to an end. Right now the gigantic blue hedgehog teen had a decision to make. Either let you remain underneath his foot and being tourmented much more or squeeze his toes together and finish you off. Sonic smiled as he kept playing with you between his toes.</span></div></div>",

Sonics big toe slowly went up right above you and came down almost instantly crushing you some more. The oversized hedgehog began doing something completely unexpected and pulled his foot out of the shoe. While his foot was leaving the smelly prison you were dragged along with it under Sonics titanic  big toe. Your body was smeared towards the large footprint making you feel the watery insole and sickening you some more with the soggy smelly surface as you were dragged along it. The blue titan lifted his entire foot off of you as it left the shoe. Light and fresh air was finally entering the shoe of the speedy god. You were exactly at the opening of the shoe but still deep in it. The gigantic footprint underneath you felt very hot. His heel must have really beaten onto it during your torture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You look even worse than I thought you would be. But that's nothing I can't handle\" Sonic smiled as he pulled out a chaos emerald and placed it above you. Everything started to shine and blend you, your hands covered your eyes and you turned your head turned away from the lightsource. Suddenly you realised that your bones weren't broken anymore, you even felt much better on a mental level. Did Sonic just heal your wounds? Maybe he isn't so evil after all. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There you go, all fixed and cleaned little guy\" Sonic said in an amused tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me out of here Sonic, this isn't funny\"   you shouted at the giant hedgehog while jumping up and done and waving your hands. Sonics smile grew bigger as he saw your reaction towards his experiment, he clearly wasn't going to stop now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You monster I can't believe you would do such a thing. That's why your mother abandoned you. She saw you for what you are, a sadistic monster\" you shouted up again as your blood boiled. Sonic didn't take your insult very well, you could tell by just looking at his face. Maybe insulting him wasn't the best idea especially at your current size. He could smack you with no effort and make you pay for your dirty mouth. The blue god stared at you with anger and you slowly felt the biggest fear so far. During all this time Sonic was holding back on you due to his positive attitude, but now you gave him a perfect reason to tourment you. You figured an apology to the blue giant would be the correct thing to do now. <br>\r\nBut before you could even open your mouth he cut you off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You little runt! My mother loved me. She gave me away to protect me. I'm just trying to help Tails with his experiment here. How dare you talk like that to me. I save people every day. I'm not gonna take that from a wannabe fanboy. You will pay for what you just said\" Sonic said in anger with both hands turned into fists. A line has definetly been crossed here. The gigantic blue blur inserted his foot back into the shoe while you begged for mercy. His foot felt much heavier than before, he was absolutely applying more pressure onto you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah keep begging bug. You can consider yourself lucky if I let you live.\" Sonic said in an mischief tone while bringing you back into the toe section with his titanic blue toes. You were dragged across the wet insole once again but this time his toes pushed you harder into it and brought more sweat onto your tiny body. It also went much faster than last time. The blue teen had you pinned in the toe section and wanted to give you a hard time now. He crossed both of his arms infront of his chest as he wiggled his toes violently on you. Each time the gigantic blue hedgehog squeezed you with his titanic blue toes he bursted out a loud but short chuckle. As the smirk on his face grew you were getting much more pain into your body. Sonic now intentionally caused you pain with his colossal toes without showing any mercy. His blue toes constantly smashed you down with incredible speed. As the blue digits crushed your tiny form with every movement you began to scream. The 5 blue bullies went into all different directions making sure that everything in their surrounding was destroyed. The blue titan who controlled your tourmenters laughed as he heard your screams of agony.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh heh is the little bugboy overwhelmed by my toes?\" Sonic said sarcastically. He really wanted to put more salt into your wounds. His toes suddenly all came down on you causing intense pain and even a loud booming sound.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThoom<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No rest for you bug\" Sonic brought his toes up into the air and brought them back onto you with more force.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThoom<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on beg me to stop and I might consider it\" You laid under his massive toes crying about your current situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThoom<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't wanna beg? I will make you, don't worry bug.\" The blue flesh went back into the air but this time his foot was balanced on his heel as he lifted his foot. His toes came down stronger onto you almost breaking your bones.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThoom<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have all day runt. But you clearly don't heh heh\" His titanic toes went up with his entire naked foot and stomped you back into the toeprints. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThoom<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong? I thought you liked to insult me. Are you playing mute so I give ya a break? Too bad\" His enormous blue foot went back up and crushed you again which made you scream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThoom<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you screaming for more? Well I can't say no to a fan\" The blue stinky flesh stomped you again bringing tears out of your eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThoom<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm I love fan service heh heh\" <br>\r\nYou cried as the titanic foot went back up and crushed you with his sweaty toes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThoom<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you pleased yet? No? Fine one more just for you\" The strongest stomp of the blue titanic hedgehog yet which broke several bones in your body<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThoom<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did I break something? Chill I can patch you up\" Sonic said joyfully. His blue gigantic toes balanced all the hedgehog's weight now. The pressure increased and so did the pain. Sweat covered you once again and you paniced. He laughed as he heard your screams. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

His walking went on until he came to an halt right infront of Tails and sending your entire body into the air and causing you to fall onto your back. The colossal green hedgehog was now looking down at Tails with a big smile on his face. Manic was two heads taller than Tails and much more intimidating. The shockwaves he caused a few seconds ago were intimidating enough but just looking at the giant hedgehog from upclose especially from your tiny point of view was extremly thrilling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's up Tails? Still working on that experiment?\" Manic asked with his thundering voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, he was just about to pick his experimenter\" Tails replied while pointing at you. Manic looked right at you with a curious look on his face. Your fear grew as the titanic hedgehog was casting a large shadow over you and giving his full attention. Suddenly he picked you up with two gloved finger and brought you closer to his face. His eyes scanned your body while you remained frozen due to fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's no reason to be afraid lil dude, I'm a not gonna crush ya like those evil giants\" Manic said in a rather mocking tone. He most likely noticed your fear and tried to calm you down, even though his current action was contributing towards your anxiety.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell ya what, how about we go for a lil walk? Might helps to thaw off your body, hmm?\" Manic offered calmly with a grin on his face. You slowly nodded your head to accept his offer since your mouth was still stunned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man you really are a scaredy cat. But don't ya worry, your buddy Manic has the best cure for that.\" Manic said as he dangled you in the air a little. He was really trying to help you but his mocking tone suggested that he was actually enjoying this. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Manic you can't take him for a walk, he hasn't picked his experimenter yet\" Tails stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Didn't ya see him nodding his head? He accepted my offer, so that makes me the experimenter, right?\" Manic replied in a persuading manner. It seems like the giant hedgehog outsmarted Tails by leading you into his trap. You would like to explain that you didn't want Manic as your experimenter but you were too scared of him as you hanged down between his large fingers. Tails was your only hope right now, he had to stand up to the green giant and get you out of this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Unless you want me to unshrink the lil dude...\" Manic said sarcasticly as he looked down into Tails eyes. So he was the one who shrinked you down to this size. It was weird to see Tails being tricked so easily by someone, then again Tails was younger and more naive. So obviously Manic wouldn't struggle to put him into his place when he wanted to. He really wanted to be the experimenter so badly, going so far to threaten Tails to unshrink you and making this experiment impossible to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No no okay okay fine you can do it Manic but please be gentle to him.\" Tails bursted out quickly with disappointment as he left the room. Manic looked back at you with a victorious smirk on his face, putting Tails into his place would probably be the second best thing that the green hedgehog would do today. However, the giant hedgehog was finally satisfied to be in charge of you, the  excitement was easy to see in his face. You on the other hand still felt unsure about this with the remaining fear in your body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong bug? Scared? Heh heh\" Manic intimidated with a mischief tone. You came to the realisation that Manic had nothing good on his mind for you.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Your body was thrilling rapidly due to the events that occurred so far. Manic was holding you between his giant fingers and he was about to start the experiment that they kept on mentioning. Manic slowly moved you closer to the ground on which he was standing on. Looking down you noticed that Manic took off his right shoe and had his naked foot on the floor. You started to panic as he placed you into his shoe without giving you any explanation. The inside of the shoe was huge, it could easily be used as a stadium at your current size. The insole was pretty beaten with a large print of Manic's foot. You could tell where exactly his foot would be if he inserted it into his shoe. The large footprint was stretching the floor further down with a more grayish color than the rest of the shoe. Just the idea of a foot so big sent shivers down your spine. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww you look so cute down there, hard to believe you're actually taller than me. But those days are over pal, time for some fun\" Manic taunted looking down at you. Just looking at the godly hedgehog from your spot was scary. He could do anything with you right now and he most likely intended to. Suddenly you saw him moving his right leg into the air and placing his giant foot right above the opening of the shoe. Now you knew what was going to come and it made you panic inside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get ready bugboy, this is gonna be one hell of a ride that you won't forget very soon\" Manic said giggling with a large smirk on his face. His toes started to wiggle in joy as he kept looking at you. You started running to the tip of the shoe so you wouldn't end up underneath the green gods sole. As you ran you quickly remembered that you were in the shoe of Manic the hedgehog. All the details in his shoe just hinted that he was a daredevil. His foot completely 'marked' this shoe as his own. The beaten insole, the giant footprint, the ravaged walls of the shoe and the overall grayish color which usually means that a shoe has been in use for a significant amount of time just reminded you that your situation was far worse that you thought. Manic could keep you at his giant foot and go into his future adventures with you being at his mercy all the time. But Manic would never do that, would he? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh heh think you can run away from my foot eh? We will see about that runt. Watch out he is coming to get ya\" Manic said in a laughing manner. His foot finally entered the shoe and boy was it big. You haven't even made it to a quarter of the shoe yet you were already exhausted. Manic on the other hand didn't even break a sweat from his action. He wiggled his toes on the insole sending shockwaves towards you. The green giant was in total control of your situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? That's it? I'm kinda disappointed lil dude, thought for sure you had more in ya. Guess I'm gonna need to give you a little headstart then\" Manic taunted as he lifted the opening part into the air causing you to slide into the tip of the shoe. You reached your goal but noticed that it was all for nothing as you looked at the toeprints. His toes would eventually have their way with you. The toeprints were larger than your house. He could probably fill each toeprint with atleast 100 copies of you. Just the idea of it was terrifying to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright playtime is finally on. Lets see how you handle my toes. They are glad to have some company\" Manic said with a taunting expression.<br>\r\nThe titanic toes approached you while getting bigger and bigger. Soon his big toes steamrolled over you and you ended up underneath them. Manic squezzed his big toe deeper into you while holding back his giggling. The pressure of his big toe was intense. He knocked out every bit of air in your body and made it hard for you to breath. His big toe began to grind your body deeper into the insole as Manic moved his big toe from the left to the right and back and forward. You laid there powerless as the giant green teen had you nailed under his lowest body part. Manic was clearly enjoying having such power over someone, especially with his ego. The pure fact that a teen hedgehog could fit the entire human population underneath his foot was ridicioules, yet here we had a gigantic green hedgehog who could torture anybody just with his toes. As Manic's big toe kept grinding on your weak body you tried to escape. All the struggle was useless, the smooth flesh of his big toe was sliding over your body giving you a hard time. Just as you stop resisting he stops all movement. The pressure however is still there. Manic wasn't done putting you into your place so he continued the tourment by tapping his big toe onto you. Now things got even heavier. The big toe had you at its mercy once again. But this time the pressure was stronger and unberable due to the constanted tapping. Manic laughed while his big toe smashed you deeper and deeper into his insole. Every toe tap had enough power to knock out every little bit of energy out of you. You weren't able to escape because of the massive force of the toe. Furthermore it was the big toe of a master thief which was much more flexible than any other toe you would experience. The big toe went up and down, up and down for over a minute. His big toe went up one last time before smashing you one last time into the insole which actually caused you to moan in pain. You thought it was over but you were very mistaked. The green god had much more on his mind so he proceeded to wiggle his toes while thinking about it. He chuckled while all his toes had their fun with you. As he wiggled his digits you were unable to do anything. You just watched helplessly as dirt from his toe gabs fell onto you. As the toes dragged you into all different directions you moaned out in pain as the pressure was constantly changing. Now each toe did something differently. It was all the experience you had from the big toe combined and multiplied by 5. Up and down, left to right, back and forward. The green titans toes were a torture device to someone of your size. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now that we are done with introducing lets see where we can go to. And don't worry my toes will keep ya save, so be nice to them and don't bite. If you do they might get 'heavier' heh heh\" The green giant said as he tapped the shoe you were in. Just as you thought it couldn't get any worse you were proven wrong by your green god himself. His entire foot was now going up and down causing even more pain than before. Manic surely was a playful hedgehog which isn't good for someone of your size. You now grunted in pain instead of moaning. All the heavy weight was rapidly beating onto you. Luckly you were stuck underneath his toes so the Manics sole couldn't harm you... yet. All toes had the exact same movement now, which made your situation even worse. While the toes went up and down on your fragile body, your fear was stunning you from the inside. Nothing could improve your case right now, you just had to lay there and take whatever the godly hedgehog decided for you, even if it was death...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The enormous toes were still flattenting you underneath them while they went up and down. You couldn't even breathe anymore. Manic was still thinking about the locations he could travel to with you under his colossal foot. He probably took more time to think so he could smash you even more into his toeprints. You could hear him humming to himself calmly while you were getting the beating of your life. Manic was worse than any bully you have encountered in your life although he was a nice guy. He would have been one of the last persons you would have considered a bully. Still here he was trampling your body with his titanic foot. As his humming got louder the pressure of his toes increased. Not only was the oxygen low in his shoe but he actually had a bone-dry insole which seemed strange now that you thought about it. This is Manics shoe which has been in walked through sewers for years and even used in combat. So where is all the sweat that would have pilled up at the green gods foot? He most likely showered recently. The fact that the shoe nor his foot was smelly supported that hypothesis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hope my toes warmed ya up a bit for our little walk. We are gonna have a nice hot day ahead of us\" Manic said as he started to walk. Now the real torture began. Even though he was walking, it still felt like he was running. The pressure was unbearable now. Once again his lower body part went up and down on you but this time with the combined force of his entire body. You wouldn't survive this. You were a bug at the green thieves foot and he would eventually turn you into a red stain at the bottom of his sole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey you're pretty good at this lil bug. Guess being a foot mat is a common thing for ya hmm?\" Manic said as he started laughing.<br>\r\nYou started to scream out in pain as the toes landed on you. But your scream was constantly interrupted by the toes smashing down onto you. The toe flesh actually made it into your mouth which caused you to lick and even slurp it. The hot weather started to make his foot sweat which started to fill up the whole shoe making everything soggy and smelly. His foot was now offically assaulting all your senses. The sweat of his toes dropped onto you which made you choke and spit which was hard to keep up since you were still screaming from the constant pain. His toes were like wet towels beating onto you. It was getting worse and worse. The pain, the smell, the wet condition. It almost felt like a tropical island.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh heh look my foot is offering you something to drink. Don't be shy, you can lick it off if you want\" Manic chuckled as his smile grew bigger with each footstep he took.<br>\r\nEveryone in the outside world would see a green hedgehog walking innocently through Mobius. His hands behind his back, his eyes looking around in the sky and his cute face showing a heartwarming smile. But in reality this 'innocent' hedgehog was tourmenting you underneath his foot and had fun doing so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were tourmented like this for the next few hours. Manic decided to have some mercy on your soul and slow down. As he stopped you started inhaling heavily to get some air which was still hardly aquired in your current surrounding. Like the playful hedgehog he is he stretched his foot and toes playfully causing you to slide between the big and second toe which he then rubbed together with you inbetween them. \"Not bad lil fella, you are still intact. I bet it's was one hell of a ride eh?\". Manic kept on grinding you between his toes. There was even more sweat between his toes and it even smelled worse than anywhere else in the shoe. The gigantic walls were crushing you with no real effort. You still couldn't believe that Manic was such a monster. It must have been his rough childhood, he never had real parents to watch over him or to love him. He was a lone wolf guided by criminals. Of course he wouldn't feel any empathy for an insignificant lifeform like you. Behind that cute face he was still a playful child who hasn't outlived his childhood so he used you to do so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wish we could do this everyday lil dude. Not sure if you had fun or not but atleast you're still okay. Don't ya worry, you made it so far without a scratch on your body, I'm sure you will be fine\" Manic said in a sarcastic tone. He actually thought you were okay even after all that screaming you had been doing inside his shoe. Maybe he didn't hear it or maybe he was ignoring it so he could have his way with you. Your condition isn't important to him at all. The green giant merly wanted a toy on his foot. That's what the whole experiment was all about. You couldn't escape so you had to survive the rest of the tourment to have a minor chance of escaping the green titan. The thought that this good natured hedgehog teen was responsible for the worst beating of your life was still scary to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe titanic hedgehog god lifted the front part of his shoe while leaving his heel on the ground. He proceeded by wiggling his toes and moving his foot around playfully. This caused you to slide away from the toe section and aim for the heel. If he was going to put you under his heel you would be finished and you knew it. But luckly he brought his entire foot back onto the ground before you reached the heel. You were stuck under his sole. What is he going to do now... </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As you laid completely buried under his naked sole you felt the need to give it a touch. Movement seemed impossible under the massive foot of the giant hedgehog. Yet you managed to use both hands to inspect his green sole. It was surprisingly soft and even felt good in your hands. You couldn't get yourself to stop rubbing his godly sole, it was just too perfect. Strange that his foot wasn't rough at all, considering all the criminal work he did up to this point, his colossal foot constantly beating onto the same insole as he did all kind of jobs for the thieves guild. Giving it a second thought it made sense for him to have such soft soles considering all the sneaking he would do while walking on his tiptoes giving the rest of his foot some refreshment as he would balance his entire weight onto his toes. You weren't the only one who enjoyed this moment as you heard the titanic hedgehog moan in delight as you kept toching his sole almost massaging it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I knew you would enjoy this too lil bug. Come on you can do better than that. Show your tour guide some appreciaten \" Manic said in a joyful tone while wiggling his toes. You didn't want to worship him after all the torture he put you through so you brought your hands back onto the insole of the giant shoe.<br>\r\n\"Aww I think you need a bit of motivation little guy. Don't worry my foot will make the first move for ya\" Manic said while pushing his titanic foot deeper into you. His gigantic sole became unbearably heavy now. You could hardly breathe while the green wall was pushing you deeper and deeper into the insole. The pressure stopped increasing for a moment letting you think that Manic had applied his entire body weight onto you. You found yourself panicing and screaming once again as the green sole squeezed you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Still not motivated hmm? Hold on let me help ya some more heh heh\" Manic said lifting is left foot from the ground and chuckling at your current state. The pressure on the right foot was too strong now which slowly started to smash your bones. The green god wasn't done however. The heel of his right foot began to lift into the air aswell. Some of your bones started to break underneath the full weighted sole. While you screamed in pain The titanic hedgehog was laughing louder and louder. You couldn't even move a single finger at this point. Manic would end your pathetic life very soon and there was nothing you could do about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're a tough one lil kid. But I got all day so you better think twice before rejecting my friendly request\" Manic said while rotating his right foot. The soft flesh of his gigantic sole smeared you greatly into his insole. The sole slided smootly over your tiny body leaving back a lot of reeking sweat onto you. His enormous foot went left and right grinding your already broken bones a bit more. It even went back and forward several times enhancing the pain and leaving your body with bright red skin. The sweat was pilling up and you had to force yourself to swallow it. It was disgusting yet very unusual from what you had ever tasted in your life. The green hedgehogs feet had their own unique smell. His large foot kept grinding you while you were about to faint. Fainting could have made your situation much more bearable but unfortunatly the pain was keeping you away from passing out. Manic smiled down with his hands on his hips knowing that he was beating up a lower lifeform just with a single foot. The titanic hedgehog enjoyed having such domination over someone, especially with his naked foot. Eventually with a bit of mercy left in him he stops grinding his foot onto you and even lifts his foot a bit giving you a big relief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't wanna go rough on ya lil guy but I will if I have to. Let me think what your small body can do for my foot . You could hmm...\" Manic was trying to figure out something you could do for him. Once again he tapped his titanic green foot onto you but this time you were stuck under the sole. You screamed as the green ceiling was crushing you constantly and breaking even more bones in your body. Tears started coming out of your eyes as you realised that this could become your daily life now. Stuck under a foot of a massive hedgehog who would use you as a toy whenever he wanted to. The repeated movement of his giant foot going up and down over your shrunken body also blew some hot air towards you which smelled terrible. Each time his foot came down, you and your surrounding got wetter from the sweat dripping of his huge sole. Your skin wasn't just suffering from the permanent foot tapping but also from the disgusting sweat. The worst however were his bonebreaking actions. The green god could probably crush your entire body just with a single toe. Maybe he would actually do it and end your suffering once and for all. Right now he simply wanted to have some fun with a bug at the mercy of his foot. Manic pulled his naked foot up one last time and brought it down with incredible force breaking several bones in your body and causing you to cry like a baby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know what you could do. Since you had so much fun and guidance from my toes it would be nice of you to repay them\" Manic giggled as he lifted his heel and shacked his foot making you slide back to the tip of the shoe. Your journey ended in one of his toeprints. It's much more wetter than you remembered. His toes were sweatier than any other of his bodyparts. Strangly you couldn't see his toes as you looked around in the shoe. A drop of sweat forced you to look right above you and there they were, being wiggled by the green giant himself. As they began to play with your peeble sized body, the hedgehog started laughing with one hand on his hips and the other scratching his head. It didn't really take much effort to deal with a runt like you and Manic knew that. His toes moved your body in various directions getting more sweat into your mouth, more stink into your nose and more pain into your body. His titanic toes finally slowed down bringing you between his big and second toe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of a sudden you remembered what happened earlier when you were in this position so you tried your best to crawl away. Unfortunatly the green giant had crushed too many of your bones at this point and even drained your body out of every little bit of energy. It was impossible to do anything now, you would most likely be toelint in the future while being stuck between Manics gigantic toes while he would head into his adventures. His toes approached you from both sides slowly getting attached to each other. It was like one of those pyramid traps where the spiked walls moved towards the target. Manics enormous toes were much worse than that however. You stopped crawling from the gigantic toewalls and accepted your fate. As you were buried between the giant toes you started screaming as the squeezing began. The titanic hedgehog was once again crushing you between his big and second toe. Manic smirked as he increased the pressure and felt your worthless body between his toes. Squeezing you between his toes wasn't enough for the green god so he slowly rubbed his toes together bringing one toe up and the other one down. He continued doing this, examining your tiny form on his favourite way. He laughed while you were being squeezed between both toes and slide into various locations between the toewalls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou screamed and cried as the tourment proceeded. The sweatyness of the toes enhanced the torture since it made the sliding easier and forced you to swallow the sweat. The sweat and the smell between his toes were extremly toxic now. If you wouldn't be crying from the pain your eyes would still produce tears due to the disgusting atmosphere itself. Manic kept on sliding his toes towards each other while crossing his arms infront of his chest and grining down at you. The green god was obviously proud of his work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm you can't really do much in that miserable condition. Lets see if I can still get something out of ya heh heh\" Manic chuckled as his toes rapidly loosen their grip on you and squeezed you back between them. He was aware of your terrible state, maybe he would finally bring it to an end. Right now the gigantic green hedgehog teen had a decision to make. Either let you remain underneath his foot and be tourmented much more or squeeze his toes together and finish you off. Manic smiled as he kept playing with you between his toes.</span></div></div>",

And finally : *SPLURT* you poured a huge amount of cum in the sole. Sonic was satisfied \"Mmh, you really liked it, for sure\". You continued to cumming for a few more minutes.

The blue hedgehog take a foot of Tails and the little fox did the same. And they sniffed and licked each other's feet with passion and envy. The Show was amazing : Sonic The Hedgehog and his friend Tails, both with giant size were enjoying their wonderful boy feet... Until their penises grow slowy to finally enter in erection... Which did the same with yours (Even if the show had already caused him to swell). Sonic said \"So ? What do you think of our dicks ?\" \"It's... it's so big !\" Tails said \"Now we're ready for the real fun\". Sonic and Tails grabbed each other's penis with their feet. Decidedly, surprises were very presents ! \"What ? You're going to...\" Sonic said \"Yeah, little one. And when we had finished, you'll clean our magnificent feet\".

YOUR FEET FEEL SO GOOD !\" \"YOURS TOO !\", you stroked your member... and after a few minute, all the three in the room exploded in cum. Each sighed. Sonic and Tails approached their feet near you.

There was no doubt now : Sonic and Tails loved feet as much as you. \"Ok now it's time for cleaning, foot pet.\" Without waiting, you tasted for the first time the cum of Sonic and Tails. You already knew the smell with yours. But that of the two giants was so much potent... and wildier (It's obvious, they are a bit of animals). Just with that, you're so happy. But the taste was the best time. It was really slimy, fishy with a indescribable aroma... And with the mixture of foot sweat, it was so much enjoyable. Shortly thereafter, you had finished to swallow all the divine semen. Sonic and Tails smiled with satisfaction  \"Pwew ! It was a great sensation. Now Tails, what is next ?\"</span></div></div>",

You didn\u2019t think Shadow realised this, but there was a small opening around the size of your torso between his palm and little finger. Hearing his voice on what he was going to do with you, you decide to make an escape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<span class=\"cred\">\u2026 How about\u2026 I start asking you how you got---<b>Hey</b>!</span>\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter charging at the opening and jumping through, you successfully dive out and begin to plummet to the earth. It was if everything was happening in slow motion, you had not fully appreciated how huge Shadow was in comparison to you, as you saw huge strands of black fur fly past you as you descend near his legs. Taking a brief moment to look up, you see the legs stretch to the sky, with the upper half of Shadow appearing as a dark blur as his head blocked the sun. Before impact, you enter a parkour roll and land without injury. Upon falling to the ground, you leave your crouched position with a sprinted run.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShadow\u2019s quills began to tense with fury at the prospect of you rejecting his aid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<span class=\"cred\">You know, it could be considered insolent to turn your back on the Ultimate Life form when he is in a rare generous mood.

Okay, then, I\u2019ll make this less difficult for you. I promise I won\u2019t run, but you can feel free - Actually I\u2019d advise you \u2013 to run as fast as you possibly can, for the Ultimate Lifeform does not tolerate impertinent pests such as yourself.</span>\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn\u2019t need to be told twice, as a matter of fact you resumed running as soon as you got back up! Still, Shadow\u2019s speech was foreboding enough to refresh your tired body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<span class=\"cred\">That\u2019s right, little ant, flee. Flee for your life.</span>\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShadow grinned maniacally at the prospect of hunting you down, toying with you, allowing himself to physically express his superiority as the Ultimate Lifeform. His body tense with a mixture of fury and excitement, he slowly lifted his left, bare foot higher than normal \u2013 up to his right leg\u2019s kneecap \u2013 and moved it 9 inches ahead of him, and after 5 seconds of leaving it in the air, Shadow brought it down, stomping as hard as he could on the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>BOOM!</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter another abrupt earthquake that nearly reduced you to your knees, you swayed to your right, nearly falling over before regaining your footing and continuing your escape. You quickly look behind you to see what had happened. What seemed to be 100 yards (Which was really 5 feet) away from you was a giant white and red structure that you recognized as the shoe, and looking up you could see Shadow\u2019s face, which seemed to be hundreds of miles away, towering above you with cold, emotionless eyes, and a menacing grin upon his face. <br>\r\nBut the thing that really sparked your panic was adjacent to the shoe, a large, black hill with 5 mounds of black fur, descending in large to small from right to left. With two red stripes streaking down the side of the hill, you immediately understood that this hill was connected to Shadow\u2019s leg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<span class=\"cred\">This is amazing\u2026</span>\u201d thought Shadow. \u201c<span class=\"cred\">Finally, a creature that suitably fears and respects me as I deserve. Perhaps if he gives me a good game, I might not destroy him after all.</span>\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, Shadow lifted his foot. This time it was his right foot, with a shoe still on. After lifting it to his left kneecap, he moved it 9 inches in front of him, waited for 5 seconds, and stomped down as hard as he could, causing dirt which looked like a blast of sand to shoot out from under it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>BOOM!</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time, as you were looking behind you, you did fall. Falling in a sideways motion, you rolled on your side, causing several small scratches against the rocky ground \u2013 Not deep enough to draw blood, but they still stung. Landing in a position that still faced Shadow, you could see he was raising his left, bare foot into the air again, at kneecap height, waiting. Looking up at him, you could not deny to yourself that if this was not a matter of life and death scenario, you\u2019d probably enjoy it!<br>\r\nDeciding to wait for the next tremor to pass, you looked in horror as Shadow wiggled his toes, causing debris from underneath his dark grey soles to plummet to the earth, like a rain made out of dust and rocks, some bigger than you! After a period of 5 seconds, he brought it back down to the earth, the shock of it making you bounce an inch from the ground. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>BOOM!</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<span class=\"cred\">He is indeed giving me good sport, but not nearly fast enough to evade me. I\u2019d relish the chance to punish his insolence and satisfyingly end this vermin\u2019s life.\u201d thought Shadow the Hedgehog. \u201cBut, if I crush him, how else can I possibly continue this euphoric feeling of superiority? While I can outmatch any rival, I cannot impose this authority upon them, this control\u2026</span>\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoving his body weight fully onto his left foot, he raised right foot into the air as if taking another step, so nonchalantly as if he was taking a normal walk. If it were not for him looking at you, it would have been possible he had lost your location. His face smiled at your expression of horror, and his expression became lustful and wanton. Recognizing your longest period of stable running, you sprang up and sprinted again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<span class=\"cred\">It would seem he has failed to evade me - at my current walking speed, my next step will tread over him with my right shoe, crushing him.</span>\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShadow began to lift his right foot to his left kneecap, moved it 9 inches ahead of him, so the middle of the shoe was directly above you, and waited for 5 seconds.<br>\r\nYou began to look frantically around for somewhere to hide, somewhere he could not get you. Maybe a small cave, or a hole? Anywhere was better than being in the open, when he was so close to you! He was no longer miles away from you \u2013 In fact, you believed he was just over 1 regular foot from crushing you. Even though the process of him lifting his feet and waiting spread over 10 seconds, he was still advancing on you faster than you could possibly match.<br>\r\nA dark rectangular shadow fell upon you as if the sun had been blotted from the sky, stretching ahead of you, at twice your running speed until it suddenly stopped moving, staying perfectly motionless. Knowing that the next 5 seconds were your last chance, you sprinted as fast as you could to escape the darkness surrounding you, illuminated ground mere moments away, until suddenly\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>BOOM!</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn explosion of dust and debris shot from underneath you as you barely managed to run from underneath Shadow\u2019s shoe before it collided with the earth. The shaking earth and force of wind that escaped from beneath his shoe caused you to shoot 6 feet (From your perspective) into the air, to which you landed on your feet and kept running. <br>\r\n\u201c<b>He\u2019s right behind me, he\u2019s going to crush me!</b>\u201d you think to yourself. You could tell that time was running short from the huge explosion that had occurred right behind you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<span class=\"cred\">Hmph! I thought I had you there, but it seems your luck has run out.</span>\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFatigue was heavily slowing you down, and you couldn\u2019t keep up the same speed you had when you began. Clumsily running, your throat dry with exhaustion, you frantically look around for some way for you to escape or hide. The sun was beating heavily upon your back, until it suddenly stopped. Only then did you realise that the sun had been blotched again. Looking in front of you, you could see that darkness covered the ground like a small island, with a large peninsula, with 4 adjacent narrowing peninsulas, allowing four pillars of light to creep between them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<span class=\"cred\"><b>Game over.</b></span>\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>BOOM!</b></span></div></div>",

The air is squeezed from your lungs, and while you feel the earth quake, you remain stuck exactly where you are. The tremor was not as violent as the previous ones, implying that Shadow had purposefully been lenient and had not stomped with his full potential force. Abruptly, the sweaty, rough texture behind you moved to the right, the friction causing you to flip over. The pressure increased suddenly and decreased several times in a swaying motion, forcing you into the ground. Suddenly the dark grey leathery surface raises into the air and repositions itself, placing you in the groove between Shadow\u2019s two smallest toes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPressing down with his toes, he forces each digit, damp with sweat, to slowly, painfully drag across your body. When you reach between his two largest toes, they slightly separate but still trapping your legs. Blinding sunlight enters from the crevice above you, its dark grey walls shimmering with small beads of sweat in the light. Surprisingly, in-between Shadow\u2019s toes had remained relatively clean in contrast from the underside of his sole, which was now covered in dust and pebbles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes finally adjusted to the light, allowing you to see the blue sky, and you calm down enough to appreciate your surroundings. Looking around, it would seem you have found yourself in another cavern \u2013 apart from the separation in the 2 toes, the dark grey ceiling descended down to the ground around you. A bead of sweat dropped onto your head, causing you to look up at the sun which was promptly blotched by Shadow\u2019s face, who was bending over to get a better view of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<span class=\"cred\">Hmph, enjoying yourself? I hope you\u2019ve had as much amusement as I had. I congratulate you on your stamina, I expected you to falter after my third step. I was certain I would have got you with my fourth, but you managed to take a full 5 steps. Still, I don\u2019t see any reason as to why I should let you remain alive. Any last words?</span>\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou begin to flail your arms around, pleading with your dry croaky voice, although all Shadow could hear of your protests were small faint squeaks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<span class=\"cred\">I\u2019m going to assume you want to live. Very well, I\u2019ll spare you on one condition. It would seem I have saved your life twice; once by offering my aid, and the second being me sparing you now. Therefore I demand complete obedience from you, to do whatever I desire. Fail and there will be no mercy for you.</span>\u201d<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cred\">If you decline, do nothing and I\u2019ll finish taking my next step.</span>\u201d Said Shadow as his 2 toes sealed together and fell down on your face, forcing you into the ground while the cavern flattened as he applied more pressure onto you. <br>\r\n\u201c<span class=\"cred\">If you consent, pledge your fealty and dedication. I\u2019ll leave that up for your imagination.</span>\u201d The pressure relieved to what it previously was, reforming the appearance of a dark grey cave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou obviously wish to consent \u2013 Anything is better than dying like this! You begin to sit up, with your legs still beneath Shadow\u2019s sole while your head reaches halfway out of the toes crevice. You begin to look around the cave frantically for some way to show your consent, while gagging as you notice the acrid scent that smelt like vinegar emanating from the glistening crevice. You hear a deep cough echo above you, so you look up to see Shadow\u2019s face with a skeptical expression, raising one red eyebrow \u2013 looking down at you if you were the biggest idiot on the planet. Suddenly, he flexes his toes, causing the skin in between them to bulge out towards your face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<b><span class=\"cred\">You have 3 minutes.</span></b>\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrasping the hint, you begin to clean. Using your hands, you wipe away the sweat that is adjacent to your head, causing the crevice to become less glistening, and more like a surface. After 30 seconds of wiping away the sweat with your hands made you become damper then you already were, to the extent that your hands would rub the sweat around rather than remove it. Your sleeves were drenched by several stray droplets that fell down your arms. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter 1 minute and 13 seconds, the majority of your upper torso was drenched, making you wonder if you could continue. Deciding to rub your hands on the ground in an attempt to dry yourself, you continue with little success, doing your best to ignore the urge in your groin\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter 1 minute and 48 seconds of smearing sweat, you successfully clean from the tip of the crevice to the sides of the base, only leaving the skin that connected the 2 toes glistening with droplets. Hearing a booming voice, you look above you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<span class=\"cred\">It seems you have done an acceptable job, but you still have not pledged fealty nor dedication. So try and think <u><b>real hard</b></u>. I\u2019m sure you\u2019re thirsty.</span>\u201d<br>\r\nNot understanding what he was trying to hint, you stare at him. Shadow groans in frustration, flexing his toes again, causing the skin between them to bulge out.<br>\r\n\u201c<span class=\"cred\">Use your arms again, and you will lose them. You have 1 minute.</span>\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nComprehending the command, you begrudgingly look directly in front of you, at the dark grey skin. The reason why you left this bit to last was because it was the most shimmering part of the crevice \u2013 The wettest. \u201c<b>Well, I am thirsty\u2026</b>\u201d you console to yourself. Suddenly, a large booming noise occurs from above you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><span class=\"cred\">*COUGH*</span></b> <span class=\"cred\">\u201cI\u2019m waiting.</span>\u201d said Shadow as a stomping sound began, which you knew to be his shoe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAcknowledging that 10 of your 60 seconds had passed, you abruptly open your mouth wide, move your head towards the skin, and stick out your tongue so a large bead of sweat could move along it, into your mouth. The scent of it was nothing compared to the taste. It was as if you were drinking a strong, mature cheese mixed with the slight taste of vinegar, like cider. After swallowing it, you could not resist returning for a second taste. Forgetting of Shadow\u2019s presence, you ravenously swallow as much of it as you possibly could, taking huge mouthfuls of the substance, occasionally swishing some droplets in your mouth as if it was some fine vintage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<span class=\"cred\"><b>10, 9, 8\u2026</b></span>\u201d came the voice from above you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNoticing that Shadow was counting down how much time you had left, you snapped back into reality to find your job was nearly finished. Taking a brief look above you, you noticed Shadow was taking off one of his gloves. Only several beads remained, the rest of the area where you licked still looking damp due to saliva, but not shimmering as Shadows sweat had done. Moving as fast as you could, you slurped each individual bead up until only one remained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<span class=\"cred\"><b>4, 3, 2\u2026</b></span>\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRealizing how little time you had left, you jerked your head forwards, attaching your mouth directly over the bead. Sucking, slurping and slightly chewing on the skin, you attempt to finish your job until\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<b><span class=\"cred\">Time\u2019s up, human.</span></b>\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA huge dark grey pillar with a streak of red blocked the light and entered the crevice, forcing you to the ground. Noticing it had a nail, you recognize it as Shadow\u2019s finger. It twisted left and right until it ascended from where it had come from. Bringing the finger up to his nose, Shadow smelt it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<span class=\"cred\">Well, the small amount of liquid here is not mine, which makes it seem you have succeeded. As I mentioned, I desire to return home, which means you will need a mode of transport. Luckily, I\u2019ve thought of a place where you may become more humble.</span>\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwisting his foot, Shadow turns you over, forces your waist between his toes and lifts you up, torso dangling below as Shadow began walking back to where he had started. Whenever it was time for him to walk with his left foot \u2013 the one that held you \u2013 he would perform it slower and gentler than his right, causing you a painless ride, but still walking at a regular pace and fashion. Unfortunately, you still suffered from the vertigo of being held face down every time he took a step, feeling sick as you were pulled into the sky and then forced back into the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile walking towards a small rock, Shadow bends over and picks up his shoe. Sitting on the rock, he places his foot on his right leg, takes you out from between his toes and places you on the tip of his right shoe. Wiping off the dust and dirt that had collected on his left foot, he lifts up his left shoe, pulling the sock out of it. Holding one in each hand, he looked to be weighing them while trying to come to a decision. With a grin on his face, he snatches you up and places you\u2026</span></div></div>",

The planet was blue and green, but <br>\r\nthe green was a bit too green and the blue was a bit too blue. Suddenly the planet began to <br>\r\nexpand and contract, changing size with every movement, it was certainly a sight to behold. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe planet stopped all motion for a while. Suddenly it started to expand rapidly, growing <br>\r\nlarger and larger until it was the only thing filling your vision. You noticed it beginning to <br>\r\nencircle you, all you see in any direction is blue and green. You then see a dot, a mere<br>\r\npinprick of red. At first it was barley noticeable, but little by little it began covering all of <br>\r\nthe blue and green, until the only color of the once distant blue and green was red.<br>\r\nYou couldn't even begin to fathom what this meant, but you were aware that you were <br>\r\ndreaming the whole time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou remembered hearing something about this, being aware of dreaming while dreaming,<br>\r\nbut you didn't really believe it could happen, let alone happen to you. You then noticed a<br>\r\nwhite symbol that resembled a crescent shape begin to form and then you woke...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking around you could see you were no longer in your living room, but where were you?<br>\r\nYou slowly sit up and look at the floor, a magnificently white fabric stained hear and there <br>\r\nwith brown, a small tear in the fabric revealed a red floor underneath. \"How strange,\" You<br>\r\nthought to yourself. Your thoughts, however, were cut short when you looked up, staring <br>\r\nyou in the face, was the face of Knuckles the Echindna.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was wondering when you were going to notice me,\" He says. You take another look around<br>\r\nand you realize that the land you were sitting on was the palm of his gloved hand, no wonder<br>\r\nwhy the floor was giving off such heat. You look up and ask him, \"How did I get here?\"<br>\r\nHe answers, \" I don't know, I only found you on the floor a few minutes ago, You almost ended<br>\r\nup a red stain on my red foot,\" You go to the side of his palm and look down at two massive red <br>\r\nfeet.

Before you open your eyes, you feel something soft and cushiony underneath your body. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s warm and comfortable, covered with some kind of fabric that you thought were sheets. Whatever it was, it was silky smooth against your face, and you rub your cheeks against it as you began to regain consciousness. You breathe in deeply through your nose, stretching your shoulders and scrunching your face to try and wake yourself up. You smell something musky, like sweat or something, but you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re in too much of a daze to think too hard about it. You turn onto your back and stretch your arms and legs. You feel your body respond to the increased circulation and the fog of sleep slowly drifts away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You move your arms and attempt to sit up, when you come to a sudden realization. The last thing you remembered was starting up your Genesis console in your living room. If you passed out, how did you make it to your bed? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You sit up quickly and open your eyes. It turned out you didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t make it to your bed at all. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The view before you is barren of any objects, save for the white fabric that covered the floor. Just in front of you, a streak of blue about as wide as your shoulders stretches off towards the horizon. At the edge of the horizon, something reflective glistened, and after shaking off the momentary blindness, you noticed that it looks like a huge hill made of gold. Your vision clears, and you begin to make out more detail. The golden hill has some kind of strange blue markings on it. They glow with a faint blue light, which suddenly grows more intense. The light bleeds onto the blue line in front of you, and it begins glowing too. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Suddenly, you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t feel the soft cushion beneath you. In fact, you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t feel <i>anything</i> beneath you. You wave your arms and legs in alarm, but with nothing there for them to grab on to, you only succeed in flailing around as uselessly as a fish out of water. You realize that there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s an aura surrounding you; the same color as the light on the floor before. Everything takes on a bluish tint as your surrounded in the halo, but you can see out of it well enough to notice the wall of\u00e2\u0080\u00a6what was that? It looked like the wall was covered in thin strands of some kind, like blades of grass. But they were just about as tall as you were. And they weren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t green either. They looked\u00e2\u0080\u00a6silver?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Before you could figure that out, you feel yourself being pulled up by an invisible force. You have absolutely no control and you begin to panic at first, but once you soon realize that whatever is pulling you is doing it slowly. In fact, it feels downright comforting. Your view of the wall of\u00e2\u0080\u00a6whatever it is pans upward. Now you just want to jerk your head up and see where your going, but the aura has you paralyzed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Soon, the silvery strands turn into a forest of thicker, white fibers. They are about as wide as your arm at their widest, and taper off at the end. From where you were, they look like someone took apart giant, puffy cotton balls and stuck them to the surface of the wall. You continue upward and the forest abruptly ends and a new shape appears. This one is smooth and colored like skin. In fact, the whole shape looks like it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s <i>made</i> of skin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Then it dawns on you. You next see a gaping hole, so deep that you can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t see the back of it. You do see it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s slimy wet floor, though, as well as glistening white formations that look like carved rocks. A humid gust of wind hits you from inside the cave, but you remain perfectly upright as you float upwards. Next you see a black object that looks like a human-sized sausage sticking out from the wall. It appears slightly moist, like the nose of a dog, but your not paying attention long enough to get a good look. As soon as you clear black object, you see two gold-colored ovals only slightly bigger than you plastered on the white surface of the wall. But these things weren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t just ovals. They were eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0And they were staring right at your puny, insignificant form. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You knew those eye anywhere. The pieces start falling into place as you suddenly realize what all that stuff was as you flew up here. The silver and white fibers weren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t strange blades of grass; they were fur. And they weren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t attached to a wall. They were attached to a body. All the rest were features of someone\u00e2\u0080\u0099s face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0No, it wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t just anyone\u00e2\u0080\u0099s face. It was the face of Silver the Hedgehog.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Your mouth is wide open, from a million different feelings that you couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t even begin to figure out. How did he get here? Why was he so <i>big</i>? Just what in name of the Seven Chaos Emeralds was going on here?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Your thoughts are silenced by Silver\u00e2\u0080\u0099s booming voice. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHEY, ARE YOU OKAY LITTLE GUY?\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0His voice shakes you to the bone and made your ears hurt. You want to fling your hands up to cover your eardrums, but the aura prevents you from moving. When you finally un-scrunch your face, you look into his huge golden eyes. They appear to be filled with a mixture of intrigue and genuine concern. But you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re too confused and terrified to tell if he wants to hurt you or not. If you answer him, he\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll know your alive and awake, which may not be a good thing if he decided to be less-than-friendly to your situation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Alternatively, you could play dead and not answer him at all. Maybe he\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll put you down and lose interest, and then you can hide and figure out just what the heck happened in guaranteed safety. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat do you do?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You were still hesitant about enlisting the behemoth hedgehog\u00e2\u0080\u0099s help, but the way you saw it, there was no other alternative. You didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t even know if you were still in your house anymore, nevertheless why Silver was a giant and holding you to his face. What possible hope could you have of solving this mess on your own, when just a short time ago Chaos Emeralds and anthropomorphic hedgehogs were about as real as a professional wrestling match? Things were obviously turned on their head, and if the situation was going to be crazy, you may as well embrace it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0But truth be told, there was another, more mischievous reason for your decision to draw attention to yourself. Ever since he was introduced into the series, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve had somewhat of a crush on Silver. You\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not sure if it was his naivet\u00c3\u00a9 and almost child-like sincerity towards almost everything he does, or his smoking body that was the hottest aspect about him, but either way you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve had a thing for the sexy hedgie from day one. And now you were at his total mercy; he could end you in an instant with a quick stomp of his massive boot or a squeeze the life out of you with his gigantic hand. For some reason, having gullible little Silver hold so much power over you was getting you pretty hot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Granted, you were still terrified for your life. Though if you really had to go, having your crush <i>literally</i> crush you to death sounded pretty appealing in your book. There were definitely worse ways to meet your maker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The titanic hedgehog stood motionless for a moment. You wonder what the problem was, and you panic at the thought that maybe he was thinking of what to do with you now that you were awake. Perhaps he wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t as innocent as you thought. You break out into a sweat, when you see him tilt his head up slightly and line your body up with his mouth. You peer into his gaping maw, moist with saliva and dank with his musty breath. His mouth was opening quickly, and your gut reaction is to squeeze your eyes shut in preparation to the inevitable, but you kept them open anyway. If he was going to eat you, then you wanted to enjoy every second of being sloshed around in Silver\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mouth before he either chewed you up or swallowed you whole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Then, you feel a sudden gust of cold air at your back. Before you could react, Silver\u00e2\u0080\u0099s voice explodes out of the chasm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cHEY! I SAID ARE YOU OKAY?\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Damn, that was loud. He was practically screaming at you, and you think to yourself that you wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be okay for long if he kept on shouting like that. But it appears that he didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t hear your reply after all. That made sense when you thought about it; his ears were about thirty feet above you, and even though they were big, your voice would be meager by comparison. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You want to shout that you are indeed okay, but before you can, you feel yourself gently float away from his face. He takes a few steps forward, which sound like crashing thunder with each foot fall, and then gently starts to lower you down. You were amazed at the kind of control he had with his telekinetic powers. You knew in the games that he had the strength to lift and hurl cars and robots with ease, so it was shocking to see that he could wield that power so delicately as well. You land on a hard surface, and the aura suddenly disappears, freeing you of your paralysis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Before you get up, you feel the rhythmic earthquakes as Silver walks away from you. You don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want him to get too far away from you, so you quickly get to your feet and start waving in his direction. But you stop in your tracks. This is the first time you got a real good look at your surroundings, and you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t like what you see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You were inside a house, but it wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t yours and it wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t normal sized. Just across from where you were standing was a sofa big enough to fill an entire stadium. You thought you could easily run a long oval across its three cushions like they were the track of your school\u00e2\u0080\u0099s football field. Since you were across from the couch, you figured out that you were standing on a long, rounded coffee table made of a dark brown wood. As such, you deduced that you were probably in the middle of the house\u00e2\u0080\u0099s living room. You scanned around, and from where you were standing you could see a small kitchen area that looked hundreds of yards away. You couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t see much else in there, as a wall cut off your view that probably led to a room or hallway of some kind on the other side. Opposite the couch was a TV that would dwarf the biggest Jumbotron you had ever seen. You scan right, and a book that was as thick as you were tall blocked most of your view, but you could see a door on the other side that was probably the main entrance to the house. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You\u00e2\u0080\u0099re relieved that Silver didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t walk that way; otherwise you may have been stuck in the house alone for who knows how long.  You don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t see the giant silver teen anywhere. After a moment of thought, you decide you have to do something to get him to come back. You may have been afraid before, but thinking on it you realize getting Silver involved was the right thing to do. Knowing him, he\u00e2\u0080\u0099d definitely help you out, if only he knew you were here. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Then you get an idea. You go over to the book and run around to the other side. Thankfully, it was a hardcover and the pages were indented from the hard outer casing, making a little lip you could push on to get more leverage. You push with all your might, and pretty soon you are able to move the book a few feet (or inches, in your case) towards the lip of the table. With one final heave, you push the book off the table and make it crash to the floor with a loud thud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0As planned, Silver came rushing in to see what the activity was all about. He floated in silently from the other side of the wall by the kitchen, arms raised in preparation for an attack. When one didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t come, he lowered himself to the floor and looked around with a confused look on his face. You jump up and down wildly, waving your arms and shouting his name. How he didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t see you right away was amazing, but this was Silver after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0After taking a few steps into the living room, his boot lands on the book you dropped. When he looks down to see what he stepped on, he sees you flailing around on the table. By the look on his face, he is totally shocked. You finally stop waving your arms, relieved that you can take a rest. Silver edges up to the table and kneels down on the balls of his feet to get a closer look at you. His titanic face became level with your tiny body, but his crown of hair stretched up into the sky like tall redwood trees. His sheer size still intimidated you, but there was no going back now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0He knew you were here, and he knew you were alive. The question is now, what will he do with you?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Silver raises one of his massive eyebrows and tilts his giant head to one side. He didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t look all that hostile towards you, but you stayed on your guard just in case. You weren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t sure what you would do if he did turn on you; in fact, as you looked at his titanic body, you were positive there would be nothing you could do. But in spite of that, every muscle in your body tensed as he gazed at you with those intense golden eyes, made even more intimidating by their size compared to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0He stared at you with that puzzled look for a minute, and then he cupped his hands around his mouth and shouted \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099M GLAD TO SEE THAT YOU\u00e2\u0080\u0099RE AWAKE. HOW ARE YOU FEELING?\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0His voice was louder than a jet engine taking off in close proximity. Though you scrunch your eyes and shoot your hands over your ears to protect them, it didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t help much at all. You kept them there as you try to stop the room from spinning, afraid that you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll feel the warmness of blood dripping through your fingers from your eardrums bursting. Thankfully, you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t feel any liquids dripping from your ear canals, and as you put your hands down you hear Silver\u00e2\u0080\u0099s voice again. He must have realized that he was causing you some tremendous pain, because his voice became softer, like a whisper transmitted over a loudspeaker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh jeez, sorry about that little guy. You\u00e2\u0080\u0099re so small, I was afraid you couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t hear me. Guess I didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have to yell though, huh?\u00e2\u0080\u009d He gave a short, nervous laugh that you couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t deny was simply adorable. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You felt noticeably more relaxed as you could sense that he wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t going to hurt you after all. But try as you might, you couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t bring yourself to be totally back to normal. Just like staring up at a huge skyscraper, there was an inherent intimidation you felt at the sight of Silver that wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t go away. You suppose that the possibility of him stomping or otherwise crushing you, even accidentally, was still a real possibility. And he was just so damn big.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0He continued speaking in a slightly louder tone. This was probably his normal speaking voice, which was certainly loud at this distance from his mouth, but at least it was tolerable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cJust who are you anyway? I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve never seen anything like you around Mobius before.\u00e2\u0080\u009d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0He thought for a moment, then a big smile crossed his face and his eyes lit up. He looked just like a little kid when he asked \u00e2\u0080\u009cAre you from the future?\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You try to shout to him that you are in fact not from the future, but its no use. He definitely sees you trying to say something, but he just looks puzzled again, and perhaps even a little flustered. He definitely can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t hear you, and you realize that unless you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re shouting directly into the gigantic triangular cavern that was his ear, he\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll never be able to hear what your saying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Thinking fast, you shake your entire upper torso left and right, making an exaggerated symbol for \u00e2\u0080\u009cNo\u00e2\u0080\u009d that you hope he recognizes. He looks like he does, because the distressed look on his face is momentarily replaced with one of satisfaction before it again changes again to disappointment.<br>\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAw, really?  I was hoping to hear from someone about what the future was like now that the Iblis problem has been taken care of.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He closes his eyes and shrugs his massive shoulders before saying, \u00e2\u0080\u009cOh well, I guess that can wait. So then where are you from?\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0There would be immense difficulty in explaining your situation to him without being able to talk. You think for a moment and then get an idea. You hold out your hand, palm upwards and make a scribbling motion with your other hand. You hope he understands what you mean by it. He squints down at you; probably trying to figure out what it is your doing. Then, his face lights up in the cutest way possible. Deep down you kind of wanted to snuggle him for being so charming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he says. \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou want to write me a note?\u00e2\u0080\u009d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You shake your head emphatically and you watch as Silver\u00e2\u0080\u0099s body glows that same bluish-green hue. He raises his hand in the direction of the couch and from behind it floats in a notepad and pencil, covered in an aura that was the same color as the one you were trapped in. He gently places the stationary in front of you. The table didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t shake or vibrate like you were expecting; apparently Silver was being very careful as he hands you what you need.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The pencil is far too long to wield effectively, so you walk over to the graphite point and snap it off with a forceful heel drop. The broken shard of black is the perfect size for your tiny hand, so you take it with you over to the paper. You begin writing down what had happened to you, running back and forth along the page as you wrote in letters that were bigger than you were. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The going was slow, but you were intensely focused on giving as accurate a description as you could. While you were focused on writing, you noticed out of the corner of your eye Silver raise himself to his full height. A moment later, you feel the ground shake as he walks over towards the couch. Then you hear a loud crumple-crunch sound as he sat down across from you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You glance up briefly, and you catch a glimpse at most of his body. His thin, taut legs stretch out towards you, spanning the gap between the table and couch and connecting to his crotch and firm, young butt that you could just barely see. You couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t see anything between his legs, but you figured whatever he was packing was either hidden behind all that fur, or that you just didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have enough time to find it. His tummy was tight and flat, covered in those silvery gray locks of hair up until his chest. You always thought that the V-shaped tuft of fur made him look even more physically fit, as it gave him the appearance of a barreled-out chest. His arms looked just as firm as his legs, and they seemed just as powerful. He rested his hands on his knees as you worked, sitting on the edge of the couch and hunched over you. His young face was transfixed on you, eyes glowing with fascination as you scribbled on your pad. If you were your normal size, you would have wrapped him up in your arms right there and\u00e2\u0080\u00a6well, the thought of it stimulated you and you felt your lower tummy buzz with delight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0But you had to focus. This was no time to fantasize; you had to tell him what was going on. After a few more minutes of exhausting writing, you put your little piece of graphite down and fall over in a heap. This should be some kind of exercise regiment, you think to yourself. Maybe when you get home, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll patent the idea; you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll probably call it something like \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe Writing for Giants method of weight loss\u00e2\u0080\u009d. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Silver replies quickly, as he had been reading what you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve wrote as you were going along. \u00e2\u0080\u009cOkay, I think I get it. You were transported here from this planet\u00e2\u0080\u00a6Earth, right? And other than that you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know anything else about how you got here or why you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re so small?\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You shake your head yes, somewhat upset that you can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t give him any more information. He must have noticed this, because he looked upset too for a moment. But then he lit up again, and not in that blue-green way. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cI know,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cShadow and I used Chaos Control to travel into the past. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m sure that if we get all the Chaos Emeralds, I can use Chaos Control to send you back home!\u00e2\u0080\u009d He jumps out of his seat, and in his excitement he bumps the table with his knees. The shockwave is enough to make you lose your balance and fall flat on your face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhoops, sorry little guy\u00e2\u0080\u009d Silver says. He activates his Psychokinesis and helps you up. In spite of his size, he really is exactly how you thought he would be. He\u00e2\u0080\u0099s kind, gentle and willing to help out someone in need without even a moment\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hesitation. Even though you just met him, you feel like you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve known him for a long time. You swell with love for him until you felt like doing backflips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0But then another thought crosses your mind. If he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just like his in-game persona, than maybe he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just as gullible too. His gargantuan body was simply god-like, and it wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t every day that you got to hang out with your anthropomorphic crush. You didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have much to go back to in your world anyway, so why rush to get back there? Maybe you could stay, and \u00e2\u0080\u009cconvince\u00e2\u0080\u009d him to do stuff that you had only ever dreamed of before now. Just thinking about it was making you excited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0On the other hand, you really should try and get back. You\u00e2\u0080\u0099d still get plenty of time with him as you both hunted for the Chaos Emeralds, and that would probably take a really long time as it was. Perhaps it was better to get started as soon as possible. Still, even if you did stuff now, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099d still have all that adventuring time with him anyway. The Emeralds won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t hunt themselves, after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You were conflicted. You could go the logical route or hold off and have some fun first. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You decide that fun should come first. Every time you picture going back to your world, all you can think about are all the responsibilities you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll have when you get there. Rent will have to be paid, chores done, and you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll have to deal with stress from countless people and situations every single day. You would probably spend every day running around like a headless chicken, only to go to bed at night feeling no more accomplished than you did when you woke up. You may not have intended to go to another world, but perhaps this was just the kind of escape from reality you needed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You suddenly get very excited. But the question remained: how to get Silver to go along with it? You don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think he would outright let you do some of the nastier stuff you had in mind; in spite of the fact that you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve known him for years and years now, he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s only met you a few minutes ago. You wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want to creep him out or anything, and your chances of getting a yes out of him would be totally zero. You had to be cleverer than that. So what do you do?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Well, you certainly were grateful to him for helping you out. Perhaps showing your appreciation would be the best way to get things started. Besides, once you found the Emeralds you may not have a chance to thank him properly before you left for your world. You had just as strong an urge to display your thanks as you did getting your jollies, so killing two birds with one stone seemed like the greatest course of action to take. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You excitedly grab your piece of graphite and get right to work on another message. In the meanwhile Silver had gotten up and silently floated over to the kitchen area. He appeared to be using his powers to make meals of some kind, though you couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t entirely tell what they were supposed to be. Perhaps it was something they make in the future for long journeys or something. Or, maybe Silver just isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t great at making food; you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t remember any sources say he was a gourmet chef or anything. Either way, you were too caught up thinking of what you were writing to pay much attention to that. You feverishly write for a good ten minutes, constantly running back and forth across the page without stopping for a break. Your excitement was building, and by the time you were done you were so pumped up on adrenaline and lust that you didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t feel the least bit tired this time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Just a moment later, Silver floats back into the living room. He\u00e2\u0080\u0099s carrying a bag that must have held the lunches he had prepared, along with some other things that were sticking out of various side pockets and pouches. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cOkay little fella, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m ready to go! I packed us some snacks and\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\u00e2\u0080\u009d He stops when he sees your note. He repeats what it says. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou want to thank me for helping you out? But I haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t done anything yet.\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You quickly scribble some more on the page, explaining that there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s really no rush to get back to your world. You go on to say that, even at your miniscule height, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099d still like to hang around Mobius for a little while. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Silver reads it and says, \u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, I get it now. You want to stick around here for a while, and you wanted to show your gratitude.\u00e2\u0080\u009d  A friendly smile grows on his face. You wished you could reach up there and kiss him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cOkay,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he says, dropping the bag at his feet with a crashing thud. You were starting to get used to the fact that every little thing Silver did was enough to floor you from the vibrations, so you didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t fall over this time. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI was just about to take a load off right before I found you anyway. A break might be just what I need, too.\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Silver puts one gigantic hand on his hip and asks, \u00e2\u0080\u009cSo, what did you have in mind first?\u00e2\u0080\u009d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0There were so many choices you could hardly decide. Your heart was racing at the thought of it. Immediately, your eyes fall to his gigantic boots. From where the rubber and fabric material met the golden clasp just under his knees all the way down to the upper part of the shoe was utterly immaculate. It was only when you get to the sole that you see the flecks of dried mud and grime that had splattered up the sides of the titanic footwear as Silver walked all over Mobius. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You take it that his shoes probably weren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t dirtier because he flew almost everywhere. But even walking or running short distances would accumulate some dirt over time. And judging by the filthiness of his soles, you could tell that he probably used those sexy legs of his more often than you previously thought. You suppose they wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have been so toned if he didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t get his exercise. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The thought of having your way with those boots (and the feet inside of them) was taking your breath away. Maybe that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s exactly what you\u00e2\u0080\u0099d start with. Then again, you shouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t rush this either. Maybe if you thought more about it, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099d come up with something better.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Damn those soles are hot. You find that you can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t resist their allure; they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re calling to you like a siren\u00e2\u0080\u0099s song, and you want nothing more than to take the plunge in after them. You fake a posture of intense thought, just to give Silver the impression that you were just spitballing ideas in case he didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t agree. He looks like he's thinking too, but you didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want him to suggest something else, so you wave him down and began signing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You point at him and then at the couch behind you. He seems to understand that, as he then hovers straight over you and sits down where you tell him. He doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t look like he was following what you had in mind, but he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not questioning it either. Next, you sit down and make an exaggerated show of taking your shoes off. Once you wrest them free of your feet, you put your legs straight out in front of you and lean back on your hands laced behind you head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cWait a minute,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Silver says. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou want me to take off my boots and put my feet on the table?\u00e2\u0080\u009d He looks more perplexed than disgusted, like he was trying to figure out the answer to a riddle of some kind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Your excitement swells in spite of yourself, and you shake your head yes a bit more enthusiastically than you intended. To help clarify why, you rub the air with your open palms, miming a massage. Your heart is beating out of your chest at this point. You\u00e2\u0080\u0099re so close; you could almost taste those gorgeous gargantuan feet of his.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, okay. You want to give me a foot message, is that right?\u00e2\u0080\u009d he says. You wildly shake your head yes, to the point where you almost give yourself whiplash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou sure about that,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he remarks. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI mean, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been out all day, and I haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t taken my boots off yet. My feet will probably be pretty smelly in there.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Again, he looks more genuine than grossed out. He may be truly concerned about disgusting you with his feet, and you suppose that he didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want to appear rude by not warning you first. Of course, the sweatier and smellier they were, the more enjoyment you\u00e2\u0080\u0099d get out of it. But he didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t need to know that, so you make an exaggerated motion of shrugging it off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, okay then. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not going to complain if you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t. You know, a foot massage sounds pretty good right now, anyway.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He shrugs his shoulders, seeming completely oblivious to the state of profound joy you found yourself in. This had to be a dream, all of it. There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no way something this fantastic could possibly be real. You\u00e2\u0080\u0099d pinch yourself, but you\u00e2\u0080\u0099d probably hurt yourself in your fervor. Besides, who in their right mind would want to wake up from <i>this</i>?<br>\r\n <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0He reaches down to the metal clasp of his right boot and gives it a sharp counter-clockwise twist. The ring unlatches and comes apart, and Silver places the two pieces on the couch beside him. He repeats the process with the other boot, then takes his right foot and crosses it over his other knee. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Silver wiggles his boot and is eventually able to wrestle it free from his foot. He was wearing electric blue socks that matched the blue tones in the rest of his outfit. As soon as he pops them off, you catch a whiff of their aroma. They have a dry smell to them, like Swiss cheese but less intense, and mixed with a lot of sweat. The other boot comes off in the same way, and the intensity of the smell grows even more. You realize that in your memorization you made your way to the edge of the table, so you back up far enough for Silver to put his feet up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0He then places both of his colossal, blue-socked feet in front of you with a crash. The ground under you quakes from the severe impact. His feet are each as tall as a three and a half story building, stretching high up into the air and partially blocking your view of his face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The soles of his socks were slightly blacker than the rest of his foot, most likely from picking up dust and debris while he walked around his house. And they were sweaty too. The socks look soaked in it, like he had just waked through a series of puddles before offering is feet to you. Besides the extraordinary taste the perspiration would add, it also had the benefit of shrinking his socks more snuggly around his feet. You could see every smooth curve and rounded edge through the socks\u00e2\u0080\u0099 fabric. In fact, the socks were so form fitting that you could almost make out the shape of each individual toe, if they weren't so high above you, that is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You\u00e2\u0080\u0099re locked in a trance, staring at them and smelling them from a distance. Your senses overload with immense pleasure, and the little friend between your legs was responding in kind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You must have been transfixed for a few minutes, because you suddenly hear Silver say, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t grossed you out, have I little guy? If it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s too much for you, we can do something else instead.\u00e2\u0080\u009d You have to blink a few times to shake off the effects of the trance. When you finally process what he said, you shake your head no and take a few steps forward. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You reach out and begin rubbing Silver\u00e2\u0080\u0099s heel in large circles with both hands. They are soft to the touch; the material of his socks is similar to those of his gloves. They feel silky smooth, and are actually thicker than you initially thought. While you can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t feel his skin through the material of the socks, the thickness of their fibers has be benefit of making them extra absorbent. The instant you touch his feet, your hands get coated in a sticky film of foul smelling sweat. The smell is so powerful that you can practically taste his feet without even putting them to your mouth. But of course, why would you settle for just that when the beauty was right in front of you, just waiting for you to have a taste.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You spread your arms wide and embrace as much of his foot as you can. You then start rubbing your entire body across the wall of flesh, smearing his pungent perspiration all over you. You catch a taste of it on your lips, and the musky and salty concoction sends you into a whirl. Without thinking you begin making out with the patch of sock in front of you, running your tongue and lips all across its surface, greedily lapping up as much of his fresh foot taste as you can. Your member grows hard as stone in your pants, and the sensation of brushing up against your crush\u00e2\u0080\u0099s gigantic sole is almost enough to make you cream yourself right there. But what pushes you over the edge is what you hear next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Though you can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t see his face from underneath his foot, you hear Silver start to lightly whimper when you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re rubbing and kneading grows more intense. Was he actually enjoying this? You pictured his cute, lovable face; his eyes closed and lips parted but relaxed. Perhaps he had a content little smile on his face as he lies there in total sensual bliss. Pre-cum is dripping out of you uncontrollably, like a leaky faucet. In fact, you couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t tell if the wet spot between your legs was from Silver\u00e2\u0080\u0099s excretions or your own. You\u00e2\u0080\u0099re amazed that you haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t shot already. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Before your able to just whip out your member and finish yourself off, you see his heel tilt away from you. The sky above you darkens, and you look up to see the electric-blue foot tilting down towards you. It comes down more quickly than you can react, smothering you with skin and sweat. As soon as you are totally covered under his sole, he stops applying pressure. You lay there on your back, covered in a blanket of footy goodness and taking in your dank surroundings. Then you hear Silver\u00e2\u0080\u0099s muffled voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cTry and get the rest of my foot now. You know, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re pretty good at this. Keep it up, little fella.\u00e2\u0080\u009d His approval is like a shot in the arm, sending waves of satisfaction down your spine. He does like it! Your delight swells, and you get to work right away at the new section of foot pressing into your body. You manipulate the skin with every part of your body, wanting to please him as much as you were pleasing yourself. All the while, you kiss his god-like soles like they were your impassioned lover. Over one patch of the sock, you clamp your mouth down and begin sucking vigorously. You swirl your tongue in frenzied circles under your suctioned lips, sweat and spit mingling together and setting off fireworks of bitter, cheese-like flavor on your taste buds. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Then, seemingly out of nowhere, he lifts his foot up off you. You're confused at first as the teenager's sole rises above you, but you understand quickly when he sharply brings it down on you again, trapping you under a new spot. Unable to take it anymore, you practically rip open the fly of your pants and let your boner rub freely against the hedgehog's sole. Your constant gyrating and twisting stimulates your now free dick, drowning you in endless waves of pleasure. You\u00e2\u0080\u0099re working yourself up, drenching Silver\u00e2\u0080\u0099s foot in pre-cum just as much as saliva. Then, your balls tighten and your dick grows hard and sensitive. You close your eyes as you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re about to shoot, but right before you do you feel the pressure of Silver\u00e2\u0080\u0099s foot lift off of your body. You open your eyes just in time to see his sole angled above you. He adjusts his foot again an crashes back down on you. You moan with pleasure when his foot contacts with your dick, and you explode with bliss and cum. You don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t even attempt to start rubbing again, opting instead to thrust your hips back and forth as you spread your seed all over the titanic teen's soles. You cum more than you ever have before, and when it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s all over, you and Silver\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sock are drenched with jizz. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0As you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re gathering yourself in your musty hideaway, Silver lifts his foot up off of you and straightens out his legs. You don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t even get back up, exhausted by all the physical activity, but in your stupor you hear Silver mention what he wants to do next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0He says\u00e2\u0080\u00a6</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You have to lie there and recover for a minute. Your orgasm has drained your energy so completely that you had to fight just to keep from passing out. You take a few deep breaths through your nose. The fresh air invigorates you, clearing your mind and allowing you to process what he had just asked. He wants you to do his other foot now? You can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t believe it. He actually liked it. Your heart does flips in your chest, but your body refuses your commands to get up. The best you could do is lazily sit yourself upright. Though you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re too high on the pleasure now, you can tell by your stiff movement that you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going to be terribly sore when this is all over. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You look down at yourself. You\u00e2\u0080\u0099re drenched in hot sweat, no doubt a mixture of yours and Silver\u00e2\u0080\u0099s. You feel your hair matted together in wild shapes, and that combined with your fatigue probably made it look like you just rolled out of bed. Your mind starts to clear and you are suddenly aware of your open fly. Panic jolts you to your mind awake, and you hurriedly stuff your shrunken penis back into your pants. You hope Silver didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t notice what you did underneath his foot. You lost control while under there; his feet were just too damn perfect, and the smell got to you so badly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You never planned on telling the titanic hedgehog about your crush on him or your fetish. At best, you were hoping to sneak in a few whiffs of his socks while he was sleeping, or have a couple of peeks at his bare soles every now and again. Sure, rubbing one out while he wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t looking was one thing. But you were practically having sex with his foot under there. Your face stings with a mixture of embarrassment and guilt. Your pants are soaked with your own cum, and you notice a huge dark spot on Silver\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sock where you spread it around on him. You pray to God that he doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t feel that wet mark before it dries. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0If he found out about your true feelings, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no telling what he\u00e2\u0080\u0099d do. He may be so grossed out that rescinds his offer to help you. Or he may just crush you into a sticky red spot on the soles of his shoes. Either way, you didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want to chance it. You make a promise to yourself that you won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t get carried away like that again. You\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll just go over and massage his other foot like promised, no funny stuff and no distractions. After that, well, maybe you won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t try to do anything sneaky from then on. Truth was, nothing could beat the experience you just had, and sneaking around would only increase the chances of you getting caught. Your memories of this day will last you a lifetime, and should be good enough fapping material for just as long. You figure that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s good enough. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You must have been sitting there for a long time, because as soon as you settled your game plan, Silver spread his legs and planted his socked feet on either side of you. He looks worried at first, like he was afraid something had happened to you. When he sees you sitting there though, his disposition noticeably improves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0He says, \u00e2\u0080\u009cOh man, you look pretty worn out down there. You don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have to do the other one if you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not feeling up to it. You did such a good job on the first one, I feel totally relaxed already.\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0His pity touches you, but you shake your head no and stand up. The sooner you get this over with, the sooner you can fall asleep. And besides, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re feeling a bit better now, and since you won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be sexing up the underside of his foot, you figure you won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be adding too much to your level of fatigue. Just imagine sleeping on his soft chest-puff when your done, and you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll make it through fine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0He shrugs his shoulders in his usual cute and na\u00c3\u00afve fashion, and then closes his wall off feet. You make your way over to his other socked sole and immediately began rubbing away at the heel. This foot is just as fresh as the first one was at the start, so you are instantly covered in reeking sweat once again. In spite of yourself, your dick twitches in your pants. How could you possibly be getting excited again so soon? Granted, your senses were flooded with nothing but the teenaged hedgehog\u00e2\u0080\u0099s god-like feet, but you were so pooped from before that you though you would be able to do this without so much as a tickle from your little head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0But you promised yourself that you wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t risk exposing yourself like that. No matter how hard you got, you wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t whip it out and start stimulating yourself again. There was too much at stake, and most of all you didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want to disappoint or gross out Silver like that. You had a crush on him, and betraying his trust like that seemed so wrong now that you thought about it. You had to be strong, for him if no one else. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Still\u00e2\u0080\u00a6there was nothing wrong with rubbing your whole body against his foot again, was there? He did say he liked it when you did that, and pleasing him was most important, right? If you wound up getting stimulated too, well then that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just icing on the cake. You spread your arms wide and start rubbing every body part across the surface of the sock. It all feels so smooth to your touch, and the smell feels like its getting in your nostrils and just sticking there, blocking out all other smells from your notice. You lick your lips a few times and relish in the fresh foot taste again, but you stop yourself from making out with them. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a line you refuse to cross, since you know where that will lead you. Instead you move around the base of his heel, trying to rub as big an area as you can manage. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You\u00e2\u0080\u0099re just getting into the groove of things and rubbing the side of his heel when all of a sudden you hear him ask, \u00e2\u0080\u009cSay, do you mind if I take my socks off? I think it\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll feel even nicer on my bare feet.\u00e2\u0080\u009d You look up at him, shocked that he even offered. To your surprise, he looks pleading, almost like he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s begging you to say yes. Your better judgment begins to crumble, and you shake your head no, that you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t mind at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Rather than using his psychokinesis like you thought he would, Silver takes his feet off the table and peels his socks off by hand. You\u00e2\u0080\u0099re so transfixed on what you see that everything appears to be moving in slow motion. He first hooks his finger under the elastic lip at his ankle. Then, he pulls downward, exposing his bare silver-furred heel. Then he pulls straight out, revealing his beautifully smooth arch, then the thick-but-creamy ball. Finally he yanks the sock off of his toes, and you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re finally able to see them in all their glory. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The five beauties are structured in a similar way to human toes, though they are covered in the same silver fur that grew on the rest of his body. They were fairly long and thin, and every single one of them was bigger than you. The pinkie toe is at least twice your size, and each of them scaled up until the big toe, which is at least four times larger than you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0After he brushes the bottoms off with his hand a few times, he stretches and wiggles those soft, round toes of his. You were sent into a tailspin. Then, before you know it, he had places his naked foot in front of you with an earth shattering thud. He wiggles his toes again, in anticipation of your miniscule touch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You try your best to keep your composure, but as soon as your hand touches the bare sole you are overcome with pure ecstasy. Somehow, his natural feet were even softer than his socks. The fur sheltering his buttery soft skin parted between your fingers, coating even finer areas in moistness and stink. His bare feet must have been much more sensitive, because you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t even start rubbing that hard before you hear your hedgehog crush moan with pleasure. You keep on rubbing, and his content sighs grow more and more frequent. He was complementing you now, telling you in relaxed whispers to keep it up and not to stop. His pleasure multiplies your own, and the bombardment of sensations was becoming too much for you to take. Your boner was now rock solid, and painfully jabbing into your pants and leaking precum like mad. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Aw, to hell with it. Before you know it you strip completely nude. You don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t give a damn any more if he sees you or not, you have to get off now. You rub your bare body against his skin, shivering in delight as you feel every hair and patch of skin caress your naked form. You hear Silver cry out in pleasure, and that only helps in throwing you further into a frenzy. You take his foot fur into your mouth, savoring the strong musky taste and sucking every fiber clean of salty sweat. Your dick is drenching Silver\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sole in precum and your motions are kneading it into his skin and all over his fur. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0After a few minutes of that, you break off of his foot. You suddenly have another great idea. You kneel down and get your penis as close to the floor as you can. Once your balls are just grazing the cool tabletop, you jam your rock hard boner in the gap where Silver\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sole met the ground. You shiver in pleasure as the warm skin envelops your cock. Without a second thought, you start humping. As your dick is stimulated, you lap at his tasty feet like a madman. You want to take in every ounce of his sweat and gulp it down like it was the first thing you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve eaten in weeks. You pump your hips faster and faster, feeling your loins tighten in response. You were getting close. You hump faster and faster, until you feel a final wave of pleasure surge through your lower body. Your dick lets forth a torrent of cum, injecting it into the space and smearing it into the giant teen\u00e2\u0080\u0099s skin. Every pump shakes you to your very core, draining you of both essence and energy. When you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re finally done you collapse into a heap, barely conscious but completely satisfied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0In your state of profound exhaustion, you fail to notice Silver\u00e2\u0080\u0099s foot move away from you, revealing his face to you again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0How does he react?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You hear Silver ask if you\u2019re okay, but it barely registers in your brain. Fatigue finally catches up with you, and you\u2019re powerless against its embrace. You drift off to sleep in spite of yourself, fully naked and covered in jizz and sweat. You imagine Silver\u2019s foot sweat mixing with your own on your body. It\u2019s a comforting thought, and it\u2019s enough to lull you into a deep sleep. But your secret\u2019s out, there\u2019s no denying that now. Shit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou come to a half hour later. As you open your eyes, you become aware of something soft cradling your prostrate body. You take a dazed look at your surroundings, and notice that you\u2019re lying on the couch. Your head and upper back are sunken into the biggest and fluffiest throw pillow that you\u2019ve ever seen in your life. Stretched out before you and covering the entire rest of the couch is a blanket made of plush white fleece. Everything is soft against your skin. But you can\u2019t help but think that they couldn\u2019t compare to Silver\u2019s socks or his sexy feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWait, Silver. He\u2019d seen you right before you passed out. You suddenly become aware of your nakedness underneath the blanket. Out of pure instinct you pull the blankets closer into your body, as if that would help hide the shame you felt. What were you thinking, stripping down like that? And with his bare feet, no less! There was no way in hell that he didn\u2019t feel what you were doing under there, though even if he didn\u2019t, he could piece it together when he saw you passed out naked on the table. He may have been gullible, but he wasn\u2019t stupid. Embarrassment burned your face, and you wanted to crawl under those blankets and never come out again. What must he think of you now? Can he even look you in the face? Could you look in his?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight before the anguish and guilt could totally smother you, a question pops into your mind. Where is Silver, anyway? You take a look around the house, but he\u2019s nowhere to be seen. You look over the edge of the couch. His shoes and socks were still there, so he didn\u2019t leave the house. You contemplate getting up to look for him, but then you remember that you have no clothes. You slump back down in a heap of melancholy, bitterly reminding yourself that he probably hates your guts right now. He was probably in his room, thinking about what to do with the nasty little pervert that just came all over his feet. The more and more you sank into a dark depression; the more and more you thought you deserved a good, fatal crushing underneath his godly soles. But picturing that scenario gave your dick a little twitch, which only served to push you further into self-loathing. There must be something really wrong with you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment, you heard crashing footsteps. They were coming from the other side of the wall that blocked off your view from the kitchen, but once they reach the edge they stopped abruptly. A moment later, Silver floated around the corner. His gloves were off, and floating next to his head were a series of dots. You have no idea what those things could possibly be, but when he gets closer you realize that they\u2019re your clothes. He approaches the coffee table, and the clothes begin drifting gently towards its surface. As they fly, you notice that they are being carefully folded, and placed on the tabletop with care. When he\u2019s done, they\u2019re arranged in a neat little line right across from where you lay. You look back up at him in time to see his gaze shift towards you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe wears an awkward but compassionate smile. \u201cHey, look who\u2019s awake.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe floats over to the other end of the couch and takes a seat. He\u2019s sitting on his shins, feet under his butt. In the back of your mind, you think that he\u2019s sitting like that because he\u2019s afraid to have his feet out with you sitting across from him. You feel your face grow warm as you stifle back tears. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI hope you don\u2019t mind,\u201d he says as he tilts his head towards your clothes. \u201cBut I washed your stuff for you. If you want, I can leave you alone and you can get dressed.\u201d You sheepishly shake your head yes, and without another word Silver floats your clothes onto the couch in front of you, and then levitates out of the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou get dressed while beating yourself up. Judging how awkward he is, you could tell he hates you. He probably can\u2019t even stand to look at you anymore. Forget about him helping you to get back home; that\u2019s about a pipe dream at this point. But that doesn\u2019t matter as much to you as what he thinks of you. He was so nice to you, willing to go out of his way to help you out, and you betrayed his trust. And what do you get out of that? Just a few minutes of sexual stimulation? None of that was worth the price of Silver\u2019s\u2026what, friendship? You weren\u2019t even friends, you just popped into his house out of nowhere and asked to rub his feet. What kind of twisted world were you living in? You start to physically shake from the grief, getting so bad that it becomes difficult to put your shocks back on. After a minute you finally succeed, but the pain doesn\u2019t get any better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as you finish Silver peeks around the bend. Noticing that your dressed, he walks over to the couch and jumps up over the far arm. He hovers down slowly so that his landing is no more disruptive than your own miniscule footsteps. He sits in that same position again, and though you try to not let it bother you, you just can\u2019t help it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou both sit in agonizing silence for a moment. His eyes are lowered and his brow is furrowed, no doubt thinking about what to say. You can\u2019t take it to see him like this, his once proud and happy face turned to prudishness and embarrassment. And it was your fault. Just watching him sit there, searching desperately for what to say, was enough to get you to tear up. Your sight became swimmy, and hot streaks course down your cheeks. You want nothing more than to sit there, miserably wailing, but you don\u2019t want to upset Silver any more than you already had. You wipe them away as quick as you can, and try to compose yourself before he notices.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a few more minutes, Silver cracks a crooked smile and says simply \u201cSo\u2026you like my feet, don\u2019t you?\u201d You find there little point in lying to him now. You shake your head yes, feeling absolutely pathetic for having to admit it like this. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd that whole foot massage thing, that was just an excuse to get close to them, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d You can\u2019t hold it back any more. To hear him say it, to acknowledge your sinister act, was the final nail in the coffin. You sob uncontrollably as you give your head a little affirmative shake. You turn away from him and huddle in the corner of the couch, face burning from a stream of tears. Your running nose is causing you to sniffle like a little kid, and in your mind you picture Silver looking on you with a sense of abject repulsion. Right now, you want nothing more than to just shrivel up and die. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you feel a gentle nudging on your whole upper arm. You turn to see Silver kneeling across the couch towards you, getting your attention with a light touch of his finger. He looks\u2026was that a look of concern? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou\u2019re caught off guard for a minute, and you wipe your nose in your forearm when he says, \u201cDon\u2019t be upset, little guy. I\u2019m not mad at you or anything, I\u2019m just kind of surprised, I guess. I knew people could get off to some weird stuff, but I never would\u2019ve thought my <i>feet</i> would be one of them.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis emphasis on that damned word made you shudder with guilt. Tears start to well up again, but Silver says, \u201cYou don\u2019t have to feel ashamed about it. For what it\u2019s worth, I\u2019m not really grossed out by it or anything like that.\u201d His face lights up with childlike innocence once gain. \u201cIn fact, I really liked what you were doing down there, while it lasted. It felt great when I had you under my feet and you were moving all around. No way I could get that from anybody that was my size!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWere you hearing him right? Was he really not upset with what you did? There was no way; he was just being nice to you to get you to stop crying. But you look into his eyes and see that there isn\u2019t an ounce of insincerity to be found in them. They gaze into yours, saying a million comforting things in a way words just can\u2019t. God almighty, he <i>was</i> telling the truth. He didn\u2019t hate you after all. In fact, he <i>liked</i> what you did. Everything starts to sink in, and for the longest time you\u2019re speechless as the pieces start falling into place. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you cry again. But this time, the tears you shed are from a well of a deep seeded joy. You hug onto his finger tightly, and bury your face in his fur. It\u2019s cool and soft on your hot face, and even with your stuffy nose you don\u2019t smell a hint of his sweat on them. You nuzzle the giant digit for what seems like twenty minutes (though it was probably only a couple seconds) before coming up to get a big gulp of air. You catch a glimpse of Silver\u2019s face, plastered with a look of sheepish concern. You give your biggest, goofiest smile you can manage through your river of tears, and you see his face slowly begin to soften. Eventually, he\u2019s grinning down at you too, stroking your back with his other massive hand. You just stand there, gripping his finger and basking in all these wonderful feelings you were experiencing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don\u2019t want the moment to end, but in time you peel yourself away from Silver\u2019s finger, wiping your face on your arm as he settles back in his original position. He yawns deeply, and then looks at the clock hanging on the wall. You do the same, and you realize it\u2019s actually pretty late. Just how long were you crying for, anyway?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I don\u2019t know about you, little guy, but I\u2019m pretty beat. I think I\u2019ll turn in early.\u201d He stops and ponders for a second. \u201cI don\u2019t want anything to happen to you, so if you want you can come sleep by me. Unless you\u2019re happy here on the couch, I can probably set something up for you so you have everything you need for the night.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat do you do?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You reach down and pat the blanket underneath you. Sleeping with Silver does sound nice; but once you calmed down, you were struck by just how tired you really were. After the day you had, you want nothing more than to just fall back into your fluffy pillow and pass out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBesides, maybe you\u2019ll talk to Silver tomorrow about getting started looking for the Chaos Emeralds. You\u2019re still in no rush to get home, but you figure that it\u2019ll still take a while to find them\u2026or take them from whoever\u2019s holding onto them. You\u2019d have plenty of time together in the meantime, and if Silver gets eager and wants to start tomorrow, you want to be ready to help out any way you can.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor just a split second after you signaled your preference, you see Silver\u2019s lips twitch into a sad smile. Did he really look\u2026disappointed? Before you could contemplate it further, the look was gone and replaced with that child-like cheerfulness you loved so much. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, that\u2019s cool with me. I\u2019ll make sure you\u2019re settled in, then.\u201d He glows with blue energy, and the coffee table edges closer to you. Now you could easily walk across to it without jumping over any gaps. You look up towards the kitchen and see three small bowls, two blue and one white, float out of the cupboards. One blue bowl is brought over to the table empty, while the other two fly towards the sink and are filled to the brim with water. When they\u2019re full, Silver places on either side of the empty one. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSince you\u2019re so small, I figure getting up and going to the bathroom will be a problem for you. So if you need to go at night, use the empty blue bowl. The full blue one is for washing up, and if you get thirsty you can drink from the white one.\u201d He\u2019s beaming with pride for being able to come up with this system for you. The good feelings are infectious, and you can\u2019t help but feel happy for him too. You give a slight bow with your hands pressed together in a motion you hope came off as thanks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re welcome little buddy,\u201d he says. Hearing that from him causes your heart to skip a beat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I\u2019m off to bed. I\u2019ll see you tomorrow, okay?\u201d He looks on you with such amiability that you feel your insides warm up as if lit by a furnace. How could you not fall in love with him when he looked at you like <i>that</i>? You nod your head in approval, and Silver floats himself up off the couch and around the bend out of sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The energy you got from his presence vanishes, and fatigue quickly fills the void. You lie down and pull the sheets over you. The moment you put your head to the pillow, you\u2019re out like a light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wake up a few hours later. It\u2019s the dead of night, but the bright white moonlight filtering into the house lights the place as well as any nightlight. Though its toasty warm under the blankets, your exposed face and arms feel the brisk night air as it blows through the empty living room. Your mouth feels incredibly dry, no doubt from all that foot sucking you were doing all day. You crawl out of bed, make your way over to the drinking water bowl and begin guzzling. The cool water feels so good going down, and you don\u2019t stop drinking until you have to come up to get a lungful of air. As you\u2019re panting over the bowl, a loud burp leaves your lips. Its taste reminds you of Silver, and your dick shivers in response. Now that you knew he was cool with everything that happened, you don\u2019t feel nearly as bad when you think back on your escapades. Sure, you did lie to him, and that still stung a bit, but in the end you both had a good time. You had a great time, in fact. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThinking about Silver\u2019s soft, fluffy soles covered in your cream got you hard in spite of yourself. If you\u2019re being honest, you kind of want to creep into Silver\u2019s room and see those sterling beauties one more time. But the more and more you think about it, the more impossible it seems. First, you\u2019d have to make it to his room, which might be miles away at your current size. Well, actually, the first thing to do would be to get off this table without getting killed; a task that seemed difficult in its own right. But even if you got down and made the trek, there was no guarantee that you\u2019d be able to get into his room if the door was closed. Maybe you could slip under it at your size, but maybe not either. You really don\u2019t like the prospect of making that trip all for nothing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then you suddenly remember something. Silver\u2019s boots and socks were still in the room; in fact, they were right underneath the table. You surge with excitement at the thought of entering those dark, smelly caves. Again, there would be no way for you to get back up here after you busted your nut in them, but you could sleep on the floor if you had to. Besides, you\u2019re so enthusiastic that you\u2019re not even tired anymore. You have to get down there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut how? You look over to your bed area and get a great idea. You go over to your pillow, and after a few hard pulls on the fluffy outer material, get it onto the ground. You hope that\u2019ll be enough to break you\u2019re fall, but you remember reading somewhere that if it were shrunk, the human body could take a fall from pretty substantial height. You really don\u2019t care to test that theory now, though. Or ever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou leap off the edge of the couch and land dead center in the pillow. Your body makes a little crater as you come to an abrupt halt, so you have to clamber your way out before you can slide off the pillow's edge and onto the floor. You take a look around to regain your bearings, and your eye catches the glint of something shiny. You move closer, and realize that it was the moonlight reflecting off of Silver's massive boots.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can tell that one boot is standing straight up and down, opening flopped to one side and sealed shut. The socks appear to be in a tight ball some distance away, and without any help they\u2019d be staying that way. You start to get bummed out until you see that his other boot is knocked over on its side. You go over to the massive opening; you\u2019d be able to walk inside fully upright if the leather wasn\u2019t smooshed flat. You get on all fours and crawl into the darkness, eager to get in and enjoy yourself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou crawl with the leather at your back until you reach what you figure to be the ankle area. This spot is much more rigid, and it\u2019s able to support it\u2019s own weight sufficiently enough to allow you to stand. You can\u2019t see anything in the darkness, but boy was there enough to smell. While you could faintly detect the hint of leather and glue that was probably the boot\u2019s natural scent, all you could focus on was that now familiar cheesy cocktail that was Silver\u2019s footy musk. The air was so thick with it in here; the smell seemed even more powerful than when you were trapped directly under Silver\u2019s feet. The closed hole probably kept the wonderful smell trapped inside and the lack of circulation made the area feel hot and sticky even though Silver hadn\u2019t worn them for hours. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough perhaps the stickiness was due to the sweat. As you feel your way around, your hands get coated in the stuff. Every step you take moistens your socks with the pungent liquid, until you thought it would start dripping off your foot when you\u2019d lift it up. The sweat was just as warm as it was when it was smeared across Silver\u2019s foot. Your boner is all but screaming at you to be let out, and you happily oblige by slipping down your fly and pulling it out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou just take in the dank surroundings as you begin to pump your dick vigorously. With every breath, the footy goodness fills you up. You feel like every inch of your lungs is getting coated with the sweat that hung in the air, which just turns you on even more. Eventually you make it to a thickly padded wall, which must be Silver\u2019s insole. It\u2019s made out of some kind of foamy material, since it holds the shape of your hand when you squish down on it. You run your hands across it, when you notice a slight ridge in one spot. It stretches high above you, but when you feel down low it turns abruptly to the right. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh God. That was Silver\u2019s footprint you were feeling. You pump harder and faster, imagining Silver\u2019s foot press down on that pad every time he takes a step.  You follow the depression all the way up until you reach the toe area. You could tell you arrived not only by the dramatic increase in delectable smells, but also by the feel of multiple small depressions on the wall in front of you. Imagining Silver\u2019s toes here, wiggling around in his boots, makes you go berserk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou start hungrily lapping at the wall in front of you. Precum is coating your hand and dripping down your shaft as you viciously pump away. You then break away from the wall, savoring the taste of Silver\u2019s foot once again entering your mouth. You inch your hips forward until the head of your dick is rubbing up against the soft memory foam. You stop pumping, and swirl your member around the edge of one of Silver\u2019s toe depressions. The soft and sticky wall sends shockwaves of pleasure through your body, until you finally crumble under their power. You shoot streams upon streams of cum right into the toe depression on the wall, overflowing it with hot jizz. You keep cumming until your balls start to hurt, and when your done you drop to your knees in exhausted bliss. Not wanting to leave a mess (and desperately wanting to have another taste of those delicious feet), you shuffle over to the wall and start licking up all the cum that was dripping from the walls. The sweetness of your sperm mixed with the saltiness of the insole creates a taste that you could only describe as pure divinity. You impatiently slurp up and swallow every last drop of jizz before turning around and leaning up against the spongy insole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe warmness and overwhelming smell are incredibly inviting. In spite of yourself, you start to fall asleep, dick laying limp outside your pants and covered in a titanic hedgehog\u2019s perspiration. You\u2019ve never been more comfortable in your life. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You slowly blink your eyes open, but you realize that there isn\u2019t much to see. It\u2019s so dark that you have to question whether you even had your eyes open at all. You get your first lungful of air, and almost choke on its unexpected taste. Delectable, cheesy goodness floods your senses and clears the drowsy fog in your brain. Oh right, you\u2019re still in Silver\u2019s boot. You attempt to get up from your very comfortable sleeping spot on the cushy insole, when your body screams in protest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll that exercise really took a beating on you. You feel like you had just run a triathlon, and then were hit by a freight train for good measure. The dull aches seem to reverberate through your body with every breath you take. Thankfully, your penis seems immune to the pain. It hangs out of your fly, limp and tingling in the dank air. You feel a thin layer of dried cum coat it and the surrounding area of your pants. Nothing you can do about that now, but you do want to take a shower once you get out of here, anyway. You're dripping with sweat and you reek of BO, both yours and Silver\u2019s. You remember that today might be the day you start looking for the Chaos Emeralds. You want to be ready if it was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut first things first: you have to stand up. Just putting your dick back in your pants is a painful chore; your joints feel creaky as you move them, and they resist your commands like they\u2019re made of rusted metal. Getting up isn\u2019t going to be possible right now, so you decide to just sit back and enjoy your surroundings for a few more minutes. Sure, there may be chances to come back in here on the journey ahead. But if you were honest, even if you could get up, you still wouldn\u2019t want to leave this place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe smell of Silver\u2019s feet was exciting, of course; but there was more to it than that. There was something comforting about the dry and savory aroma, though you couldn\u2019t pin down an exact reason why. You just felt safe here; secure as you\u2019re wrapped in the smell of someone you\u2026well loved. Yeah, it was strange to see it that way, but Silver\u2019s foot scent is just as much a part of him as anything else. What was the difference between this and liking the smell of his hair, or his skin? Nothing really, except that those other ones weren\u2019t as \u201cweird\u201d to some people. But to you, there was no difference. Just like the others, the smell reminded you of him; it brought up a picture of him in your mind even when he wasn\u2019t around. You feel like you\u2019re safe and warm in his embrace here, and you don\u2019t want to leave for anything. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of a sudden, everything around you glows with a blue-green aura. Before you can even fathom what\u2019s happening, your whole world turns upside down. The ground where you were kneeling flips over, and you fall face first onto the soft insole. Thankfully, it\u2019s thick enough to cushion the impact, but before you can get back to your feet, you are sent tumbling backwards. The floor has angled up in front of you, and you roll back head over feet, drenching yourself in cool hedgehog sweat from every impact with the ground. After about three or four tumbles, you slam into the stiff wall that was the inner lining of the boot\u2019s toe. You get up and crawl forward quickly, trying desperately to get out of this tumbling cave before it sends you flying again. You pass the dish-sized craters that were the titan\u2019s toe imprints, when a bright light in the distance blinds you. Your vision returns in time to see the opening of the boot stretch wide open, and an electric blue wall of fabric and skin slide in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh shit. Silver was putting on his boots. Your mind is paralyzed with dread and horror. He\u2019s going to crush you. You scream out for him to stop, but his foot doesn\u2019t slow down for an instant. His foot comes in quickly, slamming down on your puny legs. The pressure is enormous, and you cry out in agony. The foot slides forward, slamming into your gut with enough force to take the wind out of you. The ground underneath you is still slick with sweat, so it provides no resistance when you\u2019re pushed backwards by the electric blue wall. In less than a second you come to an abrupt stop, causing your free upper body to slam backwards into the ground. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour head hits the foam-filled insole incredibly hard. The billowing waves of pain course through your head and take away your sight for a brief moment. You put your arms up in front of your face in a feeble attempt to protect your head from getting squashed, but you know that if the titanic teen shifts his weight a certain way, you\u2019d be flattened whether you protected yourself or not. You feel a sheet of fabric envelop your arms, but there\u2019s no resistance behind them. Your hands push into the fabric as it comes down on you, creating a small little air pocket that you\u2019re quickly sealed inside of. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen all activity stops. You take a series of quick, shallow breaths in order to re-inflate your flattened lungs. The smell of Silver\u2019s feet is overpowering, far greater than anything you\u2019ve smelled before. I\u2019d be a very hot experience, if you weren\u2019t in the worst pain of your life. Your legs were pinned underneath what must have been the ball of Silver\u2019s massive foot, digging into the ground with such force that you could feel the hard rubber outsole flattening your butt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf that was his ball, then you must be right underneath the arches of his toes. When your mind clears a bit more, you feel through the loose sock fabric and find his toes. You can\u2019t tell which two toes they were, but you were smack dab in the middle of them, your head fitting snuggly in the gap between the massive digits. No wonder why the smell was so powerful now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour first instinct is to free your legs. You push with all your might against the weight crushing your waist, but your lower half doesn\u2019t budge. Well, this wasn\u2019t good. How the hell would you get out of this? There\u2019s no way he\u2019d hear you in here, and the padding of the socks coupled with the huge gap in them meant you can\u2019t even get enough pressure going to knead his toes as a signal. You were trapped, for who knows how long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour despair grows, but the weight in your legs grows less intense for an instant. The biting pressure on your lower extremities is a godsend, but it\u2019s still not enough to wiggle free from your prison. But the relief only lasts a moment. The crushing pressure starts at your feet, then travels up your legs and stops right on your pelvis. The unimaginable weight of Silver\u2019s whole body is pressing onto your waist, and you scream out loud in spite of yourself. In your mind, you imagine the moment when your bones give way, and fracture under the agonizing mass forcing itself on top of them. But thankfully, that splitting doesn\u2019t come. The soft insole underneath you cradles your lower back, and has enough give to it so your legs just sink into with the pressure rather than turning into a fine mush. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grit your teeth and close your eyes as you endure the amazing pain. Just when you think you can\u2019t take it any more, the pressure lifts off again. You let out a breath that you just realized you were holding in. Suddenly, you feel your whole body lurch forward, like you were going down a particularly fast hill of a roller coaster. For a moment you feel like your going to slip out from under your socked prison, but you remain as secure as ever. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you slow down considerably. Before you can recognize what had happened, the wave of pressure over takes you again, and you cry out in fresh pain. You finally get it as your eyes begin to water in response to your torment; Silver had just taken a step forward, right on top of you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDamn it all! He was going to go out of the house, wasn\u2019t he? Panic fueled questions raced through your pain-addled mind. How long was he planning on being out? Could you even take this misery long enough for him to find you? What if he doesn\u2019t take his shoes off all day? What would you do then?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe momentary release of pressure that came did nothing to comfort your worries. You know what comes next now. Sure enough: another step, another bone-shattering weight pressing on your pelvis. This couldn\u2019t be real. This had to be a nightmare of some kind. Your crush was quite literally walking all over you, and you could do nothing to stop it. You want to just pass out, and wake up when this is all over, but the alternating sensations of relief and suffering keep you awake every time Silver takes a step. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTime passes, and you begin to lose count of how many steps your gray hero has taken. You\u2019re a panting, sweating mess underneath his massive blue sock. It had grown considerably hotter inside the boot as Silver grew more and more active. His smelly sweat mingled with your own, and the cheesy aroma grew much more intense. Under any other circumstances, you\u2019d be hard as a rock, but everything from the waist down had turned numb a long time ago. You still feel the pain with every step he takes, but your body is so spent that you don\u2019t have the strength to react to it any more. You just let him pound you flatter and flatter with each footfall, resigned to your fate of never escaping this tortuous, noxious hell. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then, the pressure releases. You instinctively wait for the heaviness to flatten you again, but it never does. Instead, you feel Silver\u2019s foot wiggle above you, slathering you with sweat before dragging your exhausted body back towards the boots opening. Again, there\u2019s no resistance from the insole, so you slide on it like wet rubber. When you reach what had to be the heel of the boot, the massive wall of blue finally lifts off of you and out into the blindingly bright world outside. Your lungs fill with fresh air for the first time in hours, and you gasp like you just came up from a diving expedition. Thorough your barely-open eyelids, you can see Silver\u2019s face, staring down quizzically into the shoe. Then he sees you in there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat is his reaction?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Without a sound, you gently float towards the bright opening of the boot. The sensation of levitating is soothing to your battered body. The comforting touch coupled with your intense fatigue is almost enough to lull you to sleep, but when the cool outside air hits your face, it\u2019s like a defibrillator was put to your chest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes take a moment to adjust to the new lighting. After blinking a few times, you can see that you\u2019re outside, surrounded by an open, grassy field. A few delicate flowers poke out of the ground here and there, spotting the sea of green with white polka dots. In the far distance, you notice a line of trees stretching out to the horizon. Over one section of the forest, you see a column of billowing gray smoke slowly rise above the canopy. Above, thick gray clouds blot out the sun. As you stare at them, you can\u2019t help but think that the clouds look the same color as Silver\u2019s fur. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hear a loud thud behind you. You want to turn around and see what it was, but the aura prevents you from moving anything besides your eyes. You gracefully come down onto a cushy white surface. Well, didn\u2019t this feel familiar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilver put you down into his cupped hands; one nestled inside the other, as if to provide support. The green aura dissipates and you land on your feet, though since your entire lower half is still numb from all the crushing, your knees buckle from under you and you fall flat on your butt. It doesn\u2019t hurt like you thought it should; apparently Silver\u2019s gloved hands are softer than you remembered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou\u2019re finally able to turn to him, and when you do your heart breaks. His face is a collage of so many emotions that you had difficulty telling which he was trying to convey. Shock, embarrassment, worry and relief all vied for real estate on the young hedgehog\u2019s face. He must have thought you snuck in there on purpose or something, to get your jollies on while he went about his day. You would kick yourself if your legs would respond to you. He\u2019d forgiven you before, sure, but doing this so soon after the first time was a step too far.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut you didn\u2019t get stuck in there on <i>purpose</i>. It was an accident. Unfortunately, you have no way of telling him that without your notepad. Was all that trust you built up with him suddenly going to fall apart just because of a misunderstanding? What are you going to do?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilver\u2019s timid voice breaks your train of thought. \u201cLittle guy\u2026are you\u2026you\u2019re not hurt, are you?\u201d His humongous gold eyes are constantly moving, presumably scanning your body for any kind of injury. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreat, you\u2019ve made him feel guilty about your screw up. Damn it all, was there no end to the trouble you caused him? You try to get to your feet to show him that you\u2019re totally fine, but your weakened legs refuse to hold your weight, and you topple down embarrassingly again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, I know,\u201d Silver says, attempting to sound able and collected but failing miserably. \u201cI can get you some water. Just hold on, okay?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was only when he said that and glowed with energy that you realized you were underneath a massive oak tree. The trunk of the tree was about twice as wide as Silver. Looking up, branches covered in green foliage sprang out of the trunk for as far as the eye could see. It looked like an entirely different world up there, unlike anything you could have experienced at your normal height. You imagine darting around up there, looking out from the tallest limbs and seeing the whole world stretch out before you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou see a nearby acorn glow and then snap off from the branch. Silver pops the top off of it with his psychokinesis and holds it outside the cover of the tree. You realize quickly that there\u2019s actually light drizzle going on out there, and after a few minutes the top is filled with rainwater, and brought over to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn\u2019t really think you were all that thirsty, at least until you had the water right in front of you. The acorn is the perfect bowl size for you, so in your ravenous state you guzzle the water down in mere seconds. You put the bowl down and take a few breaths when you see another float towards you. You guzzle that one down as well. As you drink, you catch a glimpse of Silver\u2019s face. He looks mortified, and it seems like with every gulp of water you take, he gets even worse. After your third acorn-sized bowl of water, you shake your head and wave your hand to indicate that you\u2019ve had enough. Silver takes the bowls away from you and chucks them onto the ground. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you feeling any better now,\u201d Silver asks. You shake your head yes, wanting desperately to try and stand again. You decide against it though, since failing again will probably only make Silver feel worse.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026I\u2019m so sorry that I...I didn\u2019t notice you in there.\u201d His voice cracks as he speaks. He was really torn up about this, wasn\u2019t he? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou see, I heard that Eggman was attacking nearby, so I wanted to get here as fast as I could. I noticed you weren\u2019t in your bed this morning, but I didn\u2019t have time to find you\u2026so I came here, and did what I had to do.\u201d You remember the smoke rising from before. So that was the remains of one of Eggman\u2019s schemes? Even though you didn\u2019t see it yourself, you know that fighting Eggman would take a lot of physical activity. No wonder why it was getting so hot in that boot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen, after the battle, I came in here to take a breather. It started to rain and everything, so I figured I could take a load off here. That\u2019s when I took off my boot and found you.\u201d He looked nearly on the verge of tears. It was ripping your heart apart at the sight of it, not just because your crush was upset, but also because he was blaming himself for something that was clearly your fault. If you hadn\u2019t gone in that boot last night, none of this would have happened. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing him nearly cry made you want to as well, but you had to be strong. He needed you to be okay now, for your own sake as well as his. He had the understanding to forgive you for your misdeeds. It was about time you returned the favor. With a look of rigid determination, you vigorously shake your head no. Then you point at yourself, attempting to convey that all this was your fault, and not his.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, Silver wasn\u2019t having it. The sterling hedgehog wore his heart on his sleeve, and it showed in spades now. He averted his eyes when you looked into them, staring down and away from you and furrowing his brow like he was about to burst into tears. His cheeks turned bright red and his mouth quivered. To his credit, though, he was able to dam up the river of tears that seemed just about to flow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe didn\u2019t look back at you when he said, \u201cNo, little guy, it <i>is</i> my fault. I saw that you weren\u2019t where I left you last night, and I didn\u2019t look to see what happened to you. I should have known something was wrong, especially after I checked on you in the middle of the night and you were sleeping fine. But I was so focused on getting <i>here</i>.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hear a slight rubbing sound and notice that his bottom hand has tightened around the one you were sitting on. His eyes squint shut, and you can see his nose scrunch and his nostrils flair. Every time he takes a shuddering breath, your soul is crushed with despair. At this rate, you can\u2019t guarantee that you won\u2019t start crying too. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI even felt you in there, too. I felt something in my boot as I was walking, but I didn\u2019t stop to see what it was. I figured it was...I don\u2019t know, something. I didn\u2019t even consider that it could be you. Even after I knew you had a thing for my feet, I didn\u2019t consider that you might have made it into my boots. I could have <i>killed</i> you, just because I was careless. What kind of protector am I if I can\u2019t even keep you safe from myself?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn spite of yourself, hot tears begin streaming down your face. God, he really did care for you didn\u2019t he? If only you were normal size, you could hug him close and tell him that he didn\u2019t have anything to feel ashamed about. You can\u2019t honestly expect him to keep tabs on you 24/7, and he shouldn\u2019t either. In fact, he showed more compassion than even you initially realized. Did he really check on you in the middle of the night while you were asleep? You feel sick to your stomach at the thought of your little spelunking trip. You deserved every crushing step you got while you were trapped in there, probably even more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilver starts to break down in front of you, and you feel more small and powerless than you ever had since you arrived in this world. You could do nothing to comfort him, not even give him a kind word to put him at ease. You\u2019d get up to give his finger a hug, like you did yesterday, but your damned legs wouldn\u2019t let you move. So you break into a sob too, for making Silver feel responsible for your actions and for not being able to help him through it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilver composes himself enough to say \u201cCome on, you probably need some food and rest. I\u2019ll take you home.\u201d He takes his bottom hand and cups it over your head, encasing you in a gloved dome. Through the gaps in his fingers, you see his boot float up from the floor and onto his exposed foot. That must have been that thud you heard earlier; Silver was so overcome from seeing you in there that he immediately dropped his boot to the ground. Once it was on him and fastened, his entire young body glowed, and an instant later you were both flying at incredible speed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmazingly, you didn\u2019t feel an ounce of acceleration as you flew. Silver must have been doing something to ensure the ride was as comfortable for you as possible. Thinking on it, you really don\u2019t deserve someone as caring as him looking after you. You were a burden on him ever since you arrived, powerless to help yourself and powerless to help him. Between his fingers, you can see the entire world stretched out before you. What a bleak and terrible world it appears to be.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You really want to do something to help Silver out of this slump, but your growling stomach won\u2019t let you think in peace. When you think about it, you really can\u2019t remember the last time you ate something. Certainly nothing since you arrived in Mobius (well, unless you counted Silver\u2019s foot sweat as food). Maybe a good meal was just what you needed to kick start your brain and come up with a good idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou both arrive at Silver\u2019s cozy little home a few minutes later. Once you\u2019re through the door, Silver lifts his hand off of you. You expect him to lift you up with his psychokinesis and place you on the couch, but the titanic teenaged hedgehog instead walks towards the kitchen area. He rounds the bend and enters a short hallway, then walks its length in about four steps and opens the door at the end on the right hand side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe king sized bed, shimmering in glossy blue and white sheets, was the first thing to catch your attention. To your fatigued mind, it looks like a continent of warm, puffy clouds just waiting to cradle your worn out body. Silver floats into the room and places you gently on the building-sized pillow by hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou can sleep in here tonight. I'll pull out a mattress and sleep on the floor next to you, so I can make sure you\u2019re okay overnight.\" He smiles awkwardly down at you. It didn\u2019t take a genius to figure out that Silver was still very upset about crushing you inside his boot. Your heart aches to see him like this. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll be right back with your food. You can eat it in here, if you want\u2026\u201d the silver-furred teen says, turning away without waiting for a response. He seems to leave the room faster than when he entered, and he practically slams the door behind him in his wake. You\u2019re left totally alone, with nothing but the steady pattering of rain to keep you company. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the solitude, you take better notice of your surroundings. Across from the bed is a long and low dresser, made out of black stained wood and standing at three drawers tall. Above that is a TV setup, a moderately sized flat screen hugging the wall with the box underneath. The remote is sitting on top of the box, something that strikes you as strange at first, but you quickly remember telekinetic powers of the room\u2019s owner. The carpet is a steel gray in color, and though you have no way of feeling it for yourself, it looks incredibly soft from where you were sitting. You think of Silver running his perfect toes through the fibers of that carpet, and you can swear that you almost feel a tingle in your pants. Maybe the sensation was going to come back faster than you thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later you hear the door creak open, and Silver floats in with a steaming bowl. You notice a wooden handle sticking straight up out of a thick mish-mash of meat, beans and sauce. The smell of savory meat favored with peppery spices hits the back of your throat and causes your mouth to water. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI had some left over chili Sonic sent me not too long ago. I hope you like it spicy, because he sure does.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shake your head yes wildly, your stomach growling even more intensely as he brought the bowl closer. Silver levitates onto the middle of the bed. You see that he\u2019s taken off his shoes and socks, though he doesn\u2019t keep his gorgeous soles out for long; he tucks them under his butt as he sits on them. With the bowl in his lap, he manipulates the wooden spoon with his psychokinesis, stirring the contents of the bowl around and releasing puffs of steam and more of the delectable aroma. He takes a spoonful and floats it over to you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take a bite out of a piece of beef that was almost as big as your head. Not since tasting Silver\u2019s sweat have you ever had anything so tasty. You gobble down a few bites like a ravished fiend, before you break away an allow Silver to pick up another spoonful. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou continue this process with him for a few minutes. He doesn\u2019t say anything the entire time, and upon closer inspection he looks rather\u2026sad actually. Was the very sight of you enough to put him through pangs of guilt? A pit grows in your stomach. No, you can\u2019t have this happen. With your stomach quickly filling, your mind was starting to become clearer. What can you do to lighten the mood a little, and get his mind off of his guilt?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn opportunity arose when you heard a loud grumble. It\u2019s as strong as a power chord played at a rock concert. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, sorry about that,\u201d Silver says, blushing ever so slightly. \u201cI guess I\u2019m pretty hungry too. I\u2019ll go get something.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was it, a way to show that you weren\u2019t mad at him. You wave your arms wildly to get his attention. When you have it, you point to the bowl, then at him, then mime an eating motion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis face actually lights up for a millisecond, before turning into a polite smile. \u201cThanks little guy, but I don\u2019t want finish it on you. Don\u2019t you still need to eat?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou raise your one eyebrow at him. The bowl was about as big as a swimming pool, and you had barely even put a dent in it already. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, point taken. It was pretty good the first time around.\u201d He loads up the spoon and levitates it up to his lips. He opens his mouth, and you see shiny strings of saliva connect his top and bottom jaws. His pearly white teeth appear for a second before he clamps down on the spoon. He drags it out and plays around with the food in his mouth, obviously savoring the delicious flavor. What if you were in with that food, getting slathered with Silver\u2019s spit and getting tossed and turned by his tongue? Your spine shivers involuntarily, and this time you\u2019re actually able to feel your member twitch. You were feeling better already.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou snap out of it right away when Silver says, \u201cWow, this stuff is good even a second time around. Did you like it too, little buddy?\u201d His face was noticeably brighter; he appeared to light up the room even though he wasn\u2019t physically glowing. You shake your head yes, immensely satisfied that you were able to break the ice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilver happily continues eating the chili, occasionally floating the spoon over for you to have some as well. In time, you get pretty well stuffed and stop eating, but Silver keeps on going. He strikes up a conversation almost immediately after taking his first bite, a decidedly one-sided conversation as all you could do was nod yes or no, but still. He asked you a bunch of questions about where you came from and what life was like for you back home, and you answered to the best of your ability, and Silver seemed genuinely pleased to hear about it. You even caught him smiling a few times. That warmed your soul like nothing else in the world. You were proud that your mission to cheer him up was a success, but even happier that you had the hedgehog you loved back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHours passed in what seemed like minutes. The chili bowl had gone cold long ago, placed on the nightstand with the bowl gently lying inside it. Silver was lying across the width of the bed, feet hanging off the side and head resting on his hand. When he finished his sentence, he turned over and saw the time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow, it\u2019s pretty late. You really should get some sleep little guy, you must be exhausted.\u201d He sat up and hovered off the bed. \u201cI\u2019ll just head inside and let you sleep.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou quickly wave him down again. Instead of him leaving, you have a better idea. It was one you had ever since you saw him as a giant, and one you were itching to try out. You push both your hands down, indicating for him to sit again. He does, albeit with a curious look on his face. As soon as his but touches the bed, you signal for him to lie down. He returns to his original position sprawled out across the sheets. You try standing up, and though you do feel a dull ache when you get upright, you can still remain on your feet without issue. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilver\u2019s face widens in surprise, but he doesn\u2019t say anything. You walk over to him as quick as your numb legs will allow, and once you reach his flat tummy, you give it a hard push. It doesn\u2019t do anything, but Silver gets the message and lies down on his back. Once he does, you start climbing. Thanks to all the fur, it\u2019s relatively easy to get up on top of him, though you think that having two properly working legs would help immensely. You make your way steadily across Silver\u2019s body, enjoying every step you take on the gigantic hedgehog\u2019s soft skin. You make your way across his slowly heaving chest; the trickiest area, as every breath Silver takes risks sending you careening back onto the bed. Finally, you reach your target.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou jump headlong into Silver\u2019s puff of chest fur, arms wide and legs spread like you were doing a belly flop into a pool. The forest of thick hairs catches you and tickles your body as their feather-like tips run across your skin. You clamber up to the thickest section of the chest tuft and climb on top of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilver\u2019s face looms large over you. His massive bowline is furrowed into a worried shape and the edges of his mouth form a sad frown when he says \u201cUh\u2026I don\u2019t think it\u2019s safe for you there, little guy. I mean, what if I hurt you again or something?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don\u2019t pay much attention, because as soon as you get comfortable on a warm patch of chest fur, you are out like a light. You don\u2019t even get to see Silver\u2019s apprehensive look turn into one of pure love.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou awaken several hours later, right when dawn has broken. You wake up to the steady ebb and flow of Silver\u2019s breathing beneath you, and the faint sound of his gentle heartbeat. You open your eyes, only to realize that you had slept the entire night on Silver\u2019s chest. And not only that, but Silver had fallen asleep too. In fact, he was still asleep right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile sharing your food with him was a very nice gesture, you still didn\u2019t cheer him up the way you really wanted to. And now that he was asleep, you had easy access to almost any part of his body that you wished. Maybe a pleasant wake up was just the thing he\u2019d like. You know you\u2019ll enjoy it. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You look back and forth between his head and feet. On the one hand, Silver\u2019s sleeping face looks absolutely adorable. His eyes are peacefully closed and his mouth is hanging open ever so slightly. Heading over there could probably get you off in a flash. You think back to Silver eating; how he happily sloshed the chili around in his mouth and savored the flavor. You never thought you had a vore fetish, but apparently watching your giant hero eat chili turned you on as much as him wiggling his toes. Or maybe the fetish only applied to Silver, because he was just so damned cute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen again, how could you go wrong with feet that looked that good? Honestly, as bad as it was to be ground into the insole of Silver\u2019s boot, it really wasn\u2019t the worst thing you\u2019ve ever experienced. Yeah, it sounds weird to admit it, but after all was said and done, the whole thing was pretty hot, in a morbid sort of way. It was like an adrenaline junkie getting high off of bungee jumping; toying with death was just part of the fun. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou really have difficulty deciding. Each path had its pros and cons, and but neither definitively outstripped the other. Silver was just sexy all over, something that was apparently both a blessing and a curse for you. You glance back up at his face after staring longingly at his feet. He appears to be sleeping peacefully. Though you don\u2019t really know how heavy of a sleeper he is, you had a fair amount of confidence in your ability to be discreet. You were only a few inches tall at best, and you had to weigh only a few grams. If you were careful, and quick, you might be able to explore his entire body, from head to toe. The idea energizes you. If you couldn\u2019t choose just one, you\u2019d have to try for both. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou get to your feet and decide to strip naked. It\u2019s not like he hadn\u2019t seen you like this before; even if he did wake up, he knew you had a thing for him, so you don\u2019t imagine he\u2019d mind too much. At least, that\u2019s the hope. After you strip off your shirt and pants, you sit down to take off your shoes and socks. The chest fur feels amazing on your back and butt, like you were sitting on a pile of cotton ball fibers. It tickles your ribs, and you jerk right and left as you go to take your socks off, as every movement causes the fur to lightly caress your skin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen your feet are finally exposed, you go into a ticklish frenzy. They are the most ticklish part of your body, and you have to try desperately to stifle your laughter when they brush up against Silver\u2019s chest fur. You climb up towards the teen hedgehog\u2019s massive face on all fours, thinking that climbing on top of the fur would be less tortuous than wading through it. It\u2019s still difficult, though; every move you make is followed by a series involuntary spasms and chuckles through gritted teeth. Finally, you make it to the other side, your whole body tingling from the journey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou step directly onto Silver\u2019s peach muzzle. The feeling of his skin under your feet makes you shudder with pleasure. It\u2019s so soft, and the relaxed skin depresses slightly at your footstep. It was like stepping onto powdery sand, though without the annoyance of getting fine grains everywhere. You hang wide around the humungous hole that was Silver\u2019s mouth (as you\u2019d get to that soon enough) and continue on up his cheek, and past his human-sized nose. Knowing you can\u2019t walk across his eyelids without waking him up, you move to the area where his muzzle almost meets his brow line and jump across. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce on his brow, you admire the sea of hair before you. The five bundles of fur on the crown of Silver\u2019s head stretched out like aircraft carriers all moored on the same dock. You walk out to the centermost one. You can tell immediately that Silver takes good care of his hair; each strand is smooth and shiny, and since they are considerably longer than the fur on his body or feet, you feel like you\u2019re walking on a collection of flimsy wires rather than a carpet of hair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou lie down and take a deep whiff. Though not as sensually stimulating as his foot smell, you can\u2019t deny that it is undeniably Silver\u2019s scent. There\u2019s a faint note of shampoo: something reminiscent of a woody, maple smell.  However, since he probably hadn\u2019t washed for the past two days, the prevailing scent was Silver\u2019s natural aroma. It was musky, but not overpoweringly so, and with a sweet mustiness towards the end that reminds you of the outside air just after a rainstorm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could lie there and take in his smell all day, but you were excited. Your limp penis was rubbing in-between Silver\u2019s hair, and it was turning into the shape and consistency of sausage as you ran it though the gray strands. You stand up, and make your way back down towards his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour dick grows hard from anticipation by the time you reach Silver\u2019s mouth. You lean over the edge to peer inside, just in time to receive a blast of the giant hedgehog\u2019s morning breath as he exhales. It is absolutely repulsive, but your member takes a liking to it with a happy twitch. When the warm, moist air passes, you can see deep inside. Since he slept with his mouth open, it didn\u2019t look nearly as slick in there as it did while he was eating. Still, it appeared dank enough; his red tongue sat shimmering amid the straight rows of his stunningly white teeth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn\u2019t see much further than that, but that only meant it went down that much deeper. As appealing as it was to take the dive in there and roll around on your hero\u2019s tongue, you really don\u2019t think it\u2019s the wisest idea. If you jump in there, he\u2019s almost certain to wake up; but even if he doesn\u2019t, getting back out will be impossible until he does. It\u2019s either that, or you fall down into his throat and get sucked towards his stomach. Like getting stepped on, it\u2019s exciting because there was danger to it. But now that you had the choice, you\u2019d really like to avoid it, just like you\u2019d like to avoid getting stepped on again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead, your focus shifts to the place your standing on, Silver\u2019s lips. Unlike your own, Silver doesn\u2019t really have any dedicated \u201clips\u201d to speak of; instead, the skin of his muzzle just kind of wraps around towards the inside of his mouth where his lips should be. In all reality, they\u2019re no different from the rest of his skin, but that doesn\u2019t stop you from getting turned on. You kneel down and begin kissing the edge of his mouth beneath you. It tastes very faintly of chili, but otherwise it just tastes like skin. But the silky smoothness touching your tongue enchants you, and your mind floods with pleasure. You make out with the small section of Silver\u2019s lip like you were really kissing him because, in a way, you were. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wet patch forming between your lips turns you on just as much as the passionate kissing. After a few minutes, you inch to the side to start kissing a newer, dryer patch of lip. You continue this process until the entire edge of Silver\u2019s mouth is coated with your spit. Your mouth feels about as dry as Silver\u2019s looks, but you are hard as a rock. Until you can get to your normal size and plant one on him for real, this was as close as you were going to get to a full on make out session.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You were just about ready to get off. You look off towards the horizon, and see those perfectly shaped beauties of his looming in the distance like mountains. You can practically smell them from here, and the sight of them brings back wave after wave of sensual bliss that causes you to physically shiver. You slowly pump your rigid dick, fast enough to keep it hard but not fast enough to get you to cum too early. You begin your long journey by wading through the forest of chest fur again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were so turned on that you don\u2019t even bother climbing on top of them, instead opting to walk straight through. Your sexual tunnel vision allows you to ignore the tickling sensations on your body, but it has the negative side effect of amplifying the sensitivity of your penis. Every fiber that gently brushes past your little head is like an electric shock of euphoria. Your dick was practically convulsing and spewing out precum of its own accord without you even having to touch it. It gets so bad that you have to stop a few times along your trip, just to calm down enough so you don\u2019t spew your load before you make it to Silver\u2019s feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt takes a lot longer than you hoped, but eventually you do get out of the cocktease forest. You\u2019re on soft, furry ground again. The sensation of walking along Silver\u2019s tight tummy is not unlike walking across a carpeted floor, save for the fact that the floor was upheaving ever few seconds when Silver takes a breath. You\u2019re able to keep your balance all the way to Silver\u2019s crotch area. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAh, now here was an interesting place. The question of just what the teen hero was packing burned in the back of your mind ever since you arrived here. It\u2019s not like you had any sources back home that told you how it all worked with him, but you do know that in the comics, members of Silver\u2019s species can have children. The implications to that were tantalizing, and as much as you want to explore this area in detail, you were too far gone to be able to check it out in the way you wanted too. Maybe when you got off, you\u2019d come back and check it out. But right now, his feet await your service.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou get down on all fours to trek across Silver\u2019s incredibly long left leg. It\u2019s large enough for you to easily balance standing up, but you really don\u2019t trust him keeping still. The going is slow, but the distinct deli smell of Silver\u2019s feet get stronger as you approach. It starts very faintly, teasing you with its fleeting existence. By his shin, the smell is more noticeable, a steady cloud hanging in the air, but nowhere near as strong as you want it to be. The smell turns into a taste at the back of your throat by the time you reach his ankle. It\u2019s enough to make you throw caution to the wind and stand straight up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou run across the plush top of Silver\u2019s furred foot, making a beeline directly for his long, slender toes. His feet are pointing down and away from his face, so the incline to reach them is no steeper than a hill back home. The further down the foot you get, the more your own feet get coated in sticky sweat. The smell is enveloping; a balmy, soggy blanket that glazed your entire body with foot stink just by being in its presence. You just barely make it to his toes before your inner sex savage takes over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou drop to your knees and dig your face into the gap between his middle two toes. At first, you want to simply grind the syrupy sweat into as much of your face as you can. But once the soft skin touches your lips, your mouth goes on autopilot and starts slurping up as much of the stuff as you can. The salty taste never gets old, and you gulp it up just as rabidly as you did the chili yesterday.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon thinking about the chili, you remember how Silver enjoyed his portion. You move over to a new toe and take in as much gunk as your mouth can allow. Once inside, you slowly begin churning it around, extracting as much of the flavor from it as you possibly can. It\u2019s so savory and salty that you begin drooling out of the corners of your mouth, and your eyes begin to water at the sheer concentration of the stench and taste. In time, the sharpness of the taste fades, and it becomes more bearable. If you closed your eyes and imagined yourself back home, you could picture yourself enjoying a bite of real aged Swiss instead of Silver\u2019s foot sweat. The comparison was uncanny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou finally swallow the wad of spit and sweat, and after smacking your lips to enjoy the aftertaste; you lean down and make out with the same spot anew. You don\u2019t even bother touching yourself; the stimulation of having your head between your hero\u2019s massive toes is enough to make it dribble precum all by itself. When the hardness of your dick becomes almost painful, you break off from the toe and ready yourself for the coup-de-gr\u00e2ce.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince Silver\u2019s pinkie and ring toe touch one another with only a very small gap in between, you decide that would be the perfect hole to fucking. You lean across all his toes, sliding your dick into the gap with ease. The soft skin gently squeezes around your member, causing you to moan out loud. You start humping almost immediately. Your face is smack dab in the center of Silver\u2019s middle toe, and in your sexual frenzy you start making out with it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pump faster and faster, the entire lower half of your body convulsing as you near the breaking point. You\u2019re moving with such intensity that you have to stop kissing to come up for panting gasps of air just to keep the pace. Your balls tighten, and in the back of your mind you know you\u2019re just about to cum\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen a noise from behind stops you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt\u2019s little more than a whimper, but even in your sex-addled state, it's impossible not to hear. You stop in your tracks, carefully pulling out of Silver\u2019s toe so as to not explode prematurely. You turn around, and are shocked by what you see. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Surely your eyes were tricking you. You were so high on euphoria that you had to be fantasizing what you were seeing. Like a dehydrated person crawling through the hot desert, what you were seeing could only be a mirage created when the line between dream and reality blurred. You blink a few times, and let out the breath you realized you\u2019d been holding in. It\u2019s no dream. You were really seeing it. Silver was pleasuring himself from your foot service.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stopped as soon as you pulled away from his foot. He sits blushing with his arms crossed over his soft chest poof. He isn\u2019t meeting your gaze, instead trying to nonchalantly look out the nearby window. His total failure at looking cool and collected only served to highlight his juvenile innocence. God was it hot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh,\u201d Silver says, as indifferently as he could manage (which, of course, didn\u2019t come off as indifferent in the slightest). \u201cLooks like you\u2019re feeling better. Th\u2026That\u2019s good.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was really trying his best to cover it up. The logical part of your brain wants to cover yourself and try to talk it out with him. Unfortunately, you were hornier than a jackrabbit in heat; words fail you and action takes over instead. You sprint across Silver\u2019s leg faster than you ever thought possible. You approach the general area where Silver was rubbing and begin stroking it with your bare feet. Over one particular section, you feel a slight ridge bump up about an inch (to your size) over the rest of the flat pelvic skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, this was where the fabled treasure was buried. You grind your foot into the ridge with about half your body weight. Silver yelps in surprise and pleasure, and his hands fly from his chest to the sheets beside him. As you continue to trample the ridge, you see Silver\u2019s hands grab and claw at the bed sheets, as if his life depended on it. His eyes and head tilt upward and his mouth opens wide with panting breaths.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou start pressing down with more and more of your weight, until eventually you are putting everything you got into your stomps. One particularly hard step actually sinks your foot into the ridge, encasing it to your ankle. You feel something slick and smooth underneath, and when you pull your foot out, the ridge doesn\u2019t close back up underneath you. In fact, a shiny red hill rises from the opening to about your shin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe head of Silver\u2019s dick is triangular in appearance. If you looked straight on, it looked like the Assassin\u2019s Creed \u201cA\u201d symbol, only with the tip of the \u201cA\u201d hooking up closer to your face. The sight of it turns you on like never before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou get on your knees and begin licking the blood red head from crescent to tip. Every slimy path you trace causes a tremor beneath you; and a loud, adorable moan to leave Silver\u2019s lips. You give it a few more licks, and then smack your tongue on the roof of your mouth. The taste of Silver\u2019s dick is similar to his feet in a lot of ways, but it was different in just as many. It was much saltier, and it didn\u2019t have that dryness that made his feet taste like Swiss cheese. The musk was much stronger here as well, in both taste and smell. Everything mixed together and overwhelmed your senses with pure bliss. But no matter how much you take in, it\u2019s not enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou lick more vigorously than every before, as if your rabid lapping and streams of spit would somehow allow you to eat up that beautiful scarlet head. As your mouth violates every exposed inch, you feel Silver\u2019s shudders of pleasure turn into thrusts of his entire pelvis. You\u2019re so concentrated on the sensations in your mouth that you barely register your body braceing against every upheaval from the titanic silver teen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully, though, your not so focused that you miss out on Silver\u2019s stuttering groans that leave his lips every so often. Every moan causes the red rocket to swell beneath you. Before you even realize what was happening, you were standing up, hugging and kissing Silver\u2019s dick like it was your long lost lover. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou start to grind your own dick into the glossy hedgehog member. As you gyrate, your penis forms a depression in Silver\u2019s skin that snuggly wraps your package in warm, hedgehog flesh. It\u2019s like his dick was hugging you back. You wrap your arms around it tighter, kiss it more passionately, and grind deeper into the smooth red skin. Soon, grinding doesn\u2019t even cut it anymore. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Silver\u2019s head is just out of reach of your hungry mouth, you begin kissing his pulsating shaft. You drive your hips into him, hard and fast, like the sheer force of your humping will create a hole in him that you could fuck until you go blind. Your dick is spraying precum every which way, drenching your entire waist in minutes. But the constant gyrating, slurping and massaging gets you winded faster than you thought. You slow down considerably, deliberately moving your arms in tandem with your hips as if you were dancing a Viennese waltz. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou realize that you\u2019ve had your eyes closed for some time. You open them and take a look at Silver\u2019s face. If you didn\u2019t know any better, you would have thought he was in agonizing pain. His teeth are clenched on his curled index finger. His chest fur bounced with each puff of his shallow breath, making it look like a forest in the middle of an earthquake. His eyes are mere slits, but you could see that his beautiful golden irises were trained right on you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing his tortured pleasure only makes you want to please him more. You renew your massaging with brand new vigor. Every pulse of the now massive dick sends concussive waves through your body, which keeps you further off balance when Silver thrusts his hips into the air. It doesn\u2019t knock you over; at least not until his tight hedgie balls pop up under your feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sudden jolt from the release of Silver\u2019s knot-like ballsack causes you to break off momentarily from the red rocket. You use the time to admire his full package in all its glory. Now fully erect, it stands at least thirty-five feet tall, making it about seven inches in normal length. It was glistening and red, from the tip all the way down to the base. You could see pulsing veins here and there, visible just under the surface of the skin. The whole thing was twitching, with the balls clenching tightly together with every vibration. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look at Silver\u2019s face one more time. His eyes are pleading; he was begging you to finish him off. Without a word, you take a step forward, climb onto his balls and secure yourself tightly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you start humping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pound your waist into Silver\u2019s dick, screaming in bloody, blissful agony as your member rubs up against his hot skin. Your hands are practically clawing at the other side of his shaft, digging into his skin and grabbing at small chunks of his flesh. You try to kiss the small area of dick in front of you, but your panting gasps only allow you to feebly lick and peck at it occasionally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can\u2019t see Silver\u2019s face, but you don\u2019t even care. Your body refuses to let you break off now. All you can perceive are Silver\u2019s terrific wails, ones that sound like he was sobbing. You hump faster and faster, until you feel like your entire lower half was just a blur. Friction heats up your entire pelvis, making you feel like you are bursting into flames. But you\u2019re so close. Just a little more, and you both will be free of this torment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour prostate clenches at the same time as Silver\u2019s balls beneath you. An instant later cum erupts out of you like the explosion of a volcano. The tree-sized hedgehog penis quakes violently, and grows searing hot as cum erupts from its head as well. Every pulse of your balls and dick is mirrored by Silver\u2019s on a much grander scale. You squirt three times, and then four, dribbling warm cum right down Silver\u2019s shaft until it collects in a small pile on Silver\u2019s balls. You both cum and cum, until both your bodies are syphoned dry of the precious white love juice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou lean on Silver\u2019s dick for balance, and are rewarded with a drip of his cum that lands squarely on your head. It coats you like styling gel, but before it can dry and cement your hair in wild shapes, you scoop up as much of it as you can and put it in your mouth. It tastes sweet, not salty or bitter at all. It was almost like candy, though that may be your bias talking again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou step off of the shrinking package and weakly amble around the other side so you could see Silver\u2019s face. His eyes were closed, and he was breathing like he\u2019d just sprinted around the world. To your tired eyes, his skin seemed to give off a beautiful golden glow. Looking at his satisfied face filled you with such warmth that only served to make you sleepier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are about to collapse, when you see Silver open one of his gorgeous eyes a crack. He glows teal, and so do you. Before you can react, you are floating over to his face. He adjusts himself on his bed so he\u2019s sitting more upright, but his eyelids look heavy from fatigue and he only opens them part way. His arms and hands are slumped on either side of him, and they don\u2019t move an inch as you float past. You stop just above his chest puff, far enough away that you could almost see all of his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow,\u201d he says, in a near unintelligible whisper. \u201cThat was just\u2026wow.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smile up at him, happy that he enjoyed it just as much as you did. You let your smile melt away, as your dick grows soft and intense fatigue takes over. You slowly drift off in his telekinetic grip, but your perception remains when you suddenly feel a soft circle press into your entire face and chest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don\u2019t find out until later that it was a kiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight before you pass out completely, you hear him softly whisper something under his breath. You don\u2019t know if he meant for you to hear it or not, but you do anyway. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe says, \u201cI love you, little guy.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWarmth overtakes you, and you finally fall into a deep sleep.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It\u2019s the smell of Silver\u2019s fur infused into the pillow that finally wakes you up. You take a few deep breaths, and the distinct smell makes your eyes flutter open. Though no specific memory of him comes to mind, you picture him distinctly nonetheless. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn onto your back and sit up, scanning the area with a lethargic stare. Everything in Silver\u2019s room is as you remember it. You were at the head of his bed, covered with a warm sheet up to your chest. Without thinking, you run your hands through your hair. Chunks of it are clumped together by something that feels hard and flakey. You suddenly remember what it is, and you jitter with delight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and your giant protector had gotten as close as you possibly could to having sex. In this very bed, you squeezed and rubbed the giant dick of your longtime hero, and together you shot off your loads until you collapsed from exhaustion. The memory is as crisp and clear as a movie projected before you, but you still find it too fantastic to believe. If it weren\u2019t for the proof plastering your hair together, you would have dismissed it as just a vivid dream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou get to your feet and stretch. It appears that Silver left you alone in his bed. He\u2019s nowhere to be seen, but you do hear the faint sound of activity in the distance. As you look towards the open door leading out of his room, you see a huge book hanging precariously close to the edge of the bed. It seems like there\u2019s a note on it, so you move closer to get a better look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou realize the book was the same one you used to get Silver\u2019s attention on the first day of your arrival. The yellow sticky note stuck to it reads, \u201cKNOCK ME OVER WHEN YOU WAKE UP.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilver\u2019s cleverness makes you smile. It looks like he was getting good at accommodating your needs, and it warms your heart to imagine him thinking of you so carefully. You walk over to the open edge of the book and brace yourself under its lip again. Using all your might, you push until the book slides off the bed and crashes onto the floor with a loud thud. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike a charm, the signal works. You hear familiar crashing sounds begin softly in the distance, and then increase in volume as your giant hero approaches. The final thunderclap sounds just behind the doorways edge, and about midway up, a plume of light gray fur and glistening golden eyes pop into view.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMorning little buddy. You look like you slept pretty well,\u201d Silver says as he walks into the room. You see that he has his gloves on, and his feet are covered in a pair of cyan colored socks similar to the ones that you were very much accustomed to. He kneels down next to the bed, lining up his head with your little body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou give him a wide grin and nod yes. Those humongous eyes of his dart around, more than likely taking in all of your tiny, naked form. With all that attention, you\u2019d think you would feel a little bit self-conscious about your body. But you aren\u2019t bashful in the slightest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn fact, you feel the polar opposite. Without your conscious input, you stand up taller, puff out your chest, and spread your legs a little wider. A wave of confidence swells inside of you as he takes you in. After the time you had with him, you feel like you can conquer the world, tiny height be damned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe titanic teenaged hedgehog smiles down at you. The warm expression is not unlike the sun\u2019s rays hitting your skin. You feel your skin flush warm and red, and your stomach flutters with butterflies. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou look like you could use a shower. I don\u2019t think you\u2019ve had one since you got here, right?\u201d You nod your head yes, and Silver offers you his massive hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell come on, then. I just finished washing your clothes, so the sink in the kitchen is the perfect temperature.\u201d Immature purity seems to pour forth from every pore as he speaks. It\u2019s as adorable as it is sexy. You get onto his hand, and you both leave the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you enter the kitchen area, you finally see what all the activity was about. There are pots and pans strewn about almost everywhere. The places that aren\u2019t occupied by cookware accommodate a multitude of different ingredients. Eggs, bacon, sausage, pancake mix, butter, milk, and orange juice create a veritable rainbow of food on every countertop. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t mind the mess, little guy. I was just about to make us breakfast.\u201d He looks down at you, again with that beautifully sweet look of his. \u201cDon\u2019t worry though, I can work around you, no problem.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at all the food makes your stomach growl. A good breakfast sounds great to you. Your hero stops in front of the sink and gingerly places you inside the basin. The drain is covered in a fine mesh, and after testing it to determine that it could hold your weight, you step into the center and line yourself up with the faucet above. Silver turns on the water, and a lukewarm stream washes over your head and entire body. The feeling is absolutely delightful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust before you get pruny, you step out of the stream and shake yourself off. Since you know Silver is busy, you clamber up onto the counter yourself. When you finally surmount the top, you go over to the tap and heave it closed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBreakfast\u2019s gonna be ready in a minute,\u201d Silver says, with his back turned towards you. He\u2019s manipulating everything in the kitchen simultaneously with his powers, making the whole room glow teal. You feel dizzy looking at the complex arrangement, so you turn away and focus on the items in front of you. The towel looks incredibly soft and comfortable, and you can\u2019t resist belly flopping onto it. You writhe around until you\u2019re dry, and after fixing your puffed-out hair, you get into your clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wait patiently for Silver to finish what he\u2019s doing before getting his attention. He\u2019s only pushing around a few links of sausage in a frying pan when he once again lifts you with his powers and places you on the nearby dining table. You have your own place set out for you, adjacent to his. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilver takes a seat and starts making his own plate, while simultaneously lifting food over to yours with his mental abilities. He\u2019s quick to tell you that you don\u2019t have to eat everything in front of you, which is a relief given the amount of food he has prepared. The teen must have been so excited for the company that he went a little overboard and prepared a feast. You wouldn\u2019t be able to devour a tenth of it, even if you were lucky. Still, the sentiment was very touching, and you can\u2019t wait to dig in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilver dices up your food into manageable pieces, and while he pours orange juice into a bowl near you, he says, \u201cYou know, I was thinking about something this morning, and I wanted to see what you think about it.\u201d He finishes pouring and glances down at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI still say the best shot at getting you back home is to find all seven Chaos Emeralds. The only thing is, I\u2019m not quite sure where any of them are. If we look by ourselves, it may be a little while before we can find them all.\u201d He forks a chunk of egg and puts it in his mouth. Between chews, he continues, \u201cBut I was thinking, if we get some of my friends to help us out, we\u2019ll be able to collect them a heck of a lot faster.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou mull it over as you take a chomp out of a strip of bacon. The \"Sonic the Hedgehog\" cast is filled with people who would probably help you out, if you told them your story. But then again, those were the characters you knew from the games and comic books. Who\u2019s to say they would act exactly the same as those incarnations? Hell, <i>this</i> Silver loves having his feet serviced and just had sex with you; at this point, anything is possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look up at Silver and see that he\u2019s mulling over his options too. It\u2019s only when you\u2019re taking a sip from your bowl of orange juice that you hear him pipe up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think the best thing to do is to start looking on our own. If we meet anybody along the way that might help us out, we can talk to them then. Asking everyone out the gate would just waste too much time.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looks down at you sidelong, and says with a smirk, \u201cBesides, it\u2019d give us more alone time together. Right, little lover?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOrange juice sprays out of your mouth in a fine jet. You jerk towards him, and he gives you a cute, knowing wink before returning to his food. To think he would admit it so casually like that; he must have had a better time than you imagined. And \u201clittle lover?\u201d Blood rushes to your cheeks and your knees gently wobble. You slurp up your juice slowly, letting the implications of that statement dance around in your mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you calm down a bit, you agree to Silver\u2019s plan. Doing it his way, you\u2019d get the best of both worlds: he wouldn\u2019t be burnt out from doing everything himself, and you both would get as much time together as possible. It\u2019s a win-win, no matter how you look at it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou both finish eating some time later, and your gigantic host gets right to work cleaning up. You\u2019d eaten a heck of a lot more than you thought you would, and now you were stuffed to the brim. Just before you can lie down on the tabletop, Silver picks you up and levitates you onto the couch. He moves the TV remote closer to you and welcomes you to put on anything you\u2019d like. Now that you think about it, you were curious to see what TV programs there were on Mobius. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou get up to press the power button, when there\u2019s a booming knock at the door. You glace at it, then at Silver in the kitchen. He doesn\u2019t look back at you; instead he stares fixedly at the door with an unreadable expression. The numerous plates and food items floating around him stop glowing as he places them on the countertop, and he floats across the room towards the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilver hesitates a minute, then turns the handle. Before he can even open it fully, another giant figure barges into the house.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You\u2019ve been in Mobius for three days now. In that short time, you\u2019ve met the one hedgehog you had an immense crush on, got to rub his humongous feet, explore his incredibly hot body and, most unbelievable of all, have <i>sex</i> with him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, what was probably even more unbelievable was the fact that you did all that stuff and he <i>liked it</i>. Your wildest dreams came true a hundred times over in the span of just seventy-two hours. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet even after all that, you still become star struck by what you see. You were a teenaged girl who had just met her favorite pop idol. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSonic the Hedgehog was exactly the same size as Silver; every source you could think of confirms that fact. But as soon as he walked through the door, the sheer volume of his presence made him appear to be dozens of feet taller than he actually was. It was like he staked a claim to everything in the house just by stepping into it; and based on the look on his face, he knew it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stood tall in the doorway, one hand on his hip and a cocksure grin spread across his face. His greeting to Silver was as booming and massive as he was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s up Silver? Long time no see.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can\u2019t see Silver\u2019s face, but you notice his posture straighten slightly. He wasn\u2019t <i>quite</i> standing at attention, but compared to his relaxed stance before, he may as well have been. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I guess so,\u201d he says, flatly. \u201cI did just see you yesterday, though.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTrue that. I don\u2019t think Egghead knew what hit \u2018em when you showed up to the fight.\u201d He nudged Silver in the chest fur with his elbow, and chuckled a bit to himself. Judging by the way Silver was acting, you doubt he\u2019d follow suit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnyway,\u201d Sonic says. \u201cI gotta talk to you about that, but first\u2026mind if I use your bathroom?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilver hesitates just a moment, then says, \u201cSure, go right ahead.\u201d He then tilts his chin out the door, just behind Sonic\u2019s line of sight. \u201cYou think Amy will catch up by then?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSonic\u2019s eyes go wide and his face drops. He turns pale as a ghost as he whips his head around to look behind him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second he does. Silver flashes blue, and an instant later a freight train of air slams into your chest. You sink so deep in between the couch cushions that you can\u2019t even tell if your eyes were open or still squeezed shut by the force of the impact. A few coughs rock your body before you can breathe again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat the hell was that for? You want to clamber out and tell Silver off, but you stopped in an awkward position, and you have trouble righting yourself. Trying to fix yourself only gets you angrier, so by the time the teal light shines around you again and you\u2019re hoisted up into the air by Silver\u2019s psychokinesis, you\u2019re absolutely fuming. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you can lay into him, he says, \u201cI\u2019m really sorry I had to do that little guy, but I didn\u2019t have a choice. I couldn\u2019t risk Sonic walking by and seeing you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour one eyebrow lifts as you float onto Silver\u2019s hand. You only now realize that he has a concerned look on his face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLook, I know you don\u2019t really know Sonic or anything, but trust me when I say that this guy is bad news. I know for a fact that when he sees you, he\u2019s\u2026 well he\u2019s going to do whatever the heck he wants. Just like he <i>always</i> does.\u201d He glares at the general direction of the bathroom like it just insulted him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don't want that to happen to you. But don\u2019t worry; I promised that I\u2019d protect you, didn\u2019t I? I\u2019ll do everything I can to keep you safe.\u201d His expression grows warm. The look is infectious; you find yourself smiling too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilver\u2019s sentiment is sweet and all, but you\u2019ve got to wonder if it\u2019s really justified. In spite of what he thought, you probably knew Sonic better than he did. Yeah, the blue blur was brimming with self-confidence, almost to the point of narcissism. But you know that no matter how arrogant he seemed, he would drop the attitude in a heartbeat if someone were in trouble. He may have a high opinion about himself, but it\u2019s never at the expense of others; unless, of course, those others happened to be portly doctors obsessed with world domination. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWas Silver being paranoid? There was a lot of stuff out there that you had to be protected from, you agreed with him there, but for Silver to feel the need to protect you from someone as heroic as Sonic? That\u2019s a bit much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWas Silver still not over the whole boot fiasco? You thought you were past that by now. Hopefully it\u2019s got nothing to do with that event, and he\u2019s just being cautious in the face of an unknown scenario. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom behind, you feel a sudden gust of wind, and before you can react Silver\u2019s hand closes over you, and you\u2019re thrown backwards. You land in the space between his fingers, and when you turn around and peer out the gap, you see that you are behind Silver\u2019s back, just above his erect tail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt sounded like Sonic was speaking through a megaphone right next to you when he spoke. \u201cAhhh, much better. Thanks dude.\u201d There\u2019s a momentary pause before he says \u201cHey, what\u2019s that behind your back?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh\u2026what?\u201d Silver says. The ground beneath you gives way, and for a spit second you are in free fall as Silver raises his hands in front of him. Thankfully, you don\u2019t fall very far before his psychokinesis catches you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not holding onto anything\u2026see?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeez, this was bad. You knew six year olds who were better liars than Silver, and you think Sonic picks up on it, because he then says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, come on. Now you\u2019re holding it with your powers.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUhh\u2026 no I\u2019m not. I\u2019m just doing the dishes. It gets done <i>way</i> quicker when I do them like this.\u201d You glance over at the kitchen, and the plates and bowls he placed on the counter began floating like they had a mind of their own. The faucet turns on, and one by one they are doused with soap and water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNice save, oh clever protector.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cOh,\u201d Sonic says, a bit incredulously. \u201cI guess it does. Say, it looks like you made a feast or something. A little hungry this morning, huh?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, actually I had some company this morning. It was\u2026uh, Blaze. Yeah, she stopped by and I made her breakfast and stuff\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven though you couldn\u2019t see his face, Sonic\u2019s smugness was so pronounced that you could almost feel it coat your entire body in his oozy ego. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOhhhhhh, I get it. Finally puttin\u2019 the moves on her, huh? Making her breakfast is a classic play dude; bet you scored some major points with that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, well\u2026you know, it\u2019s only natural to do something like that for someone you\u2026like a lot.\u201d You can practically feel Silver blush as he said it. More than likely, it\u2019s because you blushed too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDawwwww,\u201d Sonic says. \u201cDid you tell her that? Because I bet you\u2019d have gotten a BIG kiss on the cheek if you did.\u201d Sonic chuckles to himself, and down on the floor, you see Silver\u2019s giant socked feet shuffle nervously. If only you weren\u2019t so small, you\u2019d get in front of Sonic and\u2026well you aren\u2019t quite sure of the specifics. The fact that you can\u2019t do anything right now pisses you off more than anything else, though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnyway,\u201d Silver says, obviously trying to sound unfazed. \u201cWhat did you want to talk about?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, yeah.\u201d Sonic sounds composed, but there\u2019s that lightness to his voice that still comes off as conceited. What was he getting at? \u201cSo you remember how you took down Eggman\u2019s mech yesterday?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell\u2026it was kind of a team effort. I just came in and finished it off.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRight! And you know the rule we have about that, right? \u2018He who busts it has to clean it up.\u2019\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hear a slap come from Silver\u2019s forehead. \u201cOh crap, that\u2019s right! I totally forgot!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow, now, don\u2019t worry, your best friend in the whole world took care of it for ya. And while<i> I</i> was doing <i>your</i> job in the pouring rain, I found this in the with all the junk.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, a bright white light bathes the entire room. You hear Silver gasp, and the aura around you instantly disappears. As dinnerware crashes in the background, you freefall a few more inches. Luckily, you\u2019re able to reach out and grab onto Silver\u2019s tail before you fall too far. He quakes underneath you from the unexpected feeling, but he doesn\u2019t lift you back up. Instead, you straddle the extremity; scooting up to it\u2019s widest part near Silver\u2019s butt where you had the best balance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026that\u2019s a Chaos Emerald, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Silver was probably saying it for your benefit, and you\u2019re so stunned that you almost fall off his tail. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHeck yeah it is. I was going to keep it, but then I thought <i>you</i> might want it. I mean, technically it is yours, since you beat Egghead and all.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, I want it!\u201d Silver says, a tad too excitedly. Then you start to feel that clammy ego of Sonic\u2019s drip over you again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell\u2026even though it <i>should</i> be yours, you didn\u2019t hold up your end of the deal by cleaning up. Since <i>I </i>did, I think it\u2019s only fair that<i> I </i>keep it.\u201d Sonic was speaking in a singsong sort of way that made you want punch him in his nose. Where does he get off, anyway?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut,\u201d Sonic continues, \u201cseeing as how you <i>really </i>want it, I might be persuaded to let you have it, if you do something for me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere\u2019s silence for a few moments, then you hear Silver pipe up. \u201cWhat do you want me to do?\u201d</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Silver must be just as shocked as you are, because he\u2019s quiet for some time. The pause is long and highly uncomfortable, especially with Sonic\u2019s offer dangling in the air like a cloud of acrid smoke. When the silver hedgehog does speak, he sounds\u2026annoyed, actually. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re totally serious about this, aren\u2019t you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat\u2019s strange; you figured he would be appalled after hearing such a ridiculous offer, and would shoot it down immediately. Instead, it sounds as if he <i>expected</i> this to happen. In spite of the nature of his powers, Silver couldn\u2019t actually read minds. That being the case, why did it sound like he knew this was coming?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSonic\u2019s forceful voice knocks you out of your train of thought. He pleasantly replies \u201cYup! I mean, think about it: you didn\u2019t clean up after yourself, so now you get to make up for it by cleaning up after me!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo\u2026he was serious then. Before you can really digest what that meant, you see Sonic suddenly appear next to Silver. A torrent of wind washes over you with the force of a hurricane in the wake of Sonic\u2019s super-speedy movement. You move slightly on Silver\u2019s tail, but you still keep your balance well enough. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on, man,\u201d Sonic says, in a light and joking voice that teetered very close to the edge of being mocking. \u201cIt\u2019s not that big of a deal, right? I mean, with <i>your</i> powers, you don\u2019t even have to touch \u2018em.\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSonic puts his arm around Silver\u2019s back, and begins shaking the white hedgehog as he makes his points. While they may have been playful shoves to someone of Silver\u2019s height, they are violent upheavals to you on his tail. The shakes are so massive that the tip of the extremity whips back and forth in the air, as if Silver was purposefully wagging it. Your butt slides on the smooth fur underneath you as if you were a hockey puck sliding across ice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow could this be happening? Sonic was really asking for this; he wanted Silver to clean his shoes for him in exchange for the Chaos Emerald. You know Silver was very good to his friends, and would do anything in order to help them. But at this point, Sonic wasn\u2019t worthy of calling Silver his friend. Where Silver was gentle and thoughtful of others, Sonic was brash and self-serving. He was a smarmy little weasel that didn\u2019t deserve the type of kindness that your\u2026well, your <i>lover</i> was capable of. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilver\u2019s a smart guy. You know he sees this for the farce that it is and will tell Sonic off any second now. When you look up, you can only slightly see the edge of Sonic\u2019s grinning face. It wouldn\u2019t be much, but when Silver shoves him away and tells him to get lost, you should be able to see enough of his expression change to get some satisfaction out of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giant silver teen doesn\u2019t wait long to give his reply. He says, \u201cOkay fine, I\u2019ll do it.  Give \u2018em to me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat the\u2026 What on Mobius is going on? Was Silver out of his mind? Why in the world would he belittle himself so much by taking on this ridiculous request? If only you could see his face, maybe it could provide a clue as to what was running through his head. Maybe he was being sarcastic, and he was really telling Sonic to go cop a walk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou cling desperately to that possibility, but it becomes more and more unlikely as you see Sonic\u2019s titanic face take on a wider smile. He takes a step away from Silver and proceeds to take his sneakers off. After he undoes the golden clasps, he pops one shoe off with the toe of the other, then vice versa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo your amazement, Sonic\u2019s blue-furred feet emerge when he takes his shoes off. Confusion racks your brain for a time, until the blue titan lifts both sneakers by the puffy white tufts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilver\u2019s socks had the very same puff at the ankle. Once you saw them, you\u2019d just assumed that everyone with that similar poof was just wearing those same types of socks. However that didn\u2019t seem to be the case: apparently they were just decorations on the red sneakers, and Sonic really wore his shoes barefoot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTeal energy surrounds the shoes and they are hoisted into the air by Silver\u2019s powers. As they rise, Sonic says, \u201cThanks a lot buddy! Take good care of \u2018em now, ya hear?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Sonic\u2019s humongous hand slams into Silver\u2019s back. The friendly pat catches your hero off guard, and he stumbles forward. The heave is so tremendous to your tiny form that you slip off of Silver\u2019s tail and begin plummeting to the ground. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThinking fast, you try to grab onto Silver\u2019s leg. But the hairs on it are so fine and smooth that you can\u2019t get sufficient purchase. Your next idea is to wrap your body completely around his leg, and slide to a stop as if you were on a fire pole. Unfortunately, your outstretched limbs are not long enough to reach around completely, so you only succeed in grinding your body into Silver\u2019s skin as you plummet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, grabbing on like that did have one benefit: you were now perfectly aligned with Silver\u2019s sock puff. You land on it with enough force to knock the wind out of you, and all the excess material completely envelops you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat you didn\u2019t count on, however, was the springiness of the fabric. It rebounds violently underneath you, and sends you tumbling away from Silver\u2019s foot entirely. You flip end over end two times before landing on your butt. You lean into the landing, rolling like a log three times until you come to a halt on your back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel like you just jumped out of a speeding truck, but at least you were alive. The soreness in your body quickly dissipates when you see where you landed. You were a few normal-sized inches away from Silver\u2019s titanic form, and just opposite the side of him that Sonic was on. With Silver in the way, you couldn\u2019t see the blue hedgehog\u2019s face. Hopefully that meant he hadn\u2019t seen <i>you</i> either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilver slowly begins walking away, towards the other side of the room where the bathroom lies. It would be impossible to keep up with him as he walked; every step he took covered the span of two football fields at a time. Instead of running with him, you turn around and move quickly towards the TV stand that was nearby. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel fairly safe in the shadow of the stand\u2019s leg. From that position, you can clearly see Sonic look on Silver with an expression of deep satisfaction as the latter makes his way out of the room. Silver, however, isn\u2019t paying much attention to that; he\u2019s instead scanning the floor with every hulking step, apparently looking for something. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe must have felt you fall from his tail and slide down his leg. Now he was looking for you, and being painfully obvious about it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn fact, Sonic makes a comment. \u201cHey, Silver you drop something?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilver spins on his heels and stands fully upright. His eyes are wide when he says \u201cNo\u2026no it\u2019s nothing. Nothing at all.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo your amazement, Sonic looks genuinely concerned. That\u2019s somewhat of a surprise; since up until now you were certain that he didn\u2019t have a sympathetic bone in his blue body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe says, \u201c You sure, dude? I can help you look for it if ya want\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNO!\u201d Silver holds his arms out in front of him and starts waving him wildly. He must suddenly realize that doing so makes him look even guiltier, because he abruptly stops and puts them to his sides. He stands as stiffly as if he had been tied up around the waist, and his face glows red with embarrassment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe says, \u201cI mean\u2026uh\u2026don\u2019t worry about it. It\u2019s fine, really. It\u2019s no big deal. Look, I\u2019ll just get these cleaned up, so don\u2019t go anywhere, okay? I mean not that you would go without your shoes, but\u2026uh, yeah\u2026\u201d He lifts himself off the floor, and with the shoes in tow he hurriedly flies around the corner and out of sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSonic watches with a single cocked eyebrow as Silver leaves the room. When the psychic hedgehog disappears, the blue blur simply shrugs and dismisses the oddness with a casual \u201cwhatever.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blue titan\u2019s crashing footsteps rock the floor as he walks over to the couch and plops down on it. Wrapping his slender blue toes around the lip of the table, he pushes it with his foot until his leg is completely outstretched. When it is, he crosses his legs underneath him and folds his arms behind his head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe remote is right next to his butt, but he doesn\u2019t appear interested in watching TV. Instead, he closes his eyes. His chest heaves more and more slowly after a minute, causing you to think that he may have fallen asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow\u2019s your chance to get the heck out of here. If you run at a decent clip, you should be able to make it to the safe side of the hallway wall in a good minute or so. From there, it should be pretty easy to make your way around and find where Silver was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen again\u2026Sonic\u2019s feet did look particularly delectable. Dammit all, you shouldn\u2019t find this jerk attractive, especially after what he\u2019s been doing to your <i>real</i> lover. But your libido doesn\u2019t lie; in spite of Sonic\u2019s actions, he still looks incredibly hot lying there with his feet on full display. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust a little taste of his feet wouldn\u2019t hurt, right? He\u2019d never know the difference, and you can go find Silver right after. But who knows; maybe if you\u2019re lucky, he\u2019s a heavy sleeper and you can get your rocks off on the cocky bastard\u2019s luscious soles. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You decide to wait another few minutes to ensure that Sonic was fast asleep. Truth be told, you aren\u2019t totally sure how heavy of a sleeper he actually is; in spite of his sometimes lazy demeanor, he was never actually asleep often in any of the games or comics. In fact, nothing had ever stuck out as explicitly saying he was either heavy or light in his rest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat\u2019s all the more reason for you to be extra careful, then.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour heart races as the seconds tick by. He doesn\u2019t budge an inch from his position, save for the slow heaves of his peach-colored belly. His feet are stretched out in front of him, pointing slightly downwards so as to make a 45-degree angle with the floor. You picture being enveloped in the shadows of those massive beauties, taking in Sonic\u2019s unique aroma before touching your lips to his smooth, soft soles\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDamn it. If you keep thinking about it, you\u2019ll probably shoot before you even make it over there. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd no way is that going to happen. The jerk deserved to get his feet dirty after what he did to Silver. Yeah, it\u2019s not really much of a revenge plot, but there\u2019s something about it that just seems <i>right</i>. You were getting off to Sonic\u2019s feet, but not for his amusement; that right was reserved for Silver alone. Instead, you were doing this for your own pleasure, experiencing Sonic\u2019s feet and then leaving when you were done, casting them aside like they were sex toys that served their purpose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHey, if Sonic was going to use Silver, than using Sonic like this was the only fair thing to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the beating in your chest becomes unbearable, you finally decide to make your move. You keep on your toes, tiptoeing every step of the way as you close in on Sonic\u2019s feet. Realistically, you could have just run there normally; none of these giants could hear you speak if you screamed at the top of your lungs anyway. The sound of running probably wouldn't reach Sonic\u2019s sleeping ears, but you want to be cautious nonetheless. Better safe then sorry after all, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter what seems like an eternity, you finally get within a few steps of the teen hedgehog\u2019s godly soles. You can feel their warmth radiate onto you like the rays of the sun, and their smell coats you as much as your own sweat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second you cross into the shade of the blue beauties, your entire field of vision turns blue for a split second. Then it grows dark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmooth, firm flesh presses against your entire body while short blue hairs rub against every inch of your exposed skin. Locker-room smell and pleasant moistness overwhelms your senses and makes you dizzy and disorientated. You can\u2019t move, no matter how hard you try. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only thing you can perceive in your musty prison is the distant, muffled voice of Sonic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGotcha!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilver the Hedgehog is rinsing off his blue friend\u2019s metallic red shoes and thinking about how much of a steal this situation is for him and his little lover. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeciding to take up Sonic\u2019s offer was a no-brainer; a measly rinsing of his iconic footwear was a small price to pay for one of the seven most powerful gems in the entire world. Sonic had said so himself, and Silver had to agree with him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, it made sense given the circumstances, anyway. Any other time, Sonic's cocky attitude would have led Silver to throw him into the nearest wall and take the emerald by force. But Silver has more important stuff to worry about now: something that's far more important to him than his pride.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Though it\u2019s really more of a \u201csome<i>one</i>\u201d than a something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe silver teen never really knew what to expect when he found the speck-sized creature passed out on his living room floor. Honestly, Silver wasn\u2019t quite sure <i>what</i> he was until the little guy explained it to him in his notes. The young hedgehog had never seen anything like him before, and that\u2019s saying a lot considering that Silver had fought a ten-story flame monster for years. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBased on first impressions, the little fella seemed pretty cool. Silver got the feeling that they would hit it off no problem as they hunted for the Chaos Emeralds together. Looking for the mystical gems often made for one hell of a bonding experience. Well, friendships did flourish under times of adversity, right? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn fact, Sonic\u2019s turn from despised Iblis Trigger to a close friend was proof positive of that fact. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn any case, the little guy was immensely grateful for the help. He was certainly grateful enough to give a killer foot massage as a token of appreciation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot that Silver had a lot to compare it to. Truth be told, he never really had a foot massage before at all; he just sort of faked a nonchalant attitude when he accepted so as to not sound inexperienced. The reason he never had one was because he never quite understood the appeal. Of course, when the little guy offered, the young hedgehog didn\u2019t want to appear rude by turning the offer down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough if Silver was honest with himself, his acceptance wasn\u2019t <i>totally</i> about being polite; deep down, he was extremely curious about it. Was it possible that it was really so good?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn reality, it was even better. Getting a massage was both relaxing and stimulating at the same time; and those feelings spread through his entire body as the tiny guy\u2019s hands gently worked their magic. How any of that was even possible Silver had no idea, but what he did know was that it felt good\u2026<i>really</i> good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, the good times ended when the little guy passed out after cumming so many times. Even if he hadn\u2019t had such a good time, the young hedgehog still wouldn\u2019t have been mad at the little fella for doing what he did. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough Silver would be lying if he said he understood it. He only had a very cursory knowledge of fetishes and why they appealed to people. It was\u2026well, it wasn\u2019t something he was particularly keen on researching before now. At any rate, it didn\u2019t matter too much to him; he felt good when he got his feet rubbed and that was that. The little guy enjoying it too was pretty much just icing on the cake. At least, that was the case at first.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young hedgehog figured that it had to be embarrassing for the little guy to get caught with his pants down, literally. But Silver never would have expected to get the reaction that he did when he confronted the little fella on it. The poor thing broke down instantly, and admitted to everything without protest. Besides feeling sorry for him, Silver kind of respected him a bit too. The guy could have easily tried to lie his way out of it, or to make up some excuse or something in order to save face. But he didn\u2019t do that at all\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilver was captivated. All that night and all the following morning, he couldn\u2019t stop thinking about the little guy. And it was more than just worrying about his safety, too; he wondered about stupid things, like what his opinion would be of this or that, or what he did in his spare time back home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe teen hedgehog even wondered what the little guy thought of <i>him</i>, too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had no idea what brought this train of thought on, but he couldn\u2019t help it. The more and more he thought about him, the more and more he wanted to be with the little guy. Just having him close by was\u2026comforting, in some weird way. A million different thoughts and feelings raced through the teen's head all morning... and distracted him from the fact that the object of his desires had stowed away inside his footwear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo matter how much time passes, Silver figures he'll never get over the horror he felt when he stared inside his boot and saw the little guy in there. As Silver pulled him out and looked into his beaten face, his mind couldn\u2019t help but flash images of the cute, tear-filled smile the little guy had given him the night before. It was like he was being taunted, shown a moment of pure joy just at the moment where it was about to be wretched away forever. And it was all Silver\u2019s fault.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then something truly amazing happened. The little guy, against all rationality, <i>forgave</i> Silver for what he had done. When he crawled up onto Silver\u2019s chest puff and drifted off into a peaceful sleep, the teen hedgehog knew that he hadn\u2019t lost this little guy\u2019s faith at all. And it had nothing to do with the tiny boy being a forgiving person, either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe little guy <i>loved</i> Silver, more than anything else in the world. And by watching the little fella peacefully slumber amid the soft white fibers, Silver\u2019s chaotic thoughts about everything coalesced into one, solid truth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilver had loved the little guy too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe teen turns off the water, scrutinizing Sonic\u2019s shoes for any dirt he may have missed. He figures that the sooner he finished up with this ridiculous task, the sooner he could look for his little lover in peace. When he's satisfied at seeing his distorted reflection staring back at him in the metal clasp, he shakes the shoes dry in the sink. With a relieved smile, he levitates out the door and down the hallway. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe rounds the bend and stops dead in his tracks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSonic is sitting on his couch, grinding something into the floor with his feet. When he turns to Silver and pulls away, the white teen sees his little lover; a panting, sweaty mess with his clothes twisted and wrinkled around his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth of them looked just as shocked to see Silver and he was to see them.</span></div></div>",

He\u2026he was awake? How could that be; you were certain he was out cold. How could he have woken up so quickly?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blue wall of skin lifts off of you, and for a moment you stare into a pair of curious green eyes. Sonic has his legs spread on either side of you, sitting on the edge of the couch and leaning over you to inspect your puny body from on high.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing his emerald green eyes stare directly into yours sends a chill through your body that could have easily frozen your blood. In spite of the futility, you want to heed your gut reaction and run, very quickly and <i>very</i> far away. Though when you try to move your arms and legs, your muscles rebel against you by remaining perfectly rigid. Your breathing becomes shallower, and you start to feel dizzy. Your mind begins to repeat a singe question over and over, as if mentally chanting it will somehow magically whisk you out of this nightmare; what am I going to do now?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSonic lets out an impressed whistle that pierces your eardrums. You wince at the pain, and by the time your eyes open again, he is bent down over you, clamping the back collar of your shirt between his bus-sized fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe yanks you up off the floor at a nausea-inducing speed. Reflex takes over; your hands fly up to the front collar of your shirt, your fingers hook in-between your neck and the cotton-wrapped elastic, and you pull down with all your strength to fight the tugging force of the giant hedgehog at your back. It\u2019s a good thing your reflexes were as good as they are, as even a moment\u2019s more hesitation could have resulted in you being inadvertently hung by the big blue teen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn your intense anger you begin flailing your legs, trying against all hope to kick the bastard to make him let you go. You even scream at the top of your lungs for him to put you down, but even as the words explode out of your mouth, you know it\u2019s all just a waste of breath. Sonic didn\u2019t hear you; the fact that he showed no change in his expression of curiosity was a testament to that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the kicking stops when Sonic finally opens his big mouth. His voice is so loud that you almost throw your hands up to your ears, at the expense of leaving your neck exposed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey there, little guy. I\u2019ll be honest; this is kind of a surprise. I knew Silver was hiding something, but I didn\u2019t think it\u2019d be a little fella like you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe spreads his other hand out underneath you and lets go of your collar. After falling for a second, you land awkwardly on a plush cushion of fabric-coated skin. You aren\u2019t hurt from the impact, but you do have to sit up in order to lock gazes with Sonic again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYa know, I got a lot of questions for you. But honestly, I think the one I\u2019m most curious about is why you were sneaking around my feet while I was relaxing.\u201d You don\u2019t answer him, not that you could if you wanted to. Instead you sit there leering at him, in the hopes that he got the message that you didn\u2019t want anything to do with him. But it doesn\u2019t look like Sonic was studying you for an answer; instead it appears that he\u2019s thinking and trying to deduce the answer himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis epiphany comes a few moments later. \u201cOhhh\u2026you like them, don\u2019t you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA pit forms in the base of your stomach. How could he have figured that out? You hadn\u2019t done anything yet; there should be no way that he could have guessed about your foot fetish. Was it possible that <i>he</i> was the psychic hedgehog here?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then have an epiphany of your own. You weren\u2019t dealing with naive and oblivious little Silver here anymore; Sonic had way more experience under his belt than the silver teen, and it went way beyond just beating up robots and saving little woodland creatures. The very act of running around at supersonic speeds would require an insane level of perceptibility and intuition on his part. You suspect that the blue giant had to be abundant with both in order to be sitting in front of you right now: if he didn\u2019t, well, he probably would\u2019ve splattered into a tree or rock a long time ago.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat being the case, it\u2019s no wonder why he's catching onto you and Silver so quickly. He probably had an idea something strange was afoot the moment Silver told his first lie. From there, all he had to do was play along until he had a chance to investigate. And you, being the veritable brain trust that you were, went right up to him and handed him that opportunity on a silver platter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are broken out of your trance by Sonic speaking to you again. To your surprise, it seems to be a question directed squarely at you, and you notice Sonic\u2019s face loom large as he eagerly awaits your answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, was I right? Do you really like \u2018em, little guy?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don\u2019t really know what to say. In a way, you feel like he already knows the answer, or at the very least suspects it. You don\u2019t think lying to him will work, as he\u2019d probably call you out on it immediately. Quite frankly, you really don\u2019t even want to think about what he\u2019d do to you after that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough what\u2019s the alternative; you tell him the truth and he has his way with you? Would that even happen, realistically? With Sonic, it\u2019s all a flip of the coin, and with your life hanging in the balance, you aren\u2019t terribly fond of those odds. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou decide to wait a moment to gauge his reaction, in the hopes that you could uncover more of what he was getting at. He is looking at you intently, as if studying your every movement and facial expression for a hint of an answer. But at the same time, he appears patient; a decidedly odd look on the infamously impulsive hedgehog. What on Mobius is he trying to get at? Finally, you decide to give in and nod your head in affirmation. Your logic is that you\u2019d much rather deal with him when he\u2019s pleased than risk him getting pissed off when you lied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnsurprisingly, he seems satisfied with this. A toothy grin creeps across one half of his massive face, while his eyelids drape halfway down his eyes. The condescending look is both infuriating and terrifying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHeh, I knew it. Can\u2019t say I blame ya, though\u2026they are some kinda beauties, aren\u2019t they?\u201d You feel the ground upend as Sonic shifts his weight backwards to lift his feet into the air. He wiggles his toes in front of himself, devilishly taunting you with their presence while keeping them far out of your reach. At the sight of his toes wagging in mid air, you feel your little head jerk upward. Curses; even when he was teasing you, you still found it hot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnyway, you and Silver are pretty tight buds I guess, huh?\u201d You must have looked stunned by his wildly correct guess, and Sonic must have decided to actually acknowledge it this time, because he goes on to explain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I know that the whole feast he put together wasn\u2019t for Blaze; I mean, besides the fact that it was an obvious lie, Silver\u2019s way too shy to put on all this and get all romantic and stuff with somebody.\u201d You chuckle a bit in the back of your mind, though you don\u2019t dare to let the expression show on your face. Apparently he didn\u2019t know his \u201cbuddy\u201d Silver as well as he thought he did. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhich,\u201d he says, \u201ccan only mean he had a new friend over, and wanted to impress \u2018em with his cooking skills. Oh, let me guess, he cooked everything at the same time with his powers, didn\u2019t he? Heh, classic.\u201d His smugness seems to wrap around him like the luxurious mink sweater of a snotty, upper-class heiress.  And it doesn\u2019t help that, though the details were way off, he was totally right in his conclusions. He successfully tore down the veneer Silver had carefully tried to construct in order to protect you, and now that you were here in his palm, the truth was laid bare for all to see. You think bitterly that if you hadn\u2019t slinked from your hiding spot and came over here, even with the tremendous amount of suspicions he had, Sonic would have left the house being none the wiser to the entire ploy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut you just had to go after those feet, didn\u2019t you?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSonic says, \u201cWell, since you two are such good buddies, maybe you\u2019ll want to help him out in fulfilling his payment to me.\u201d The ground beneath you quakes as Sonic suddenly rises to a standing position. It\u2019s so quick that you fall over in his hand, your stomach feeling like it\u2019s racing to catch up and causing you to feel nauseous. Your disorientation worsens when you hear a loud, sickening screech come from below you. Before you can clear your mind enough to figure out what it was, you are dumped unceremoniously on the hard surface of the coffee table. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat sound must have been Sonic moving the table closer to the couch, since his knees almost make contact with the table\u2019s edge when he sits down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe goes on to say, \u201cNow, no pressure for you to do anything, little fella. It\u2019s Silver\u2019s fault he\u2019s in this mess to begin with, so no worries if he has to clean it up himself. That said, I\u2019ll betcha he\u2019d be really appreciative if you helped him get outta this hole. Heck, I know I would!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWait a minute, was Sonic being serious right now? Was he really planning on stringing Silver along even longer for that damned emerald? This was going way too far, and you had no more patience left for the blue titan. The sooner he was out of Silver\u2019s hair, and out of your <i>life,</i> the better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd now, for the first time since you arrived on Mobius, you have the power to do something about it. If you agreed to Sonic\u2019s demands, whatever they might be, you could help Silver tremendously. You'd be sacrificing your dignity for that of your white hero, and thus freeing him from Sonic's unreasonable clutches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor Silver, it's a price you\u2019d be willing to pay a thousand times over. Without regret or hesitation, you nod your head yes. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cAw man, this is awesome!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSonic practically shouts as you agree to his terms, though it probably only sounded that way due to your diminutive size. Either way, he was certainly excited; his cocky grin had grown to a full-blown smile, and his cheeks rose so high that his eyes looked squeezed shut. When he opened them again, they sparkled like polished, human-sized emeralds. The twinkling causes your stomach to tie itself in knots; you have no doubt that his mesmerized look is a bad omen, and only signals that he\u2019s thinking hard about which humiliating labor to put you through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giant blue teen crosses one leg over the other, resting his elbow on his knee and likewise resting his chin on his fist. His gigantic eyes scan over you, but he doesn\u2019t open his mouth to speak. You don\u2019t sit down and you don\u2019t shift your gaze from him; you don\u2019t even shuffle in place, even though your nerves compel you to do so. You stand tall in the face of the coming danger, just as your silver hero would have done. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiant and tiny lock eyes for what seems like hours. Movement in the corner of your eye forces you to break your gaze; though you don\u2019t lose the intensity in your stare, nor do you move a muscle other than your eyes. The toes of Sonic\u2019s suspended foot wiggle mockingly a few yards away. Upon looking at his feet, an involuntary shiver of pleasure courses through your body, rippling through every part of it before culminating in your dick. It pulses in tandem with the waves, filling up with your blood and growing more and more erect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel your face grow warm with a blush, and then dissipate the instant you realized it was happening. You look back at Sonic, but it was too late. His building-sized mouth perks up at the corners, and his eyelids slide down to cover the tops of his pupils. He doesn\u2019t move otherwise (even his toes had stopped moving now), and for the longest time his chips away at your brave fa\u00e7ade with his impish stare. You do your best to at least hold the intensity of your glare, but even that you can feel weakening as you look at his titanic, conniving face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, he relieves your squirming by speaking. You\u2019re almost thankful for it; that is, until you comprehend what he says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know what to do with you. You want these babies so badly; \u201c he tilts his head towards his suspended foot, \u201cthen maybe I\u2019ll just let you have \u2018em.\u201d He reaches across the enormous distance between the couch and where you stand, coiling his fingers around your body in a tight grip up to your neck and whisking you up in front of his face. His grasp is so tight that deep breathing becomes impossible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are even with his monolithic black nose when he says \u201cOkay, here\u2019s the deal, little guy; if you give me a foot massage, I\u2019ll consider Silver and me even and give him the Chaos Emerald.\u201d He brings his other hand into view, pointing a vehicle-sized finger at your tiny head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow, you have to do it for as long as I say; otherwise it doesn\u2019t count. If you can\u2019t do it or you stop before I tell you, then Silver still owes me one. That\u2019ll sure suck for him, but that\u2019s not really your problem either.\u201c He shrugs, eyebrows raised and eyes closed as he does it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen his eyes open again, they stare at you intensely. All the cockiness in his face had vanished in an instant, and was replaced by a warning steadiness. He says, \u201cI just wanna make sure your still up for this. No shame in backing out now if you\u2019re not interested.\u201d All of a sudden, there\u2019s a shadow of a smirk; \u201cnot that I think you <i>don\u2019t</i> want this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt\u2019s true; you do want this, but not for the reason he thinks. Your services can help Silver, and you\u2019d be the one who secured the first emerald. You could finally prove to him that you aren\u2019t as helpless as he thinks you are; and maybe then he could finally rid himself of this guilt that was tearing him in two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor your own sake, as well as Silver\u2019s, you were ready to do this. You nod an affirmative without a trace of regret.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA sudden childlike glow surrounds all visible parts of Sonic\u2019s body. He\u2019s buzzing with excitement when he places you back down on the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAll right! Well then, let\u2019s not wait around anymore.\u201d With that, he leans back on the couch and plants his two blue towers of feet mere inches away from you. The reverberations rock the table underneath you and produce a deafening boom to your tiny ears. You recover from the disorientation just in time to hear Sonic give you his blessing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHave fun, little guy! I know I will!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou approach the first foot with hesitation. The long arch extends his ball and toes high into the air, far higher than Silver\u2019s at the same distance. Warm air starts to waft in your direction, carrying with it Sonic\u2019s distinct odor. The stench was incredibly powerful; already more pungent than even the worst Silver\u2019s feet had to offer. The smell of sweat comprises most of the foot stench; as you smell it, memories flash of a high school locker room after fermenting over a long break.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour dick tingles in response. Even in spite of your duty to fulfill this important mission, your body can\u2019t deny the visceral attraction it feels to the whole situation. At the end of the day, this is exactly what you wanted, to plant your face into the blue blur\u2019s giant soles and take in his boyish foot musk. Every part of your body wants you to throw your clothes to the ground and run headlong into those beautifully soft looking soles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then you think of your lover. The thought of him reminds you of your mission, and you steel yourself against your lesser instincts. Giving in like that would be as good as cheating on him, and though you know it will be hard to keep yourself in check, you resolve that you must not break that loyalty you had to your true, silvery hero. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou reach out with open palms. Plush blue fur parts in your fingers, making way for you to feel the buttery-soft skin that lay underneath. You stand in amazement at the smoothness of Sonic\u2019s soles; you\u2019d figured that anyone who had run as much as he did would\u2018ve had their soles revenged from excessive use. You move your arms in wide circles, mimicking what you did with Silver not that long ago. And just like that time, your dick pulses excitedly with each rotation of your arms; the intoxicating smell and supple feel working in unison to fill you with pleasure, even in spite of yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSonic lets out a contented hum when your hand first makes contact, but you don\u2019t hear from him much after that. As you work around the sides of his heel, you hazard a glance up at his face. You see him stare back at you, carefully watching your movements but obviously enjoying your work. You keep going at the same pace, painfully aware of your erection that was now pushing on the edge of your pants. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou go to move back around his foot towards the center of his heel, when he breaks off from you. You look up, and panic sets in right before the ball of his foot slams into you with enough force to pin you painfully to the floor. Your entire body becomes damp from the moist foot hairs depositing their layers of warm sweat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, he slides his foot back and forth over your prostrate body; grinding you into the ground with firm, steady pressure. Every push and pull tugs at your clothes, crumpling and creasing them as they are dragged along your body and dampened with Sonic\u2019s pungent foot secretions. The plush hairs that felt so soft in your hands now painfully abrade your exposed skin. In time, these areas grow red and raw, turning sensitive, and thus heightening the pain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe constant downward pressure flattens your nose, though the constant kneading practically forces the smell up into your nasal cavity. If you thought the smell was stuck in there before, you were highly mistaken; now literal droplets of the salty liquid make their way into your nose with your every breath. You hack and wheeze involuntarily, only to have your mouth be assaulted by wave after wave of briny hedgehog flavor. The fur and skin dancing across your tongue is coated in your saliva, which in turn gets pushed up and into your nose and onto the rest of your face. In a short time, everywhere from forehead to chin is thickly coated in a cocktail of spit, sweat and your pain induced tears. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour dick convulses as if to spite you. Every rub, which brings new waves of pain to other parts of your body, only makes it throb with more vigor. You feel precum begin to dribble out, only to be squeezed out of your cock when Sonic pushes his foot upwards. In time, your pants become sopping wet with the pre-ejaculate juices, but even then your fight with every ounce of your being to not cum for real.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the rubbing never seems to end. Just as the wall of foot fur and skin grind away at your body, so too do the sensations from your mouth and penis grind away at your resolve. Mind and body clash over opposing desires; one seeking to enjoy the ultimate pleasure, and the other wanting to remain loyal to your lover. Soon, it\u2019s too much for you to handle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour balls knot up, and you feel your lower tummy convulse with waves of pleasure. Unconsciously, your hips thrust with each contraction, only to be slammed back down by the hedgehog\u2019s titanic weight. Warm, milky cum streams out of your dick in ribbons, instantaneously ground into your pelvis by the giant foot sliding over you. You scream in blissful agony, well aware of the fact that your promise, like you, was thoroughly broken. </span></div></div>",

            ],
            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As if by karma, or some other form of divine punishment, the pulverizing continues. As soon as the final stream of cum left your rock-hard member (and was thoroughly slathered across the inside of your pants and lower tummy), the intense sensations of arousal turned immediately into sharp needles of pain. Your dick was now highly sensitive, and it received no respite from the rubbing and dragging motions of the titanic teen\u2019s blue feet. Even through the layers of your now-soaked clothes, Sonic\u2019s grinding was giving your weary penis a horrific beating; and your cries of anguish did nothing to alleviate it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mind is a total blur of terrible sensations happening all across your body, though that didn\u2019t stop your reflexes from acting on your behalf. You try in vain to push up against the oscillating wall of blue fur and moist skin, but it doesn\u2019t budge an inch. In fact, it only serves to cause you even more pain, as your arms are forcibly pulled up over your head when Sonic\u2019s foot barrels upward over your body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith your arms now firmly planted on either side of your head, it becomes impossible to turn your head to give your face a break. You continue to cough and choke under the terrific onslaught of stench and sweat, powerless to do anything but cry out in pitiful anguish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust when you begin to lose all feeling in your raw, exposed skin, the pressing weight lifts off you. Your first gulp of fresh air chokes you at first, and a sudden wave of nausea swells over you. Blurred vision prevents you from seeing anything clearly for a few seconds, though thankfully when it does clear, your nausea dissipates as well. It\u2019s only then that you become aware of the prickling soreness in your arms, stomach, lower legs and face. You look down and see that all of these exposed areas were a bright red and hot to the touch. It was as if you had been sunburned; and it stung that way as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour clothes look as if they had been thrown into a pool. Sonic\u2019s locker-room stink saturated the clothes as thoroughly as the sweat that was visible on them; the smell wafting up would have made you go wild with lust in another situation. But now you\u2019re too tired to do <i>anything</i>, never mind about getting excited again. In fact, you feel like you won\u2019t be able to cum again for a week after the beating you and your sex organ had endured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRising feebly to a sitting position, you send a weary glare Sonic\u2019s way. The gigantic hedgehog is sitting up on the edge of the couch, feet planted flat on either side of you, supporting his weight as he leans in closer to you. His face appears quizzical; one eyebrow cocked high with massive pupils scanning you from head to toe. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis neutral lips part in a self-satisfied grin when he gets a good look at you, and he says \u201cHeh, looks like you had a good time under there.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEither he was being willfully ignorant of your dilapidated state, or he genuinely thought that you were having a blast at the mercy of his soles. In a certain way, you were; just not of your own volition. Your insistence on staying pure for Silver had been thoroughly ground into the dirt along with your body; a fact that you know you\u2019ll come to grieve about later. But right now, you had other things to worry about, and so your guilty feelings about being pleasured against your would have to come later. You did have a job to do, after all. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsing all your strength, you get to your feet; legs wobbling underneath you as you willed yourself to remain steady. You stand up as tall as you could manage, and wave both hands towards you as a signal that you\u2019re ready for more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSonic lets a conceited chuckle loose. \u201cWow, you\u2019re a greedy little fella, huh? Well, I\u2019m glad to see that you\u2019re so eager, \u2018cause I\u2019m not done yet.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou see his other blue foot move towards you out of the corner of your eye. By the time your head turns to meet it, it sideswipes you, knocking you to the ground without even the slightest indication of effort on Sonic\u2019s part. The only thing you have time to do before you are consumed by your dank prison is throw your hands up over your face. Thinking about it, doing so didn\u2019t make much sense rationally, considering what happened before; but instinct drove your movements and once the weight was on top of you, there was no correcting the mistake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSonic\u2019s voice is just barely audible; it came in more clearly though the vibrations it made in the floor than anything else. \u201cFor what it\u2019s worth, I\u2019m having a great time here. Can\u2019t say I\u2019m having more fun than <i>you</i>, though, but then again that\u2019d be pretty much impossible.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the intense gnashing resumes; made all the worse by your achingly sore body. Just as you predicted, your arms couldn\u2019t resist the massive force of Sonic\u2019s foot; so within the first stroke, they are laid straight out beside your head again. The sweat now coating your body is fresh; every part of you gets coated in a warm, gamy film of the stuff the instant the wall of flesh came down on top of you. The grinding only serves to smear it further into your skin, hair and clothes, until every inch of you smells like the blue blur\u2019s trademark body parts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMuch to your amazement, you\u2019re able to bear it a little better than last time; you didn\u2019t cry out in pain so much, even in spite of the fact that you could swear that he was pressing down harder on you. Naturally, that doesn\u2019t mean that you\u2019re able to remain totally tight lipped; Sonic\u2019s oscillating foot is still able to coat the inside of your nose in sweat, and the coughing fits that ensue again leave your mouth exposed to the putrid, sticky mass in front of you. But you\u2019re able to keep your composure, for the most part, and it allows you to think a bit more clearly than before. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust when you think you\u2019re getting into the swing of things (that is, actually getting used to several tons of hedgehog bearing down on you and grinding you into the floor), the titanic blue teen flips the script on you. This time, he wraps his toes around you and turns you ninety degrees, so that you were now perpendicular to your previous position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor an instant, you can see the teenaged hedgehog\u2019s enormous face. That damned cocky grin of his seems to mock you as you lay underneath him, powerlessly waiting to be worked on by his lower extremities again. It must\u2019ve felt great to have all that power over someone; having them at the mercy of the lowest part of your body, your <i>feet</i>, as well as the fact that tiniest shift in weight could turn that person into a pathetic red stain with a just a miniscule pop in retort. Of course Sonic was enjoying this; with an ego like his, who wouldn\u2019t?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe smiling green eyes are then covered up by another wall of blue fur. This time, the arch of Sonic\u2019s massive big toe completely covers your face, while each subsequent toe wraps around progressively lower parts of your body. Once you\u2019re snuggly encased in a coffin of Sonic\u2019s toes, he twists his foot at his ankle, dragging every toe over you supine body. Each toe is squished flat as he does this, ensuring that you feel every heave as each furry digit drags over your face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs each toe glides across you, it splashes more and more reeking sweat onto your tiny form. The smell is even more oppressive here than anywhere else on Sonic\u2019s foot; the odor alone is enough to choke off your oxygen supply and make you involuntarily hack. The taste that forces its way down your throat is putrid and tangy; but unbelievably, not all that unpleasant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour dick had been quiet for the past twenty minutes or so since Sonic switched feet. It wasn\u2019t sensitive anymore, but as the titanic teen twisted his foot back and forth over you, the ribbing sensation of his toes gliding over your crotch forced your member into a reawakening. With each pass it grew more and more rigid, until soon it was as hard as a rock in your pants. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, without warning, Sonic picked up his tempo. He ground you down with gradually more and more speed, making your lower belly do summersaults of pure ecstasy as his toes bobbed over your dick. Without thinking, you let out a soft moan, this time welcoming the intrusion of the blue blur\u2019s foot musk into your mouth. Taking deep breaths through your nose, inhaling the essence of the fastest thing alive, sends shivers down your spine and makes your penis spit out precum by the ribbons. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe speed of the massaging gets even faster; until, in time, the rhythm almost makes you think that he was jerking you off on purpose. For some reason, you cling to that thought, imagining his self-satisfied face as he watched you writhe in blissful convulsions. You think of it pleasing him to see you like this; that he wants to keep working you and working you, until you finally shoot your load under the pressure of his famous feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don\u2019t have to wait long to fulfill that wish. Your lower body explodes in a terrific procession of spasms and contortions. Your hips heave up and down against the teen\u2019s pressing toes, as your dick erupts with more cum than you ever could have imagined it could hold. The ejaculate soaks through your drenched pants on the first squirt; each one after leaks out of your pants and begins lightly coating the undersides of Sonic\u2019s toes. It cakes onto the blue fur, and is quickly scraped off by the rest of your body when he twists his foot. Quickly, your entire torso and the fronts of both thighs are smeared with a stinking mixture of your own cum and the blue blur\u2019s perspiration.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Much to your amazement, the up-tempo grinding seems to slow down considerably as soon as you spew your load. Just when the spasms in your dick peter out, the titanic teen hedgehog removes his foot from you. You\u2019re far too exhausted to do anything but take fatigued, panting breaths; so you don't fight it when the massive teen reaches down and picks you up in his godly grip. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, well, looks like I guessed right. You DO like my feet, and quite a bit by the looks of it.\u201d He flashes a mouthful of human-sized teeth, giving you a smile that would have made you wince with embarrassment under normal circumstances. However, you couldn\u2019t even muster the energy to react properly to the cocky teen\u2019s condescending remarks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe leans back slightly, and lets his foot rest on the knee of the other. With his free hand, he slowly runs his finger along the inside arch of his toes. Sweat, gunk and your own spunk collect in a small, gooey pile on the tip of his finger. When the monstrously sized digit finally moves past his big toe, he brings the collected assortment of bodily fluids closer to his face. He inspects it very closely, rubbing in between his gloved thumb and index finger and smearing it everywhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, he says \u201cYup, that\u2019s just like I thought. You got a real bad foot fetish, don\u2019t cha?\u201d He glances sidelong over at you, obviously aware of the answer without you having to give it. \u201cThat makes a whole lotta sense, now that I think about it.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe works the sweat-infused cum around in his fingers some more. He presses his fingers together with considerable force, and then slowly separates them. Long strings of sticky spunk stretch out between the slowly moving appendages. The strands get thinner and thinner, before they finally snap, dangling off the teen\u2019s thumb and plopping in thick globules on the cushion of the couch a few stories below. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe wipes the spunk-filled hand on the edge of the couch, smearing the mixture deep into the fabric. The bastard should have to pay for that, but there was nothing you could do now. He knew about your fetish, and he even found out about your involuntary ejaculations at the mercy of his footplay. Of course, Sonic didn\u2019t uncover the entire story; you suspect that he thinks that the squirting of your love juices was intentional, but when all\u2019s said and done, you don\u2019t think he cares much about those little details anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn fact, you have to wonder if he even remembered the terms of your agreement anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout ceremony, he leans down and deposits you on the floor. You stare up, and see Sonic in all his glory. He towers over you; his head hundreds of feet in the air and blocking out a significant portion of the light coming in behind him. Squarely in his shadow, you know that there\u2019s no hope of escape from whatever machinations the giant blue blur had in mind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tower that was the teen\u2019s right leg lifted high into the sky, far higher than you thought was safe. Sonic grinned as he hovered his foot above you, clearly enjoying every second of the anticipation before he would feel the tiny human squirm around under his soles again. The giant wiggles his toes excitedly, right bringing the several tons of foot flesh to a crashing halt on top of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe familiar pulverizing begins to wreak havoc on your body again; when all of a sudden, it stops. The giant\u2019s putrid, furry foot is lifted off of you, and you instantly feel a change in the air. The look on your tormentors face is no longer one of conceit or pleasure, but instead of total shock. You follow his eyes to the source of the surprise, and it causes you to gasp as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilver is standing at the entrance to the living room. His young face is twisted in horror, and his eyes darts from Sonic's to yours in rapid succession. Otherwise, he doesn't move a single inch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA light chuckle above you brings your attention back to Sonic. His classic grin had finally returned, and his posture had relaxed considerably. He crosses one leg over the other, and leanes against the back of the couch with both arms spread out at shoulder height. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, hey there Silver. Man, that was pretty quick; I hope you don\u2019t mind that I decided to play with your little friend here while you\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the blink of an eye, Sonic is gone. A mere fraction of a second later, a cacophony of a million thunderclaps blasts your eardrums close to the point of bursting. The shockwave that follows shakes the ground like an earthquake; and you know that this isn't just a result of your diminutive size: you hear the clanging in the background of plates, cups and other items resonating with the blast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sit bolt upright and turn your head left, following the sound of cracking that suddenly appeared near the door. Sonic\u2019s gigantic form is suspended a few normal-sized inches above the ground, just high enough so his splayed out toes don\u2019t touch the ground. His arms and legs are spread out flat around him, struggling against all hope against an invisible force. The wall behind him is slightly caved in, and adorned with a spider\u2019s web of cracks that originate from somewhere behind Sonic\u2019s back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel a gust of air rush past you; and before it settles down, you see Silver hover in front of the other,  helpless hedgehog. The silver teen is glowing with teal energy; far more than you had ever seen before. In fact, the aura around him seems to churn and swirl, like it was so condensed that the massless light was given weight, and it ebbed and flowed like a liquid as a result. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilver\u2019s outstretched hand comes so close to Sonic\u2019s neck area that even you couldn\u2019t fit widthwise through the gap. You can\u2019t see his face, but just based on the sound of his voice, you could tell your savior is speaking through clenched teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe says, \u201cSonic\u2026What the hell do you think you\u2019re doing?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blue blur tries his best to regain his jovial composure, but you can tell that the crushing force of Silver\u2019s powers is making that difficult. He at least manages to crack a weak smirk when he says:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, dude why\u2019re you so upset? You mad that I started the party without ya\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilver\u2019s aura shines brighter than ever before; crude bubbles begin to form in the energy, so that it looks like the teal light is a pool of water boiling off of him. The cracks surrounding Sonic\u2019s body double in width, followed instantly by the sickening sound of a tree being split by lightening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilver replies, \u201cYou don\u2019t have the right to make jokes. Now, I\u2019m not going to repeat myself again: what were you doing with my friend over there?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough pain had initially caused Sonic to wince, when he opens one eye to stare back at Silver, there is still a glimmer of his usual spirit. The blue hedgehog grunts back, \u201cHe was just\u2026keeping me company while you were off polishin\u2019 my shoes. He came out of his hiding spot by the TV and wanted to get\u2026acquainted with my feet. I just figured it\u2019d be fun to oblige.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilver\u2019s outstretched fingers, once rigid with anger, now relax slightly. He turns his head slightly over to you. \u201cIs\u2026is that true?\u201d he asks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOut of instinct, you open your mouth to explain, but Sonic cuts you off. \u201cYeah, it is. He walked right up to me while I was relaxing here. I asked him if he liked my feet and he said yes\u2026then he agreed to give me a foot massage while we waited for you to get back. I made sure he was up for it first, and he was really dead-set on it. Everything's cool, dude...honest!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilver stood in silence for a few more moments. Finally, the aura around him dissipated, and Sonic was dropped to his feet. The blue teen held his shoulder and rotated it a few times, while Silver walked past you and picked up the shoes he had dropped. He walked them back over to Sonic, and shoved them into his chest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere. Take \u2018em and get out. I have to be alone for a while.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSonic glances from Silver to you, and then back again. You can tell that all manner of conceit and deviousness has left the blue blur, replaced now by apprehension. He looks like he wants to say something, but doesn\u2019t. Instead, he deftly slips his shoes on his feet without saying a word.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he\u2019s done, he holds his palm out in front of him. In a flash of light, a stark white gem appears. He holds it out for Silver to take.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere ya go. Thanks again for doing me that solid...I\u2019ll catch ya later, okay?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilver takes the emerald from him and simply nods an affirmative. On that note, Sonic opens the door and steps outside. Before he closes it, he takes one last look at you; he seems to give a wordless apology with his eyes before finally shutting the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe house is so silent that you could hear Sonic\u2019s footsteps outside. He doesn\u2019t speed off like you expect; instead, he seems to walk away from the house at a normal pace. Silver remains still; one hand clutching the precious Chaos Emerald, and the other balled into a fist. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, he turns his head just enough to look down at you. His golden irises display a myriad of different emotions, so entangled with one another that they fail to come to fruition on his face. Looking at you for a time does seem to help one stand out above the rest, though...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilver\u2019s lip twitches a bit like he wants to say something, but the words fail to come to him. Instead, he turns fully and walks away, taking the path around the far side of the couch instead of the more direct route near you. He rounds the bend out of sight; and after a few more booming steps, you hear a door slam in the distance.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You look around the empty room, completely rudderless and terrifically alone. With nothing but the memories of recent events to keep you company, you decide to turn around and sit against the thick leg of the coffee table. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce seated, the image of Silver\u2019s disappointed face plays to the soundtrack of his echoing, angry footsteps with striking clarity. These memories play over and over again without reprieve; soon, they torment you with intense feelings of sorrow every time they play again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first, you couldn\u2019t believe that you thought any of that was a good idea. You berate yourself for not having the foresight to predict what Silver would say if he caught you getting cozy with Sonic\u2019s feet. With the benefit of hindsight, you can see how the whole thing would look like a heinous act of cheating, instead of the carefully planned deal that you had intended it to be. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat must your silver-haired hero think of you now? You must seem to him to be an uncontrollable, feet obsessed pervert who only showed affection to him because there was no one else around; once Sonic showed up, you flung yourself at him with reckless abandon, just like the desperate little foot whore that you were. To your grief-stricken mind, that argument made perfectly logical sense. It was the ONLY conclusion your hero could come to, and he had every right to be upset about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut\u2026that wasn\u2019t the whole story. Not at ALL, in fact. Yes, you did choose to get close to Sonic in the hopes of tasting his feet, but you had no idea that he was awake the whole time. He said himself that he was waiting for an opportunity to catch you; who\u2019s to say that he wouldn\u2019t have just sped over and picked you up while you made your way across the living room floor? It was inevitable from the moment you left Silver\u2019s side that Sonic would find you; and with the blue blur\u2019s powers of observation, you're certain that your secret love of his feet wouldn't have been kept safe for very long, either. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only reason you worked on Sonic\u2019s feet in the first place was because he threatened to put Silver through more tortures if you didn\u2019t. How could you possibly abandon Silver when you were in such a unique position to help him? There wasn\u2019t a whole lot you could do to help him at your current size; in fact, you imagined that you were really more of a hindrance to him than an actual asset.  But there was one thing that you were really, REALLY good at: servicing the feet of giants. Silver said himself that no one at his size could give a foot massage quite like you could; the fact that such a talent came in handy today was something that you should be proud of, not ashamed about. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuaking footsteps suddenly make their way down the hallway, snapping you out of your stupor. The crashing footfalls come in quick succession; so fast that their owner practically flies into the kitchen area once he finally rounds the bend. Silver doesn\u2019t look in your direction when he passes; instead he casts his gaze around his immediate vicinity. You take note that his boots are back on, thus explaining why the giant hedgehog's footfalls sounded so heavy from so far off. However, you sense that there was far more to it than that as well.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA series of loud crunching sounds emanates from underneath Silver as he steps near the refrigerator. He grunts in disgust and glows teal, raising up shards of broken plates and drinking glasses from below his feet and depositing them into the nearby trash bin. Doing this forces him to turn in your general direction, and you notice that he catches your eye for a brief instant. The moment he does, however, he breaks off and whips around to face the sink behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe grabs one of the humungous dirty pots on the counter next to him, turns on the faucet, and plunges the cookware deep into the steaming stream. It's strange that Silver would resort to cleaning dishes by hand when he could easily use his powers, but then you think of a reason why: cleaning the dishes this way means that he has to stay facing the sink...and not you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou make your way over to the kitchen, stopping a few human-sized feet away from the titan\u2019s rubberized soles. From this angle, you could see his face; he does his best to look intensely focused on the task in front of him, but you can tell that he knows where you are. Slowly tiring of this game of his, you look around for something to throw at him to get his attention. A minuscule piece of china abuts the counter nearby; to your size, it looks to be roughly the shape and size of a softball. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walk over and heft the piece of ceramic in your hand. It\u2019s got a fairly nice weight to it, but you know that even if you threw it as hard as you could, you wouldn\u2019t be able to do any real damage to Silver with it. Without getting any closer, you reel your hand back and let the small piece of debris fly. It arcs through the air and impacts Silver\u2019s exposed leg. Much to your shock, the giant actually flinches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOw,\u201d Silver exclaims, as he lets go of the pot looks down at you, seeming rather annoyed at the interruption. He asks, \u201cWhat do you want? Can\u2019t you see I\u2019m busy?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou decide quickly that signing out your entire explanation would be next to impossible. Instead, you wave him over and make a scribbling sign to indicate that you want to write the message for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis brow furrows and he turns his head away from you again. \u201cNo way, I don\u2019t really care about what you have to say. What\u2019s done is done, and that\u2019s all there is to it.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then glances sidelong at you, skewering you with a venomous stare when he says, \u201c...besides, you never listen to a WORD I say, so why should I have to listen to YOU?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stand with your mouth agape, unable to comprehend what you just heard. You simply can\u2019t believe it; he really didn\u2019t want to hear your side of the story? Was it possible that he took Sonic\u2019s word at face value? In your frustration, you stomp your foot and began screaming a blazing tirade up at him, one that makes your face flush red with anger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the back of your mind, you realize that Silver couldn\u2019t physically hear you, but you don\u2019t remember such a minute detail in you rage. It looks like he\u2019s simply ignoring all of your points, and willfully continuing on with his duties. This infuriates you further, so much so that you stomp over to Silver\u2019s boot and give it a swift kick with all your strength. It doesn\u2019t budge an inch from your hit, but it does move away from you when he turns and leans over your head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, don\u2019t give me that attitude! YOU\u2019RE the one who can\u2019t keep his hands to himself!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou whip your head side-to-side, then point to yourself and then up at his face. Can\u2019t he see that you did all of that for his benefit? Well, he WOULD if he\u2019d just let you explain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe forces a short, disbelieving puff of air through his teeth, then says, \u201cI TOLD you what would happen if Sonic caught you, but you just didn\u2019t care, did you? You know what, it serves you right if Sonic was rough with you; maybe NOW you\u2019ll listen to me instead of blowing me off.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow you\u2019re absolutely fuming. You didn\u2019t blow him off on PURPOSE; things just got way out of control. Besides, who was he to tell you what you can and can\u2019t do? You puff out your chest dramatically and beat it with a strong, open hand, indicating that you can take care of yourself without the help of nanny Silver.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh yeah, I bet you\u2019re a real tough guy,\u201d the teen says, as he raises himself up to his full height. He crosses his arm in front of his chest and raises an eyebrow as he says; \u201ctell me again how that worked out for ya when you were being ground into dust by Sonic\u2019s big toe. Or are you gonna tell me that that was \u2018all part of your plan,\u2019 or something stupid like that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour face flushes red at the dismantling of your argument. But that didn\u2019t change the fact that you weren\u2019t in any danger; you skillfully kept Sonic in a good mood and avoided anything that would have pissed him off. You knew exactly what you were doing, even if it didn\u2019t look that way to an outsider. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you can offer your retort, Silver huffs through his nose and turns back towards the sink. He then closes his eyes and takes a deep breath; when he speaks again, his voice is far calmer, but not at the expense of it\u2019s commandingly hard edge. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll be making us lunch in a few minutes. Go someplace where you won\u2019t get into any more trouble, all right? I\u2019ll call you when it\u2019s done.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat seemed to be the end of the conversation. It caught you so off guard that you weren\u2019t sure what you wanted to do next. You have more to say, WAY more, but Silver seems insistent that he isn\u2019t interested in hearing it right now. Perhaps it would be better if you slinked off somewhere and cooled down for a minute or two. If you did that, then maybe you could come up with a solution that would benefit you both, and bring about an end to this gross misunderstanding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then you catch a glimpse at the small piece of plate from before. Throwing the thing at him seemed oddly satisfying, and it would show him that you couldn\u2019t be shoved off into a corner somewhere like some disobedient child. You have a point to make, and you were dead set on making it to your pig-headed protector. Too bad if he didn't want to hear it; you know for certain that once he DID, he'd see the error of his ways. After that...well, maybe a session or two of make-up sex would be in order, with YOU calling all the shots. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>This misunderstanding has to end as quickly as possible. You march over to the tiny piece of plate, thoroughly intent on using it as often as you had to until you got your point across. Ignoring the problem like Silver wanted was only going to lead to more animosity, and even though you didn\u2019t want to admit it, you knew that it hurt to see this rift form between you two. Rage may have guided your actions before, but the fuel burning that flame was one of a profound desperation; a deep, DEEP desire to get things back to the way they were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou heft the ball of ceramic and hurl it at Silver\u2019s massive leg with all your strength. It impacts noiselessly and bounces away in some random direction, but Silver\u2019s hiss of pain through angrily clenched teeth tells you that the hit was very much effective. He growls bitterly before addressing you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou really can\u2019t listen to me ONCE can you? Why can\u2019t you just leave me alone?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shake your head emphatically, and then make the scribbling motion on your open palm again. Though a slight fear forms at the bottom of your stomach, (no doubt a result of seeing a powerful, gigantic teenager get increasingly annoyed at your constant meddling), you soldier on with your request regardless. Getting this mess sorted out was far more important than any apprehension you could possibly feel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilver rolled his eyes and turned off the running faucet. And instant later he glows teal and lifts you up into the air with his mental powers. You notice that the take off was abrupt; vastly different from the gentle and graceful levitations he had performed on you in the past.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour giant protector wears an annoyed scowl as he floats all the way across the room towards the sofa. His tight grip on you prevents you from moving your head, but out of the corner of your eye you see him levitate the graphite and pad of paper that you had used to communicate before. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilver drops himself onto the couch with an inconspicuously loud THOOM, right before placing you and your stationary down on the coffee table in front of him. While you get your bearings on the wooden surface, he crosses one leg over the other, folds his arms in front of his chest poof and sighs impatiently. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you expected, the process of writing everything out is painfully slow and physically exhausting; however, your drive to clear the air with your hedgehog crush pushed you along. Once five minutes of steady writing passes, you reach the end of the page and have to flip to a new one. You toss your graphite aside for a moment so that you could pull the paper with both hands; a smart move, considering you need almost all your strength in order to peel back the driveway-sized sheet from all the rest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile you\u2019re turning your page, you hazard a glace up at Silver. He has his cheek resting on his fist, and his eyes restlessly dart around in the general area of the door. He looks like he\u2019s doing everything he can to avoid looking at you and what you\u2019re writing. At first this strikes you as an insult to your labors, as if he really DIDN\u2019T give a damn about what you had to say. However, the more rational part of your brain consoled you with the thought that he was simply looking away to avoid reading what you've written before you had a chance to finish. It\u2019s enough to quell the torrent of anger that swelled in you as a result, but the fact that Silver\u2019s eyebrows seemed permanently fixed in their furrowed position didn\u2019t instill you with a terrific amount of confidence in your rationale.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nYour conflicted feelings only serve to increase your level of fatigue. Ten minutes of steady writing passes, then twenty. The words pour out of you much more sluggishly as your mind and body slowly burn out. You want to keep going, to finish what you started quickly, but your exhaustion prevents it. Deciding to take a quick break, you step off the paper and collapse on the dark wood coffee table. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter smacking your tongue on the roof of your parched mouth, you come to realize that you hadn\u2019t had anything to drink since before the incident with Sonic. With you finally sitting down, your body screams at you to get something to drink. You see that Silver is still looking away from you, but you decide to wave him down to get his attention anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis mind is clearly elsewhere; again, you weren\u2019t sure if that was due to malice against you or simple absentmindedness, and trying to figure it out puts more strain on you than you care to handle. The feeling of the piece of graphite in your hand gives you an idea. Without even bothering to aim, you chuck the pencil tip in the general direction of your titanic host, using the last of your strength to ensure that it impacted with sufficient force. When it plinks off his skin just underneath the left side of his chest hair, you hear him gasp sharply in surprise. Before he turns to look at you, he closes his eyes and takes a deep breath through his nose, then lets it out through his teeth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI really wish you\u2019d quit throwing stuff at me.\u201d He says under his breath as he gives you a fleeting look. Under normal circumstances, you\u2019d retort that there was no other foreseeable way for you to get his attention, but the thought is promptly scrubbed away by a riptide of drowsiness. You sign to him a drinking motion, but he looks away before you can get the invisible cup to your lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRather, your white-furred guardian\u2019s gaze lands on your work in progress. Before you can do anything about it, he leans over and reaches for the pad lying next to you. A lightning bolt of anxiety careens through your entire body, defibrillating your tired mind and banishing all traces of fatigue. Before you know it, you\u2019re on your feet, yelling up to him that you weren\u2019t done with your story yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaturally, however, Silver doesn\u2019t hear your pleas. He swipes the pad up off the table so fast that a gust of air billows over you. With your newfound energy, you jump up and down and scream at the top of your lungs, but nothing diverts his attention from what you had written. In your excitement, the thought of you being slighted on purpose seems more and more like a real possibility. Anger begins to flare up in you, and as your progressively louder cries continue to go unanswered, the idea manifests to find something else to throw at him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look around feverishly, but the only projectile you had was now somewhere on the floor below you. But your search abruptly ends when you see your pad drop within inches of your tiny form, landing on the table with a deafening THOOM. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere; now that you got all that off your chest, do you feel better now?\u201d Silver didn\u2019t look any less annoyed as you gazed up at him from the table\u2019s surface. Your heart swan dives into the pit of your stomach when a sickening implication comes to mind; the thought that he hadn\u2019t read a single word of what you said stabs you in the gut so hard that you begin to absentmindedly pant to catch your breath again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crashing of his booted feet might as well have been the sound of your whole world crashing down around you. You\u2019re too stunned for words, but you can still perceive enough of what was going on around you to hear Silver say,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLike I said before, I got lunch to make.\u201d It doesn\u2019t register when he picks you up with his powers and deposits you on the couch; you only realize it later when your find yourself sunken into the supple couch cushion after you were already moved. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout another word, he plods back off to the kitchen. You find that you only have the willpower to watch on as he works hundreds of feet away from you, back turned and intensely focused on finishing his task. He doesn\u2019t look back at you once; not even a glance in your general direction is afforded to you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the sound of each pot and pan being placed on the countertop next to him, more and more of your feelings become detangled as the shock wears off. You gave it your all, but it still wasn\u2019t enough. Perhaps Silver would stay mad at you forever; and if that was the case, then what could you possibly do about it? You wanted to be sad about it\u2026to cry your eyes out at the loss of a beautiful relationship right on the eve of its consummation. But if Silver was going to treat you like this, like a little kid that didn\u2019t know any better and had to be constantly coddled, then spending your tears on him seemed\u2026 like a waste. He didn\u2019t seem too upset about losing you, after all; so it was reasonably clear to you that you shouldn\u2019t feel so bad about it either. You clearly deserved better than Silver, someone who didn\u2019t fly off the handle at the tiniest transgression, and one who actually LISTENED to you when you were trying to explain yourself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut you were stuck with him: for now, anyway. Surely, though, you shouldn\u2019t be subjected to this kind of treatment from him. You may be miniscule to him, but you had rights just as much as anyone else; a fact that he seemed to forget when he couldn\u2019t even show you the slightest bit of common courtesy by letting you continue with your account. Well then, you figure that if he was going to treat you like a child, than perhaps you should act like one\u2026the most obstinate, reckless, pain-in-the-ass disobedient little kid that you could possibly be. If you absolutely HAD to be stuck with him for the foreseeable future, then you had to be sure that you would make it the most stressful time Silver had ever had in his entire life. It was only fair thing to do, after all.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The days following your fight with Silver quickly began to follow a distinct pattern. You wasted no time in giving the teenaged hedgehog a headache every chance you could, and you ensured that his torture went on for every waking moment. Of course, he didn\u2019t take that lying down, and so each day became a teeter-totter of who got one over on whom, and who was embittered because of what. This struggle between hard headed titan and tiny carried on for days, and then weeks. Soon, your prickly attitude and the actions resulting from it became like a daily routine, as natural to you as waking up in the morning and brushing your teeth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis morning you were on Silver\u2019s dresser, just underneath the television in his room. Initially, your giant protector let you sleep on the end table directly next to his bed; but he soon realized that, while this WAS close enough for him to keep a close eye on you, it was TOO close for him to do anything productive; like sleep, for example. And so, the little sleeping bag that he made for you out of one of his old socks (one that he THORUOGHLY cleaned, much to your chagrin) was moved over to his dresser, right where he thought you couldn\u2019t be a bother to him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce you fully awaken, you walk over to the very edge of the dresser and, without a second\u2019s hesitation; leap off to the floor below. The impact barely sends a shiver up your spine, as the incredibly thick carpet cushions your fall, just as intended. In time, you wade through the carpet and arrive at the base of Silver\u2019s bed. Once there, you reach around the leg of the footboard and produce a carefully hidden thread. To you, this thread was about as thick as rope, extending from the bottom of Silver\u2019s mattress and bridging the empty space between his box-spring and the floor. You give it a tug to ensure that it\u2019s secured tightly, and once you\u2019re certain it is, you begin climbing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, you crawl out onto the vast, white plain of bed sheets and comforters. In the distance, you see part of the titan's fur sticking out from a huge bulge in the sheets. His face isn't visible at this distance, but you know exactly what you\u2019ll find once you get closer. Sure enough, when you close the distance, you see that he\u2019s sleeping peacefully in his normal position: on his side, with everything from his shoulders up peeking out from under his sheets. The rest of his titanic body is covered in a thick layer of warm blankets; his cute, relaxed looks simply angelic as he gently snoozes under your feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA smirk forms as you look over at the nearby clock; you see that it\u2019s exactly six in the morning, and your heart leaps in anticipation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou casually walk over to the exposed section of Silver\u2019s shoulder, taking your time to imagine how comfy he must be at the moment. When you feel Silver\u2019s fur tickling the bottoms of your feet, you check your balance to ensure that you wouldn\u2019t be sent plummeting to the mattress below. The instant you feel secure, you bend at your knees and jump as high as you can into the air. After you reach your apex, you bring your heels together and extend your legs so that you come down like a heavy needle onto Silver\u2019s exposed skin. The impact pushes your heels so far into the giant\u2019s arm that you could swear you hit bone. You use the downward momentum to wind up your next jump; then you do it again, and again, and again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou keep an eye on Silver\u2019s face the entire time, eager to see it contort in misery as he's rudely awakened at such an early hour. But as you begin to lose count of how many times you slammed into him, you notice that such a thing isn\u2019t going to happen. He HAD woken up, of that you were certain; his peaceful breathing had ceased and his relaxed face grew far more alert, though his eyes remained closed and he didn\u2019t move a muscle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course he wouldn\u2019t give you the reaction that you wanted, as that was just one of the many ways he punished you for being so obnoxious. But this doesn\u2019t dissuade you; if there was one thing you learned during your month in Mobius, it was how to push Silver\u2019s buttons. You stop jumping and take a few steps towards his upper shoulder. Here, the thick hairs of his chest poof extend up and around his shoulder, towards his back. With a cursory glance in the direction of his face, you reach down and yank a hair right out of the ground, as if it were a weed in a garden. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat gets his attention. His yelp is ear-gratingly loud, but short and satisfying. You're so smug that you don\u2019t even mind when his massive hand reaches out from underneath the covers and yanks you off of his shoulder. He jerks you in front of his face, and the sight just makes you even more devilishly happy; you can't help but show amusement as you see his groggy face do it\u2019s best impression of severe annoyance. However, since he just woke up, the most he can manage is to furrow his brow and he lazily blinks at you; all the while sighing angrily through his nose. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen his eyes finally open wide enough to look at you, he speaks in a voice that sounded like he'd just gargled with gravel. He says, \u201cAw, come on\u2026how\u2019d you get over here? I thought I put you across the room.\u201d He pauses a moment, like he\u2019s about to turn around and confirm where your sleeping quarters were, but seeing as he was still in the process of waking up, he probably didn\u2019t feel like moving just yet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn fact, he doesn\u2019t say anything further for a few minutes; instead, he gathers his strength, and finally sits up after a few minutes of preparation. Once there, he twists and contorts his upper body in a variety of stretching motions, with you still firmly held in his grasp. The movements of his hands are quick and sweeping, and you're twisted and turned in a variety of orientations before he's through. Like a nauseating carnival ride, you swing and jerk through the air; a terrifying experience when you notice that you're dozens of feet in the air. You try your best not to scream in terror, as you know that that's just the reaction he'd be hoping to get. Instead, you try squeezing your eyes shut, but that only amplifies the feeling of vertigo you experience while being swung about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the ordeal finally ends, Silver places you on his covered lap. He seems very convincingly aloof as he fixes the disheveled white pillars on the top of his head that was his hair. He says, \u201cI think I\u2019m gonna have to put you in a drawer tonight or something. Obviously I can\u2019t trust you with being out in the open on your own.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blink up at him innocently, pouting you lips and pressing your hands together in a pleading-like sign. Then, you reach down to your feet and mime putting a sock onto your right foot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh yeah, you\u2019d like it if I put you in my SOCK drawer\u2026 well then, I guess I'll just stick you in a junk drawer somewhere.\u201d He glances down at you and smirks while he says, \u201cYa know, when I think about it, the junk drawer seems like a pretty fitting place to put you. I\u2019d probably have a lot less headaches if I just kept you in there.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour heart stops a tick when you hear Silver say that. You try your best not to let it get to you, and you think that you put on a fairly good show of not looking bothered by what he says, but the look on your belligerent teenaged caretaker's face tells you that your fa\u00e7ade isn\u2019t so airtight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning away from him seems like the best course of action, since he then couldn\u2019t read your facial expressions. But that's all the reaction he needs, and you hear him chuckle softly to himself. The ground beneath you upheaves, and you see Silver swing his legs over the side of the bed and plant them on the floor below. Before you know it, he lifts you up with his powers; floating himself up off the bed as soon as you made it into the air. You both refrain from saying anything further as you both hover out of the room and towards the kitchen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe morning continued according its usual course. The days where Silver prepared you a lavish meal were long past; instead, he fed you whatever he happened to be making and eating himself that day. This morning's meal was oatmeal, dressed with a combination of cinnamon and sugar. Along with your own bowl of soupy oat mash, your gigantic host also provides you with small amounts of condiments on the side so that you can season your breakfast to your liking. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo one makes conversation during the meal, as per usual. The only time Silver speaks to you is after you are both done eating, when he informs you that he's going out to hunt for the Chaos Emeralds...again. You barely pay it any mind, and instead prepare your body for what you know comes next; like clockwork, Silver lifts you up with his psychokinesis and places you in your usual spot on the coffee table in the living room. The usual three bowls soon follow, the same blue and white ones you used during your first night. Finally, as he levitates his shoes on his feet, he flicks the TV on and places the remote next to you; a gesture that's unnecessary, since you have no plans on changing the channel while he's gone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis young eyes seem to glitter with satisfaction as you glare up at him; you have no doubt that he\u2019s content with the fact that he's set you up with everything you'll need. But to you, the treatment's humiliating; like a dog being prepared for an extended period without his master. With smile on his face, Silver turns towards the door; he says his goodbyes from over his shoulder right before closing the door behind him. Just like every other day, you're left alone to your own devices. You probably won\u2019t move from the spot where your sitting, as you just don't see the point in moving when you have nowhere to go.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            ],
            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Much to your surprise, Silver isn\u2019t gone for very long. Only about two programs play through their entirety on the TV when you hear the distinctive, ear-splitting creak of the door opening off to your right. It comes as such shock that you actually stand up and turn to watch him enter; looking on as the cool air of Mobius\u2019s autumn blows in with him. The warmness of his smile is almost enough to warm your cold heart towards him, but the brisk breeze that filtered into the house behind him woke you from the fantasy before you could indulge in it too much. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout turning around, he kicks the door closed with the heel of his boot, making it slam home with a thunderous crash. He didn\u2019t close it normally because he was so focused on staring at you; he locked his giant golden irises with yours as soon as he entered, and didn\u2019t break the gaze until he slid to a kneeling position right next to the table. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou eye him up and down for a second, trying to discern what got him so excited. It wasn\u2019t unusual for Silver to be out on his gallivants for hours on end; most times he wouldn\u2019t arrive back home until well into the evening, when the sunlight was replaced with moonlight and it became too difficult to search any further. What could he have done in such a short time that would cause him to return so soon?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnless\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes begin to glow with excitement, and your face stretches into an incredibly wide and toothy smile. This causes Silver to respond in kind; the ginormous enamel formations that were his teeth peeked in from the edges of his mouth as a smile grew and exposed them. He even giggled a little under his breath, which made you even more excited. However, even though he was smiling at you, he didn\u2019t open his mouth to say anything. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou raise your eyebrows and nod a little, urging him on to say the words that you couldn\u2019t wait to hear. However, instead of saying something, his smile drops and his brow furrow. His eyes scan you wordlessly for a moment, before realizing something and marking his newfound comprehension with a long \u201cOh.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe shakes his head from side to side and says \u201cNo, I didn\u2019t find the Emerald today. Sorry about that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour smile turns to a scowl in no time flat. Now thoroughly disinterested in whatever he WAS smiling about, you turn towards the TV with an angry sigh and sit back down in your spot; bringing your knees back up to your chest and hugging your shins as if it would make Silver disappear from your sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, it doesn\u2019t; and Silver doesn\u2019t appear to notice your displeasure, as he begins to go off on his rant anyway. He excitedly recites everything that happened after he left the house: something about Eggman attacking a nearby town and the intense battle that followed. You did your best to pay attention to the program that was playing in front of you; it may have been a rerun of a show you\u2019ve seen many times already, but you still get annoyed that you can\u2019t hear EXACTLY what\u2019s being said over the sound of Silver\u2019s ramblings. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally fed up with hearing his droning on in the background after a moment or two, you decide to make your sour disposition known by getting up and stomping over to the TV remote. In order to do so, you have to turn and face where Silver was kneeling, but luckily you don\u2019t make eye contact. He was casually going on with his story while looking upwards quizzically, as if he was reading a transcription of the account that was written on the ceiling. You roll your eyes and mash the volume up bottom with your heel, all the way until the sound of the television droned out Silver\u2019s blabbering. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe increase in volume caught Silver\u2019s attention; he looked back down at you and then at the TV. You hear him tsk in in disgust as you walk back to your seat, but you never make it there. Silver snatches you up off the table mid-step, flinging you up in the air under the grip of his massive hand so quickly that the room begins to spin. You blink off the vertigo just in time to see Silver\u2019s ticked off face glare down at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell fine, doesn\u2019t matter if you want to hear about it anyway. The point is, I need to borrow you for a sec.\u201d Without even asking your permission, he bounds across the room with you in tow. Just when you think you\u2019ll see your breakfast on the outside of your belly again, he stops and lets you down onto yet another hard surface. You rub your eyes to stop the swirling shapes from taking over your vision; when things finally become clear, you notice Silver rummaging through a drawer in front of you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take the opportunity to regain your bearings; instantly you realize that you are standing the surface of the desk on the far side of Silver\u2019s living room. This was the very desk that your stationary was housed; and while you have made your way over here at floor level on occasion, you\u2019ve never had the opportunity to stand on its surface like this. The area surrounding you was barren of all objects, save for a small cup containing a myriad of writing implements. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn another few moments, the sound of Silver\u2019s rummaging ceases, replaced by an \u201cah ha!\u201d of confirmation. You turn and watch as your titanic guardian produces a long, thin piece of wood from out of a small side drawer. The ruler, which you assumed was a foot long to Silver, as he used imperial units all the time, stretched up to many times your height and was easily about as thick as the height of your head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he placed the ruler down, Silver poked and prodded at various points on your body. Apparently he was adjusting you, as when you finally ended up standing straight and tall, he lined the ruler up with your body. He squints one eye shut as he measures you, using his hand to determine where the top of your head ended up. In the back of your mind, you somewhat wish that you had listened to his story before; perhaps there was a hint in it that would make things clearer as to what the heck he was doing with you. After he measures you height wise, he turns the ruler sideways and attempts to measure your width. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou bear the humiliation of being sized up like a children\u2019s doll for as long as it takes for Silver to get his measurements. Once he\u2019s turned the ruler around you for the umpteenth time, he finally places it down and prances back into the living room. He kneels down at the coffee table and scribbles something on the notepad that you\u2019d left there, ripping the page off of the pad when he\u2019s done, and stuffing it into the space between his skin and his golden arm brace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he notices you signing the question of just what the heck he was doing, he snatches you up and places you back down on the surface of the coffee table again. When the new wave of dizziness wears off, you hear Silver say, \u201cOkay, that\u2019s all I needed, thanks little guy. I\u2019m gonna go now, but I\u2019ll be back soon.\u201d He smiles broadly and then says \u201cNext time you see me, I\u2019ll have a present for you. And before you ask, no\u2026it won\u2019t be an Emerald; at least I don\u2019t plan on it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt another time, you may have actually been excited about this mysterious present of his; but ever since the fight, you\u2019ve learned to become weary of any time that Silver makes plans for you. More often then not, they end in your abject humiliation and him feeling smug and confident the entire day. Not interested in letting that happen, you shrug your shoulders and then point at him, trying to ask just what the hell he was talking about. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilver\u2019s massive lips pout in response. \u201cIf you\u2019d let me finish my story, maybe you\u2019d know what I had in mind. But since you don\u2019t care, you can find out later.\u201d Then, he crosses his arms in front of him, \u201cbefore I go, are there anything else you\u2019ll need? I don\u2019t want to come back here and see you all moody because you thought I ignored you or something.\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You press your hands together and rest your cheek on them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou want your sleeping bag?\u201d Silver asks, and you nod an affirmative. Without saying anything else, he hovers out of the room and out of sight. The moment he rounds the corner, you sprint for your restroom bowls. When you reach the full blue bowl, you cup your hands together and scoop out as much water as you can carry; then you rush over to the empty bowl and toss the liquid into it. As the water forms a bead at the bottom of the basin, you hurry back to repeat the process. Once four or five handfuls of water pool at the bottom of the empty bowl, you wipe your hands on your pants and move back towards your original position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that very instant Silver returns with your sleeping sock. He places it in front of you, and you make a show of climbing in. Right before you pull the lip of the sock over your head, however, you point towards the empty bowl, which now holds a thin layer of liquid at the bottom of its basin. You see Silver glance over at it, and then roll his eyes before picking it up and taking it into the bathroom. It appears that he wasn\u2019t too fond of cleaning up your \u201cpee\u201d right before he had to leave. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeizing the opportunity, you crawl out of the sock and run over to the remote control. Luckily for you, it was JUST about as wide as you were, if a little bit taller. However, Silver\u2019s sock is so massive that the clicker would still fit inside easily without him noticing. It\u2019s a bit of a struggle, but you finally heft the device into position inside your bed and close the lip behind it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith very little time to spare before Silver gets back, you find that you don\u2019t have very many options to get down off the coffee table. Though you never wanted to try it, it appears you had to test your theory about the human body being able to take serious falls when shrunken. You reach the edge of the dark wood piece of furniture and kneel down to hang off of it, so that you were as close to the ground as you could possibly be. When you finally work up the nerve to do it, you let go and plummet to the hard ground below. The impact isn\u2019t as serious as you thought, though you do roll forward on the landing out of instinct. Now that you were on the floor, you had a much better chance of sneaking onto Silver\u2019s person unnoticed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hear Silver\u2019s thunderous footsteps before you see him round the bend. You can only see up to his knees when he finally approaches the table, but that\u2019s all you\u2019re really interested in anyway. Knowing full well that this would be your only chance to get on him, you sprint as fast as you can towards the towers of leather and rubber. As you near the aqua-colored toe of Silvers boot, you wind yourself up for a mighty leap that sends you crashing into the solid surface. You land on the very tip of the boot; right was it careens downward to meet the rim of the outsole. While there was nothing jutting out to give you purchase, most of your body landed above the rounded edge, meaning that you didn\u2019t immediately fall off due to your own weight. You clamber up until your whole body is sprawled out on the flat upper part of Silver\u2019s shoe, right where the aqua and dark gray with the white stripe meet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you suddenly feel a shift of the ground underneath you. You are hoisted into the air very briefly before everything is rocked from below you. Silver had only shifted his foot, but even that was enough to get you to lose balance. You know that you have to move somewhere more secure, and when you scan around, you think you find salvation. Right where Silver\u2019s ankle was located there was a collection of folds in the material of the boots. Many of these folds looked big enough not only to grab onto, but also to hide you completely if you lie underneath them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou make a break for it, silently praying that Silver didn\u2019t take a step before you can make it there. Thankfully, he doesn\u2019t begin to walk until after you slide into a particularly large crevice, wrap it around you and hold on for dear life. It\u2019s rough dealing with his walking at first, as each step rocks you to your core and slides you around in your small pocket of protection. You don\u2019t feel any relief until you hear him say some encouraging words high above your head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, I\u2019m heading out now little guy. I\u2019ll see you later.\u201d Once you hear those words, the shaking stops and you notice a distinct aura surround everything nearby. You hold on tighter when you hear the sound of the door shutting, and you feel the cool outside air wash over your body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou close your eyes in preparation for the inevitable acceleration, but it doesn\u2019t come right away. First, you hear a sigh leave Silver\u2019s lips high above you, a sad, weary little thing that catches you off guard. When you try to comprehend what it could mean, you\u2019re senses overload as you are suddenly accelerated to incredible speeds. The ride is intense, but once the shock of going from zero to sixty in mere milliseconds wears off, the rest of the trip seems to feel rather smooth. Your knuckles remain white as they grip into the leather however, and you find yourself grateful that you can\u2019t see anything from the inside of the fold. You\u2019re fairly certain that if you could see how fast you were traveling, your breakfast really WOULD be on the outside of you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a dozen or so minutes of flight, you suddenly come under the effects of intense deceleration. The sensation is almost as bad as accelerating; only this time you were threatened to be flung from your hiding spot into some unknown territory, instead of being pressed flat into the top of Silver\u2019s boot. Fortunately, you\u2019re able to hang on long enough to feel Silver plant his feet firmly on the ground. The moment he does, your eagerness to get off the insane ride pushes you to crawl out of your hiding spot and onto the center of your titanic protector\u2019s upper boot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you take a look around you see that you are now in\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You only get a cursory glace of your surroundings before the ground is drawn up beneath you. Keeping your balance is all but impossible as Silver\u2019s foot is raised up in the air. He takes a massive step forward, and when his foot finally connects with the ground, the violent shockwave that results sends you tumbling over the edge of his boot and rolling onto the hard, flat concrete floor. You stop on your back, looking up at Silver\u2019s towering body as he takes another step away from you. Apparently he hadn\u2019t seen you yet; which was probably all for the best, since you\u2019d much prefer to explore the new environment you found yourself in before you made your appearance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sit up and take a proper look around. The space is humungous, even by Silver\u2019s standards. The ceiling stretched up so high above you that you half expected to see a cloud drift by underneath the rusted panels of corrugated metal. Strong, thick I-beams ran down the center of the ceiling, acting as a spine from which smaller beams spread out perpendicular to it, connecting the edge of the ceiling to it\u2019s central spine. The walls appeared to be made of some thick concrete; exactly how thick, you couldn\u2019t tell, but certainly enough to give a mountain excavating team pause if asked to burrow through it. These walls stretched out so far into the distance that the far wall seemed covered in a light haze, not unlike a mountain range when seen from miles away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was something painted on the nearest wall; on top of a round, white base was a wreath of laurels; bordering the edge of the background and colored olive green. Centered at the very top of the symbol was a fluorescent green gemstone, drawn like an ideal cut diamond. Flanking either side of the gem was a pair of stark white wings; their coloration so pure that the background looked tinged with gray by comparison. At the bottom, centered between the two laurel strands was a single, immense gold ring. It caught the light from the nearby industrial lights, and you then realized that it was actually accented with gold leafing, which glittered and sparkled so brightly that it almost appeared to be emanating light of it\u2019s own accord.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, what really got your attention was the part of the emblem that instantly tipped you off to its owner; the person who, most likely, owned the entire building on which the symbol tagged. Just inside the wreath and following its curvature, two enormous orange tails fanned up and out in opposing directions; much like the small pair or wings splayed inside them. The white tips of the tails extended far past the edges of the laurels, stretching all the way up until the fluffy-looking tips were on level with the top edge of the emerald. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stand in both awe and befuddlement. What was Silver doing in Tail\u2019s workshop? Did the trip here have something to do with the measurements he took of you back home? When you think on it, it doesn\u2019t make sense; what use would Tails have for measurements on you? The sounds of Silver\u2019s footsteps were noticeably softer as he moved further and further away, but the expansive nature of the hanger meant that you could still hear the echo of his treads off in the distance. You push the questions out of your mind for the time being and scan around a bit; it turns out you were on one side of the central pillars, which seemed to serve as a divider of sorts that separated the hangar into two parts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe side you\u2019re on is cluttered with various pieces of high tech equipment: some of it on racks and dollies, some of it sticking out of opened crates, and some of it free standing. The larger pieces of equipment come equipped with sturdy metal wheels, presumably for easier transport; one example of this was a huge hydraulic arm that stretched a dozen stories into the air. Abutting the nearby wall is a massive red toolbox, taller than some skyscrapers back home, and far taller than even Silver. Next to the toolbox was a bench, littered with loose tools and other components. A small (by Silver\u2019s standards, to you it looked as large as an entire tool shed), backless shop stool is parked near the workbench, far enough away that it looked like whoever sat in it last rolled back to work on something else and then abandoned the seat there without replacing it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou make your way forward, using Silver\u2019s echoing footsteps as a guide, but mostly blazing your own trail as you explore the area further. To a normal sized person, this side of the hangar would have been like an obstacle course to navigate through; with maintenance equipment jutting out that had to be ducked under or stepped over, and crates and carts packed so tightly together that one would have to side step in order to pass through the gaps. Thankfully, your tiny size came in handy, as you passed under each hazard with minimal difficulty. Of course, the major downside to your small stature was that covering ground took immensely longer, and so making it through the labyrinth of machinery probably took the same amount of time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter traveling straight ahead for a bit, you decide to break off and see whet the other side of the hangar looked like. You duck underneath a few carts of aircraft components and sidestep a pallet of motor oil before you make it to the wide-open field on the far side. The entire space, from the far away wall to the support pillars is completely devoid of even a single piece of equipment, making it stand in sharp contrast to the jungle gym of metal and plastic that you just came from. You look down towards the other end of the hangar, and see why this part of it was so clear; in the distance, you see a very familiar looking red biplane parked neatly amid a small collection of scaffolds and carts. You must be standing in the thruway for Tails\u2019 famous aircraft, upon which he taxied his plane out of the hangar and onto the runway, which must have been directly behind you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, even though it wasn\u2019t too difficult to make your way through the clutter, you like the idea of travelling along this open road much better, so you begin to move forward again. Off to your left, you hear quaking footfalls emanate out; though judging by their patterns, Silver isn\u2019t walking normally. The steps stop every so often, then resume again, or get quieter briefly before returning to their normal volume. Why he didn\u2019t just fly over everything from the very beginning was a question that was nagging in the back of your mind as you gradually catch up to his position. Eventually you decide to break into a run, and you quickly overtake his struggling steps. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few moments after you do, you hear the resonating whine of power tools in the distance. The echo makes it difficult to determine the location of the source until you get closer; by the time you deduce that the sound was coming from somewhere off to your left, it changed from a steady whirling sound to a sharp chorus of crackling and popping. You try to look over the tangle of equipment, and sure enough, a small section of the far wall is illuminated in flickering blue light as welding sounds ring out across the hangar. Using that as your guide, you make your way over to the cityscape of heavy equipment, making it through quickly and ending up in a small, circular open space that brought to mind clearing in the middle of a dense forest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young fox boy is standing on a small step latter, with a flat gray welding mask covering his face. He\u2019s hunched over what looks like the engine block of a car, but the design of the car was unlike anything you\u2019ve ever seen before. It had a cabin; roofless, like a convertible, but with a distinctive sweptback windshield. The body looks simply made out of practical, durable steel, with some sections missing and exposing the components underneath. However, what strikes you most about this vehicle is the lack of any kind of wheels; at first you think they could be hidden inside the body of the vehicle, but from what you can tell, the car is sitting perfectly flat on the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you can think on it further, Silver suddenly enters your field of vision. The abrupt sighting of the giant teen gives you a jolt; you figured that you would hear him coming before he got here, but apparently Tail\u2019s work was loud enough for the teenaged hedgehog to sneak up on you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nApparently, Tails doesn\u2019t notice him, as he continues welding for a few more minutes until Silver finally walks up to the car and lightly raps the metallic body with his knuckles. Only then does the blue light disappear, accompanied by the striking hiss of the fuel to the torch being cut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout lifting his facemask, the young fox cries out excitedly, his voice muffled behind the metallic headwear. \u201cOh, Silver! Check this out, I think I almost got it working. Look here, I think I had the inertial dampeners calibrated all wrong last time. Come on, take a look!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe waves Silver over, the latter stepping over only reluctantly as he\u2019s instantly assaulted with a string of dense technobabble. The teenaged hedgehog doesn\u2019t seem interested in any of it, but he politely keeps quiet and looks at all the things Tails points out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike Silver, you tune out the ramblings as well, thinking instead on the big question that had been bugging you ever since you saw the logo on the wall. Should you make yourself known to the boy genius, or hold off on exposing yourself and only surprise Silver with your presence. The experience with Sonic still gives shivers of dread to this day, but you know full well that Tails is nothing like his blue idol. You may have better luck with him; but then again, maybe not. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat do you decide?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Nothing ventured, nothing gained. If you really think about it, there\u2019s always going to be a risk when exposing yourself to someone new, and until you get back to your normal size, that risk wasn\u2019t ever going away. If you don\u2019t at least TRY, then what\u2019s the point of ever leaving Silver\u2019s house? You\u2019d be perfectly safe in front of the giant TV, watching reruns of shows while Silver did all the heavy lifting; but that was a life you didn\u2019t want any part of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn spite of how things turned out, the incident with Sonic was probably the first time since you arrived on Mobius that you\u2019ve ever had any control of anything. It didn\u2019t help your depression that you didn\u2019t have all that much freedom since then, with Silver tightening his leash on you and all. It was frustrating to be cooped up in the house like that; a sentiment that you\u2019re sure Silver didn't understand. He could keep you safe from just about anything, but at what cost? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou aren\u2019t some possession that he can keep locked away somewhere. You could make your own decisions, and if the incident with Sonic was any indication, you can handle consequences too. It was about time Silver realized that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn spite of all your conviction, you hold back on walking out into the clearing. Tails was still busy boring Silver to tears, judging by the look on his face. You decide to wait until the boy genius was finished talking before making your entrance; but seeing as how the conversation looked to be going on for the foreseeable future, you cross your legs and sit on the cool concrete beneath you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe minutes tick by, each one passing with a river of technical jargon that was far too complicated for you to understand. Just when you feel like you\u2019re about to nod off, Silver\u2019s voice chimes in to break you out of your stupor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe says, \u201cHey Tails, I\u2019m glad you\u2019re excited and everything, but all this is going way over my head. I keep telling you, even though I\u2019ve seen cars like this in the future, I didn\u2019t spend all day working on \u2018em. I can only tell you if what you\u2019re doing LOOKS right, not if it\u2019s actually put together correctly.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTails pauses. Though you couldn\u2019t see the boy\u2019s face behind his welder\u2019s mask, you can tell his mouth was agape just by the way he stopped mid sentence and froze in his tracks. He lets Silver\u2019s words sink in before moving again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe rubs the back of his head and says, \u201cHeh heh\u2026yeah, I know, I know. Sorry about that, I just get a little carried away\u2026ESPECIALLY when I\u2019ve been racking my brain on this thing for the better part of a day. When I\u2019m in engineer mode, it\u2019s a little tough to snap me out of it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou see Silver smile at that, and he replies, \u201cNah, don\u2019t sweat it. I\u2019ll tell you what, though; it LOOKS right to me. Does it work?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTails practically rips the mask off his face, exposing his adorable, boyish fox face to the open air for the first time in who knows how long. Judging by the beads of sweat on his brow and the disheveled state of the fur on his muzzle, you find it safe to assume that it\u2019s been quite a while. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis sapphire eyes sparkle like gemstones as he says, \u201cYou bet it does! Here, take a look!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe twin tails pick up speed as they are whipped about like helicopter blades; soon, the boy is airborne, flying over the hood and windshield of the car. After he plops himself down in the driver\u2019s seat, Tails expertly manipulates the controls with a practiced hand. In under a minute, the vehicle roars to life; bellowing a mighty mechanical purr that echoes throughout the immensity hangar. You cup your hands over your ears to drown out the worst of it, and oddly enough, you notice Silver do the same. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the vehicle\u2019s undercarriage begins to glow. It shines forth a brilliant blue light, illuminating the floor below it. The shade of the light is not terribly different from Silver\u2019s when his powers were engaged, leading you to question what that could mean for your gigantic protector. The light grows more intense, and as it does, the steel body begins to shudder under the power of an unseen force. Then, ever so gently, the car begins to rise. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt lifts off only about an inch or so above the floor, just about high enough so that you could walk underneath it without ducking. It stays suspended on a cushion of air for a few more minutes, until it\u2019s finally brought back down to earth as gently as it had lifted off. As the car powers down, its mighty drumming changes into a softer whine before finally cutting out completely. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilver\u2019s face brightens in amazement. He says, \u201cTails, that was awesome! It sounds just like the cars back home now, even when it\u2019s turning off! And I think you got it up a little higher than the last time you showed me!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTails jumps out of the car and slaps Silver\u2019s hand in a proffered high-five. Then the young inventor turns and pats the vehicle\u2019s body, making it resonate with deep thuds. \u201cYeah, that was all the adjustments to the output system I was telling you about. It really helped, but I think I might need to replace the wiring when I find something better; I betcha I can make it fly up in the sky like you said if I just had a few dozen feet of superconducting lines. Then again, if I did that, then I\u2019d have to worry about running a cooling system to keep it below transition temperature\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm\u2026yeah okay,\u201d Silver says, trying to cut the fox off before he went off onto another tangent. \u201cI\u2019ll tell you what, if I come across anything, I\u2019ll be sure to bring it to you. Deal?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTails looks back up from his train of thought and smiles. He nods and says, \u201cDeal!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of a sudden, you notice Tails eye Silver curiously. He looks the teenager up and down with a furrowed brow, as if inspecting him like a malfunctioning robot. You decide to look him over too from where you sit; upon further inspection, the teenaged hedgehog looked positively littered in small oil splotches, scrapes and patches of messy fur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe memory of Silver\u2019s awkward footfalls echoing in the distance on your way up here instantly springs to mind. It would seem that your theory was correct; your fearless protector DID have a tough time navigating through the impressive tangle of equipment. Your gut reaction is to snicker at the thought of him inching his way between boxes and crouching underneath beams; evidently, the puny human that he was trying to stifle had an easier time of getting here than he did. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou watch on in amusement as Tails says, \u201cSilver\u2026you didn\u2019t walk through all my stuff to get over here, right? You could\u2019ve just flown over it; I wouldn\u2019t have minded.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour giant protector looks down at himself. The instant he does, a deep red blush flushes his cheeks. He gets right to work smoothing out his fur with his hands, causing Tails to utter an adorable boyish giggle that mirrored your sentiments. He walks over to a nearby bench and opens a side drawer; out of it, he produces a clean gray rag. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe chucks it in Silver\u2019s direction from where he stood. The psychokinetic hedgehog catches it with his powers, though he decides to wipe himself down by hand. As he does, he mutters \u201cHeh heh\u2026I guess I did, huh? I-I didn\u2019t really think to do that, honestly.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOut of nowhere, he stops moving and looks downward. Melancholy breaks across his face and his cheeks grow an even darker shade of scarlet. He speaks in a near whisper; \u201cI\u2019ve\u2026just got a lot on my mind recently.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTails looks curious, but doesn\u2019t say anything. Silver doesn\u2019t move for a moment, but then is suddenly stirred by a thought. He reaches into his cufflink and produces the paper he had stashed in there earlier. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cActually, that reminds me\u2026here\u2019s the measurements you wanted me to get. I did my best, but they might not be accurate enough for you.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTails is in the process of walking back when he cracks a confident smirk. It looked as if it was copied and pasted from the boy\u2019s idol, no doubt a mannerism the fox picked up from the blue blur. As he takes the paper from Silver\u2019s hand, he says, \u201cI\u2019m sure it\u2019s perfect. I mean, not to brag or anything, but I HAVE been putting together a car with an anti-gravity suspension from SCRATCH. Building a suit based on measurements is child\u2019s play by comparison.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeizing the opportunity, Silver says, \u201cWhich says a lot, considering you\u2019re still a kid.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTails\u2019s smirk grows wider, and he unfolds the paper carefully to begin reviewing it. \u201cYou got that right!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a lapse in the conversation that seemed perfectly suited to make your move. You stand up and make your way out into the clearing. Nobody noticed you, naturally, so you decided to take the initiative. An incredibly tiny screw sat nearby, just shy of Silver\u2019s enormous booted feet. You lift it up and hold it with the blunt end in a reverse grip, the point facing upwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReeling back, you let the screw fly like a javelin towards Silver\u2019s leg. Your aim is true, and it pings off dead center just around his knee. The giant teenager yelps, not expecting to be smarted from down below. He twists around and stands in total awe when he sees you waving up from the floor beneath him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTails reacts quickly to the sound of the hedgehog's distress. He looks up, and the instant his big blue eyes gaze on you, they light up in wonder and amazement. He gasps excitedly, but he remains wordless for a few more minutes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter he does speak, what does he want to do with you?</span></div></div>",

            ],
            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As Silver stammers in disbelief at your appearance, you see Tails yelp in abject glee. He closes the distance to you very quickly; so fast that he lets a gust of wind wash over you in the wake of his movement.  As he stands over you, he leans over and braces his hands on his knees. With mouth agape, he studies you all around, bending his knees slightly to view you at every angle he could. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the attention immediately goes to your head. It had been such a long time since anyone stared at you with such amazement, and it felt good to finally be noticed by someone other than Silver. You puff out your chest and spread your legs into a wide, akimbo stance, posing as if you were some kind of super hero or the like. To Tails, you probably looked more like an action figure, standing like that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, the good feelings were short lived; a moment later, the giant boy\u2019s wonderment is cut short by the sound of crashing footsteps. Right next to Tails\u2019s curious face, Silver\u2019s burst into view. His eyes glow with a maleficent fire, and it appears that every one of his hairs is standing on end; his chest fur in particular fanned out spectacularly, giving an even broader look to his already impressive chest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the heck are YOU doing here!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe must have yelled a bit too close to Tails, or perhaps the boy wasn\u2019t expecting the outburst. Either way, as Silver bellowed at you, Tails ears pressed flat against the top of his head, and his eyes were scrunched shut. When Silver finishes, Tails turns and addresses the hedgehog directly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJeez, what\u2019s your problem? \u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilver is taken aback by the abrupt rebuttal. His anger evaporates in a fit of surprised blinking, and he stares at the fox like he had just noticed his presence. You can see the gears turning in his head as he grasps that you weren\u2019t the only person in the room, and that he had some explaining to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stammers his response. \u201cI\u2026uh\u2026he\u2019s the guy I got the measurements from. He\u2019s supposed to be AT HOME, but\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Silver could finish, Tails cuts him off. He whips back around to you, eyes glimmering with fascination. You can almost feel your face glow with a warm blush; the way he looked at you, you would have thought yourself a superstar, if you didn\u2019t know any better. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo way\u2026so then YOU\u2019RE the little guy from Earth that Silver\u2019s been talking about! That\u2019s AWESOME!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe giggles with glee and beams with an adorable, toothy smile. Then he kneels down in front of you and offers you his massive, gloved hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a tone as warm as sunlight, he says, \u201cMy name\u2019s Miles, but everybody calls me Tails. It\u2019s very nice to meet you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shake his pinkie with both hands, feeling the softness of his gloves with your palms. You smile back at him; both in reaction to the kindness that he extended to you, and to communicate to him that the pleasure was mutual. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh man, this is SO cool! I can\u2019t believe I finally get to meet you in person! I have so many questions for you\u2026like what\u2019s it like on your world? What\u2019s your technological level? Do you have self-assembling AI constructs and quantum supercomputing? How about\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTails prattles on with a seemingly endless string of questions so complex that you can\u2019t even begin to answer them, even if you COULD speak to him. However, at this point, he appeared to be more interested in properly communicating what was on his mind than actually getting an answer. He sat up and looked up to the sky as he mentally scrolled through his infinitely long list of inquiries, no longer paying attention to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeizing the opportunity, you look over at Silver. He\u2019s leaning up against he body of the car, some distance away. You realize when you look over at him that he was already staring at you; when your eyes meet, his brow furrows into a miserable scowl. You can practically feel the anger radiate off him like the heat from an enormous bonfire; it rages about him invisibly, but palpably all the same. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo that, all you care to do is stick up your chin in defiance and revel in the attention you were receiving. If he didn\u2019t like sharing you with other people, than that was just tough for him. You\u2019re old enough to make your own decisions (in fact, you were far older than Silver).  Besides that, he had no one to blame but himself for this whole situation. If you had just been given a little bit more leeway, you wouldn\u2019t have had to resort to trickery and sleuthing in order to get a release. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was obviously only mad because you were soundly teaching him a lesson. No skin off your nose if he didn\u2019t like it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt long last, Tails exhausts his inexhaustible line of questions and looks back down at you again. Upon looking at you, he laughs with a sheepish smile; he must have realized that you had no way of answering every single one of his questions. You decide to smile back up to him to diffuse his embarrassment; thankfully, it appears to work, as his happy grin returns. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow, this is amazing. I can\u2019t believe you\u2019re really here in front of me. I\u2019ve gotta be dreaming or something.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, his face widens with excitement.  \u201cSay, why don\u2019t you come with me to my house. It\u2019s not too far off, we can hang out and maybe get something to eat\u2026you\u2019re probably STARVING since you had to make that long trip from Silver\u2019s, and\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, hold on a sec,\u201d Silver interjects, far in the distance. The echoing of his boots hitting the concrete seems amplified by his ticked off disposition. \u201cLook, there\u2019s no way this little guy\u2019s going with you. I have to take him home right now, before something happens to him.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if reading your mind and giving voice to your own sentiments, Tails turns around, crossing his legs underneath him and replying \u201cWhaddya think\u2019s gonna to happen to him, Silver? Do you not trust me or something?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt appears that the teen hedgehog is instantly aware of the gaffe he had uttered, because he looks terribly flustered as he says, \u201cWhat\u2026no, I trust you Tails. It\u2019s just that\u2026THIS guy has a knack for getting himself in trouble. Don\u2019t be fooled by his adorable looks\u2026he\u2019s a WAY bigger handful than you can imagine!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTails turns back around; first eyeing you, and then eyeing Silver again. Finally, he turns around completely and says, \u201cWell, I guess that makes us two of a kind, huh little guy?\u201d His giggle fit is highly infectious, causing you to join in as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilver, however, seems immune to it. He frowns at the pair of you and goes on. \u201cCome on, Tails, I\u2019m serious. Anything could happen to this guy, and I promised him that I\u2019d protect him until I got him back to his world. If anything were to happen to him...I\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLook Silver, you don\u2019t have to worry about a thing.\u201d Tails interruption is surprisingly reassuring. The boy only turns his head in Silver\u2019s general direction; the rest of his furry orange body faces you. \u201cHe\u2019ll be safe with me for the day: I won\u2019t let him out of my sight. Then, before it gets late, I\u2019ll take him back to your house myself.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen he turns to you, again all smiles. \u201cBesides, now that I have him here I can fit him for the suit myself, which means it\u2019ll get done a lot quicker.\u201d He rubs his chin and looks down his muzzle at you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe says in an exaggerated whisper, \u201cYa know, maybe we can even get some testing sessions in too.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilver gasps in horror and then stomps his foot in protest. Even at this distance, it\u2019s loud enough to ring your ears. \u201cYou\u2019ll WHAT!?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTails\u2019s shoulders quiver as a burst of laughter erupts from him. You take notice that his tails are swaying at a much faster rate as his good humor escalates. When he finally turns to Silver and stands up, the hedgehog realizes that he\u2019d been played. His cheeks grow red in embarrassment and anger, but they are quickly soothed when Tails touches the older boy\u2019s shoulder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI swear Silver, I won\u2019t let anything happen to your friend. I know how much he means to you\u2026and, well let\u2019s just say I know what that\u2019s like, thanks to a certain blue guy we both know and love.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can\u2019t see Tails\u2019s expression from where you stood, but Silver\u2019s face gradually softens as the silence stretches longer and longer. Though he doesn\u2019t appear entirely convinced, you figure he must have been satisfied on some level as he finally nods his head in affirmation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis causes Tails to squeal in delight, so loudly that Silver flinches and scrunches his eyes in response. The fox boy bounds over to you and gets on all fours. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe says, \u201cOkay, so whaddya say little fella, want to hang out with me for the day?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe choice is exceedingly obvious. You nod your head yes, a smile growing on your face as you watch Tails\u2019s grin extend in tandem. Without another word, he extends his hand to you, palm upwards. You climb onto the boy\u2019s plush platform of a hand and remain standing as he gets up off the floor. He puts his other hand underneath the one you stand on, carefully bracing it as if he were balancing a statue made of glass. He looks at you intently to ensure the ride is smooth, but the air of elation around him betrays his true feelings of wonderment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe starts walking back towards the car, moving in front of the hood where Silver stood. The boy said his goodbye in passing, never breaking his gaze from you. As you move past, you take a glace over at Silver. There\u2019s a look of doubt and fear plastered on his face, but his eyes seem to say something completely different. Amid all the worry, there seemed to be just the slightest hint of longing mixed in with everything else. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGood, that\u2019s exactly how he SHOULD feel. You look away from him and stick your chin out like you were storming off. Even as you move further and further away, you can feel Silver\u2019s gaze follow you until you finally round a bend out of sight.  <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Thankfully, Tails was right; his house wasn\u2019t very far away at all. In fact, it only took the boy genius mere minutes to make the trek. Unbeknownst to you, Tails\u2019s house was actually a small abode situated directly next to the hangar that served as his workshop. After you both passed front of the car, Tails had deftly maneuvered through a number of very large and complex engineering equipment until he reached the far left hand corner of the hanger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doors that stood there lead to a small corridor, only about a few yards long and about four yards wide. In sharp contrast to the very imposing construction of the hangar, this hallway appeared quaint and practical. As Tails took you down it, you gazed upon the walls and noticed that they were made out of slats of corrugated metal riveted together. Though the materials may have been crude, you could tell by the straightness of the lines of rivets that great care was taken in the corridor\u2019s building.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the far end of the corridor, a plain looking wood door blocked off the entranceway to Tails\u2019s house. Tails\u2019s footfalls seemed to grow more impatient as he approached the door; by the time he did, he practically threw it open in front of you both. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven though it was daytime, the fox boy\u2019s home appeared to be rather dark, any windows that filtered in light appeared to be on the far end of the house and out of your view. Your new host took a few steps forward, entering what appeared to be the kitchen and dining room areas. He placed you down on the simple wooden table as gingerly as he would place a flower, and it was only then that he ran back across the room to pull the thin white string that was connected to the lights above. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the florescent bulbs hummed to life, you were finally able to take in your surroundings properly. You were right in your assumption with this room you are standing in was the kitchen; off to your right, a series of mismatching cabinets adorned the walls above a countertop that looked more fitting as an examination table in a doctor\u2019s office. The rainbow of colors and materials in the kitchen alone made your head spin\u2026evidently, Tails scavenged sets from whatever he could find and simply put them together in a sort of Frankenstein fashion. Even the light fixtures above and the tiles below didn\u2019t match from one to the next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, in spite of the fact that their origins may have been drastically different, you can\u2019t deny that the whole set up was carefully put together and lovingly maintained. Everything looked brand new; reflective surfaces were polished to a brilliant shine and the woods sparkled brilliantly with fresh coats of wax and varnish. The tiles below you looked spic and span, even in the grouting. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn around to see what was directly opposite the kitchen, but unfortunately there\u2019s not much to look at. The room next to you appears to be the living room, though the majority of it stretched around a bend and out of your sight; what you DID see was a thickly cushioned brown couch and small end table (which, of course didn\u2019t match the couch OR the rug underneath it in the slightest). <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou thought the flooring below the couch, which ran from well inside the living room to about a few inches before then end of your table, was some kind of strange green rug. However, upon further inspection, you realized that it was actually some kind of AstroTurf, patterned with pinstripes of light and dark green. You wonder why on earth he would have a rug that looked like that...but then you remember the fox boy\u2019s first appearance in the game series. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTails gets your attention when he suddenly speaks directly behind you, initially causing you to flinch as the boy spoke in a particularly loud and enthusiastic voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo little guy, whatcha want to do first? I can head to my room and bring out some board games or something\u2026Oh, or I could take you around the house and show you around\u2026OR\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy is cut off by the particularly loud grumblings of your tiny stomach. Your cheeks brighten in embarrassment, but Tails simply giggles it off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, yeah; I guess you\u2019re pretty hungry, huh? Well, I think I got just the thing for that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis tails begin to spin, and soon the young inventor is airborne, hovering over towards the cabinets. As soon as he opens them, you see that they are littered with a myriad of containers\u2026some of the labels advertise that they are filled with hand wipes, or nails. Still others look like simple glass mason jars; it\u2019s through these that you discern that every container in that cabinet is filled with a myriad of brightly wrapped confections. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTails first flies over to an adjacent cabinet and produces a large glass bowl. He then hovers back, and begins taking fistfuls of candy out of each of the containers, depositing the pieces in the bowl. Once he\u2019s stuffed it to the brim, he abruptly stops spinning his tails, causing him to drop to the floor with a cacophonous crash. It\u2019s loud enough to cause you to wince, but your smile returns when you see Tails joyous face as he rushes back over to you with his bowl of goodies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t really know what you\u2019d like, so I grabbed a little of everything. Here, let me lay \u2018em out for ya.\u201d He does so right away, deftly picking different pieces from the bowl and presenting them to you. Once they are arranged in a neat line a few paces away, he pulls a chair closer to him before sitting down, resting his elbows on the table in order to prop up his head by his cheeks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can feel his glimmering blue eyes follow you as you inspect all the pieces of candy that lie before you. Each one varied in size from sour sucky candies the height of your waist, to a lollipop that stretched out to about two times your height. After looking them over, you decide to start unwrapping a medium sized piece of chocolate. Though it\u2019s fairly awkward, you do manage to rip the package open yourself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou happily chow down on your food, highly aware at the bedazzled boy looming over you. Each time you glace up at him and meet his eye, he seems to twitch with glee; though he doesn\u2019t speak a word or otherwise make a sound. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou slowly begin to find the silence awkward, so you decide to strike up a conversation. Of course, you need a pad of paper to help with this, so you sign up to Tails that you\u2019d like a writing implement and something to write on. Much to your surprise, the boy genius looks miffed when he gives his reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAw man, how could I be so careless? Of course you need something to write on in order to talk to me. Just wait right here, I\u2019ll be right back.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy flies away and around the bend. In the distance, you hear distinct rustling sounds that start and stop at seemingly random intervals. In time, the sounds grow louder and louder; until eventually you hear a loud crash and a feeble interjection of pain from your young host. All\u2019s quiet for a moment, and then you see Tails hover around the bend again, one hand gripping a pencil and sheet of paper, the other one rubbing the back of his head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe gently places the items in front of you, and you decide to immediately go to work on crafting a message. You had a lot to say to the boy\u2026in truth, while you liked every member of the Sonic cast, there was always a special place in your heart reserved for the orange fox. You fondly remember the hours you would spend playing as him in Sonic the Hedgehog 2, and how, in a way, the boy was just like a kid version of yourself. You watched the boy grow as a character in every game; going from an obedient sidekick playing second fiddle to the titular character, to growing into the very hero he had idolized. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd HE was interested in YOU. A chuckle leaves your lips at the irony of the situation as you scribble your first question into the ground beneath you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you finish, Tails looks over your message excitedly, reading it back aloud. \u201c \u2018What were you going to use those measurements for?\u2019 OH, yeah those\u2026well, ya see I kind of promised Silver that I\u2019d make you some kind of protective suit, in order to keep you safe whenever he wasn\u2019t around.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tsk in disgust. Of COURSE he would commission Tails for that\u2026his overprotection truly knew no bounds, didn\u2019t it? But before you could get too mad at that, you notice a change in your host\u2019s expression. He looks down at his fidgeting hands, while his perky triangular ears lower slightly and his whipping tails slow considerably. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut\u2026I didn\u2019t really tell him that I\u2026well, I don\u2019t really have the materials and tools I\u2019d need in order to make it. I was hoping he\u2019d\u2026bring you around one day, and then I\u2019d have an excuse to\u2026hang out with you and stuff.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe suddenly clasps his hands together in a praying motion, closing his eyes when he speaks again. \u201cPlease don\u2019t tell Silver\u2026he\u2019s been nice enough to give me descriptions of future technology. I wouldn\u2019t be able to develop that stuff without his help and\u2026well he\u2019s just a cool guy and stuff and I don\u2019t want him mad at me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou quickly write a reassurance to him when he opens his eyes, consoling him that you\u2019ll keep his secret. He looks immensely relieved at first\u2026then he brightens up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I may not be able to give Silver what he wants\u2026but from what I\u2019m told, I think I might have something that YOU\u2019D be interested in.\u201d He winks at you, though you\u2019re unsure as to why. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe suddenly stands and places his hands on his hips as he says, \u201cI\u2019ve been itching to learn more about you. Whaddya say about being a test subject in a few experiments? And don\u2019t worry; it\u2019s nothing dangerous or anything. In fact\u2026I bet you\u2019ll like it.\u201d He giggles in that adorable fashion again, but this time you sense the slightest hint of deviousness in his voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust what do these experiments entail, exactly?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The boy genius wasn\u2019t making much sense. First off, what did he mean by an \u201cexperiment?\u201d From what you recalled, Tails was just joking around with Silver when he previously mentioned the occurrence of any kind of tests. Was he just lying to Silver, in order to get the hedgehog off his back? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile that would certainly make a lot of sense, it didn\u2019t explain why he thought you\u2019d take any particular enjoyment in whatever it was he had planned. Besides that, didn\u2019t he just meet you a few minutes ago? What would he know about what you did and didn\u2019t like?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout further debate, Tails reaches down and picks you up; thankfully, in his excitement, he didn\u2019t carelessly wrap his stout fingers around your body hard enough to squeeze the life out of you. Instead, he\u2019s just as gentle as he was before; after initially picking you up in his entire fist, he gingerly positions his other hand underneath you and deposits you on it. Now that you're safely standing on the platform of his palm, he takes off and flies around the bend. Even though his rotating tails were so high above you, the force of the wind raining down on you as he flew made it feel like you were stuck in the middle of a hurricane.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe whipping winds finally died down, punctuated by a deafening crash made by Tails\u2019s shoes hitting the floor. Without the typhoon raging about you, you could finally open your eyes enough to see where you were. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe room had 3 large windows on each wall, giving you a near unbroken panoramic view of the sunlit, rolling fields outside. In fact, the windows were so massive that it felt like there weren\u2019t even any walls in the room at all. Even the ceiling had an impressive sunroof, through which brilliant golden sunshine lit the room, far brighter than any single artificial light could. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bedframe appeared to be sturdily made out of some thick logs of an unknown type of wood; though the mattress, pillows and sheets that covered them appeared downy soft. There was a thick comforter on the bed as well, quilted with large brown squares that alternated shades from one to the next. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMuch to your surprise, other than the bed, the room didn\u2019t appear to be furnished with anything else. There was no dresser to speak of, nor a television set or a closet. The only things you could see were two small nightstands flanking either side of the bed. On one nightstand, you noticed a picture; this one you could see clearly enough to recognize the smiling faces of Sonic and Tails, both boys slinging their arms around each other\u2019s backs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy genius must have noticed your astonishment, because as he put you down on the bed, he said.  \u201cOh, yeah this is Sonic\u2019s room, for when he stays the night and stuff. The bed\u2019s big enough to fit both of us in here, so it\u2019s the perfect spot for me and you to conduct the tests.\u201d He then looks down at you and raises his eyebrows \u201cOkay, don\u2019t go anywhere. I\u2019ll be right back.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, the twin-tailed fox bounds out of the room; palpably giddy with some kind of mysterious excitement. You take another look around, and are taken aback by the sheer magnitude of the bed. You\u2019d thought Silver\u2019s bed was utterly massive, but when compared to this, it seemed rather puny. If you had to make the comparison, where Silver\u2019s may have been a full sized bed, this one was a king. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nInitially, you scoff at the greediness of the blue blur. Did he honestly need all this room to sleep? It all seemed rather excessive, even for him; though, when you think about it, you suppose he\u2019d need the room if his massive ego were ever going to fit along with him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then another thought crossed your mind, as you looked upon the small picture on the nightstand again. Didn\u2019t Tails use the phrase \u201cus\u201d when referring to who slept in this bed?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you could follow up on that line thought, you heard excitedly booming footfalls coming from behind you. You manage to turn just in time to see Tails enter the room again, his hands filled with all kinds of objects. He makes his way over to the bed, and throws down on it an enormous brown leather suitcase. On top of it balanced a familiar looking yellow tablet computer, which the boy immediate swiped up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis fingers dance across the surface of the screen, and when he\u2019s finally satisfied with whatever is displayed on it, he reaches into the tufts of his gloves and produces a collection of very small black dots. He shuffles over to you with them and says, \u201cOkay, before we get to the good stuff, I gotta put these on you. They\u2019ll allow me to get all kinds of readouts while the test is going on. Just hold still for me, okay little guy?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou oblige, curious as to what exactly the young fox had in mind. You look on in great interest as Tails picks up the dots one at a time, gives the flat side of them a slobbery lick with his cute little tongue, and presses them into any bit of exposed skin he could find. After a few minutes, everything from your forehead to your feet was covered in small, black bumps. When you look down at your arms, you couldn\u2019t help but think of ancient illustrations chronicling the effects of the medieval plague.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Tails was done admiring his handiwork, he takes the yellow tablet back into his hands and swipes its surface a few more times. His jubilant astonishment is hard to hide when he says, \u201cWoah\u2026your vital signs aren\u2019t much different from normal sized people.\u201d He looks up at you suddenly and flashes an embarrassed smile. \u201cOh, uh sorry, no offense.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou brush it off, clearly understanding the boy\u2019s intent. In truth, it was a fascinating discovery for you as well; though you also couldn\u2019t say that you thought about it all that much, either. Still, it was promise that maybe you\u2019d learn something from all this too, whatever THIS was.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTails then turns a knob on pad, and a recognizable series of beeps gradually increases in volume. This must have been a heart monitor of some kind, a thought that was confirmed when Tails placed the pad down and you saw the endlessly scrolling jagged lines taking up a majority of the screen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce he places the pad down, he opens the suitcase next to him; from the angle at which you were standing, you couldn\u2019t tell what was inside, but whatever it was, it didn\u2019t make a sound as it was ruffled about by the boy genius. The minute or two of searching yields no clues as to the suitcase\u2019s contents, and you can\u2019t see what it is he produced when the search ends. All you COULD see was the fox boy bend down and disappear beyond the horizon of the bed for the span of a few minutes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe whole time you heard a new series of rustling. Then, you heard a pop, and then another, followed again by more rustling. You take a few steps forward and try to crane your neck to see over the edge of the bed, but all you could see are the tips of the boy\u2019s furry ears. Just when you're about to take a few more steps forward, his head pops back up again, giving you a terrific fright; which, in turn, causes the heart monitor to squeal in alarm for a few terrifying seconds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe smiles at you and reaches for the pad. The steadily slowing beeps don\u2019t cease as he minimizes the screen and opens up a brand new one. This new one is marked by a single, large microphone icon, which he taps with his finger. He doesn\u2019t speak until a bright red circle surrounds the icon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExperiment number two five two zero one six: Codename Little Man will now commence. Subject\u2019s vitals appear nominal up to this point\u2026I will now begin with the control group.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy flashes you a brief smile as he stands up and takes the pad in both hands again. He whips his tails up behind him and floats high into the air. Once they finally pass the rim of the bed, you realize that the boy isn\u2019t wearing his iconic red and white sneakers anymore; you see instead a rather thick pair of pristinely white socks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe floats over you, and his gigantic socked feet get ever closer. You can feel your heart rate increasing; each pulse punctuated by a shrill beep from Tails\u2019s pad. When the boy finally plops down on the bed with a mighty quake, the towering beauties come to rest only a few steps away from you. They\u2019re so close, you can feel the warmth radiate from them, causing a shiver to travel down your spine which is then announced by the beeping pad. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou\u2019re frozen in place, unsure of what to do next. You look up at Tails for guidance; he has the back of the pad firmly trained on you, as if he was recording everything you did.  He peeks over the edge of the pad and explains with a childish grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYa see little guy\u2026Sonic told me all about how you had fun with his feet and stuff the last time you saw him. It got me really interested in what exactly makes feet attractive to somebody like you, so I designed this experiment in order to find out. Hopefully by the end of today, I\u2019ll have enough data collected to be able to piece together an answer\u2026in the meantime though, just do whatever you feel like to my feet. I want it to be completely natural, so make believe like I\u2019m not here\u2026well, I guess that would mean my feet weren\u2019t here either\u2026eh, you know what I mean.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis had to be a dream\u2026Tails was really okay with you doing whatever you wanted to his feet? Was he even old enough to understand what a fetish entailed\u2026granted, he was a genius but he was still just a kid, right? You\u2019re eyes unconsciously drift to the picture on the nightstand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, maybe he had a bit more experience than you give him credit for. Either way, the boy was curious, and seeing as he was nice enough to loan his feet out to you, it\u2019d be rude not to take him up on the offer, right? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe question is, where do you start?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The immaculate white towers rising up high into the air before you were so absolutely beautiful that it took all your willpower not to throw yourself down at them. Tails was giving you the once in a lifetime opportunity to do ANYTHING you wanted to his feet, and though your lust for the young boy\u2019s soles was incredibly strong, you knew that savoring every single second would wind up being far more pleasurable. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you finally shuffle across the last few inches of puffy comforter and make it to the base of Tails\u2019s heel, you decide to look up and admire the splendor of the masterpiece before you. The sock covering the boy\u2019s foot was a thick number; very few features of the sole underneath showed through the fabric. However even just by the general shape of them, you could tell that they were simply gorgeous. The socks themselves rode up Tails\u2019s leg, terminating at his ankle in a thick, scrunched up puff that extended well past the width of his foot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe inner footwear looked similar in type to the kind worn by Silver; if you had to hazard a guess, you would think that these were Tails\u2019s everyday socks, worn under the cover of his classic red and white sneakers. However, it struck you as odd that they were so impeccably clean. Based on what you could remember with Silver (in a bygone age that seemed like a lifetime ago), a giant\u2019s socks still accumulated SOME dirt as their owner traipsed around the house in them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure, Tails could fly...but so could Silver, and HIS socks looked absolutely rancid compared to these snow-white cotton coverings. Either Tails NEVER removed his sneakers, or these socks were brand new and just recently placed on his feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking up at the impressive splendor must have caused your heart rate to increase, because after the initial stupefaction wore off, you became aware of the shrill, rapid beeping of the heart monitor a short distance away. You blink away the remnants of the daze in time to see Tails peek over the edge of the pad and cast a reassuring smile down at you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat compassionate look being sent to you from behind a pair of sublime feet sent your heart aflutter; making the pad chime in a gleeful tone which matched the sentiment that it announced. Lord above, it really HAD been way too long since you received this kind of recognition from someone, and you didn\u2019t know how desperately you missed it until right at this moment. The feeling is so nice and warm that you want to hold onto it for as long as you possibly can, like a child grasping at their favorite stuffed animal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou suck in a large breath through your nose. The air is warm around you, no doubt due to your proximity to Tails\u2019s soles, but you\u2019re shocked by the fact that there wasn\u2019t much of a putrid smell wafting around. Instead, everything smelled rather pleasant, like fresh laundry detergent that was weakened due to the passage of time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYears upon years of foot fetishism have trained you to associate that particular smell, when mixed with the warmness of someone\u2019s feet, with instantaneous arousal. The breath you release comes out in shivers as pleasurable tingles course throughout your body at the delightful scent. The smell is just enough to give you the energy (and bravery) needed to reach out with both hands and stroke the pristine surface that practically begged to be touched. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe palms of your hands gently caress the thick fabric, giving you the sensation of slowly brushing your hands across a thick, luxurious pillow. If you closed your eyes, you probably wouldn\u2019t have been able to tell the difference between this and the inanimate object, save for the pleasant sultriness of the foot in front of you. You wrap your fingers around a fistful of sock and squeeze gently. You feel nothing but puffy cotton in your grip, so you squeeze tighter, all in an attempt to gauge the thickness of the socks. Apparently, they were almost impenetrably thick; no matter how hard you tightened your grasp, you could feel nothing of the skin or musculature that lay underneath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, the socks themselves were nothing to scoff at. You bring your face in close and take another deep whiff. The smell is so powerful that it seems to invade your mouth, causing your eyes to flutter like the wings of a butterfly. You can\u2019t get enough of that smell, which seems to straddle the line between both clean AND dirty. The powerful overtones and subtle low notes you detect cause you to lean in and press your entire face deep into the surface of the boy\u2019s powerful sole. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe deep breaths you take fill your lungs with the divine aroma of Tails\u2019s feet. You want to coat your entire body with the stuff and smell like it forever, so you move closer and begin rubbing your body all over the sole of the young giant.  Your arms trace wide circles above your head, while your neck gently shakes back and forth in order to further rub your face into the smooth cotton; your lower torso, meanwhile, slowly gyrates against the pillowy surface. The feeling of your semi-hard dick swirling around inside your pants against the soft yet resilient wall in front of you made your balls and prostate tense in excitement. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEach breath teased you with a delectable taste, but you don\u2019t go so far as to put your lips onto the surface of the sock. Mixing in the smell of your own breath and saliva would only sully the absolutely perfect bouquet with far inferior smells. Something this magnificent deserved to be enjoyed on its own, and as thoroughly as possible. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo deep is your immersion in the scent that you begin to lose all sense of time. The only thing keeping you remotely tethered to any notion of reality is the erratic squealing of the heart monitor, as it tried its best to report every pulse of your impassioned heartbeat. You did hear Tails speak, but his words blurred together and lost all meaning as you focused your attention on the godly expanse in front of you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, in a far shorter time than you would have wanted, the glistening socked soles slowly pull away from you. In your dazed state of abject pleasure, you step forward a bit to follow them, but you stop when Tails shifts himself around and folds his legs underneath him. Your panting breath cools your throat and lungs, and the influx of oxygen gradually allows you to come back to your senses, at least somewhat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only thing you\u2019re truly conscious of is Tails swinging his legs over the edge of the bed and fiddling with something down by his feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe swipes and taps the pad placed next to him a few times and says \u201cControl test yielded surprising results\u2026already the subject has exceeded expectations. Data shows immense levels of pleasure and sexual arousal on part of the test subject, which may well have begun to influence the test taker as well.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, he glances back in your direction and gives you a slight wink. In time, he finishes with whatever he was doing under the bed and swings his feet back up in front of you. He says, \u201cThe testing will now continue with variation one.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pair of socks displayed before you looked identical to the ones he had just had on, save for one very crucial detail. While the other socks were blindingly white and clean as untouched mounds of snow, the ones before you now were nowhere near as pristine. Large swaths of the soles were discolored; huge footprint-shaped areas that stretched across the surface of each sock were completely brown. You could see that the individual fibers of these areas were matted together, and pressed flatter than the other areas of the socks. You have no doubt the cotton was pressed flat by the giant boy\u2019s weight coming down on them an untold number of times. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight away, the air begins to take on a far different aroma. No longer is the scent you smell balanced thinly between filthy and fresh; it\u2019s undeniable that these socks reeked of something terrifically pungent. Your already rock hard member tightened immensely the moment the smell went up your nose. Your mind was fogged yet again, and your body went into autopilot in a desperate attempt to alleviate the pressure in your pants and bring on the ultimate bliss. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou close the distance to Tails\u2019s feet and waste absolutely no time rubbing all up against them. The deep whiffs you take betray the slightest whisper of the clean smell you reveled in before, but it\u2019s undeniable that the overwhelming scent was a cheesy cocktail of young boy sweat and skin. The dirty brown spot in front of you, which was caked with pressed-in dust and debris, was imploring you to partake in a taste. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut just a taste wouldn\u2019t satisfy you now. Your tongue hangs out as you push your entire head into the filthy pillow of the sock; letting everything the boy had stepped in drag across the surface of your tongue and freely enter your mouth. Then you suck, gnaw, lick and massage the little patch with your mouth, desiring to take in the forgotten remnants stuck to the bottom of the young god's beautiful, worship-worthy feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis taste was the best thing you've experienced in eons. It was both salty and sweet at the same time, and not bitter in the slightest. The other boys may have tasted like the shaper of cheeses, but Tails brought to mind the mild, pleasant taste of yellow cheddar. You feel your lower body tense up with each slobbery lick. Then, the bombardment of sensations turns you into a weak, wobbling mess, so much so that you unconsciously blow your load onto the interior of your pants. The warm cum squirts out of your dick in violent streams, coating your entire private area with ounces upon ounces of delectable boy juice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough you figure that not even THAT could beat the taste of what you were sampling at the moment. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The fact that you had already came only momentarily slowed down your impassioned onslaught on the godly boy\u2019s soles. The hot concoction of boy juices is smeared and pressed deeply into the flesh of your pelvis and the underwear covering them, matting itself in the wisps of your pubic hair and gluing clumps of them together in messy, gooey knots.  Your body\u2019s natural response to this was to simply ride the wave of pleasure and thrust your hips in tandem to the pulses of your prostate\u2026even though those pulses were now long over and your dick was slowly losing rigidity.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe warmness on your pelvis was so comforting that you wanted to spread it over as much of you as possible, so you kept thrusting and gyrating to work it even deeper into the skin of your hips and upper legs. All the while, you continue to make out with the dingy cloth that was pressed up against your face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the time of your climax, the spot was already thickly drenched with copious amounts of your saliva; so much, in fact, that the brown filth that coated the sock was transformed into a swirled, muddy mark that looked like a mixture of watercolor paints covering a canvass. The spot still reeked of boy sweat, though now it also took on the intense notes of your spit as well. Peeling yourself away from the wall and casting your gaze on the dark, sloppy spot formed by your mouth only makes your lust for Tails\u2019s delectable soles grow even stronger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout thinking, you plunge your face deep into the sopping, soiled blotch. The pressure of your face causes the spot to audibly squish, and the now compressed fibers release their blend of flavors and smells directly onto the surface of your skin. You rub your nose and mouth deep into the area, intensely inhaling the blend of footy cheddar, musky sweat and pungent saliva. But the smell isn\u2019t the only thing that gets up your nose; the loose liquids spewing out of the cotton fibers also get sucked by your ravenous sniffing, coating your nasal cavity as thoroughly as the rest of your face. The smell made you lose yourself, and you feel all inhibitions slipping away with each new whiff. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was almost like you weren\u2019t in control of your body anymore; Tails\u2019s powerful foot had latched onto your very soul with its unyielding musk and was guiding you movements like a marionette. Each twitch and shuffle of the boy\u2019s sole sent shivers down your spine and caused spasms to rock all your extremities. With your face ear-deep in the drenched, spongy surface of the fetid sock, the connection you felt with the godly appendage was absolute: an undeniable fact of life no more disputable than the law of gravity. For a fraction of a time, your body didn\u2019t belong to you; it belonged to the giant boy that sat before you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wanted nothing else in the world but to rub your face into Tails\u2019s sole forever, but the young fox instead had other ideas. He slowly dragged his foot away from you, causing your weakened knees to shiver before giving out completely and making you fall face-first onto the surface the plush comforter. The impact was insignificant, but it was just enough to wake you from your daze; in a fit of rapid blinking and panting breaths you regain your hold on reality enough to push yourself up into a sitting position on your calves. <br>\r\nYou have to blink a few more times in order for your eyes to adjust to the brightness that suddenly flared before you. When your vision returns, you reel backwards in surprise, as you notice Tails\u2019s face mere inches from your tiny form. His gorgeous blue eyes sparkle in wonderment and delight as they carefully take you in from head to toe. His mouth is agape in boyish surprise, and his ears are perked up and appear even stiffer than usual. Behind them, his twin tails wave back and forth at an incredibly high tempo, giving him the bestial appearance of a happy dog instead of a curious boy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe moment you lock eyes with him, he flashes an adorably genuine smile. The giggle that followed shook your battered body to the core; not only due to the volume, but also because of the pangs of satisfaction they wrought within you. He leans on one arm and courteously extends the other to you, offering his finger as support to help you to your feet. As you reach out and touch his man-sized gloved digit, you can\u2019t help but equate it\u2019s soft feel to that of the socks that you had enjoyed just moments before. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thought causes an involuntary lightening bolt of lust to shoot down your spine and scatter into shivers along your extremities. This causes your legs to turn into wobbling jelly; and so when Tails finally removed his finger, you became powerless to support your own weight and you fell to the bed sheets once again. Thankfully, you had enough control to land yourself in a sitting position, which gave you the perfect view of Tails\u2019s face as he jovially chuckled at your pathetic state. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnder any other circumstances, you would be terribly embarrassed, but you could tell that the boy meant no ill will by his laughter. Instead of trying to get you back to your feet, Tails surrenders the idea and leans back to sit with his feet crossed beneath him. He reaches next to him and picks up the pad he had deposited there, swiping at the screen for a moment before speaking into it once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cVariation one was a far greater success than initially hypothesized. Subject seemed to be in an almost enthralled state during the duration of the test\u2026please consult video record for further analysis.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter finishing his sentence, he glances over at you, meeting your eyes with the faintest gleam of deviousness. He even smirks a little as he goes on to say, \u201cSubject climaxed approximately five minutes into the test\u2026far quicker than predicted. Orgasm was achieved without the subject first removing his pants, leading me to believe that the reaction was involuntary. More analysis is required to confirm this finding.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe swipes at the pad once more and lowers if from his face. In an almost soothing, compassionate voice he says, \u201cYou want to call it quits for now little guy? I know that probably took a lot out of ya.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thought of getting a hold of the boy genius\u2019s feet one more time is enough in itself to jolt you back to life. Though an echo of fatigue still lingers in your body, you still generate more than enough energy to stand back up and wave him on for one more round. The young fox looks just about as excited as you are as he whips his legs over the side of his bed and fiddles with his feet once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe excitement of what was coming fills you to the brim and makes your heart race. You decide to close your eyes in order to uphold the surprise until the very last moment; so for a brief instant, the only sensory input you receive is the rapid-but-stable blips from the heart monitor and the disjointed shuffling of Tails\u2019s fidgeting. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe anticipation alone turns your member into a meaty sausage, causing it to painfully struggle against the hairs and patches of loose skin that stuck to it with dried cum. You use your hand and wiggle your dick to free it from its bondage; the instant you do, you feel the true extent of the mess you\u2019d made, as bits of jizz flake off and crumple through your fingers at your touch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou\u2019re then interrupted by the terrific crashing of Tails\u2019s feet when he finally deposits them on the bed in front of you. You look up and swoon by the sight you see: the socks he had on now were jet black in color, and far shorter than the pairs he had on before. They terminated at the boy\u2019s ankle with an elastic lip that swept down and around his ankle bones, before coming back up behind the back of the heel. The material of the socks looked far thinner than either of the previous specimens. These ones very clearly showed every gentle bend and smooth curve in Tails\u2019s foot structure, all the way up until they terminated in a tightly wrapped toe area. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sole of the sock looked crushed flat, just like the previous one\u2026though this one seemed far cleaner by comparison. True, there did look to be a thin layer of lighter dust and debris that polluted a foot-shaped section of the surface, but you could plainly tell that these socks hadn\u2019t had the pleasure of compressing under the fox\u2019s weight in quite some time. They did seem to give off a slight hint of the boyish musk you were so fond of, however, which was WAY more than enough to elicit a cheerful response from your tiny head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou step forward, and just as you\u2019re about to reach out and touch the surface of the sock, you catch movement in the corner of your eye. Tails scoots across the bed so that he is sitting closer to you; then once he\u2019s in position, he angles his feet downwards and puts them on either side of your miniscule form. He sits in a butterfly style, with both feet laying horizontally and flanking you on either side. By the time he\u2019s done, you\u2019re completely surrounded on all sides by some part of the titanic fox boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the delectable toe section slowly descending down to your level hypnotizes you like a silver pocket watch. At that moment, nothing else in the world existed but patch of dirty, smelly cotton and the plump treasures that hid underneath. The sirens song it sings captivates you anew, calling you out to revel in the pleasure it can provide. Of course, you can't possibly resist it's allure. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does it call out for you to do?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You keep your eyes fixed on Tails\u2019s foot as it slowly lowers toward the bed sheets. The imprints of the boy\u2019s toes etched out in filth on the bottom of the sock hold your gaze like a vice grip. It all looks so warm, so inviting; when his feet are finally horizontal, you find your legs taking you closer of their own accord. The rest of his foot was hot, sure: incredibly so. This, however, was on a whole other level.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPushing forward, you wade through the few inches of puffed out cotton until you reached the firm, plump toes. Even with your arms outstretched in front of you, the cute, smelly treasures are so insulated that you must fully wrap yourself in the dingy sock fabric before you reach them. Here, in the arches of his toes, you were completely surrounded by the boy genius\u2019s infinitely powerful soles. In fact, their oppressive smell clued you in nicely to their terrific strength.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou bask in smell for a moment, letting your member slowly gain rigidity. You are starting to feel the warmth of his soles now; to your surprise, it makes you feel even smaller than you are. Even as you close your eyes, and feel nothing but the blanket of foul-smelling cloth wrapped around your body, you feel like you could still sense the might of the giant that stretched up before you. He was just a little kid: under normal circumstances he\u2019d only come up to waist height, but now he towered over your form. The little boy wasn\u2019t so little any more, and he had all the power that came with it. Being a servant to such a power\u2026felt more important now than anything else in the world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, you steel yourself with a single resolve. You decide that, no matter what, you would make Tails feel better than he ever had felt in his life. Though it\u2019s unclear as to what the boy\u2019s previous experience may be, none of that matters in the end. You were the only one that could do this, the only one weak and servile enough to bring this boy the pleasure befitting a titan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes open, twinkling with conviction. Your hands are out in front of you, lightly brushing up against the wall of black and the solid flesh that supported it. Since this area didn\u2019t experience as much of the boy\u2019s weight, it was far softer than the crushed fabric on either side of you. You stroke your hands up, down and all around the area, getting a feel for the locations of Tails\u2019s massive toes. Of course, doing this also gives you a sense of their scale as well; though far shorter and stubbier than either Sonic\u2019s or Silver\u2019s, the toes of the fox boy are by no means puny when compared to your stature. Though the pinkie toe was decently shorter than you, the big guy that stuck out at head height was at least as long as you were tall. The lean, smooth muscle structure of each one was apparent, even under the thickness of the sock. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stand up straight and apply pressure to the big toe. Almost immediately, you feel a sharp twitch in response, which gives you a moment\u2019s pause. His toes must be really sensitive\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour spine shivers with pleasure and your dick stirs. Your balls clench in rhythm with your heartbeat, but you pray they don\u2019t squeeze too hard. As much as you\u2019d LOVE to cum at the moment, you don\u2019t want to deny Tails of any of the pleasure you could provide him before that. And so you get to work properly, firmly squeezing and rubbing the skin of the boy\u2019s toe with a determined passion. Your fingers deftly work the flesh, like a pianist tickling the keys of his piano. Like the artisan, not a movement is wasted; every slight push of a finger sends a lightning bolt of joy right into the taught muscles of the toe. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvery twitch and shuffle of the massive digit fills you with empathetic glee. The joy that this boy feels, you feel magnified a hundred times over. Though the oak-like rigidity of your dick would say otherwise, you feel immensely calm and collected as you massage the toe in front of you. The warmth of your surroundings lulls you into a Zen-like trance, and the smell working its way deeply into your nose humbles you with it\u2019s domineering might.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe smell, in fact, is so powerful here that it begins to make your eyes water. The odor enters your sinuses, causing them to well up. When the warm tears finally do start to flow, you chuckle a bit, in spite of yourself. How powerful IS this boy, that the mere smell of his godly toes could turn you into a crying, horny mess? What would he think of your pitiful state? Either way, it helped put things in perspective for you\u2026you were the servant, and he was the all-powerful master. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhether he actually KNEW his role or not was completely irrelevant. All that mattered was that you were pleasing him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, you feel a movement in the foot as a whole. Tails was fidgeting under your touch; no longer was his body content with simply wiggling his toes to react to the pleasure. The waves must have finally propagated up and began to affect his entire young body, and with that in mind, you break off from the toe and move outside the pillowy prison. As you move, however, you don\u2019t let your hands break off from the fleshy sole; instead you inch sideways, slowly working your way towards the pad of the fox\u2019s toe. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sock here is pressed flat, and much like the other worn areas, it is caked in a noticeable layer of filth. The grit covers your hands almost instantly, turning them pale with forgotten bits of dust Tails had inadvertently picked up. Now outside your sanctuary, you look down the length of his leg and up his body towards his face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo your surprise, the tablet isn\u2019t covering it up. Instead, Tails\u2019s face is scrunched up in what seems like pain at first; however, the implication is dispelled when a feeble little moan leaves his lips. The soft, stuttering cry imbues you with confidence; what you were doing was clearly working. The adorably innocent look fills you with pleasure\u2026and your dick with blood. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTails\u2019s eyes are firmly shut, though you don\u2019t really care if he\u2019s watching you or not at this point. No matter what, you HAVE to get naked now, and after a swift series of pulls and tugs, you are. You let your rigid penis trace circles on the pad of the boy\u2019s middle toe; the softness of the fabric and warm ductility of the skin underneath feels incredible on your little head. You then give it more pressure, sinking your dick deeper into the flesh and twirling it around until it was covered in filth. For you, it\u2019s just another appendage with which to work your magic: a tool that allowed you to work two toes at the same time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou match the pressure with your hands, and continue to artfully work the skin of the giant. The moans from the boy grow louder as both dick and palm work him over like putty. But even though you controlled the pace and movement of your appendages, Tails firmly controlled your level of pleasure with his own. The more worked up he got, the more you got worked up in turn, and at the moment, the boy appeared to be in heaven thanks to your work. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you feel the boy reach the apex of his enjoyment, you move in to raise the bar higher with your mouth. Though you wanted to slowly build up to it, you go straight for the impassioned, sucking kiss immediately in spite of yourself. Your mouth thickly slathers on the saliva as your tongue caresses deeply into the giant\u2019s tissue. Though it\u2019s not really your intention, you still suck in as much of the cheesy taste as you possibly can. Thankfully, judging by the yelp given forth by your master and host, he appears to like it just as much as you do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe smells and tastes grip into you again, making you lose all control of yourself. You stop rubbing, and put your hands as far around the toe as you can, just so you could pull it closer like the embrace you give an estranged lover. You let your eyes close as you get more and more into the kiss; it takes you to another world, one filled with nothing but pleasure. Your hips stroke back and forth, causing your dick to ride up and become sandwiched between the toe pad and your pelvis. The soft resilience of the warm sock on your scrotum makes your entire crotch twitch, which is transferred into the toe and answered with a short, breathy hum.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou want to hear that again. You reel your hips back and slam your tight sack into the toe again. This time, you hear a moan clearly through clenched teeth. And so you keep pounding, picking up the pace slowly, but deliberately. Your whole shaft buzzes with energy as it rubs up against the slightly abrasive surface. Your little head becomes hot, and turns a shade of purple with the strain. Precum seeps deep into the sock, which soaks the juices up happily like a sponge. The warmth hitting your balls and the moans from the giant boy become far too much for you to handle, and with one final buck of your hips, it\u2019s all over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe final slam is like the firing pin of a gun, sending shockwaves through your tool that propels steaming, sticky cum at unimaginable velocity. The first squirts reach all the way up to the base of your neck, and as these drips slowly course down your chest, your pelvis drowns in torrent of the ejaculate fluids. Your mouth, still firmly clamped onto the pad of Tails\u2019s big toe, breaks off for only an instant to issue a pained cry of elation into the thick black fabric. Your fingers dig deeply into the toe flesh of the boy, causing him to issue a cry of his own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen it\u2019s all over, you sink to your knees. Much of the cum drips down onto the bed and piles around your tired member, but the small amount that does stick to the dirty fabric begs you to clean it off. With eyes still fluttering from the after effects of your orgasm, you lean in and gently lap up the loose juices with the tip of your tongue. The quickly congealing cum feels good in your weary mouth, so you don\u2019t bother swallowing it just yet; at least, not until you turn to Tails to see his reaction first. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Much to your delight, Tails sits in a state of complete dishevelment. He\u2019s lying spiraled out across the length of the bed, propped up on his elbows. As you watch, he takes slow, deep breaths that cause his chest fur to slightly bob in rhythm. His eyes are shut, and his nose happily twitches every time he takes in air. His ears are slightly pitched forward, and behind them, you see his tails softly dance a silent waltz. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look on for a few moments, until his eyes become suddenly alert. His head darts downward, and upon seeing you looking back at him, he sits up in a flash. At first, you would have figured he\u2019d be embarrassed for seeing you in such a messy state. However, curiosity and a youthful intrigue appear to take hold in the boy; he positions himself as quickly as possible so that he\u2019s lying on his belly in front of you, with his hands propping up his chin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTails\u2019s excitement was clear, even if his face wasn\u2019t millimeters from you. His tails whip back and forth through the air like flags in a breeze, causing gusts of their own that reach you on the bed. You could feel his breath come out in excited bursts from his small, black nose; the wind picked up even further when he let out an inquisitive \u201coohh\u201d out of his mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour cheeks grow hot from all the attention, and so you go to wipe off the excess fluids from your face. Before you do, however, a man-sized white digit reaches out and stops your arm. You look from it, to Tails\u2019s enormous face, and then back again. His eyes sparkled with interest, barely breaking their gaze from your own. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou squint, trying to discern his intent. Just when you figure he simply wants to take in this picture as much as possible, he leans in closer. With the very tip of his pink tongue, he draws a single, slobbery line completely up your body, beginning at your waist and ending at the crown of your head. The heavily textured muscle scraped all the excess fluids off your skin as it made its way up, leaving you sopping wet but totally clean. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe action came as such a surprise that you almost swallowed your mouthful of jizz, but the fox boy stopped you just in time. With the very tip of his finger on your chin, he gently pulled downwards, inviting you to open your mouth. The semen/saliva mixture was just runny enough to nearly slide off your tongue as he opened it, but thankfully you were able to keep it all from passing your lips. But once your mouth was fully open, you notice Tails continue to push your chin down. Your whole head tips downwards, causing the copious amounts of cum to slide right out of your mouth\u2026and onto his awaiting tongue. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy retreated back from you a ways. Before he pulled it back in his mouth, the giant\u2019s cheeks rose in a smile as he playfully wagged his head in your direction, as if he were giving you an insult with his tongue sticking out. On the tip, you could see the small pile of gunk: bits of putrid dirt and grime from his feet, mixed with a cocktail of both of your sweat. On top of that, of course, was a thick pile of your cum, mixed heavily with spit as well as other contaminants from his feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe little pink muscle retreated into his mouth in a flash of movement. Before you knew it, he was sloshing the mixture around in his mouth, quizzically humming to himself as if he were deciphering a code. He smacks his lips loudly, and after squinting his eyes for a moment he pulls away from you completely. On the other end of the bed, he retrieves his pad and plays with its controls. He looks distracted from your presence now, at least until he begins typing something in on the pad\u2019s surface.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe narrates what he types. \u201cUpon further analysis, mixture appears to be comprised of twenty five percent subject sweat, fifteen percent test taker sweat, twenty five percent miscellaneous materials\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis sidelong glance pierces you like a spear as he says, \u201c\u2026and thirty five percent subject seminal fluids.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he finishes, he places the pad back down on the bed. Oddly enough, there seems to be total silence coming from it now: the heart monitor, which had droned on for so long so as to blend into the background, was noticeably silent now. The eerie quiet didn\u2019t last, however; Tails made no effort to muffle the sound of his movements as he moved closer to the briefcase. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn\u2019t make out what he had grabbed as he crawled back over to you. The only presumption you could make was that it was another pair of socks, though their style still eluded you. He kept the footwear behind his back at all times, never letting you see them even as he sat down and spread his feet out in front of you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then went on with his usual introduction to the next phase of the test. Though, as you look at him, you notice that his pad wasn\u2019t even anywhere near him this time around. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe said, \u201cNow it\u2019s time for the next variation. This time, the test taker will determine if any arousal can be attained by the removal and replacement of socks.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fox boy grins down at you, right before saying, \u201cyou ready little guy?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith eyes wide in anticipation, you slowly nod your head yes. The moment you do, he bends down and catches the lip of the sock in his fingers. The black cotton-wrapped elastic is slowly separated from the fur of his heel. When he retreats both fingers, it snaps against his heel pad, loudly enough for you to hear it even at a distance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, with the tip of his finger, he slowly let the lip of the sock ride up his sole towards his toes. The boy wasn\u2019t even looking at you as he did it; he showed an almost delicate degree of care as he focused all his attention on removing his sock. It was as if he was trying not to hurt himself, slowly bringing the elastic part of the fabric up his arch and around the smooth bend of his ball. When he finally reached his toes, he carefully wrapped his finger under the lip and jerked up quickly, revealing the digits in all their glory. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour assessment about his foot appeared to be dead on. Though it was similar in the fact that it was completely covered in short fur, Tails\u2019s foot was a wild departure from those you were used to before. His youth showed, as his foot was shorter and stumpier than either of the older hedgehogs. The sole was a tad wider, rounding out features that would be taut musculature on the other boys. However, his foot looked no less creamily soft; all the way up, each and every curve looked positively smooth. His toes, while shorter, looked surprisingly lean for the proportions of his foot; telling you that once his body matured more, his feet would turn into particularly svelte and toned examples of boyish soles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTails took far less time removing his other sock. Again, he unhinged the lip of the sock from its place on his heel: but rather than removing it by hand, he instead lied back and flattened his foot against the bed. Bracing his back with his outstretched arms, he slid his foot backward, causing the sock to crumple up the length of his foot until it reached his toes. Once it did, he clamped down on it, lifted it up off the surface of the bed and tossed it in your direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhether he was aiming to hit you or not was unclear. Either way, the crumpled up ball of putrid smelling cotton arched low through the air and slammed into with the force of an oversized beach ball. It knocked you slightly off balance, but you recover almost immediately\u2026just in time to enjoy the beautiful cheddary smell as it curled around you. It must have landed in such a way that you were forced into its opening; the patches of cloth that touched your skin were damp, and the smell was far more powerful than ever before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hear a giggle from outside the blackness. After a number of rustles, light pours in from in front of you, and through the glare you can see Tails reaching over to take the sock off of you. He tosses it aside with a flick of his wrist and a friendly smile before going back to his original position. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce there, he produced what he had behind his back: a pair of thin black nylon stockings. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn\u2019t believe your eyes, even as he carefully moved to put them on. First, he takes one stocking and crumples it up, until it was no more than a ring of material. He then leans back slightly, lifting one foot in high in the air. With his leg fully extended, he stretches across and wraps the lip of the stocking completely around all of his toes, covering them completely in a thin veneer of material. Again, his focus is clearly on the task at hand; he even sticks his tongue out a little in concentration as he deliberately unrolled the stocking along the length of his foot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pace he kept was steady, but also agonizingly teasing. Though you thought your dick would be totally out of commission for a while, watching the nylon material wrap tightly around his heel sent a soft moan shivering out of your lips. Soon, he was rolling it up his leg; higher and higher it went until finally ending just above his knee. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter rotating his foot at the ankle and wiggling his toes, he looked to you for approval. The sight of the nearly transparent material covering the boy\u2019s extremities spellbinds you, and as such the only reaction you could manage was a tight series of nods. He smiles abashedly, but then quickly goes to work dressing the other foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly when both stockings are firmly on his feet does the boy extend both out to you. You look them up and down: the thin material tightly covering his beautiful soles though still leaving nothing to the imagination. You know that if you were to touch them, the feeling of the cloth would be negligible. In essence, you would be caressing his bare soles, feeling their smoothness in all their titanic glory\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow do you decide to proceed?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The boy genius wastes no time waiting for you to make the first move. Before you can even shuffle in place at the delightful sight of his feet in stockings, he leans across the bed and snatches you in his fist. With you in hand, he takes you over to the edge of the bed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking back at his face, you could see the young fox could barely contain his excitement anymore. He hopped off the bed with a mighty crash, a wide grin forming when he saw you flinch at the incredibly loud thoom. He balanced on his toes and sat on his haunches in order to place you amid the strands of plastic on the faux-grass floor. Before you can even look back up at his face, you see his feet leave the floor. He leaps up and lands on the bed with deafening creak, causing you to wince. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hear more creaking before you open your eyes, and once you do, you are greeted by a very welcoming sight. Mere inches from your head, a wall of thin black netting and short orange fur cast a dark shadow over you tiny form. Even though you had gotten intimate with these very soles many times before, having them hover over your head sends foreboding shivers coursing down your spine. It takes far less imagination than you like to admit to picture these several tons of muscle and flesh coming down on you and swiftly ending your life; but in spite of that, you find yourself enjoying the illusion of danger. The adrenaline rush perks you up, causing your heart to beat faster and your lower extremities to lose all sense of their fatigue. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTails leans back, allowing the full force of the sun beat down on you from beyond the skylight. You\u2019re blinded for an instant, but not enough so that you don\u2019t see him retreat towards the edge of the bed. He places both arms on either side of his body, and lets his eyelids drop to cover half his irises. The seductive look suits his handsome face surprisingly well, but you don\u2019t see it for very long. The expression is quickly covered up when he extends his right leg out to you, offering you the toes of his foot to do with as you pleased. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, there is nothing holding back your voracious appetite. Every single muscle in your body simultaneously relaxes as if hit by a tranquilizer, but instead of falling asleep, you slip into ecstasy. You step forward grab onto either side of Tails\u2019s big toe, holding it like it was the head of your significant other. You start off by giving it a soft peck, but instead of pulling away, your lips linger on the nylon-covered skin. You open your mouth, and let your tongue drag across the silky surface. The taste of Tails\u2019s foot comes to you at full strength now; its cheesy, putrid mixture of flavors stings your tongue with its sheer intensity, but you\u2019re too far gone to stop now. In turns you suck, lick and kiss the gigantic boy\u2019s head-sized digit. In short order, your tongue and mouth grow numb to the unimaginably sharp essence of the titan\u2019s sole, though that doesn\u2019t stop your taste buds from buzzing every time they\u2019re dragged across the surface. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes of passionate french kissing, your arms begin to get into it as well. They slowly bend at the elbows, stroking the toe up and down on either side. The web of material between the digits is so light and airy that it provides little resistance for your hand as you push into it. You then apply a little pressure, and the hairs part enough to allow you to feel the supple skin underneath. The creamy smoothness deadens your entire arm; it\u2019s so unreal that it gives you pause, and you break off your kiss in order to moan softly. When your rubbing resumes, all you can manage is to pant softly into the wet patch in the boy\u2019s fur. You can feel your eyes glaze over as you are overcome by the dreamlike sensations dancing across your hands. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe panting draws more than enough of the boys toe scent into your nose. The cutting perfume seems powerful enough to peel paint off the walls, but you simply can\u2019t get enough of it. You dig your nose deeply into the fur, until it is completely covered, and take a series of deep breaths. Your lungs fill with the smell, and your throat begins to take on more of the taste of it as small droplets of sweat get sucked down with the odor. It causes your lower torso to stir, awakening your dick with a violent string of contractions and twitches. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt stands fully at attention when you open your eyes and look up. You see Tails sitting with his eyes closed, head straight and breathing heavily. His chest heaves and shudders every time you move your arm or take a deep whiff. Once you move your arm down and begin caressing the pad of his foot, you see his eyes open slightly. They lock with yours, and he smirks when he sees how into it you really are. It must excite him immensely, because he then does something you don\u2019t expect, something that causes you to freeze in place immediately once you see it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look on as he raises his right hand to his mouth. He clamps down on the tip of one finger and pulls as far as the glove will allow. With that finger loose, he moves on to the next one, slowly peeling the fabric covering away until he removes it completely by tugging it off at his thumb. With the limp white glove still dangling from his mouth, he runs his orange furred hand down his chest, then his belly, and finally to a spot directly between his legs. It\u2019s there that he starts rubbing, letting out a soft moan from between his clenched teeth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou go back to kissing Tails\u2019s toe, the whole time keeping your eye on the boy as he pleasures himself at your touch. With your left hand, you move over to the next toe and begin groping and cupping it like the pliant breast of a seductress. Your right hand, meanwhile, reaches down to your package, fondling your balls and stroking your rigid shaft. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour new arrangement doesn\u2019t escape Tails\u2019s notice. His eyes widen considerably when he sees you go for your sex organs, and the pace and pressure of his massaging increases. It\u2019s during this state of increased exertion that he spits the glove out of his mouth, freeing it to open wide with a sensual howl. The cry shakes you to the core, causing you to grit your teeth and shiver with bliss. It takes all your energy not to blow right then and there, though somehow you manage to stave it off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore long, the young boy takes the initiative and repositions his foot in front of you. He twists his foot slightly to his left, moving his big toe away from you and offering you his smaller digits. You decide to skip the toes here, and instead plant your face squarely in the webbing between them; namely, the sensitive area between his pinkie and index toe. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn\u2019t determine the last time the boy cleaned in between his toes, but you are thankful that it didn\u2019t appear to be very recently. All the stuck-in toe jam and foul smelling gunk plastered there looks like entrees at a five star buffet to your sex-addled mind. Your stomach growls in anticipation, and without any more ado you delightedly dig in. The amorphous sludge slides down your throat smoothly, but it never seems to fill you up no matter how much of it you gulp down. You munch away at it and lick the area clean, but with your hunger still unsatisfied, you move on to the next space. As you lap up more of the delectable toe filth, you look up and stare in wonder at the gigantic young fox\u2019s reactions. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tip of his penis had poked through its protective, furry covering, and he was stroking it vigorously. The more ravenously you devoured the refuse between his toes, the more swollen his little foxy member became. By the time you exhausted the bounty of the second crevice, the boy\u2019s little doggie knot popped out into the open. The instant it did, he yelped in glee, and began panting as he vigorously stroked his fox dick with his entire fist. You HAD to mimic the action, especially as he bit his lip and hummed in delight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou go to lap up the last of the toe gunk, when you feel the wall of flesh gently push you backwards. You stumble at bit into the thicket of grass behind you, but you\u2019re able to recover in time to watch him hop off the bed with an earth shattering crash. He flattens scores of grass blades under his immense weight, a sight that causes your dick to spit out strands of precum in force. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTails is standing over you akimbo, his knees bent slightly. His penis isn\u2019t sticking straight up in the air; instead, he has it angled down so its tip is pointing directly at you. He strokes it faster and faster, running his fingers over the bulge of his knot with each pass. You milk your own dick at a higher tempo as well, wishing to synch up with him so that you could share in the moment of profound euphoria with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, you both reach the climax. You feel the sticky white stuff surge through your lower body before you see it erupt out of your head. It flies far and wide, forming thick globules and droplets on the nearby plastic strands. Your vision was reduced to a single pinhole from the strain, and it didn\u2019t return before you felt a searing hotness drench your body. It completely covered your hair and upper body, pooling up at your shins before another blast hit your squarely in the chest. The explosion of fox boy juices sends droplets splattering all over your face and head, though its not long before THAT gets hit with a stream of its very own as well. The force of the hit causes some to get past your lips and into your mouth, much to your orgasmic delight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, he appears to be finished. He plops back down on the bed and sighs deeply. You stare up at him, dripping in his fluids and smiling a toothy grin. The sight causes the young boy to laugh; a pleasant little thing that comforts you as deep fatigue drags you down into a profound slumber. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The sound of whirring machinery jolts you from your slumber. For a fraction of a second, you could swear that you thought you were back in your old room, in your normal sized house amid your normal sized effects. However, your quickly sharpening vision promptly brings you back to reality. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack to your strange, strange, STRANGE reality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor seemingly miles around, spires of metal crowd the landscape like a city skyline. However, instead of buildings cast in steel and adorned with glimmering glass, you see nothing but enormous, complicated pieces of heavy machinery. Support struts, levers, cranks, cranes, gear boxes, transmissions, anti-gravity emitters; seemingly every conceivable piece of technology known, and sometimes UNKNOWN, to man is spread out before you in all directions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shift your hands beneath you in order to stand up. You notice that the floor is soft to the touch; upon further inspection, you realize that you had been sleeping on some folded, quilted rag roughly the size of a city block. Getting to your feet, you notice not but a few paces away a deep black stain the size of a pond. When you take a deep breath, the sharp stench of motor oil causes you to reel backwards and wince. Evidently, you find out, this rag wasn\u2019t used solely as padding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe resumed sound of whirring draws your attention to a particular section of the metallic tangle. You can see through a partially disassembled biplane engine enough to catch a glimpse of an orange and white shape flitting in the distance. You try to maneuver on your little patch of oil-stained, padded ground to get a better look, but the shape is just too far away and too massive to be seen clearly through the relatively small peephole. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as you resign yourself to a fate of sitting put and waiting, the whirring sound suddenly ceases, and you hear a loud clang in the direction of the orange object. Immediately after, the object shifts until the entire opening is filled with the image of a single, ocean blue eye. As soon as the eye catches sight of you it disappears upward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTails sets himself down in a clearing right in front of your makeshift bed. Much to your surprise, in spite of his absolutely IMMENSE size, he touches down with such grace that not even a light crunch leaves the sole of his shoes. He is wearing a big smile, which seems to only grow wider as he approaches. As he does, of course, his enormity only grows more and more apparent, and as if to drive the point home, each footstep shakes the ground with enough force to make your knees wobble. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThank goodness you were used to this sort of thing. In fact, you were even ready for the inescapable feeling of feebleness that washed over you as Tails came to a stop a few steps away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis booming voice brings your eyes back up, way up, to his face. Though he was now a towering beast compared to you, that child-like charm never seemed lost when you looked up into those innocent baby blues of his. Though, if recent events told you nothing else, Tails wasn\u2019t as innocent as he had seemed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the seemingly endless hours of adult fun turned into a distant memory the instant he brandished that toothy, boyish of his at you. \u201cGood morning little fella. Good to see you\u2019re finally awake.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you could automatically reply, you see him take a few steps over to your right. On a low, rolling shop chair adjacent to the workbench he had positioned you on was a small glass filled to the brim with a colorful liquid. Tails picked up the makeshift bowl and placed it gingerly in front of you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere, it\u2019s a sports drink. After all that exercise, you need to replenish your electrolytes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy smiles and gestures for you to take a sip. At almost the same time, an intense thirst hits you like a freight train. You heft the cup up and chug down the neon red colored liquid. As it passes your throat, you notice suddenly that the puffy cotton feeling in your mouth has instantly disappeared. In addition to that, a surge of energy forms in the pit of your belly and radiates out, coursing through your entire body and renewing your vitality. It feels as if you could run a marathon in this condition.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201che he he, you like my recipe? I like to add my own special blend of vitamins and minerals to give it that extra kick.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe swings his leg back and forth sheepishly and rubs the back of his head as he says, \u201cto be honest, I wasn\u2019t totally sure if it would work on your unique physiology, but I\u2019m glad to see that it does.\u201d He wears another smile, and this time you can\u2019t help but return it with one of your own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell anyway, I\u2019m glad you are feeling much better now. I wanted to thank you for taking part in my little\u2026study. I got a LOT of useful data out of that.\u201d He chuckles devilishly, knowingly, shaking you to the core with both excitement and nervousness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn response to his thanks, you give an exaggerated bow, your way of telling him that he\u2019s more then welcome. It seems that the gesture sparks something in him, as his eyes widen at that and he talks a bit more loudly then before. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOH, THAT\u2019S RIGHT!\u201d Then, without another word, he puts a strange device up to his ear. You hadn\u2019t realized he had been holding anything as he approached, but you realize in that moment that whatever it is must have been what he was working on so diligently as you were waking up. He clips the device to his ear with one hand and toggles a switch with the other. Then, with arms outstretched, he waits as the device buzzes and clicks it\u2019s various components into place. A sharp, ultrasonic whine signals the end of the machine\u2019s contortions. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter it fades into nothingness, Tails gestures to the device. \u201cPretty nice, huh? See, I might not have been able to make Silver that suit for you like I promised, but I figured I had to do SOMETHING for him. So, after you fell asleep and I got you situated, I thought up something that might be just as useful.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnexpectedly, he waves you on. \u201cGo ahead little guy, say something.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerplexed and unsure totally of what he was getting it, you squint your eyes and study him carefully. When he didn\u2019t laugh it off like a joke or offer any further explanation, you decide to finally give in and say something. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUmmm, hello?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo sooner had the words left your lips that Tails\u2019 eyes grew wide. A smile formed, which soon grew into a full on beam. Eventually, he just couldn\u2019t contain himself; he let out a cry of joy as he propelled himself quickly a few feet (for him, a couple STORIES for you) into the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn his excitement, he didn\u2019t land quite as gracefully as he had before. The impact of his massive shoes hitting the concrete creates an earthquake for your tiny form that\u2019s so powerful that it knocks you flat on your back. The sound isn\u2019t anything to scoff at either, no different then a dozen thunderclaps going off in close proximity, or a controlled detonation to topple an old skyscraper. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as he opens his eyes and quits shouting how well he did, Tails notices your plight and, quite embarrassingly, stops. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe shuffles uncomfortably and says, \u201cOh, um sorry little guy. I got a little\u2026. carried away there.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNah\u2026it\u2019s\u2026. it\u2019s cool. Don\u2019t sweat it, man,\u201d You manage to gasp out, carefully righting yourself and unplugging your hands from your ears. They begin to stop ringing as Tails smiles down at you and takes a few steps closer before kneeling down to make you muzzle level.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks little guy.\u201d He giggles innocently, an expression you unbelievably still find cute even under the circumstances. But your mind quickly returns to the myriad of questions you have for the young genius.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, hold on here. You can understand me? How is that possible?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe train of complex technical lexicon flies at you far faster then you could anticipate. Tails is just getting into a theory about quantum entanglement and it's effect on sound waves when you pipe up and stop him. \u201cI\u2019m sorry Tails, but\u2026.English, please?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy froze mid sentence, and after pondering your response a moment said, \u201cEnglish? What\u2019s tha\u2026..ohhhh you mean you want it in laymen\u2019s terms. Okay, well the basics of it is that this device amplifies your voice so anybody MY size can here you.\u201d He smiles once more before adding, \u201cPretty neat, huh?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod emphatically, too stunned by the possibilities to think clearly. You can\u2019t believe this; after all this time, FINALLY you\u2019re able to talk to someone normally. You don\u2019t really know what to say, mostly because it had been so long since the last time anything you said actually MATTERED. You find that all you can do is what came naturally after all that time of being in total silence. You look Tails right in the eyes and bow a few times in thanks, but this time you actually voice your appreciation as well. The feeling of using the words from your lips to convey your emotions is absolutely indescribable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you, thank you, thank you Tails. This means so much, you really have no idea.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother smile. \u201cYou\u2019re welcome, friend.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, Tails looks past you at something. You turn around and notice that, out of the windows on the colossal hangar doors, the cheery blue sky has given way to the deep navy of night. You blink in surprise, shocked that you had slept for far longer than you anticipated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTails voices your thoughts before you have a chance too. \u201cIt\u2019s getting pretty late. I\u2019m supposed to take you home to Silver now.\u201d The dissatisfaction on his face is infectious, and soon you find yourself wearing the same expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut just then, Tails seems to get an idea. \u201cYou know what though, if I needed you until late in order to make some \u2018final calibrations to your suit,\u2019 maybe he\u2019d let you stay the night. What do you say, little guy? Wanna sleep over with me?\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cI think it might be best if I stay here,\u201d you said finally. \u201cWe can head back first thing in the morning.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTails smiles wide. Even though he was being polite, you could tell he is  thrilled to be keeping you around for a little bit longer. That kind of attention is really rather nice, when you think about it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay! Sounds like a plan to me!\u201d With that excited affirmation, he yawns loud enough to cause a pleasant hum to course through your body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn\u2019t too long before he picks you up in his gargantuan, gloved hands and carries you out of his workshop and into his house proper. He carries you off to his room and places you gently on the foot of his bed. Looking intently at Tails, you see him unbuckling and pulling off his gleaming red sneakers. The boy glances up at you, grinning knowingly as he peels the footwear off. He does it as slow as possible, the sound of his sock stickily peeling away from the insole escaping the dark cavern inside and filling the room with bliss. Once it\u2019s out in the open, his toes wiggle inside their cotton home: a home which, you notice, is marked with darker spots of delicious sweat. The marks are darkest near his wiggling toes, nearly outlining the slender, cheesy digits as they press up against the cotton with each movement. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow I can get the input right from the source. How do you like that little buddy?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven though you could technically give an answer, you find it difficult to find the words. Your breath is caught in your throat; drool oozing unknowingly as if you\u2019re staring at a delicious meal right in front of you. In a manner of speaking, you somewhat are.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe peels his other shoe off and sets it down carefully next to him. Taking a seat on the floor, he stretches his legs towards the bed; they\u2019re kept straight, the ankle puffs of his socks kissing, balls of his feet just barely meeting. If you were down there on the floor, it would be like two pillowy buildings planting themselves in front of you. You ogle the sexy features of the giant fox as he leans forward and touches those succulent toes with his fingertips. After a second of that, he moves on to yet another stretch, this time using one leg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can\u2019t exactly tell if this stretching is part of his normal night routine or he was just putting on a show for you, but a show it certainly is. He\u2019s surprisingly nimble for a young mechanic, owing probably to the many battles he has to fight in addition to all the engines he has to put together. You see his face melt with joy as joints pop all along his body. Admittedly, the sound is pretty relaxing, and even somewhat stimulating as it allows him to maximize his stretches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinishing with an impressive split,the boy stands with an effortless grace, taking a deep breath. He towers over you once again, looking down at you at his crotch level.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know about you, but I\u2019m absolutely exhausted. You can feel free to stay up and explore if you want, but there\u2019s no way I\u2019m going to be able to stay conscious for much longer. I\u2019m pooped\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis twin tails spin rapidly for a few seconds, carrying him up and over you and gently depositing him on the bed. It\u2019s so gentle that you don\u2019t even feel it, even as he puts his full crushing weight down on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGot any last words before I take my device off? I won\u2019t be able to hear you when I do, remember. So speak now or forever hold your peace\u2026 until morning anyway.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cute giggle he produces warms your heart up right away. You smile up at him; then you glance down at his feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh\u2026 just one request maybe\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTails glances down and giggles once again. \u201cOh those were coming off in a minute. Don\u2019t you worry little fella. I\u2019m WELL aware of how much you like my feet.\u201dHe pauses a moment. \u201cWhich actually, raises a really obvious question I should have asked to begin with.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he peels his reeking socks off his feet, he continues.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy are you so attracted to feet in the first place? I admit I was sort of guessing before when I brought out all those different socks to wear for you. I didn\u2019t really know the first thing about what I was doing, other than you were responding well to it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes are transfixed on the the boy\u2019s digits as he speaks, though you do offer a response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell\u2026 it\u2019s kind of hard to explain actually. I\u2019ve just always been this way. The sight of feet really excite me.\u201d You pause, then continue, \u201cwell, not JUST the sight I guess.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh?\u201d Tails inquires, as he starts peeling the other one off. Their familiar cheddar scent begins wafting about the area with a new strength, almost as if they\u2019re encouraging you to continue on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah. The scent, the taste, the feel; ALL about them, basically. It\u2019s sort of like\u2026 as if I\u2019m interacting with a penis or a vagina, basically. It\u2019s just natural for me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWoah, the attraction is that intense? Is it like that for everyone where you\u2019re from?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh\u2026 no, certainly not. In fact, it\u2019s somewhat looked down upon by people who don\u2019t share these feelings. I know I would keep it to myself around friends and family and stuff.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut not around us I suppose.\u201d He giggle sweetly again, surrounding you with his soles. He doesn\u2019t look like he\u2019s up to anything mischievous; as a matter of fact, he seems to have them there more for your comfort and enjoyment than anything else. It\u2019s very\u2026 loving, in a way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother long yawn leaves the fox boys lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI wish I could chat more, but I\u2019ll pass out if I don\u2019t get some shut eye soon.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHeh, is my story boring you that much?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTails leans forward and gives you a friendly pet on the head, smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGoodnight you snarky little guy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGoodnight Tails. Sweet dreams.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sit back and let the boy fiddle with his earpiece. He takes it out and places it on the night stand next to him. Smiling down at you one last time, he pulls the covers up over his body. Whether it\u2019s that action or him putting his head to his pillow, the lights go out automatically without another peep or action from the genius lad. It very quickly puts the whole room into a comfortable, relaxing state; the light from the moon through the window is the only source of illumination, the sound of crickets and the gentle wind bringing an immediate sense of calm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt\u2019d be the ideal sleeping situation, if you were at all sleepy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTails\u2019 concoction did a great job at waking you up, and right now you couldn\u2019t think of shutting your eyes. Your slowly softening stiffy does give you an idea about how you can quickly exhaust all that extra energy, however\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou trek across the boy\u2019s titanic topography, walking across the ebbs and flows of his blanket as you make your way up toward his face. You realize that he is on his side, as the path you walk is narrow and steadily rising as you reach his shoulders. The thick floor muffles your steps, preventing you from disturbing your gracious gigantic host.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou reach his face in no time. The boy must have been tired alright; he snores softly under you, his breath making little waves of fabric in his sheets sway back and forth like trees in the wind. Jumping down to that level, you smile as his unique-smelling breath washes over you. It\u2019s comforting, and even tempting you to stop and enjoy it\u2026 but you have another prize in mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou make your way in the darkness of the sheets.It takes a minute for your eyes to get used to the darkness, but you\u2019re following your nose far more at this point.Further and further in you go, making your way towards those smelly prizes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then, you pause a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA thick, musky scent off to your side catches your attention. Moving towards it, you are quickly surprised when you walk directly into the soft flesh of Tail\u2019s red rocket. Feeling around in the dark, and from what little you can perceive with your eyes, you can tell it\u2019s already poking out very noticeably from its soft, furry home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn fact, touching your face where you bumped into it, you feel the sticky, warm precum oozing its way between your fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBetween the scent and the feel of the precum, your body is sent into overdrive. You practically rip your clothes off and lunge yourself at the boy\u2019s sex. Writhing, sweating, humping and kissing the rod makes it grow swifty, oozing out more of that clear, delicious goo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt doesn\u2019t matter if you can see it or not. It doesn\u2019t even matter if you wake Tails up or not anymore. Your lust drives you absolutely wild; so much so that you wonder just exactly what was in that drink you partook in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes of savoring Tails\u2019 strong, potent flavor, you feel his thick manhood start to pulse. The shaking rocks your body to the core, prompting your own prostate to start to tighten. You hump his knot vigorously, crying out his name into the darkness before blowing your load right on his smooth, silky skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour head swims as you pump more and more semen out of your rod. Through the fog, you can just barely take in Tails\u2019 monster cock unloading gallons and gallons of cum into the sheets in front of him. Whatever his true age is, this load was certainly not that of a mere child. The cum stain that forms is so massive and thick with sticky white love that you can\u2019t help but bring your sweaty body over to it and lying down in its sticky, warm embrace. And it\u2019s there, breathing in the fox-boy\u2019s man musk, coated in your own jizz on the front and his on your back, that you finally fall into a deep, restful slumber once again.</span></div></div>",

His cute little face made you shudder a little, his size made you wonder if he was even interested in experimenting but then Tails does something that surprises you. The giant's gloved hand envelops you what his chuckle appears, as he appears to be pinning you underneath until you begin to pass out. The weirdest thing was you were starting to enjoy being poked and prodded by the child genius there when he asks if you've had enough you clearly make it obvious you want more he then smiles then nods before leaving the room he comes back in a few seconds with what appears to be a glass Beaker he then points to you to get inside quickly and you going without much force. The ground underneath you shakes as he just slowly lifted into the air. \"Alright, now you heard l wanted to give you the full tour...\" Your eyes widened when you realised what he meant, you were trapped and there was nothing you could do about it. He places you onto the countertop as he sits on his couch the loud crashing noise as he sits down on the leather is murder on your ears. he puts an arm onto the armrest besides him and smiles at you resting both of these shoe'd feet onto the counter. \"We've got a lot of catching up to do but first I'd like you to meet my shoe soles. I bet you wish you could touch them huh?\" he wasn't wrong your entire body was shaking it just the thought of touching them they look like the most amazing thing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now before that you need to do this!\" as he takes you out of your prison and places you on the sofa before he sits on you. He laughs and grins as you're smothered underneath and giving a few bounces, before he plugs in a gaming console and plays away the next few hours without knowing you're even there. \"Can you still take me? Loser!!\" He said playing the game but you could easily assume he was talking to you. You hear him making a noise akin to screaming and he makes one last this, before making a mess inside your nether regions.

Once the words \" early in the day\" hit your eardrums, a sense of disappointment comes to mind as Sonic, Knuckles, and everyone else are likely still asleep by this point. \" So, I guess you're here to get your fix of Sonic's feet ?\" The young fox teases whilst placing a set of bags on the floor \" I'm sorry, but everyone's gone on a camping trip for the week, leaving EVERYTHING to me. But...maybe I could help ?\".<br>\r\nYour attention diverts to Tails' red and white sneakers, which are slowly being shifted off one foot at a time, letting out a pure stench that would disgust most other people if they were to get a smell of it, but you relish in it for every second instead. \" To tell you the truth, I've actually never done anything like this before. But, I'm still all for it. Okay...wh-what should we star off with then ?\".</span></div></div>",

At first the small fox grimaces from the odd sensation, but he soon forces himself to relax as you continue to breath in the aromatic aphrodisiac. A sudden rush of excitement courses through your entire body, especially your member, which begins to slowly reveal itself in a tight bulge. You continue to sniff away as to keep up the heavenly sensation in your pants, or at least that is until Tails finally notices your rock hard cock. \" Well, that's definitely something new to keep in mind.\" he shyly mutters out with an awkward giggle \" Actually, somethings just hit my mind. What if...what if I were to use that shrink ray over there !? I could shrink you down to the size of a pebble so you could get the most out of my feet while not leaving that much of a, well, ' mess'. Or, w-we could just continue it the way we're already doing it. It's really up to you. I just thought it'd be...' interesting'. \".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou slowly shift your attention from the little pieces of heaven in front of you to the barely visible device you'd taken notice of earlier. The fox then stiffly lifts himself from the tiny stool he sat upon and carefully lets his hands wander towards the shrink ray whilst finally turning on the living area's dim lights. \" I'll just leave it here on the shelf if you change your mind.\" he says in a friendly tone of voice. Upon making his way back, you immediately return to the business at hand. The pent up tension starts to become to much and you at last decide upon unsheathing your member into the open air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTails' face then subtly blushes \" I'd never thought I'd be able to turn someone on...with my feet. I'm honestly flattered !\". His short announcement, however, flies over your head as the tension somehow manages to build up more. Without blinking an eye, you quickly remove the socks from the fox's feet and place them on your cock, leaving his small feet vulnerable. That's when the idea of using the shrink ray becomes more of an apparent method, leaving your mind in small crisis of sorts. With the opportunity to have a once in a lifetime experience which will likely never happen again, you start to think very deeply of the situation and ultimately try to come up with a final decision.</span></div></div>",

As you sit and weigh your options, Tails' toes<br>\r\nstart to wander along your exposed member, starting at the base and slowly stroking their way to<br>\r\nthe head, idly playing with your shaft as he patiently waits for your answer, his face a mixture of<br>\r\nchildlike wonder and excitement, you think he's secretly hoping you say yes. You come to your<br>\r\ndecision.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, Let's do this.\" Tails practically leaps into your arms with excitement, \"Thank you so much!<br>\r\nI love being able to help others with my inventions, and don't worry, we can grow you back at any<br>\r\ntime.\" That gives you an idea you might want to try later, but for now, you're just satisfied with <br>\r\nbeing small. You zip up your pants as the twin tailed fox grabs the toy-like device from the shelf, <br>\r\n\"But before we begin I want to set this up just right,\" he says, apparently he's given this some thought <br>\r\nas well. He takes a seat on the couch and motions to the air in front of him as his sticks his furry orange <br>\r\nlegs out in front of him, \"Now I want you to stand between my legs and hold my feet.\" You do as instructed, <br>\r\nhe asks if you are ready to which you nod.

You look at Tails and are<br>\r\nabout to say that you believe that it isn't working when you feel the two feet in your hands start to grow.<br>\r\nYour entire world begins to get bigger as you dwindle in size, you then get a sneaky idea, you raise one <br>\r\nof his expanding feet to your face and insert his big toe into your mouth, feeling every second of growth.<br>\r\nYou take in his scent and taste every part of that toe, eventually it starts to be a mouthful so you have to<br>\r\nremove it, but you don't remove his foot from your face. The toes slowly stretching up to your forehead, <br>\r\none foot becoming large enough to be your head, Tails then instructs you to lie down, you do as asked<br>\r\nand he places his foot on your chest and stands, putting all of his weight on the other foot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel yourself shrinking faster, his toes moving up to your chin, while his heel heads towards your<br>\r\ninsanely hard pecker. You ask Tails how small you will get, he replies that he can input any <br>\r\nsize reduction or expansion he wants and any speed he wants on the ray and he informs<br>\r\n you that you will stop shrinking at...</span></div></div>",

I've never really tried this... foot thing b-before,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTails grabs a stool nearby from the dimly lighted room and sits down on it, shuffling nervously as you wait. Once Tails felt somewhat comfortable, he extends both his legs to you, giving you a clear view of his slightly damp and smelly socked feet. For a few seconds, you do nothing, sitting, waiting on the cold hard floor for a signal from Tails to start.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ar-Aren't you g-gonna start?\" Tails said, his eyes dart over to you, curious to how you'll start the massage yet still stuttering a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry Tails,\" you apologize before grabbing his left foot to begin the massage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe closed his eyes in response while you started the foot massage. For the first few minutes, you started from the bottom of the foot and pressed your thumbs there before rubbing them in various motions, trying to find the perfect spot where Tails can be satisfied and calm the most.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore long, you found that sweet spot once Tails mouth formed a huge smile on his face, as if he's mentally begging to keep going.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes of Tail's left foot massage, you remove his left foot from your hand and start massaging his right foot next, this time repeating the same process faster. Unsurprisingly, it was easier to find the sweet spot due to it being in the almost exact position as his left foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't long until you started to get bored of massage in the same place so you removed your thumbs from his foot and you bury your nose in-between his toes, taking in the sweaty boy scent that your nostrils were taking. Noticing the sudden change of treatment his feet were getting, Tails re-opened his eyes and to his amazement, saw you massaging his toes with your nose. Looking at the way you massaged his foot, Tails couldn't help but chuckle a bit. It wasn't everyday he saw a guy worship his foot like that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're enjoying this aren't you?\" Tails asked with a huge grin on his face, \"No wonder why Sonic likes you! It's a little funny.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod, blushing from the embarrassment of Tails statement as the yellow fox continued to rub his dirty socked feet on your face, before finally making sure to get your nose right in-between his first and second toes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin a few more pleasurable minutes, Tails removes his feet from your face, allowing you to take a breath of fresh air. Well, the smell of oil and spare metallic parts around his (presumingly) workshop smells fresh to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what do you want to do now?\" Tails asks, offering you another foot-related activity, finally eased in your weird fetish.</span></div></div>",

Surprised with your immediate response, Tails gives off a queer look before tearing away his socks, letting his boyish odor echo through the entire living room. Amidst the overpowering stench of sweat is a hint of mechanical oil, which does take you out of your euphoric state for a brief moment, but you soon get used to and accept as being a key component of Tails' character, giving you a deeper sense of excitement. Without wasting a moments notice, you grab hold of the fox's small, left foot and dig your nose deep into his sole, taking in large whiffs of his youthful foot smell. The fox's toes then begin to wiggle intensely, silently inviting you to show them some love, to which you fully accept.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinutes turn to hours as you sniff away at Tails' bare feet to your heart's absolute contempt. As time continues to fly by, you soon get tired of just smelling, and thus begin to give out slight licks to the fox's orange walls of flesh. Your tongue maneuvers the full length of Tails' feet in a rhythmic fashion, from top to bottom, toes to heels, again and again, constantly tasting the lad's sweaty, salty flavor of sorts. After what could've been a possibly indefinite amount of time sampling Tails' aphrodisiacs of feet, the tension inside your pants grows to an almost unbearable length, ultimately making you unleash your stiffened member right in front of the young fox. Shocked, Tails' nearly tips his stool over whilst letting out a sudden gasp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-sorry !\" he stammers out \"I...I'm just a little anxious at what I presume your going to do next.\". He shivers as he places his stool back up and places his feet in your lap once again. \"Oh man, this is getting too weird now. But...I did ask what you wanted to do next. I shoulda predicted this woulda happened eventually.\". You gently smile before bringing his feet on to your hard cock, steadily stroking them up and down your shaft. Despite his squeals of childish disgust, you continue to rub one out while enclosed in your bubble of pure euphoria.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tension builds and builds until you've reached your climax. You rapidly, and rather violently, jerk Tails' feet up and down, up and down, up and down in a fierce manner. It keeps on building until it grows too much and you let out a large, piping hot stream of cum on the fox's feet. Silence falls upon the room after your intense orgasm, lifting an air of awkwardness which is further permeated by a deep stare the two of you exchange. \"I...I'm sorry Tails.\" you mutter out with a nervous tone \"I-I just got so caught up in it all, and...\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you can let our another word, a disturbed glance emits from the fox's crystal eyes before a subtle whisper of \"it's...it's fine.\" graces your ears. Feeling slightly ashamed of yourself, you decide to walk out the door and spend the night looking around Knothole. Who knows if he'll ever truly forgive you, seeing as the following day happened to be your last on mobius. You lead back into the real world, giving nothing more than a silent goodbye.</span></div></div>",

I mean, I'm for it like I said, but...I just need to get some more experience with this.\". You quietly tell him that \" this would be perfect practice\", which somewhat relieves him of his presumable disgust with your fetish, but he still looked kinda nervous. \" Listen, I think it'll be better if we were to do this when Sonic's back. Or...maybe we could try it in my room if you really insist on it. After all, it's better than being stuck in a dark, dark room.\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe truly seemed to be stressed out by this point, so you ultimately decide upon taking him to his room, the same one he shares with Sonic coincidentally.

You replied yes and asked where you were. \"In my house, I'm Silver.\" You had told him your name as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou got out of the bed, setting the blanket over the pillow. \"Let's go to the living room.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok.\" you reply. You two headed to the living room where there lied a white sofa, television, and coffee table. Silver takes a seat on the couch and pats a spot on the couch, motioning you to come sit with him. You take a seat right next to Silver. You and Silver start talking and realize that you both have a lot in common. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, it had gotten later and later until it was night. \"It's getting late.\" right before you could ask what you were going to do for the night. \"Hey, you don't mind sleeping in the guest bed again?\" asked Silver.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. Not at all.\" you reply. You two had then went upstairs and gotten to bed. But at 3:17 AM, you woke up to a sweaty, furry, foot in your face. You tried to shout, but the foot caused it to be muffled and not understandable. After 5 minutes, you feel the foot lift off your face. You sigh in relief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then, you feel yourself getting picked up by an invisible force. You then realize you were being taken to the living room. You're then lied down in front of a love seat. You then feel the two sweaty feet on your cheeks.

But as you were making it towards the front door, you're pounced on by Silver and dragged again by the invisible force. He had put you in the same position you were just in before you ran off. This time Silver had duck taped you to the wooden floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tsk - tsk.\" he said, clicking his tongue. \"Going to have to 'punish' you for that.\" </span></div></div>",

While holding the boot he makes a face and says \"Ugh, my nose is not even near this beauty and I can still smell it, you're in for a rough ride kid!\" He laughs a little at the end of the sentence. To your horror he then started lowering the boot towards you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're quick to scream \"Why are you doing thi-mfffff\" but you're soon muffled by his boot. Silver is pressing down hard, finally forcing you to inhale through your nose. The smell is unbelievably strong, reminiscent of his furry foot, but the aroma of his sweat intensified. As you can't do anything but smell more of his musky, sweaty boot you look up to his face. He is grinning down at you, dominance and satisfaction in his eyes, he's gonna enjoy putting you in your place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why? I already told you! I need a new piece of foot meat\" he says pushing the boot down even harder at the last two words to make them sink in. \"You know... Something I can put my feet on and relax, get a little massage with it's face, a little kiss here and there, and if I'm feeling generous I may even let it lick them\" Silvers smile was getting wider as he was talking, he also pressed his boot down even harder, making your nose touch the insole of his boot, not only making the smell harder but also making you feel how wet and sweaty his boots really were. \"This piece of foot meat would of course have to acknowledge how godly my feet are, and it's should worship them like the gods of its existence\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilver then lifted the boot from your face, but before you could protest or say anything he slapped his sole on your mouth, successfully making you unable to speak. He then grabs his other boot and holds it above you, but he doesn't move his sweaty, smelly, furry foot just yet. \"Oh and if you haven't realized what the best news is, I'm gonna enlighten you\" he then leans in a little bit so you can have a better view of his smug, grinning face and wiggles his toes on your face \"you're that piece of foot meat\" he then laughs and leans back again, tapping his foot few times on your face to further humiliate you. \"I'd suggest you think about how lucky you are while smelling my other boot!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then lifts his foot from your face and quickly replaces it with the boot from his hand, forcing you to smell his musk again. You whimper a little into his boot, making Silver chuckle \"Oh don't worry foot meat, soon you'll be begging to get the privilege of smelling my boots, enjoy it while it lasts\" Silver says with a smug smile, Silver then proceeds to force his boot down on your face, taunting you from time to time, making sure you get well acquainted with the smell of his boots and with the knowledge you're now his property, nothing more then a piece of furniture. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe's gonna enjoy having you worship his feet, Silver thinks about what to do with you, he could get some of his sweat soaked socks to have some fun with you, he could also just make you give some attention to your gods themselves: his feet, he could also use his mind powers to make you a little more obedient and accepting with the fact his feet now own you. Silver looks down at you breathing in his sweat and just smirks as he thinks of the possibilities... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe finally takes his boot away \"I think you had enough fun with my boots, It's high time...</span></div></div>",

I just released, you haven't gotten used to the beauties themselves,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he said this, he dropped his boots to the side, made sure he got sat down comfortably, and lifted both feet above of your face, they smelled worse than the boots but smelled less earthy, which in a smal way seemed more bearable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Jesus! And judging by the smell they are both ready to meet you probably, kid, meet your new Gods!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please do-mmph!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMuch like early, silver used his bare soles to silence you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No need for a hello, they want to get a 'feel for you' right away.\" Silver said with a devilish grin and a chuckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilver's feet covered over your entire face, not truly taking effect into how big they were till just now. He wraps his toes on top of your head, almost squeezing your face to his soles like a mask. After not being able to breath for a few seconds you start to panic, but it's useless hearing any of your muphled yells begging for air as silver is completely enjoying himself. After a few more seconds, silver lifts the heels and lower parts of his feet off your face and you gasp for air through your mouth as your nose is still scrunched down ( and you can't see anything either).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? Don't like getting too close for long? Heheh. They are overwhelming, but they are just starting to warm up to you.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilver lifts his feet off your face, but not for long as one foot lowers down to your nose and mouth and you see his toes completely cover your whole nose and your mouth and lips become completely unseen under the ball of his foot. While the other one starts being rubbed all over your cheeks and covering your eye every so often. His right foot ( from your direction, your right) starts scrunching and stretching, pressing and squeezing your nose and mouth. His foot is so sweaty and wet that it feels like the foot is kissing you or sucking on your nose and mouth, mixed with the smell and almost not being able to breath, your eyes started fading without you realizing it. It was too much to handle. Silver notices this and uses the left foot (again, your left) and slaps you with it to wake you up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! Foot-near, I don't want you to get to comfortable down there, I have so much for you to do left.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe puts his left foot beside your head and lifts his toes from his right foot off your nose leaving you more air to breath but not taking the ball of his foot off your mouth even pressing harder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm going to leave that foot there till you learn to not speak out of turn or beg for mercy unless I tell you to. Otherwise I might use it to knock you out or kill you, got it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince you are stuck in this with no choice, you nod accordingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, I'll let my foot off if need be, but for now, let's take a look at the options you have foot-meat. For 1. Nod yes, for 2. Nod no. And if your wondering where foot licking is, like I said, if your a good boy we can get to that later got it?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, 1. You can massage my other lonely foot while the other stays where it is and switch, and don't worry, the tape will come off your hands and arms, because I'm hoping you learned you can't get away. Only so you can do the massage while the other foot stays on your mouth. Or 2. You can kiss my feet passionately, both of them obviously, but you would still have to not speak and do it for a few hours. Your choice?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth options didn't sound very pleasing to you, either way, feet are going to be on your face, the smell still unbearable and still very wet and sweaty. Both incredibly embarrassing, maybe more comfort will come from option 1 due to more movement, while option 2 allows you to breath from your nose and mouth, very tricky choice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well? I'm waiting....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he says this, much like fingers on tables, he starts wiggling his toes over your nose much like an irritated lady would her nails like she were tapping something. Silver wasn't going to let this though process go on for long. It became a tiny bit harder to breath as each time silvers toes pressed down onto his nose. He suddenly presses on your nose and mouth and squeezes hard not allowing you breath suddenly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not going to wait all day!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNod yes for #1<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNod no for #2</span></div></div>",

Thankfully he eases the pressure and allows you to breathe but he doesn't lift his foot off your mouth just yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilver just looks down at you with that smug grin and chuckles \"Awww, you're really eager to show your new gods how much you love them aren't you?\" he asks with a mocking tone. He wiggles his toes in front of your nose and slightly presses them against it as he continues to speak \"Well I can't blame you, I bet you just can't wait to have the best kiss of your life but don't forget your place!\" his voice getting more firm at the end of the sentence. \"Don't speak unless I let you and make sure you're kissing them passionately, they're your gods after all!\" he presses down his foot a little harder for a second as if to make a point. \"Got it foot-meat?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod your head still scared by his earlier threat. \"Good boy\" he smirks before finally lifting his foot of your face and hoovers it above it just so you can get a good look at it, he lowers it slightly, that way his sole is almost touching your lips. \"Go for it foot meat!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take a deep breath now that you can, it was mainly filled with the aroma of Silver sweaty feet but you were glad you were able to breathe freely. You decide based on your previous experience that it's better to not keep Silver waiting and you lean in and give his sole a peck, before you could lean in for another one Silver stomps on your face making you whimper. \"I!... Said!... Passionately!...\" Obviously not happy with your performance he even pushes his foot down harder when pronouncing every word. \"You're way too low to be those beauties lover but when I tell you to kiss them like they're the love of your life you do so foot-meat, understand?!\". You quickly nod your head and continue whimpering quietly. \"Since I'm feeling merciful I'm gonna pretend that didn't happen and give you another chance, but if you kiss them as pitifully again I'm not gonna be so generous!\" he finally lifts up his foot again and lets it rest above your mouth. \"Again!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time you immediately go for the kiss, trying to fix your mistake, you press your lips against his sole you close your eyes before letting your mouth be invaded by the salty taste of Silver's foot sweat and dirt. You suck on the foot and push your tongue against it during the kiss. Finally after solid minute you break the kiss. Fearing that you did a bad job again you keep your eyes shut afraid of getting smothered by his foot again but instead you hear him say \"There, that wasn't so hard was it?\" he then brings his other foot above your head and presses it's heel on your mouth \"Looks like they like you\" he says and then begins to lightly grind his heel on your lips. \"You better keep kissing foot-meat, and how about telling my feet you love them before continuing huh?\" he asks while holding back laughter. \"Come on now!\" too afraid to disobey you look at feet above you and mutter \"I l-love you\" with your mouth full of Silver's heel, Silver bursts out laughing but you not wanting to disappoint him just start making out with his heel, once again getting mouthful of sweat and dirt and treating his foot as if it was your lover.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe keeps giving you different areas of his feet to kiss while mocking you with devilish grin, but you keep on going. This goes on for a while but Silver seems to enjoy taking his time with the undersides of his toes, finding it hilarious to see you struggle with the smell and sweat, he also tries keeping the foot that's not being kissed busy by rubbing it all over your face or by cupping your nose with his toes and making you inhale his foot fumes. At one point he lifts his foot up playfully, that way it's just out of your reach and chuckles \"Come on foot-meat, get it, get it\" he says mockingly as you lift your head as high as you can trying to kiss it, he keeps swaying his foot above you and wiggling his toes while laughing at you and treating you like a dog that can't reach his treat. After having a ball looking at your pathetic attempts to reach his foot he finally lowers his big toe letting you kiss it and sliding it all over your lips as you greedily slobber all over that sweaty toe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while he finally seems satisfied \"Enough foot-meat\", you stop your worshipful kisses at the command, he then rests both of his feet on your face and wiggles his toes \"Your gods took a liking to you, they definitely gonna enjoy owning you\" he says as he taps his toes on your forehead. \"Inhale deeply foot-meat\" he commands and you instantly take deep breaths of his sweaty feet, it was still making you a little dizzy but you definitely got used to it to say the least. Silver thinks what to do with you next as he looks down at you with a smug grin across his face while you're huffing his foot scent.</span></div></div>",

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">Welcome to my reboot!<br>\r\nSome brief info: Sonic Feet was an interactive story (Erotica) based on Sonic Characters (Mostly Male)<br>\r\nand their feet. It was an interactive that I visited frequently and was devastated to find it removed, so I<br>\r\nstarted my own Sonic Feet to try to recapture what I loved about the original.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nPlease keep all entries to 2nd person and present tense: \"You rub Sonic's feet\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's come to my attention recently that I should have tried to illustrate more about what I want/ Don't want in the story so: Here it goes<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI will allow mostly anything, it's what made the original special and it would be easier to say what I don't want to see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI do not want:<br>\r\n1. A name for the main character: I don't hate First or Third Person, I just prefer \"You\" to \"I\" or a name, ambiguity is fun!<br>\r\n2. Extreme grammatical errors (I will edit as I see fit)<br>\r\n3. Death (Unless there is a way to write the character back to life)<br>\r\n4. Hardcore scat and gore.<br>\r\n5. I will allow crossovers, but that doesn't mean you can just not include a Sonic Character, this is primarily a Sonic interactive. So if you do do a crossover the story-line must contain at least one sonic character.<br>\r\n6. Also, under no circumstance (baring  previous chapters so far) Do I want a stream of question chapters. Period. End of story. I know of too many stories that have potential but are over bearing on question chapters. One here and there is fine, but if you must make a chapter that asks essentially \"Who is it?\" Make the chapter more than one sentence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf there is anyone who would like to add to this ever expanding story, but you aren't confident in your writing, <br>\r\nor if you would like to see something specific and don't want to write it yourself I am more than willing to help,<br>\r\nAlways feel free to send me an email. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI would love to be more active here once again, so please do not hesitate to ask!<br>\r\nI'm here to help satisfy your footy needs (Or whatever other fetishes/ stories you have in mind)</td>",
