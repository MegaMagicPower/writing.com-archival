What you do notice is that it looks as if it's unfinished; there's an outer ring with a sentence of text, but the rest of the medallion is blank. There's an inner ring, where it looks like there should be an image of some sort, as well as a smaller scroll-like area for a caption, but neither of them are filled in. Tracing your hand over it, it's very well polished, furthering your idea that this was likely difficult to make. It was probably a gift for an emperor or something; maybe they died, which is why it's unfinished? As you continue to hold it in your hand, you realize how warm it feels, despite there being no reason for it to be. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou place the medallion back in your pocket, planning to research it and see what the text says when you get home later tonight.
