Sparks were flying, clashing against blasts of water, fire, and leaves. Pikachu struggled, but all hope seemed lost. There was no way Pikachu could possibly take on the forces of three, specially trained by a human for battle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIvysaur's vine whip came rushing toward the electric pest, and suddenly, a crate fell from the sky, clashing with the vines, and cracking open, dropping a pokeball on the ground right in front of Pikachu. \"Yes!\" he thought to himself. It could only be fate that another pokemon would come fry the sky to help even the odds. Pikachu grabbed it, and threw it directly at Ivysaur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nManaphy flies into the sky, spinning and firing red beams from it's antennae. One struck Pikachu in the head, and he froze. The other aimed for Ivysaur, who leaped out of the way. The beam swerved backwards, and hit the Pokemon Trainer in charge of the action instead. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPikachu shook his head, and opened his eyes, breaking the trance. He braced himself for an incoming attack as he stared at Ivysaur in front of him. Nothing came at him. Instead, Ivysaur seemed to be concerned if he was hurt. \"I'm fine, don't worry.\" said Pikachu.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What!?!\" he blerted out. \"Since when can I speak human?\" Pikachu looked down. His fur was gone! He was wearing a human's &lt;i&gt;clothes&lt;/i&gt;! His paws were now full fledged hands with fingers, thumbs, skin: The Whole Package. He was now a human, in charge of other pokemon. He was the Pokemon Trainer!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe real Pokemon Trainer woke up on the battlefield. His eyes were drawn to Ivysaur, who seemed confused. The trainer figured it was best to give Ivysaur a rest and send out Charizard to clean up. He reached for his belt...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pika Pika! Pi? Pika? PIKA?\" The trainer was in total shock. Where were his pokeballs? Where were his fingers? Where was his voice? When he tried to change pokemon, he touched nothing but soft yellow fur with paws where his hands were. He couldn't even cry out for help. He just kept squeaking that name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"&lt;B&gt;TIME UP&lt;/B&gt;\" shouts the announcer's voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPikachu and the Pokemon Trainer were warped back to the other's room.</span></div></div>",

In this storyline, Lyn isn't Roy's mother, even though she has the possibility to be in the Fire Emblem series. A Character's gender will be considered whatever gender that the body they're in is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the stage 'Castle Siege'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoy was fighting Marth in a timed match. Roy had made it back in even though he wasn't supposed to. The two swordsmen kept striking with their blades, but the other one would block. Suddenly a Poke Ball and an Assist Trophy appeared on the field. Marth went to get the Poke Ball, while Roy went to get the Assist Trophy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You won't defeat me!\" Marth shouted as he ran to the Poke Ball.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wouldn't be so sure about that!\" Roy replied as he reached the Assist Trophy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoy grabbed and used the Assist Trophy, quickly followed by Marth with the Poke Ball. Lyn appeared from the Trophy and crouched down, then vanished and struck Marth, who went flying out of the stage right as Manaphy came out of the Poke Ball and used Heart Swap. Since Marth hadn't been brought back yet, Manaphy's Heart Swap hit Roy and Lyn, who hadn't disappeared yet. The two fell down, with Lyn\u2019s body not disappearing. Marth was brought back to the field.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry Roy, but I\u2019m not going to stop just because you\u2019re down.\u201d Marth said as he charged at Roy\u2019s body with his sword out. Marth was about to strike when time ran out and all three Fire Emblem characters were teleported out of the field.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n&lt;B&gt;\"This game's winner is Roy!\"&lt;/B&gt; The announcer declared. Lyn and Roy's bodies were brought to their rooms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n&lt;B&gt;Later, in Lyn's room.&lt;/B&gt;<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoy woke up and groaned, but didn't notice the change in her voice at first. As she stood up however, she felt something jiggling on her chest. Roy looked down and saw her new breast, but that wasn't all, she recognized the clothing she was wearing as Lyn's!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the heck is going on?\" Roy wondered in surprise, and immediately noticed that it was Lyn's voice that came out. Roy found a full body mirror and looked at it, she saw Lyn looking back. \"Yep, I'm in Lyn's body alright.\" Suddenly Roy saw a note on a table near her new bed. She went to check it out and saw that it was a note saying that Lyn had gone from being an Assist Trophy to being an actual character in Brawl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoy went back to the mirror and moved her new arm around in front of her and watched in fasination as her reflection did the same thing. Roy then got a perverted grin on her new face as she squeezed her new breasts and moaned. Roy always tried to be polite and respect others, but she still had the mind of a teenage boy and was in a beautiful girl's body. Roy heard a knock on the door and then her old voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat did Roy's original body say?</span></div></div>",

It's Lyn!! I think you are kinda lost, I'll ask Link for the Team Battle, you'd better focus on the battle.\" Marth says as he walks away<br>\r\nAs Marth leaves, Roy hurries to where her old body is at, still facing the corridor Marth went down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what did he talk to you about?

He and his good friend had been planning something for several days, but he needed someone else to make it possible. Where was she... where was she...?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere! The swish of her pink dress! The boy ran down the hall and around the corner, and almost ran face first into Princess Peach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! Ness. Can I help you?\" The princess asked politely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, yeah. Sonic wanted to see you. He said it's urgent.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh? I wonder what it could be...\" She said, lifting up her skirt and walking briskly (\"Princess's never run\" Toadsworth always told her) to Sonic's room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Sonic was in his room, resting. He had just gotten back from a Sudden Death match with Captain Falcon. Not even his speed can save him from a Falcon Punch...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe heard a light knock on his door. \"Hm? Come in!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door opened, and in walked the blonde princess of the Mushroom Kingdom. She smiled sweetly at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, hello your highness.\" Sonic said respectfully. The heir to the throne giggled with a gloved hand in front of her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sonic, I told you. Call me Peach.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSonic chuckled as Peach took a seat, crossing her legs in a perfectly ladylike manner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You wanted to see me about something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSonic perked up. \"No. I was hoping to get some rest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeach cocked her head slightly. \"You were? But Ness said...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo boys, Ness and one significantly older, peeked into Sonic's room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, Pokemon Trainer, NOW!\" Ness said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe nameless Pokemon Trainer opened the door and flung the Pokeball he'd obtained from the area that they kept the items, and that he had been saving in before either occupants could react.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go, Manaphy! Heart Swap!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bright blue Pokemon cried out happily and extended it's two antenna. One plucked the polite, demure heart of the princess, while the other extracted the more confident, free spirited heart of the Hedgehog, before spinning around and placing them in the opposite bodies. Immediately, both both victims fainted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNess jumped into the air. \"Yes! It worked!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'd better get out of her before they wake up.\" Advised the Pokemon Trainer as Manaphy vanished. Ness nodded, and the two set off.</span></div></div>",

If you want someone else in, just send me a message telling me which character, and what game they're from, but I won't put all of them in. Here are the extra characters so far:<br>\r\nTetra/Toon Zelda (Legend of Zelda series)<br>\r\nBaby Mario and Baby Luigi (Team, Mario series)<br>\r\nKrystal (Starfox series)<br>\r\nDixie Kong (Donkey Kong series)<br>\r\nBlaze the Cat (Sonic series)<br>\r\nPuppet Zelda (Legend of Zelda series)<br>\r\nShadow Queen (Mario series)<br>\r\nMiles \"Tails\" Prowler (Sonic series)<br>\r\nTy the Tasmanian Tiger (his own series)<br>\r\nThe following are all from the Fire Emblem series:<br>\r\nMicaiah<br>\r\nSothe<br>\r\nLethe<br>\r\nEphraim<br>\r\nEirika<br>\r\nNino<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI'm also adding more characters as Assist Trophies, and each of them are allowed to switch:<br>\r\nKnuckles (Sonic series)<br>\r\nVivian (Mario series)<br>\r\nThe next following are all from the Fire Emblem series:<br>\r\nMist<br>\r\nL'Arachel<br>\r\nMyrrh<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere are certain characters to who can't switch with each other, here they are:<br>\r\nMelee Link, Young Link, Brawl Link, and Toon Link<br>\r\nMelee Zelda/Sheik, Brawl Zelda/Sheik, Puppet Zelda, and Tetra/Toon Zelda<br>\r\nFusion Samus and Samus<br>\r\nShadow Queen and Peach<br>\r\nMario, Doctor Mario, Luigi, Baby Mario, and Baby Luigi<br>\r\nPikachu and Pichu<br>\r\nMale and Female Ice Climbers<br>\r\nRob with anyone<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA playable character can be in more than one body because of the mistake, but an Assist Trophy character can't.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe characters will all be living in a mansion. The characters start out in the mansion, but you can make them go on an adventure anytime you want.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOther than what I said, you can do just about anything, but I will step in at times if I think someone has gone too far or ends the story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI'm going to give 300 Gift Points to anyone who makes a real chapter without breaking any of my rules.</td>",
