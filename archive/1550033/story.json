The bottom of her warn in jeans jeans getting wet as the rain continued, even worse was the fact that she only had flip-flops on, why did she thought it\u2019ll be a good evening to wear them over to her friends house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKnocking again the door opened only for Ashley to be on the other side dressed in purple sweeter to keep her warm also wearing a pair of white PJs to blink looking at the soaked Kaela who quickly made her way into the room, shivering as she did so. <br>\r\n\u201cHey Kay\u2026 why didn\u2019t you bring an umbrella or something?\u201d Ash asked looking at her who then glared back before sighing slightly, her white tank top still dry. <br>\r\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know it was going to rain did I?\u201d she replied hanging her coat up and then taking off her flip-flops still shivering slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaela blinked looking at Ashley\u2019s PJs before giving a sigh \u201cOh man I forgot my sleeping stuff\u2026 I\u2019m going to have to go back to my house to grab some\u201d she said looking at Ash who smiled and shrugged \u201cAh don\u2019t worry about it, you can wait till it stop raining and the four of us will head over to yours to grab them, okii?\u201d she asked happily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh shifted her hair from her face, she was trying something she\u2019d done before but liked the outcome the stile now was Blue bangs, red fringes at the front, natural at the top and back. <br>\r\n\u201cSo why you rushed me over in such a hurry? It was because of you rushing me that I forgot my PJs\u201d Kay asked before seeing the other shoes of two other people, one being some worn in trainers and the other pair some black boots.<br>\r\n\u201cWell I found an old game called \u2018Ijou-Yuugi\u2019 in the attic and I had the house to myself so I invited some of our friends over for a game of it, I mean why not?\u201d she asked smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking Kaela into the living room where the two other girls where, Kaela smile and waved at them, there was Hailey who had her dark blue short sleeve T shirt on with some yellow writing say something that Kaela could never quite make out because of her dirty-blonde hair getting in the way of it, like Ash Hailey had PJs, these ones however where pink with red dots on them. Sitting next to Hailey was Lacey, the oldest of the group she wore a big white shirt which hung over her black skirt, she hadn\u2019t put her PJs on just yet but she still had her fishnet leggings on because of how comfortable she felt in them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo after a chatting for a few minutes and talking the rules over which simple seemed to be, role the dice, more that many spaces forward and whoever gets to the end wins, the game mentions a reward but it wasn\u2019t sure what it was, the girls picked there peaces which was Red for Kaela, blue for Ashley, yellow for Hailey and green for Lacey. Finally they where wondering how to pick who\u2019ll go first.</span></div></div>",

Her blouse was beginning to strain and revealed some of her stomach. Her skirt became shorter and shorter to become a miniskirt. She stood up from all the pressure, she knew she was the tallest of them but she was even taller now. Lacey continued to inch up higher and higher, almost reaching the 7' mark. Her blouse was torn apart by her now enormous breast, which are now EE cup and her bra began to strain as well. Her \"miniskirt\" ripped off her body and her panties began to look like a thong. She finally stops growing at about 7'11\", more than two feet taller than she was before. Her bra was popped off by her now G cup boobs. What's left of her panties was barely a thong and was ready to be ripped at the slightest moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLacey could't believe how taller she was. She easily towered the rest of the girls and her boobs were the size of all of theirs combined. Lacey spoke,\"Wow, I didn't know I was going to be THIS big!\" The other girls was shocked how big Lacey is, they were even jealous. Hailey decides to grab the dice and roll her turn next.

Ow!\" She suddenly cried out, straightening up. \"My bra is.. ow it's digging into me! and so are my pants!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls looked her over in shock- her breasts were slowly begining to expand. Soft flesh overflowed the cups of her bra, and she let out a loud moan as she began swelling far past a 30C. As her breasts became firmer and fuller,  sticking out further from her body, her hips and butt began to inflate too. Her hips stretched out from a 32, becoming more and more sensual as she grew. Her ass had grown so that it was a supple and jiggilingly curvacious shape, looking as though she had stored two basketballs in her skirt. Her growth had become so wide that her formerly knee-length skirt barely reached mid thigh. She moaned louder and her bra snapped, her breasts falling, having become huge and arousing orbs that easily surpassed a 38EE.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my... god... look! I'm... I'm so hot now!\" She was gasping and flushed, but managed to maintain her composure. Her nipples stuck out against her shirt and she was visibly wet, since her skirt rode so high that, as she sat back, the others could see up it with ease...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley became incredibly jealous of her Kaela's new body, and thought she looked just like a sexy anime girl<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHailey thought it looked amazing but was terrified of it happening to her, mostly because she had a feeling it would hurt her for some reason... though Kaela seemed to enjoy it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLacey was happy with her body, and was actually dreading the thought of more growth, since she already had trouble keeping her clothes on during concerts. Even though she stayed away from crowds and mosh pits, it seemed that a guy only needed the slightest urge to grope her up...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, who makes the next move?</span></div></div>",

Caucasian, blonde hair.<br>\r\n\tCute, friendly, but a little vain. She\u2019s rather concerned with her appearance, though mostly due to a lack of self-confidence. She has a very conservative exterior, but has a considerable wild side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Ashley Hughes</b> \u2013 17 years old<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t5\u20192\u201d, 100 lbs, 32C. Japanese-Caucasian, black hair (Typically dyed.).<br>\r\n\tPlayful, cute, youthful but not immature. She\u2019s a great friend to those she likes, often helping out her friends and being a friendly person in general. She\u2019s a little punkish and loves anime, and can be a rather unorthodox person. She can be rather scary when angered, though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Hailey Anderson</b> \u2013 14 years old<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t5\u20194\u201d, 115 lbs, 34C. Caucasian, dirty-blonde hair.<br>\r\n\tNice, outgoing and rather popular, though she doesn\u2019t usually let it go to her head. She can be a tad na\u00efve and is rather active, playing a lot of sports. She is a shoe-in for the cheerleading squad, but she never bothered to sign up, believing they were too snobby for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Lacey McAllistair</b> \u2013 19 years old<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t5\u20197\u201d, 130 lbs, 34D. Caucasian, brown hair.<br>\r\n\tQuiet, shy, but outgoing when she needs to be. A rocker girl, she often acts the part, though she never looks hardcore into it. She can often be found wearing rocker girl clothes of sorts, though, such as boots and fishnets. She can seem rather foreboding and intimidating, but she is usually harmless.<br>\r\n</td>",
