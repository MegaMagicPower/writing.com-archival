Huh... my voice sounds like Tea!?\" she muttered, as something suddenly occurred to her; she was sitting down. That wouldn't be a cause for alarm, if everything didn't seem to be at the same height.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh-wha...?\" Yugi began, as she glanced around. Something was wrong, she was nowhere near that tall, then feels she two straps on her shoulders, and a purse around her shoulder as well. A bunch of pink and blue bracelets that Tea carries around both of her hands. She sets the purse down, then gulping she tentatively glanced downward. She finds everything Tea had on her including her chest. Just on case she went, to the women's restroom, but grabbed the purse first, then ignoring the window it has first on the wall before later, first she went to a stall and, closing the window there so, no pervert can see what she is doing and goes, back to what she doing here. She found herself staring that appears to be Tea's impressive chest and thinks, she is inside Tea's body. She then pokes her chest, then moans lightly, so that so no one can hear her. She makes sure their real by unbuttoning, the yellow collar light green, sleeveless shirt to see a blue bra covering her boobs, then she pulls her new hands, inside of them then rubs them and moans, again this time slightly louder, but not loud enough for people to hear. She then thinks \"Is it down their too?\". She confirms it by putting her hand where her groin area, but feels nothing, then she pokes it and moans, like she did to his boobs. Then she does the same thing, like she did to the sleeveless shirt, this time to the blue mini-skirt covered by a navy shorts with a light blue belt around it covering her blue panties she has on, she puts his hand inside the skirt and panties to find nothing, then she rubs her new groin area and moans again and same sound of voice she had when touching the boobs. Yugi then looks through the purse to find a mirror Tea always had on her, then after a while of searching she finds it, then opens the mini mirror up to her face to see that she has Tea's face on her, confirming she really is her, and feeling sad/perverted, that she masturbated on her body, in order to make sure that it wasn't her own body. Yugi starts to get up from the ground really fast, to put her clothes back on, before exiting the stall, and went to where, she was before. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WAAAH!!\" Yugi screamed as she jumped to his feet, once she was close to, where she was before... and promptly fell over, not used to her new center of balance, blue platform sandals she isn't used to have to walk in, and lands on her chest because of those two things. Yugi then feels pain on her new boobs, and puts her hand on them causing, them to bounce and jiggle on her causing, her to moan a little more loudly, but still not enough for people to hear her. She then spots her former body. It looks like her former body was still their and thinks Tea is inside of it. \" If she can't remember who, she is in two weeks I'm going, to carry on what she planned, but with some improvements added, and even if she remembers I am going, to have the card to swap us depending, on the situation slightly.\" She thought truly, but mostly wanted to, feel sex as a girl as well if she liked it as a girl, she would sell her body 2-4 times, a night depending on, how tired she(now he) is then. She then grabs the card into a good, hidden slot in the purse she had given to her(now he) before her, old body wakes up with the plan, she now intends to happen even, if it is wrong the purse's hidden slot he, did it himself for something to happen, that one thing he did seal, the deal of her new fate. She then sees Yugi(In Tea's body) body waked up and and says \"....\" What happens?</span></div></div>",

Huh... my voice sounds like Alexis!?\" she muttered, as something suddenly occurred to her; she was sitting down. That wouldn't be a cause for alarm, if it weren\u2019t based on the heavy weight she had on her chest. She didn't notice it, until she scratched it her chest, he felt something bounce and jiggle causing her to moan lightly enough for people to not hear her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh-wha...?\" Jaden began, as she glanced around. Something was wrong; she felt a heavy weight on her chest and feels two straps on both of shoulders. She then starts gulping, when she tentatively glanced down. She finds everything Alexis had on her including her chest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe found herself staring that appears to be Alexis's impressive chest and thinks; she is inside Alexis's body. Jaden then feels the urge to go pee pretty soon, so she started running there. 10 ft later, \"WAAAH!!\" Jaden screamed as she fell to her feet... and promptly fell over, not used to her new center of balance and blue slightly heel boots, since she isn't used to have to walk or run in heel boots before since girls do, and lands on her chest because of those two things. Jaden then feels pain on her new chest thinking because of the boobs, causing it to bounce and jiggle on her causing her to moan a little more loudly, but still not enough for people to hear her, luckily for her no one isn't at school yet including the teachers and the principal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then gets up again and feels like she is going to wet herself now. She starts run again, but much faster and goes into the girl's restroom, as if by instinct and heads straight into a stall and locking it. Jaden then starts to pull down the female Obelisk Blue skirt down and the blue panties, she had on and sits down on the toilet, and pees as a girl as if she has done it before. As soon as she is done she grabs toilet paper, to wipe off the water that came out of her new private area. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaden then decides to explore her new body and decides what\u2019s different. She then starts with her private area, by putting her new feminine hands with blue fingerless glove on their to feel nothing their, she now knows she has a vagina. She starts to rub her vagina making her moan, using a voice level that no one can hear. Jaden puts the panties and skirt back on. Jaden then starts poke her chest, knowing that she has differently have boobs, making her moan slightly as they bounce and jiggle around, using the same voice level as before. She then wants a closer look at the boobs, so she unfastens the top part of the female Obelisk Blue uniform, to see a blue bra matching the blue panties she has on. She then unfastens the bra as if it is 2nd nature to her; her boobs then come out 10 cm more seeing that she has D-cup breasts. She then rubs her boobs and making moans again, but a little louder, but still has the same voice level as the last two times. She then stops and puts back on the bra and the female Obelisk Blue uniform top part, she then unlocks the stall and leaves, but stops at glass restroom mirror to see that she Alexis's head on her instead of her own. Jaden then feels sad/perverted that she masturbated on Alexis's body, but she also felt happy/excited that she, now knows what a girl's body feels and looks like.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaden starts to run back to where she was before. 20 cm before she reached where she was before, \"WAAAH!!\" Jaden screamed as she fell to her feet... and promptly fell over again, still not used to her new center of balance, blue heel boots she isn't used to have to walk in, and lands on her chest because of those two things. Jaden then feels pain again on her new boobs and puts her hand on them causing them to bounce and jiggle on her causing her to moan a little more loudly, but still not enough for people to hear her. As soon as she gets to her feet, then spots her former body with Alexis in it. It looks like her old body is still there. Jaden then sees her old body and thinks Alexis is inside of it. She then sees her old body waking up. It then sees Jaden (In Alexis's body) and says \"....\" What happens?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

They could try to find out more about the card. But without really knowing much about, they wouldn't really know where to start. They could just take it easy for now, but that had its own problems. They were each other, so they would have to pretend to be one another for now. Meaning she would have to go back to his place and act like her in front of his parents while he stay to the garage and pretended to be her with Jack and Crow. She didn't really want to, but if they couldn't fix the problem today, it would eventually come to that whether she wanted to or not, so it might not be a bad idea to start sooner than later.</span></div></div>",

He then looks down to see chest to see something that wasn't there before Akiza's motorcylce suit that left part of her boobs exposed. He then thinks, he is inside Akiza's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he looks up again, he saw a confused Yusei, who examined himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeo asks Yusei hesitant \"Luna that you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Leo, you're that in Akiza's body?\" Luna asks back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah that's me. How did we end up here anyway, pointing to his body?\" Leo said.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"I have no idea. We were on our way home on our Duel Boards, and then there was a flash of light, and we ended up in the bodies of Yusei and Aki.\" Luna said. \"Wait a second, do you still have that card you found?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" Leo asked, but quickly caught on. Unfortunately, the card was not in his hand.  \"No. Its gone. But I don't remember letting go of it, and I had it before that flash...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna sighed. \"It figures you'd lose something important like that.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, its not my fault!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyway, lets not argue. We should really try to find out what's going on here.\" Luna took a good look around the room, but saw no one else there.  She then turned to the Duel Runners. \"Hey, we can use Yusei and Akiza Duel Runner to drive to the place where we found the card and see what happened with our bodies.\" she said as she walked over to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" Leo asked as he started to move over to them, but instead falls down, do to his new center of balance, then his chest bounces and jiggles making him moan for a split second. Then Leo gets up by pushing his hand against the floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Leo, you're OK?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah ... I'm fine. Let's go to the Duel Runner's to the place where we found the card.

Did you two finish your duel already?\" Yusei(In Luna's body) said softly, speaking in a gentle and innocent childlike tone, notably different than his usual tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo say this was a surreal experience for the twins was an understatement. Here they were in Yusei and Akiza bodies and then here was Yusei and Akiza, both of them in a situation that was similar, but they were acting like and believing that they really were them!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, yeah, we did. We were just in the area and saw you two and thought we'd stop and say hello.\" Luna(In Yusei's body) said. She had been hoping that Yusei and Akiza would be as aware of the situation as they were. The possibility that they might actually believe that they were really Luna and Leo hadn't occured to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven Leo(In Akiza's body) could tell what was going on in this situation, and he wasn't really sure about what to say. Then, he noticed something in one of Akiza's hands. It looked like a card. Then he thought of something. \"Ak-Uh, Leo, whats that in your hand?\" he asked, almost calling Akiza by her actual name instead of who she believed herself to be. He had almost forgotten that as far as anyone else knew, he was Akiza for now. Still, it was so weird to be calling her by his own name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean this?\" she said as she held it up, revealing that it was indeed a card. \"Its some really weird card I found a little while ago. Its blank, and only has its name, \"Body Swap,\" on it.\" she explained, confirming Leo's suspicions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? Would you mind if I took a look?\" Luna asked as she got off of Yusei's Duel Runner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure thing, Yusei.\" Akiza said as she handed it over to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna looked it over and Leo got off of Akiza's Duel Runner as well and looked over his sister's shoulder. It was definitely the card that he had picked up earlier, and what they could only think had caused this situation. \"Would you mind if I hold onto this for a while, uh, Leo? I'm curious about it.\" she asked, thinking to herself about how weird it was to call Akiza by her brother's name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, sure, no problem. You can keep it if you want. Oh, unless it turns out to be a super powerful card! Then I definitely want it back!\" Akiza said, early jumping a bit in her apparent excitement as she said the last part.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Sooo weird.' Luna thought to herself. \"Sure. I'll let you know if I find anything out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks a lot, Yusei!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyway, we should be getting home, Leo. We've got to go to our classes at the Academy tomorrow.\" Yusei said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, you're right. Anyway, see you guys tomorrow!\" Akiza said and waved as the two rode off on the Duel Boards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you find that to be as weird as I did?\" Leo asked as soon as the two were gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Definitely.\" Luna replied.</span></div></div>",

Something was wrong she thought; she felt a heavy weight on her chest and feels two straps on both of her arms, she reaches it to find out what they are, then she feels her chest moves around and bounces.

She screams as she then, spots her former body with Akiza in it. Her scream, woke up Akiza (In Leo's body), who immediately sat up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong?\" he said. As he took the sight before him in, Akiza recoiled back in surprise, when he saw his former slender, shapely body with Leo in it. \"Why am I seeing myself?\" he sputtered out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh-what is with my voice sounding weird?\" he said in surprise, before he finally looks down, at himself and his fears were confirmed, as he saw a young male body clad in Leo's clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will not be stuck, like this for the rest of my life.\" she said frantically, as she walked to her former body in panic. \u201cThat card did this\u201d she said in Akiza's voice with anger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just relax and lets figure this out, it's me Akiza.\" Akiza said, trying to remain calm and, trying to calm down the, former boy before him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeo breathed in deeply, and did as she apologizes.  \"This is my fault.

Yusei, of course, has not noticed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Something wrong, Akiza?\" Luna lets out a giggle.

This doesn't go unnoticed from Luna, though. \"What's with you, Leo?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing!\" Both Akiza and Leo shout a bit too loudly. Leo especially seems shook up, judging from her blush and her still staring at Yusei's abs.
