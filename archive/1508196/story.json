She was not wearing her usual light blue armor. Instead, she was wearing a strapless midnight-blue dress that reached her hooves. The dress had many brilliant dots all over. If one were to pay attention, if would look like she was wearing a piece of the night sky itself. It also was clearly designed for her, because it had open spaces in the back for her wings and her tail. She was also mearing a tiara on her head that was silver colored with five small jewels on it. Two on the left side, two on the right side and one on the center. The jewels that were at the tips of the tiara were pearls, the ones at the front were sapphires. All on them were star shaped. And completing the tiara, was a beatifully crescent-moon shaped onyx stone right on the center. Thee jewels had been clearly marved by professionals.

He looked to be on his late teens and was as tall as his mother. His hair was short with three spikes that looked like inverted waves and pointed to the left. His eyes were teal colored, like Nightmare's but with normal slits. His body was quite bulky and well built. His clothes were practically pure black. He was wearing a t-shirt, jeans pants, sneakers, biker gloves with silver steel spikes on the knuckles, sun-glasses that were hanging froom his t-shirt, a legitimate leather jacket that had silver steel spikes on the shoulders and a stetson hat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><span class=\"cblack\">\"I know this is a shocker to everyone.

Once he was fully formed, the King emerged from the mist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe king was wearing his costumary armor, which consisted on the legs, arms and torso protections, and a crown worthy of a king. He took a look at the crowd and shook his head while smiling maliciously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cmaroon\">\"Ahh. So many free people without a leader to guide them. No, no. This simply will not do. But worry not everyone! Once this concert is all over, I'll be glad to become your king as well, my soon to be loyal slaves!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nRather than cheering, the crowd simply stared at the king in fear and uncertainity. They liked him as a villain, but no way in tartarus did they wanted to be slaves!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Er... Thank you, your highness...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe king simply shrugged. <span class=\"cmaroon\">\"It's no problem.\"</span>, he said with a satisfied smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, well... Anyway, our next performer is none other than <b>DOCTOOOOR FACILIER</b> from the Disney version of The Princess and the Frog!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn odd and eerie, if rythmic music began playing. Everyone recognaized it as Facilier's trademark theme.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cgrey\"><i>\"Pom, Pom, Pom<br>\r\nPom, Pom, Pom<br>\r\nAre you ready?<br>\r\nAre you ready?\"</i></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, Facilier's voice was heard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cnavy\">\"Are you ready?

Once it dispersed, everyone could see, that there, in the middle of the stage, was Dr. Facilier himself! Surrounded by several VooDoo masks that varied sizes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cnavy\">\"Hello everyone! What a nice audience we have tonight!</span>\", he said, while bowing and courtesing with his top hat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time, the crowd did cheered. Much to Sombras annoyance. He didn't liked one bit that this wizard wannabe was stealing <i>his</i> spotlight <i>AND</i> the attention and affection of his soon to be slaves!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome Mr. Facilier.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cnavy\">\"Oh please.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Note: This chapter serves to provide background story and has nothing to do with the previous times in which Twilight has appeared. You could say she's from an alternative universe. Also, her name changed. Now she's called Twilight Eris Starlight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n She replaces Tatsumi as Esdeath's love interest. Unlike Tatsumi, Twilight does love Esdeath. More than she'd admit to the other Night Raid members. Also, their past is different. Twilight and Esdeath met in her village (originally Tatsumi's) when they were children, Esdeath's father being good friends with the Village's Chief, who was Twilight's grandfather. They used to playtogether and were firmly joined to the hip, thus it was dificult to see one without the other whenever she and her father visited the village or whenever Twilight and the Chief visited Easdeath's tribe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis friendship between them soon turned into something more. A simple crush at first, then into love. Tough neither had found the nerve to confess to the other so far.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n However, soon the time came to part when Esdeath's father had to leave and go to the Empire's Capital looking for work. And of course he would take his daughter with him. By this time, Twilight was 13 and Esdeath was 16.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Twilight had wanted for Esdeath to stay with her, having heard horrible things about the Empire and it's corruption and she also had a terrible feeling in her heart that she couldn't explain. Esdeath however ignored Twilight's warning, thinking her friend, and secret love, was simply being paranoid and silly. This lead to a fallout between them, and parting ways in, less than favorable circumstances.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Now, 5 years later, Easeath is the greatest General the Empire has ever had and one of the strongest persons in all of the Empire, while Twilight is part of the group of assassins known as Night Raid, who work in tandem with The Revolutionary Army.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Twilight had entered a \"tournament\", tough it was more of a circus filled with weaklings in her opinion. Night Raid's plan having been that she would win the tournament to draw the attention of the Empire's General, who wuld be the judge on the tournament, and infiltrate in the army as a spy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The plan worked, too well. She had drawn the attention of someone alright. That person being no other than General Esdeath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n As soon as they laid eyes on each other, they froze. Here they were, after so many years, reunited once more. Esdeath had been overjoyed at seeing her beloved again and at having a chance to patch things up from their last meeting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Twilight was feeling too many emotions at the same time to simply focus on one. She was feeling in extasis at meeting her mate again, saddened at seeing her wearing the colors of the wretched Empire, shocked at Esdeath being a General, and the Empire's finest at thet, and a deep, burning fury. Not at Esdeath, oh no. She was furious with the other Night Raid members, especially Najeenda!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n During one night, the members of Night Raid had gathered and, as a form of bonding, it had been proposed that they shared their reasons for fighting and what they wished to reveal of their backgrounds. Twilight had told them about her and Esdeath's shared childhood, just as the others had told her something about themselves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n A few days later, Najeenda had given Leone, Lubock and herself this mission. There was simply no way that Najeenda did not know that Esdeath was the General and that she would be atending the torunament! That bitch <i>knew</i>, and she still sent her to the fray and to the very likely scenario in which she would have to fight her beloved Esdeath!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n So yes, she was feeling enraged. Murderous even! She had fully intended to have a, talk, with Najeenda once she returned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Her toughts had been brought to a halt when she heard the distinct *clinck* of a collar and the rustling of a thin chain. Looking down, she saw that her beloved had collared her and, from the look in her eyes, intended to take Twilight with herself to somewhere private, likely her bedchambers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Twilight looked at her with sad, sorrowful eyes, shook her head and teleported away, confusing everyone in the arena and leaving a shocked and distraught Esdeath behind. However, Esdeath wasn't the Empire's finest for nothing. She immediately ordered her best infiltration agent, Kurome, to track and follow Twilight magical signature. However, she also gave very specific orders that Twilight was not to be harmed, or there would be serious consequences. Kurome nodded and departed. Her superhuman speed allowing her to find Twilight and co. easily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Once she found her quarry, Kurome noticed that the mare looked both, very saddened and, if she was reading the fierce and aggressive aura around the pony correctly, furiously murderous. She entered along with her quarry, becoming slightly shocked when she saw her older sister, Akame, and stuck to the ceilings, as hardly enyone ever looked up. While she did that, she was recording everything that happened, both as her report to Esdeath-sama and for any weakness she could find on her sister. And she also constantly checked her ear-piece, which was a comunicator linked directly to those of the other Jaegers, including Esdeath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Kurome wasn't surprised when everyone gave the mare wide berth, as anyone could tell she wasn't to be messed with at the moment, tough the blonde woman and the green haired boy looked like they want to question her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Kurome followed Twilight until they reached an office where they found Najeenda. Twilight requested that they be left alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n As soon as the door closed and it was clear that no one was eavesdropping, Twilight begun t oquestion, read interrogate, Najeenda. Calmly and coldly at first. But gradually becoming more furiorus with each answer Najeenda gave. However, Twilight's rage exploded when Najeenda uttered the words \"for the greater good\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n At that point, Twilight saw red. She used her magic to slam Najeenda to the wall and proceeded to beat her black and blue, the door refusing to open due to Twilight having sealed it shut with her magic. Kurome, and later on Esdeathl, would admit to herself that she was impressed with both, the techinques and the brutality displayed by the ponian.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Once Twilight was moderately tired, she got off silver haired woman and looked at her handiwork, having left Najeenda as a barely recognizable, and barely alive, lump of flesh covered in cuts, lumps, bruises and other kinds of physical injuries, as likely traumatized.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The mare unlocked the door, at which point the other Night Raid members barged into the office, having heard the commotion. Once they saw Najeenda's state, they were fully prepared to berate their, at the moment tentative, comrade. However, once they saw the glare on Twilight's face, they flinched and refrained from speaking. That is, until Twilight demanded to know if they were aware of the details of their mission.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n At first, all of them played the confused card, until the heard the mare growl the way n impatient predator would. Then, slowly, some raised their hands, those being Leone, Lubock and Mine. Bulat, Scheele, Chelsea and Akane still had no idea of what was going on. Akane asked Twilight what had her in her current state.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Once Twilight had explained, Akane and the others all glared at those who knew of their plan. They knew this was a War against the Empire. However, it was one thing to go against the enemy, and another completely to betray the trust of a comrade and use their personal information to their own gain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The worst part was that, while Leone looked guilty and apologetic, Lubock looke completely unrepentant and Mine looked liked she was fruirous at being berated and glared at, believing that what she and the others did was completely fine to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Mine was about to speak, probably to say something hurtful as usual. However, Twilight levitated her and Lubock and slammed them against the cavern's wall, the sound of stone and bones breaking echoing in the otherwise silent corridors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The ponian turned and walke away to her room, with no one following, knowing that right now she needed to be alone. The only one who followed her was Kurome, due to her mission.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n As soon as her quarry had closed the door to her room and reached her bed, the ponian sat down heavily on the bed, clearly exausted from the days' events, and, to Kurome's surprise, broke down in tears, holding her face between her hands, her back hunched and ears drooped to their lowest. She didn't wailed, Kurome didn't think it was necessary. Her sobs made what she was feeling perfectly clear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n All of a sudden, Kurome could swear she was hearing music, but there was no recorder on any other mechanism playing music anywhere!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Her thoughts were interrupeted when her quarry started singing, apparently being able to hear the music as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n And while Twilight sang, she unknowingly was singing the same song and at the same time as Esdeath...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Now dear reader, what was that song?)</span></div></div>",

She stares longingly at the window for a few minutes, then opens the window and leaps out of it, intending on being away from Night Raid for the time being, and maybe for good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Kurome waitnfor a few seconds, then follows the mare. As much as she'd like to settle things with her sister, orders were orders. And her's were to follow and observe the mare for as long as Esdeath-sama said so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Still, from what she had seen and heard, it was clear the mare was in love with her leader. And if she read her leader's body language correctly, plus her tone on her oders regarding the mare in question and the heavy emphasis on keeping the mare safe, then it was likely that her leader had fallen for the ponian.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Kurome herself wouldn't mind dating the mare. She certainly was beautiful and powerful. And she also had a secret attraction towards Esdeath-sama. If she lpayed her cards right, maybe all three of them could become mates, with Seiryu being a possible addition. Who knows?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n But for the time being, she'd settle on strictly following her orders, until an opportunity presented itself...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Note: Thsi is just a drabble.

Ask away.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I, and I'm sure that not only everybody here, but also the people back at home are very curious as to why you have chosen this song. So, what would be the reason?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblack\">\"Yes. We would like to know as well!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\"Well, when I first saw Nightmare Moon on the prefecture back at Ponyville, I thought she was quite sexy. But, even before that, when I first read the story of <i>\"The Mare in the Moon\"</i> to be precise, I already had developed a crush on her.\"</span>, confessed Twilight, blushing a deep shade of red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cnavy\">\"As for me, I addmit I had been observing Twilight from afar. Even when I was on the Moon, I already had my eyes on her. Tough I was very careful to hide it from Luna. And so, after my defeat, Twilight and myself arranged for me to live on her home until I was recovered. Of course, I didn't had evil intentions anymore, thanks to the Elements of Harmony.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\"So, even tough she couldn't leave the library, we spent our nights together and became a couple. Of course, even after revealing her to Princess Celestia and everypony else, we kept our relationship a secret. However, we became tired of hiding, and decided to use this performance as a chance to announce our relationship proudly to the world!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryones jaws were on the floor, by now. No one could believe it! Especially the royal Pony Sisters! Minly Princess Celestia! Her precious student in a relationship with the pony that had once attempted to overthrow her and, worse, had posessed her beloved little sister! Still, for one this wasn't the right moment to talk about it. So she would wait until they were back in Equestria.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that was certainly unexpected. But anyway! We're here to sing and have fun! Not to judge! Now, without any further delay! You're majesties, would you kindly?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cnavy\">\"Sure thing!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\"Let's do it!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cindigo\">\"Yeah!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMusic starts playing:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cnavy\">Once in a lifetime means there's no second chance<br>\r\nSo i believe that you and me should grab it while we can</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">Make it last forever<br>\r\nAnd never give it back</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cnavy\">It's our turn and i'm lovin where we're at</span><br>\r\n<span class=\"cplum\">Becasue this moment's really all we have</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cnavy\">Everyday of our lives</span><br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">Wanna find you there, wanna hold on tight</span> <br>\r\n<span class=\"cnavy\">Gotta run</span><br>\r\n<span class=\"cplum\">While we're young </span><br>\r\n<span class=\"cplum\">And keep the faith</span><br>\r\n<span class=\"cnavy\">Everyday</span> <span class=\"cplum\">from right now</span><br>\r\n<span class=\"cplum\">Gonna use our voices and scream out loud</span><br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">Take my hand</span><br>\r\n<span class=\"cnavy\">Toghether we will celebrate</span> <span class=\"cviolet\">(Celebrate)</span><br>\r\n<span class=\"cplum\">Oh, everyday!!!</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">They say that you should follow</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cnavy\">And chase down what you dream</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">But if you get lost and lose yourself</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cnavy\">What does it really mean?</span> <span class=\"cviolet\">(Ho o o oh)</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">No matter where we go</span> <span class=\"cnavy\">(Oh yeah!)</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cnavy\">It starts from where we are!</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\"> There's more to life</span> <span class=\"cplum\">when we listen to our hearts</span><br>\r\n<span class=\"cplum\">And because of you i've got the strength to start!

Now, the government enforced a mandate that banned private restrooms in favor of public amenities. However, in order to use them, one must first pay the fee. If you refuse-well, who am I kidding? You'd be a fool to fight with the ninja running these toilets. One of these toilets was being run by Team Kakashi members Naruto and Sakura, Public Amenity #9. It is at this said amenity that one of the poor is begging for a free pee. This citizen was Konohamaru, the third Hokage's grandson.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, Sakura! Just this once! I'll pay you back tomorrow!\" Konohamaru pleaded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's what you said yesterday,\" Sakura replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mon, Naruto! Reason with the woman!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto sighed and turned to Sakura.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sakura, why does it matter if he pays or not?\" Naruto inquired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It doesn't!

Gloves of red leather with wide cuffs stretching half way up his forearms were matched by a world war one era leather aviator\u2019s helmet, complete with white goggles worn high up on the forehead.  The protruding chin was balanced by an equally protruding nose.  His thin lips were drawn back in a wide smile, showing of a set of perfectly even teeth while the narrow beady eyes looked at the audience in a calculating, almost predatory manor. As he sized up the assembled throng he used the finger and thumb of one hand to twist and curled the end of his pencil thin handlebar moustache.  His first words were directed not at the waiting assembly, who were not listening in any case, but at his companion; a dog of indeterminable lineage that walked beside him, clad also in an aviator\u2019s helmet and wearing a red scarf.  \u201cWell Muttley\u201d, the man sneered confidently, \u201cAccording to whatever rules they they have in this place, all we need to do is sing one little song and we\u2019re free to leave.  Then we can get back to catching that insufferable little pigeon for the General.\u201d  The only response from the dog was a sort of rasping laugh.  <br>\r\nBefore anything further was said there was a bright flash from the right hand side of the stage, and in the dark afterglow the audience could make out the shape of a slim cloaked woman.  As she walked into the spotlights they could see she was dressed in a dark purple sleeveless body suit.  What most in the audience had, at first, assumed to be a cape, was revealed instead to be long light brown hair that reached all the way down to the tops of her dark purple ankle boots.  <br>\r\nWalking over to where the other two stood in the center of the stage she peered critically through the yellow lens of her sunglasses at them.  I\"It looks,\" she said in a soft voice, \"as though this song is for three parts.  Mind if I join you?\"<br>\r\n\u201cNot at all my dear,\u201d spoke the man in a smooth voice, \"not at all.  Muttley and I would be delighted to have you join us, isn\u2019t that right, Muttley?\u201d<br>\r\nWhat Muttley said in response was an un-intelligible mutter, but the man ignored this as he continued. \u201cI don\u2019t believe we\u2019ve been properly introduced my dear. I am Dick Dastardly, and my diminutive cohort here is known as Muttley.\u201d  <br>\r\n\u201cDastardly and Muttley, how interesting.. \" The woman paused for a moment, evidently thinking, then spoke \u201cYou may call me Darcy\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cDarcy.\u201d Repeated Dastardly, clicking his heels and inclining his head in a formal greeting. \u201cWe are pleased to make your acquaintance.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cAnd I, yours. Would you by chance be any relation to Dastardly and Muttley of the famous Vulture Squadron?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cOne and the same, my dear,\u201d Dastardly smiled \u201cOne and the same.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYea!\u201d muttered Muttley \u201cRick Rasterdly\u201d<br>\r\nDastardly surreptitiously aimed a kick at Muttley, then continued. \u201cI take it you have heard of us?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cOf course. No other squadron can boast of such an impressive record. I believe you shot down something like one ship, one train. a gas station, 182 aeroplanes, and 3 balloons!<br>\r\n\u201cAh ah ah,\u201d said Dastardly, waving a correcting finger, \u201ctwo balloons and a Zeppelin!\u201d<br>\r\nAny further conversation was interrupted by the hiss of enormous speakers as somewhere back stage a jukebox came to life.  The three stared about the stage for some clue on what was to happen next, then spotted a ribbon of words hovering in mid air directly in front of them.<br>\r\nAfter a glance at each other, Darcy and Dastardly begin to sing along to the words, while Muttley mutters along in tune.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>DASTARDLY, DARCY, AND MUTTLEY</b><br>\r\n<i>\"Kidnap Mr. Sandy Claws\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>DASTARDLY</b><br>\r\n<i>\"I wanna do it\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>MUTTLEY</b><br>\r\n<i>\u201dyeah-yeah-yeah...\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>DARCY</b><br>\r\n<i>\"Jack said we should work together<br>\r\nThree of a kind\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>DASTARDLY, DARCY, AND MUTTLEY</b><br>\r\n<i>\"Birds of a feather<br>\r\nNow and forever<br>\r\nWheeee<br>\r\nLa, la, la, la, la<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKidnap the Sandy Claws, lock him up real tight<br>\r\nThrow away the key and then<br>\r\nTurn off all the lights\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>DARCY</b><br>\r\n<i>\"First, we're going to set some bait<br>\r\nInside a nasty trap and wait<br>\r\nWhen he comes a-sniffing we will<br>\r\nSnap the trap and close the gate\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>DASTARDLY</b><br>\r\n<i>\"Wait!

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>  The crowd patiently paid absolutely no attention what so ever to the short line of people winding their way across the stage.  To say they looked oddly out of place would be an un-necessarily re-iteration of the obvious.  Every one was out of place in this place, and these four were no exception.<br>\r\n  Of the tall and slightly built dark haired man at the front of the line the kindest thing you could say was that his nose was striking.  If you were un-kind, as most people turned out to be, you might point out that it resembled the beak of a large bird, possible an ostrich or a turkey.  His hair was also striking, being the closest thing to a black pile of spray painted straw most people would hope to encounter.<br>\r\n  The plain white T-shirt that he wore, as well as the jeans they were tucked into, contained several small rips, tears, and dirt smudges.  Not artistically placed ones designed to enhance an artificial image of handsome ruggedness, but the good honest wear experienced by a good honest hard working shirt worn by a good honest hard working man, who just may have happened to have fallen down a cliff fairly recently.<br>\r\n  His boots too bore unmistakable signs of hard use;  Scuffs and scrapes, and the rounding of the heels that mark boots well used; yet they were also well polished and carefully cared for.  Instead of a coat he was wearing a button-less vest of grey leather.  At odds with the basic normality of the rest of his clothing were the  short black leather bracers he wore around each wrist.  These were decorated with small, silver coloured conical studs, a theme that was continued on his belt, as well as on the thin choker collar he wore around his thin neck. <br>\r\n  He could not have been said to be leading the group, even though he was at the head of the line; it was more like he had wandered into the spotlight and of the rest of the group had followed out of nervous curiosity.    <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  The girl that followed most closely behind him was clothed inappropriately in a short pink dress, with soft boots of an impractical flower pedal design on her feet. A small pink conical cap with a flopped over tip covered the top of her head.  Her outfit suggested that someone had been trying to capture the look of a full sized version of Tinker Bell, but had gotten cold feet at the last moment about the position of the hemline and just how much thigh would be showing.  Dirt smudges and small tears whispered that, here too, was a person who walked too close to cliff edges. She also wore a black leather choker with silver studs that matched the one on the dark haired man, although you could just barely make it out under the long dark hair spilling over her shoulders.  Her pretty face had the high cheek bones and long nose reminiscent of the American Apache Indian, although the effect was spoiled somewhat by the green colouration of her skin.<br>\r\n  The furtive way she followed suggested that, although she absolutely did not mistake the two of them for a couple, she wasn\u2019t about to let the man with dark hair get too far out in front.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  The third member of the little group was close to a direct opposite of the dark haired man.  To say he was a bit chubby would be like calling the ocean a bit damp.  His girth truly looked to exceed his 5 foot 3 inch stature, and he not so much as walked as he wobbled back and forth, gradually moving forward.  He was dressed in loud slacks of polyester, with a matching sports jacket whose colour scheme was reminiscent of neon signage.  As if the plot needed more stereotyping his face wore the warm wide grin of a man who was constantly jolly.  One who had, if not a new joke every day, at least an old one with a great punch line.  And if it wasn\u2019t a great punch line he would tell it like it was anyway.  Here was the man your uncle Buck was trying to be every Christmas.  You knew instinctively that this was a man on who you could count to liven up a cocktail party, who would be guaranteed to cheer you up, and from whom you would never, ever buy anything with the word pre-owned in the title.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  The fourth member of the group was a burly gentleman dressed in canvas trousers and beige cable-knit sweater. The broad jaw and piercing blue eyes whispered of a Scandinavian heritage. The woolen toque covering his head said that if any of the group was to call themselves a sailor, this would be the one.  The frayed rope belt echoed the sentiment. The man carried himself with a confidence that spoke loudly \u2018If you\u2019re organizing a side for rugby,  here\u2019s your first pick.\u2019.  The salt stains on his boots told of recent sea fairing experience. The duffle bag slung casually over the shoulder fairly shouted \u2018We\u2019re still keeping with the sailor theme here\u2019!<br>\r\n  You began to wonder if he was actually allowed to say any words for himself<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  At center stage the burly blond dropped his carry bag and grinned at the crowd as the others clustered around.  \u201cNow\u201d his voice boomed, \u201cWe Sing!\u201d<br>\r\n  At this he grabbed the closest mike and began at the top of his voice\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce we had a company<br>\r\n\u2018Til we all began to Disagree<br>\r\nThen John sued Paul, Paul sued Bob, and Bob us three,<br>\r\nIt\u2019s getting so confused, I think I just sued me!<br>\r\nOh, I\u2019ve been served with a yellow subpoena!<br>\r\nA yellow subpoena, a yellow subpoena\u2026<br>\r\nRealizing that nobody else had joined in, he trailed off as he looked around at the astonished blank stares from the rest of the group.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d he demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s not the way it goes\u201d complained the fat man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou speak from reading words.  Sven now, Sven speaks from experience!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dark haired man spoke up \u201cSven speaks from reading back issues of Heavy Metal.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment, the big Scandinavian glowered at him, then broke into a grin \u201cOK Mark, you got me.  I just happen to like Kierkegaard\u2019s lyrics better McCartney\u2019s.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman broke in with \u201cCan we just get this over with?  I\u2019ve got a date with a warm bath and I\u2019m way overdue.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cShall we try this again?\u201d queried the man addressed as Mark<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fat man spoke up \u201cFirst let me tell you about the two Irish guys who were in this pub.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s not a song.\u201d Countered the woman<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot at the start, no, but later after they get a few drinks on\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe\u2019re supposed to sing Yellow Submarine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhich one?  The one from \u2018Revolver\u2019 or the one off the B side of Elanor Rigby?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDoes it matter?\u201d asked the woman in an exasperated tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot at all. They\u2019re both the same.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen why did you bring it up?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCause I know a great revolver joke.  Seems this guy finds a magic bottle on the beach\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCan\u2019t we just sing already?\u201d the woman interrupted, rolling her eyes.  She turned and said aside to Mark \u201cNext time I have to pull you from the brink of certain death, can we leave Fred at home?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey\u201d retorted Mark \u201cIt wasn\u2019t my idea to bring him along.\u201d  After a pause he continued \u201cCome to think of it, it never is!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know,\u201d the woman said, \u201cIt just makes me feel better to say it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot to be deterred, the fat man spoke up again \u201cSo this Irish guy walks out of a bar!\u201d<br>\r\nAt the collective groan he looked around at the faces of his companions.  \u201cWhat? It could happen!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSven grinned at his companions again, then raised the mike once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the town where I was born <br>\r\nLived a man who sailed to sea <br>\r\nAnd he told us of his life <br>\r\nIn the land of submarines <br>\r\nSo we sailed up to the sun <br>\r\nTill we found a sea of green <br>\r\nAnd we lived beneath the waves <br>\r\nin our yellow submarine <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest joined in the chorus:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe all live in a yellow submarine <br>\r\nYellow submarine, yellow submarine <br>\r\nWe all live in a yellow submarine <br>\r\nYellow submarine, yellow submarine <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark:<br>\r\nAnd our friends are all aboard <br>\r\nMany more of them live next door <br>\r\nAnd the band begins to play <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll:<br>\r\nWe all live in a yellow submarine <br>\r\nYellow submarine, yellow submarine <br>\r\nWe all live in a yellow submarine <br>\r\nYellow submarine, yellow submarine <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFred (speaking into his hand to give a hollow echo like effect)<br>\r\nThe captain says you can do it, Mr Boatswain, you can do it<br>\r\nOh, Sgt. Of course I love you<br>\r\nBut for god\u2019s sake take your hand off the intercom button.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark:<br>\r\nWhat?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFred: <br>\r\nAs we live a life of ease <br>\r\nEvery one of us has all we need<br>\r\nSky of blue and a pint of green <br>\r\nIn our yellow submarine <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll<br>\r\nWe all live in a yellow submarine <br>\r\nYellow submarine, yellow submarine <br>\r\nWe all live in a yellow submarine <br>\r\nYellow submarine, yellow submarine <br>\r\nWe all live in a yellow submarine <br>\r\nYellow submarine, yellow submarine<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey ended the performance to a smattering of applause.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank You, Thank you\u201d Fred bowed at the audience, \u201cHey, have you heard the one about the two nuns, the peanuts, and the cocktail dress?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seemed that this time the sparkling lights moved faster than usual.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The lights come up low, softly illuminating a room set in the center stage.<br>\r\nAll the rest is dark, focusing your attention on the weak pool of light. The ceiling of the room is curved, the walls worked into the support ribs and bulkheads that make up the hull of a Galaxy Class Starship. A low cabinet, enclosing some vital piece of equipment, juts into the room. An access hatch and status panel, one light clearly blinking, could be seen at one end of the cabinet. On top a partial wall, half solid and half hexagon mesh, extended upward, dividing the room into two separate areas. The first was obviously a work space, containing as it did a triangular shaped desk and an odd shaped computer. The second area was just as obviously intended for sleeping, with a mattress set onto a raised platform. <br>\r\n  Further proof of the area\u2019s function was provided by the prone figure the mattress was supporting, one arm draped across the eyes in an attempt to block what little of the dim light spilled through the mesh.<br>\r\n   In direct defiance of normal sleeping customs the figure lay on top of any bedding the mattress may have been covered with. In further defiance of sleeping traditions the figure was still fully dressed; Gold command tunic, black trousers, and, adding insult to the already injured rules of what to wear while sleeping, black uniform boots. <br>\r\n  In defense of these transgressions, the reclining figure reveals itself to not, as was originally thought, be sleeping. The figure twitches and stirs restlessly, and after a few minutes levers itself upright, swinging its legs off the side, and sit up on the edge of the bed.  Tiredly rubbing its face with both hands, the figure looks around the room, then begins, somewhat over dramatically, to speak.<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n\u201cIt's been a,, hard day's night, andI'vebeen,, Working,, like a dog\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs it speaks, the figure gets to its feet, crossing the room to touch a wall panel, causing the lights to brighten. Wincing at the increased illumination, the figures eyes blink rapidly, as if adjusting to the increased light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt'sbeena,, HARD! day's,, night, And I Should!

When I! gethometoyou I,, findthethings that, YOU, do<br>\r\nWill make,, ME,, feelalright\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, the figure crosses the room into the work area and sits behind the desk, resting its head on its hands with its elbows on the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know, I work,, all day, to get,, Shoreleave,, tobuyyouthings\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe figure looks at the screen of the computer<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd it's worth it,, just.

After a few moments a hand is raised, waiting for the applause to die down.<br>\r\nOnce the applause had dropped to a level where it could be heard clearly the figure spoke. \u201cWith a little practice,, in dramatically ACCENTUATING certain,, words, andpausing,, in,, strange,, placeswhenyou,, speak,, Then,, you too,, can,,TALK,, likewilliamshatner,, Every,, March 22nd!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lights dimmed, and the figure, desk, bed and entire set disappeared in sparkling lights. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She had long dark purple hair, pupil-less lavender coloured eyes and wore a black tank top under a purple and tan jacket, blue trousers, black sandals and a metal headband with a leaf on it.  But what was particularly noticeable about her was the look of utter astonishment she had at that moment.  \"Wha-, but I\" she said, as she did not consider herself to be much of a singer and wasn't sure if she wanted to be on stage at that moment.  But then she thought about how much the song fitted her feelings for a certain knuckle head ninja, and decided to sing any way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I sense that there's something in the wind<br>\r\nThat feels like tragedy's at hand.<br>\r\nand though I would like to stand by him,<br>\r\nCan't shake this feeling that I have.<br>\r\nThe worst is just around the bend, <br>\r\nBut does he notice my feelings for him?<br>\r\nAnd will he see how much he means to me?<br>\r\nI think it's not too be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat will be come of my dear friend?<br>\r\nWhere will his actions lead us then?<br>\r\nAlthough I'd like to join the crowd, in their enthusiastic cloud?<br>\r\nTry as I may, it doesn't last.<br>\r\nAnd will we ever end up together?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo, I think not.<br>\r\nIt's never to become, for I am not the one.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, the song ended.

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">You might have already guessed the point of this story.  For some reason unknown to....well, EVERYONE, a load of fictional characters are being made to sing random songs.  It is your job to decide what songs are going to be sung, who are going to sing them and why the songs are being sung.  This was inspired by a combination of reading The-Poisoned-Doughnut-Of-Doom's story <b><i> Doughnut's Done It Again </i></b> on FanFiction.Net and listening to various songs late at night.  I would like to mention a few rules before we begin:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*No killing off anyone:  A character can go on holiday for a little bit, and sure they get injured, but NO DEATH!!!!<br>\r\n*No drugs.<br>\r\n*Try not to go overboard on swearing when the characters have stopped singing.  If there is swearing within the actual song, then go ahead.  Otherwise, no way.<br>\r\n*No chapters that just say \"They start singing, {{i}insert song lyrics here{{/i} and they stop singing.<br>\r\n*Try to make the \"story lines\" end at 200 chapters.<br>\r\n<b>And finally </b><br>\r\n*Add whatever songs/characters you want to add.  You are definetly going to see plenty of \"You Decide\" choices, So you might as well let your imaginations run wild.  BUT, do not take this as an excuse to do rubbish chapters involving the Jonas Brothers or some other crap!.  Only fictional characters can sing in this story (you can use some of your own characters though).  If i find any real person fan fiction, you will have a warning <br>\r\nApart from that, feel free to add and enjoy.</td>",
