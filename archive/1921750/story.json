All day the sky was clear, it had been a beautiful day. Danial walked down the street from the gym where he just had an extensive workout session. The pump made him feel so good, and it showed in every calculated move he took. He even decided to take the detour through the park just to strike some appearances for the jogging folk. His dorm is now only a few blocks away and Danial is already planning his evening in his head.First he would take a quick protein rich meal, followed by some posing in front of the mirror, and probably sleep in early. Tomorrow will be an ea- BLAM!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanial felt something soft bounce of his stomach. Something soft and jiggly. Danial could hear hard thuds of  things hitting the street and he could swear he heard glass break. But when Danial looked around, nothing was there. He was confused, whatever it was it was gone... or never existed. But he has a meal to get to, so he felt he should get going again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! Wa- watch where you are going.\" Said a high almost squealing voice. Danial had only taken two steps. Surprised he turned around and there he saw a man who Danial would describe it as a blob. Short, very fat, almost spherical in that regard, and sweat beads all over his face. Danial's bully inside of him triggered, and the unfortunate target was that man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. You should have watched. You little fat shit.\" Danial blurted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man conjured an uncomfortable smile, with a glint of surprise in his eyes and said: \"My a-apologies, it was indeed my fault.\" He waddled as fast as he could to examine the damage on his suitcases before turning around to Danial again. \"You couldn't see me as I was under the-the influence of an invisibility spell. I guess I lost fo-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A spell!\" Danial interrupted the man with a mocking voice. Normally Danial would have walked away. But he couldn't stop, this was getting to good for him as he took another look at the man and saw everything about him scream 'loser' and 'nerd'. Robes he saw these 'losers' wear on Halloween and the man even had a wand to complete the deal. \"It isn't even Halloween and you are dressed like that. Your not just a fat little shit. You are a fat sad little nerd, I bet you have never seen a pussy at all, have you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man smile faded and Danial gloated in the change. \"I- I apologized. You do not have to be rude like that. So lets forget this and be on o-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do whatever I want. And right now I am going to give you a lesson. Look at me. I can get every lady I want. You are a fat little cunt, a nerd and I bet a virgin as well. And you are, 30, 40 years old?\" The man tried to interrupt Danial, but failed to even start the first stutter of a sentence. Danial continued: \"Get a grip on reality. Go to the gym. Loose that fat. In life I am the winner, and you are the fat little virgin of a loser you are.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanial turned around and planned to walk away with the most gratifying strut he could conjure. But -<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop it right there!\" Said the man with a voice of confidence and anger. \"My name is Phyllis Trottenburg, wizard of the King's Academy. I endured your insults. But I will not accept someone calling me a loser!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhyllis pulled out his wand and pointed at Danial. Danial tried to conjure a laugh at this silly display. But before he could open his mouth, Danial felt the world fall away. Flowers of darkness bloomed on the edge of his vision as he felt some unknown force pushing on his chest, slowly tilting him backwards, slowly tumbling him over. Time slowed down to a crawl, and the light of the sun didn't seem to reach Danial anymore. Odd symbols form on the peripheral of Danial's vision, burning inside the darkness. The force on Danial already pushed him as much backwards where Danial wanted to correct his stance, but Danial's body didn't respond to any of his minds commands. More and more signs and symbols appear and start to cling together forming lines and circles. The force pushed Danial almost to the point where normally anyone would fall flat on his back. However, it didn't happen. No, the lines of signs started to weave together forming chains with the circles and started to bury themselves into Danial. Danial could hear the rattling of metal chains as this all happened. The force had Danial now almost flat, leaving Danial with a sensation of levitation. More rattling, a strain building up. then a lock fell into place...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the observer Danial would simply stopped mid-sentence, took one step backwards and blinked a few times. Danial's mind stowed the experience he just had away deep inside his subconscious as it wasn't able to process into something sensible. Only seconds passed when Danial reached for his stomach and his face turned green.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am suddenly not feeling so well.\" Jake mumbled, trying to hold in the expensive shake he took at the gym earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the mean time Phyllis straightened himself, and said in the most grand voice he could muster: \"You have been cu-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever...\" Danial interrupted Phyllis, \"It must be the shake... bad shake. Ugh.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhyllis tried again: \"You will know the mea-\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just get out of my way, too much shake!\" interrupted Danial Phyllis while Danial shoved Phyllis aside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhyllis tried to stop Danial one more time when Danial passed him, but Phyllis gave up. Whatever spine he just had was gone again. But Phyllis knew he would get the last laugh out of this and he only mumbled: \"You, prick, will know the meaning of 'too much' soon enough.\", before moving through the door while he slowly faded away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf what shall Danial know the meaning of \"too much\"?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Danial barged through the front door and went straight down the hallway into the common bathroom. Danial was greeted with the filth of a poorly kept toilet and the foul odor of last nights party didn't help soothe his stomach. However, Danial was more concerned to get it all out than too keep it all in at that point. No matter how expensive that shake was. He just wanted to feel better already. He coughed, he rasped his throat, he spit out saliva, but nothing helped. Minutes went by with nothing really happening except for Danial making a lot of ruckus. To make things even worse Danial started to feel even more ill with every passing minute. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBruce was inside the kitchen preparing his pre-diner sandwich, a thickly stacked piece Bruce likes to call \"Meatwich\" as it could better be described as meat with bread than bread with meat. When he started eating the meatwich he heard the front door slam shut followed by the bathroom door. With a house full of student who all like to drink, well almost all, the sounds of coughing and rasping on the toilet didn't bother Bruce. He planned to help the poor sod, but not after he had finished his snack. It would just spoil his appetite if it would go that way. However, half way through his sandwich he recognized the gurgling, scraping and coughing sounds out of the bathroom as Danial's, his roommate. Considering how long he has been at it, Bruce grew worried and left his half eaten snack behind to check up with his friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you all right in there?\" Shouted Bruce through the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bughlrrhf.\" Answered Danial. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you need anything?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No-cough.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have been in there for a while, are really sure?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ye-\" A loud thud could be heard from behind the door. Bruce responded by slamming the door open and what he saw shocked him. Danial lay on the ground and was hanging half inside the toilet bowl. Danial's face visibly green, his eyes wide and sweat had almost soaked him through and through. Bruce first thought was to get Danial to a better place. If he had to call for an ambulance he wanted to secure Danial's safety. Bruce, as Danial's former lifting buddy, managed to lift his bigger friend of the ground with ease and managed to drag him to the kitchen where Bruce managed to get Danial on a chair. Reaching out to the phone to call the emergency services he turned around to keep an eye on his friend...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever Bruce was surprised by the following display. Danial had managed to get up and reached toe counter with slow swaying steps of someone close to a delirium. Bruce saw Danial heavily shake, just standing and holding himself up was taking Danial's all his strength. It didn't take long before Bruce realized what Danial was after: Bruce's half eaten sandwich. Danial reached out to it and devoured the half eaten sandwich with a vigor of someone who hasn't eaten in days. In two massive bites the thick meat on meat layered sandwich disappeared into Danial's mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShortly after Danial started to feel better. He felt invigorated. The shaking stopped, his stomach didn't try to eat itself anymore. His face turned to a more healthy color. Bruce slowly approached Danial while he transformed from the sick shaking heap of flesh back to Danial and laid a hand on his back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My god, I thought you were dying.\" said Bruce with a look of confusion and surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanial who was equally surprised, didn't know how to respond and just stared at his greasy hands. His stomach gurgled as the meatwich plopped into it and Danial responded with a small burp. Danial felt fine again. No sickness, no pain, all gone. \"I am not sure why, but I feel fine now.\" Danial said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure?\" said Bruce \"Should I call the campus doctor?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah, lets not bother him... He will just say to lay off the supplements, take some aspiring and 'stop drinking so fucking much you morons'.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanial moved to the common living room where a few other housemates were already watching the latest sports news. They both plopped in their standard places, albeit Danial with much more confidence and Bruce still keeping an eye on Danial.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA good hour went by with them watching television. Danial couldn't help but to rub his stomach, he always loved to feel the creases of his abs. He was proud of them and always likes to show them off, one way or the other. But when his hand slipped under his shirt, he was greeted with a small bulge. Danial recognized it as the bulge he gets when has eaten a lot of food. Firm and below his abdomens. Danial realized he hadn't eaten a lot, but considering what happened he didn't mind much. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I will head to bed early.\" Said Danial, \"Whatever I have, I hope a good nights rest will solve it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I still think you need to see a doctor. What happened there was not normal.\" Bruce said concerned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, whatever. It feel fine now, so it is probably gone. Probably because of my awesome immune system.\" Answered Danial with confidence flexing his pecs reminding himself of his most expensive hobby, \"Can't afford it anyway.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Does something happen before Danial has the chance to get to bed?</i></span></div></div>",

Danial slipped out of the common room without anyone noticing and went to his room on the second floor. Upon entering his room Danial was greeted with the familiar smell of old cheese. As both Bruce and Danial are both not the tidiest persons and both being athletes the smell of dirty socks simply sneaked in one day never to leave again. For them it didn't matter any longer. They got used to it a long time ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Danial switched the lights on he was greeted by his own reflection in the mirror across the room. But what he saw shocked him a little. His gut was bulging out quite a bit. Danial touched it, carefully probing it while he moved closer to the mirror. Examining it as if it was not part of his own body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"God, I got quite the food baby going in there.\" He said to himself jokingly, \"Guess I have to cut a bit and hit the cardio tomorrow.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that Danial brushed his teeth, cleaned his face, while flexing all the time. His usual routine, but all the time he was rubbing his new found gut subconsciously whenever one hand was free. He slipped into his messy bed, which clearly needed a change of sheets a few weeks ago, and started to doze off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust before Danial slipped into sleep, he went thought his day in his mind: the fat man, the illness, the food, his bulging gut. He found it odd. He remembered not eating that much this day, did he? He shrugged and just turned to his side and fell asleep quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>What will happen next?</i></span></div></div>",

He looked around like a madman expecting something to attack him in the darkness of his room. It took Danial a few seconds to calm down and realize what he was doing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Must have been a nightmare.</i> He thought and laid back again. <i>Good thing I can't remember it.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel tried to relax but failed to do so. He grabbed his phone he left charging on his nightstand. It was just past three. He let out a sigh and thought: <i>Why am I so tense?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nA grumbling noise filled the room and Danial easily identified the source as his stomach. Surprised he laid a hand on top of his stomach, expecting to feel his abs. But it was softer than he was used to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the -\" Danial whispered. Across the room he heard his roommate turn in his sleep. Daniel knew Bruce was a heavy sleeper, but he didn't want to wake him either way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanial continued to feel down his stomach. It didn't had the bulge of someone who just ate a bit too much. No, this was fat, a thin soft layer of fat. Danial flexed his abdomen and tried to feel his abs and was relieved when he felt them give a sign of life. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA second grumble resonated through Danial's body. Danial didn't want to give in, not with the recent discovery of him being fatter. He still probed and pocked the thin layer that now bulged out of his stomach. It wasn't much, easily able to hide if he held in his gut. But he never gained this fast and this much, not even when he tried to bulk up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanial closed his eyes again trying to sleep, but the grumbling of his stomach kept him awake. After the fifth one, Danial just launched himself out of his bed and marched out of the room. Not really wanting to think what he is about to do. When Danial arrived in the common kitchen and opened the fridge he saw it was devoid of anything eat worthy. The only thing there was plenty of were drinks, mainly soda and beer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn it.\" said Danial, while his stomach let out another grumble. \"Well, guess I have to drink away this hunger a bit.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanial reached in to grab a drink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>What does Danial do?</i></span></div></div>",

Whoever left it there must have forgotten how easily beer went missing in this dorm when left unattended. And hiding it behind a few bottles of soda is not good enough for Alcohol deprived frat boys. Danial smiled at the thought that he and his buddy were the reason why everyone had a mini-fridge in their rooms now and grateful to the owner of the beer that he didn't had the memo yet. He pushed aside the soda and grabbed one six-pack, closed the fridge, grabbed the remote and plopped down on he bench with the cold pack of beers pressing against his exposed flesh. Making sure the volume of the television was low preventing waking anyone up and getting busted, if his grumbling stomach hadn't already. Danial tore the six-pack open. While he was zapping through the channels with his left hand, he agilely opened a can of beer with his right and started chugging. He could feel the beer hit his stomach and after a few gurgles it went silent. And in under a minute the last drop left the can and entered Danial's mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One demolished, five to go.\" Danial whispered jokingly to himself, his hand already reaching out for the next can. As expected nothing much was on this late. All the commercial senders had either adds running in a loop for sex-hotlines, infomercials, or reruns of the late news bulletins. Nearing  the end of the channel list, Danial's hand got hold of the second can, popped it, brought it to his mouth ready to be emptied, and started chugging again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat Danial didn't notice was the effect the beer was having on his stomach as he was pretty much occupied by either zapping, or getting more beer in his mullet. The thin film of fat had started to gorge itself on the rich alcohol which sated Danial's system and it has gradually been expanding outward. If someone would have seen Danial now that person would think Danial was a jock who had enjoyed a few too many parties lately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter draining the last drop from the second can. \"Man that feels good.\" He whispered to himself and let out a sigh of content. He had gone through the whole channel list and planned to just grab the channel which had a rerun of a B-movie running for the millionth time, but it had to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>While his left hand is still occupied by zapping to that channel, what does Danial's right hand do?</i></span></div></div>",

Not chugging it down this time he just went for the large gulps. The movie was already past the halfway mark, but Danial didn't care much about that. He was just in time for the actions and the explosions how cheesy and fake they may seem. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith his mind distracted by the mildly interesting movie, and his left hand idle on the remote to turn up or down the volume when the movie decided to be either all quite or blast some explosives at the watcher. He downed his third beer in a steady pace and with that his gut grew with each gulp of beer hitting his stomach. Now growing past just a beginner beer belly, it started to curve out more. The first signs of an overhang appeared as love handles started to show themselves by slowly but steadily pushing out the waistband of Danial's boxer shorts. Danial's abs were long gone at this moment as his skin completely smoothed out from the bottom of the still small curve of his bottom belly to where the top connected just below his pecs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the end of Danial's third beer Danial was at his fattest he ever has been. Even on his bulking cycles he never went this far. Almost leaving his athletic build behind and starting to move on into the territory where people would think he just let himself go. A jock who just entered college and has dropped his diet to just enjoy everything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the alcohol started to affect more than Danial's gut, he started to feel the float of the booze set in. Breaking down his boundaries even further Danial grabbed the fourth can with even less thought than the first three, opened it up, and started to drink again. The movie was reaching its rather dull but still explosive and enjoyable climax. And as the tension got up, the speed at which Danial drank the beer increased as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a few more gulps the love handles, which were just pushing the waistband moments ago, bulged out into their own fold which extended out and down completing the overhang. And thus completing the base of Danial's steadily growing gut. Each gulp after that was like someone attached a pump to Danial's belly button. As it started to grow out, bit by bit, other parts of Danial's body started to get affected as well. The pecs solidly placed above Danial's gut started to look softer. His arms and his legs lost their definition as his skin grew thicker. Still, most of the growth went into Danial's gut which started to get quite the curve going and started to settle as an inflatable tube around his stomach. By the end of the fourth can a American football could easily be fitted upright in the bulge of Danial's gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>What does Danial do?</i></span></div></div>",

The major curve of his belly now starting to ascend upwards from his bottom belly to more the middle as a ball seemed to slowly inflate inside his stomach. His bellybutton started to stretch and deepen with each gulp as fat piled up around it. The American football was getting inflated to the size of a watermelon and there it just went rounder and more spherical. In the mean time the movie was as good as over: the world was saved once more and the hero got his beloved girl back. Danial knew that the last bit was just some slapstick humor and some movie sex you could hardly call anything close to even soft porn. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Danial threw the fifth can backwards to chug down the last massive gulp of the fifth can, the alcohol hit him. From being just happily woozy he quickly started to feel the drunkenness kick in. As if all the alcohol just decided to march to Danial's brain to just have a party of their own. Even his gut grew more of that last bit than usual now reaching the size where it could easily fit a basketball inside its spherical mass. It came to Danial's mind that the alcohol was hitting him harder then he was used to he brought and out of curiosity he looked at the now empty fifth can to see how heavy the stuff was. After a few careful turns of the can he found it: 12% it said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No wonder that stuff hit me like a truck!\" Danial almost yelled. He looked over to the side where he previously left the former six-pack to see that only one can was filling the now flimsy looking plastic wrapping. \"Well, it is time to finish the job.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLazily he shook the last can out which heavily plopped on the bench and tossed the plastic over his back. Grabbed the can, opened it and just chugged it down like the first one. As the beer ran down his throat his body reacted again by just expanding outward. Danial's gut just inflated like a balloon, growing well beyond baseball size in just a few gulps. His meaty strong legs gathered just enough fat to completely lose all definition as small rolls of fat started to appear on the seat. His butt started to press into the back of the bench as his once firm butt started to bubble outward. His arms looked bigger, but most of all fatter. And his pecs started to become moobs, pushing out and flattening out on the plateau which had become his gut. And Danial just barely chugged down half the can.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGulp. The solid gut bounced out a bit more with a bit of a jiggle. His love handles which have been neglected in his growth as all his fat went into the sphere that was his gut, jiggled out as now a thick layer of fat started to hang below Danial's gut, increasing his overhang.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGulp. The overhang bounced down a bit and connected with the legs. Danial now very drunk didn't even notice the new sensation of his gut pressing against his own legs. His thighs now big enough to constantly rub against each other when he would walk. A dream Danial hoped to achieve one day, but not in the way it is now going. His moobs growing a bit sideways as his once V-shaped waist which he lost 3 beers ago devolved more and more and started to resemble more an 8-shaped figure. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last gulp just made the imaginary pump just push out its largest most devastating blow. Danial's arms started to develop a bit of visible flab. His moobs were now completely rounded out and the fold even reached around towards his back. His gut just blew up and started to jiggle quite a bit. the belly button, once just shallow, stretched out and deepened into a cave. His overhang pushed out another 2.5 cm (1 inch) now firmly pressing down which could be even more was Danial reclined in a relaxed position while he chugged down the last bit of beer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with the last bit of beer gone Danial let out a ear deafening burp. Shortly after he heard some bonking noise on the wall behind him. He drunkenly sniggered to himself. With the booze coursing through his system and knowing he had done a job well done he switched off the television to be greeted by complete darkness. His intention was to get up get back in bed, but in the moment the room went black Danial's eyelids started to feel heavy as an alcohol induced slumber sneaked upon him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>What does Danial do?</i></span></div></div>",

He failed obviously as the weight of his gut pinned him down on the couch. Somewhere in his drunk stupor Danial noticed some mass rolling down his legs as he slightly bent forward in a more normal seating position, but didn't mind much of it as he was pretty much at the edge of falling in a deep sleep. He moved his arms one more time positioning them like a monkey ready to press down into the couch, but much farther he wasn't able to do much as he fell into a deep slumber.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dreams which followed were odd to Danial to say the least. All he saw was food, beer, and soda floating around him. In the meantime Danial felt an insatiable hunger flood over him and would just eat everything he saw. Which got immediately replenished by even more food for him to chow down. The food even had flavors and they were the best he ever tasted. He felt content, happy, and knew that he was getting fatter and fatter even though he couldn't see his own body. But then he saw something odd. A black figure, just in the corner of his eye. Danial shifted his focus on the black shade, and it vaguely resembled a person.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Who are you?</i> Danial said in his dream to the figure. But it didn't gave any response at first. Instead a smile appeared, showing unnatural white teeth against the shadows that were his body. And the smile just grew wider and wider until it reached from one side of the face to the other. And with a voice, not of this world, he finally answered:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>You.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanial awoke again with wide eyes. Immediately blinded by the bright light flowing through the lamella curtain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>When does Danial awaken?</i> </span></div></div>",

How late is it?\" Danial said to no one in the room. Slowly his senses return to him, and slowly a sense of urgent need raised in Danial's mind as his bladder was aching for release.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrunting Daniel tried a few times to get up, finding his body a lot more cumbersome than before. It required a lot of Danial's strength to finally get to his feet. Once up he had to balance a bit as he found his center of balance had shifted quite a bit forward. This time not missing the fact the rolling sensation of something heavy down his legs when he tried to bend forward while standing up, Danial looked down to see a massive heap of something pushing out on the place his muscled stomach used to be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe just looked down at it still hazed by the hangover and the last remnants of sleep and sniggered to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha! Nice fat suit.\" He said, while he started to move towards the toilet as fast as he could. Danial was a master pranker of the floor and there were many who waited for the perfect moment to return the favor. But as he walked down the hallway he noticed the rub between his legs and the heft and bounce in every of his movements. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoever did this must have been up all night to get this suit on me.\" He said to himself again while he lumbered down the hallway. \"And I have been in a coma.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe entered the bathroom and closed the door behind him and walked to the toilet. There he positioned himself above the bowl and looked down to try and aim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shit! The suit, I need to get it off.\" And he tried to find a zipper. But as he didn't find any and everything just felt like skin. He went down under the massive overhang to find his boxers. After a bit of fiddling to get a bit of the surprising warm soft pudge out of the way to reach the band of his boxer he immediately felt the band being stretched way to its limit. From there he moved his hand up feeling the softness of the massive sack of stuff hanging down trying to find any proof of a seam. However, he never found any. Now practically lifting his overhang with both hands he felt the pull of the massive weight strain lifted from his back and started kneading the soft stuff. Somehow it felt nice to the touch and it gave him a very comfortable sensation in a spot he never felt before... Somewhere distant out of him... a nice massage... And then the explosive impact of realization happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AAAAAAAAAAHR!\" Danial yelled from the tops of his lungs on the moment he realized the of the massive heap of stuff was actually his own flesh hanging there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ho-! Wha-! Son of bitch!\" Danial continued yelling while he carefully placed his hands on top of this thing and surely he felt the skin of <i>his</i> hand touch the skin of <i>his</i> newly found gut. Carefully Danial tried to move it, hoping in vain that it was just a very realistic suit or something. But it didn't. He could feel the pressure build in his gut while he moved it around. He felt that it was quite solid, and didn't budge much in way of wobbling on the sides and top. But it had a thick layer of soft pudge covering it in which his fingers could sink a bit before meeting any resistance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes of just probing and poking the gut, Danial moved to the two mounts of flesh which used to be his solid pecs. They spread out about a few cm (about two inches) out of his chest onto his gut with a fold reaching all the way down around the sides below his arms. He cupped his moobs and lifted them from his gut. Whimpering a bit at the sight of the looseness and softness of them. He tried to flex the muscles buried beneath the thick layer of fat. He could see his moobs bounce and could feel the muscles move under the thick layers of fat, but it made him only realize more how fat they were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the meantime a few people were scurrying and cursing outside the bathroom door all awoken by Danial's screams. Some words went back and forth, then they all went silent. Just a few moments alter a few loud angry bonks threatening just to punch through the door alerted Danial.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude! You know you just awoke the entire floor!\" Yelled a familiar voice outside. It was Bruce, and he sounded royally pissed. A few moments Danial just stared at the door, than back at his gut, to return to the door again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had to do something and stepped towards the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>What does Danial do?</i></span></div></div>",

The rubbing sensation of his thighs, it wasn't intense but surely hig upper thighs connected when he tried to move his one leg before the other. The wobbling of his moobs on top of his gut. The rubbing of his much wider gut against the sink when he misjudged his new dimensions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanial took one step too many too reach the door and stood there with his gut pressed against it. The cold of the wood slowly seeped into his skin which made Danial let out another whimper as the sensation felt so distant from his former body. Another sets of bonks sends ripples through the lard of Danial's gut and a Bruce's voice boomed through the building again: \"Hey, shitface! Do I need to break this door down!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanial knew he had to do something, but what he wasn't sure. A longing for help bubbled in the back of his mind, someone who he could talk to. But he didn't want others to see him like this. Then Danial got an idea which might work, if he was quick enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough Danial has fattened up significantly he was still strong and with surprising speed he unlocked the door, grabbed Bruce's arm, and pulled him in. Others standing around the door only saw a glimpse of a very fat man, but didn't recognize Danial in the confusion. Danial managed to close the door behind Bruce, but it left them standing with their bodies pressing against each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Bruce is Danial's former lifting buddy, but Bruce outgrew Danial one way or the other.

From Bruce's perspective a fat man managed to pull him in with some considerable strength.

And managed to lock the restroom's door, before anyone even got a glance of what was happening inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe room was barely big enough for the both of them. It would take just a few pounds on either one of them and one would be forced to sit on the toilet to make room for the other with the other's gut pressing in the face. For a few moments, Bruce was frozen in surprise of the situation. The odd sensation of fat on fat when he got pulled in had dazed him. However, it took Bruce just a few moments too remember why he was near the restroom anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, fat fuck! Why are you screaming so early in the morning!\" Bruce yelled at the back of Danial, still not recognizing him. But who could figure out that your friend, who was just your regular gym rat, would turn up so much heavier in just a few hours since you last met? The love handles which hung over Danial's boxers were not there, the fat fold in the back caused by the larger ass or the folds near the shoulders indicating some moob fat. This all was what Danial wasn't and even openly resented hours before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shh, you fatso.\" A to Bruce familiar voice whispered back. Danial turned to face Bruce, but the unfamiliar momentum of his body made him stumble a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha! Your the one to call me fat, fat... -so?\" The coin dropped. The familiarity of the voice, the familiar yet fatter face, the usual insult since Bruce decided to focus power-lifting more than his own fat percentage. \"How, what?...

But the extra amount of padding, made Danial looked rather burly. Nothing like Bruce though. Ever since he went on a permanent bulking cycle he explode, more or less, in both strength and size. And being in the power lifters club of the university, where size was a large factor in determining your rank amoungst fellow members. Bruce determined that Danial's gut was quite large, almost as large as Bruce's. But even then Danial somehow got this large beer belly build, where most of the fat is concentrated around the gut, unlike Bruce himself. Bruce got more fat all over, where with the added muscles made his ass and legs look massive. Besides that, Bruce clearly got more muscle filling in his upper body than Danial does. So, Danial was right, but Bruce would have clearly won when this was a size-em-up in his club.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBruce sat down on the toilet seat. He didn't know why, somehow he felt weak to the knees. He let out a long sigh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And to answer, I do not know. I had a few beers, fell asleep, and woke up like this!\" Danial continued and gestured at his belly not even willing to move his hands closer to it. And with great disgust on his face Danial could still feel a slight wobble pass through it of the sudden movement he made.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw come on, you look quite stronger now.\" As much as Bruce's burly body allowed he hunched over to let his elbows rest on his knees and let his head rest in the palms of his hands, transforming him in a ball of lard and muscle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you know I am not. This is all fat!\" Danial said with increasing volume. He was almost yelling at the end. A moment of silence followed. Bruce just observed Danial and it was making Danial uncomfortable. \"Shall we get out of this cramped space.

I can see you secretly liking it.\" Bruce teased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanial's face contorted into a grimace of disgust and surprise. \"No...\" Was the only word he could muster. He wasn't yelling, or talking. Bruce knew Danial well enough for that to be the truth, but that statement didn't had any of the usual force behind it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm?\" Bruce hummed teasingly. However Danial didn't show any intention to respond, he just stared down at his new horizon. \"Lets get out of here, let me see if the coast is clear.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBruce tried to pass Danial, but Danial tried everything to prevent another fat-on-fat rubbing action. Or having Bruce touch Danial's gut in any way or form. However, there was clearly not enough space in the restroom to do this maneuver. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I have to get past you... or do you want to take a peek and be exposed.\" Bruce said annoyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O... ok.\" Danial answered hesitantly. With a face of defeat Danial huffed to suck in his gut as much as possible. But it didn't help much as Bruce just pushed his out even more in response. Bruce loved the sensation of the wobble and the rub. Somewhere deep inside Bruce liked that he was now able to show Danial that having a gut can bring lots of pleasures. Eat what you want, as much as you want. No worries about standards or arbitrary numbers. There are enough people out there which will find fat powerful dudes hot, if not the large fan-base of his club wasn't a testimony of that... It is just a shame that it isn't seen that way in the popular media.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Danial's gut touched that of Bruce's once more, Bruce concentrated on the firmness of Danial's gut and he was not disappointed. Danial's gut wasn't pure solid beef, but had a small layer of softness that made it perfect. Unlike the gut of Bruce, which was more a solid muscular foundation with a lot of soft hanging pudge flowing off it. For a short moment Bruce was jealous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey passed each other with quite a hassle. Danial just seemingly shrinking as Bruce just stretched the moment where there bellies were squished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBruce opened the door slightly and peeked through. \"Shit,\" he whispered, \"some are still here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe turned to Danial and said before slipping through. \"Nothing to worry about, just wait a minute.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanial slowly shuffled to the door. He could hear Bruce's powerful voice beaming through it saying: \"Nothing to see here. Just a small alcohol incident.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was followed by some ruckus. Probably some are trying to get access to the restroom to snap some pictures either for blackmail or just to post on the internet to make fun of the victim. This was soon followed by Bruce's voice \"No fucking way. You wanna get through me?\" A moment of silence followed. \"I thought so. Just go back to bed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few moments of mumbling later, it got quite on Danial's side. A few moments later Bruce knocked on the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is clear. Just hurry.\" Bruce said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd at the highest speed Danial could muster he speed walked back. Once in their room, Danial plopped down on his bed which groaned and creaked dangerously. Danial himself could feel his fat gut spread over his lap and immediately reacted by just stretching out and closed his eyes. He wished so hard that thing would just go away. But when he opened his eyes again it was still there, looming in front of him over him like a big round mountain, blocking the vision of his feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBruce made sure the door was locked, turned around and asked: \"Ok, now... what's next?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA short moment of silence followed. Danial didn't know, but one thing is certain. He wants to know what is happening to him. Thinking hard the first thing to cross his mind was the beer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe that other six pack is still inside the fridge.\" Said Danial. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But are you sure it wasn't pure weight gain shake or something.\" Bruce answered \"What else could this have caused?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am certain...\" Answered Danial. Bruce just raised an eyebrow in disbelief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, I see what I can do.\" Bruce said, and left to go to the common room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Will Bruce find any trace of the beer?</i></span></div></div>",

Carefully he laid his hand on top of his gut. Danial was surprised by the touch. It was his body, his gut, yet it felt so distant from what he was used to. Slowly he started pushing down and Danial could feel the fat ooze through the gaps between his fingers. But he didn't had to go far to meet the resistance of something rock solid. An odd pressure started to build at the place where his gut met his chest. His moobs flattened a bit more as it got that little bit more room to spread out to. When he released his hands, the gut started to move back into the normal position with a surprising lack of wobbling. Danial saw Bruce sometimes play with his gut like this, but he always saw it wobble for a few moments when Bruce would do something like this. No, Danial's gut felt like a monolith of fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanial could not deny it was feeling rather nice. But he still hoped he could lose this fat as quick as possible.

But, there is something odd about it.\" said Bruce while sitting down on his own bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about it?\" said Danial while he brought the six-pack closer to inspect it further. But didn't do so immediately as he saw Bruce let himself fall to his side and stretch out. Although Danial had seen Bruce's gut many sizes and many times before, he never actually observed it any different than an ugly thing. But for once Danial was interested in how his gut was different from his own. Bruce's gut was clearly softer than Danial's as it just curved up a bit before flattening off. His belly-fat oozed to his sides making his gut and love handles look even wider than they already were. Bruce moved one hand to the back of his head and the other to his moobs. Like his gut it oozed a bit more sideways making his moobs looking rather pointy. Feeling for the hidden muscle cleavage of his pectoral muscles underneath the layer of fat of his moobs, Bruce kept flexing and relaxing while he sunk deeper in his thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"MinoBull Strong Beer. Never heard of that brand.\" Bruce said a bit absent while he still continued doing the flex motions. \"And the warning labels on it. It just seems to be one big fake... a joke more.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me see.\" Danial said while snapping out of his own dreamy state. He looked at the label of the six-pack and the first thing he noticed was the odd brand symbol. It was pretty much a thick red circle with a Minotaur with massive horns winking. It was leaning out of the circle with massive muscular arms and even held a thumbs up in approval of something. Underneath it \"MinoBull\" was written in big yellow letters with a red thick stroke surrounding the letters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen flipping the pack over he could see an odd looking bar-code, and he couldn't make any sense of the nutritional values as it was using a system unfamiliar to Danial. But on bottom there was a small print in different languages. One of them was plain English and it read:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>MinoBull, will get you in the mood no matter how big you are. The secret magical ingredient makes sure you will get the right amount of alcohol to ensure you to get as drunk as a dwarf in just a few cans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWARNING.

He looked towards Bruce, who was still deep in thought, and continued \"It has a number on it, but it is unlike anything I have seen. Three zeros? What kind of call can you make beyond international?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like I said, probably just one big joke.\" Bruce answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>What happens next?</i></span></div></div>",

Danial knew better, as his gut was the source of that mighty roar. It trembled and shuddered on his lap and while it left with a pleasant tingling sensation, Danial could feel his face turn red of embarrassment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Was... that your gut?\" Bruce asked when he relaxed and sat back down on his bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanial just nodded silently, still with a red face. It had been gnawing for an hour, slowly building the roar it just released inside of him. But he never expected that it would build up to such an mighty outburst. Danial could already feel some dull stabs in his stomach while it charged up for another roar of hunger. Normally he could go all morning without food, whenever he ate well the evening before. And he knew he did. But the sun got barely up... Danial realized his early unspoken plans on getting rid of this gut might not go so easily as he had hoped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dear god. I think we need to feed you something before it wakes up the entire building.\" Bruce said jokingly. But Danial didn't want to respond to that. It all felt a bit too familiar: the gnawing, the hunger pangs, it was just like yesterday, just like this night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, do you have anything in your fridge, Danial?\" asked Bruce. But before Danial could answer he felt a hunger pang stab through his stomach, which let out a second mighty roar. Making his gut tremble and slightly wobble once more. Bruce just looked at Danial's gut go. When it finally went silent, Bruce said while giving his gut a meaty slap. \"We really need to get that monster of yours something. Or else you might go crazy and start to see me as a delicious meaty treat. So... Food... Your fridge?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You damn well know I don't stock my fridge since you went all lard a-\" The burst of anger Danial could bring up, died as soon as he got stuck on the last word. Realizing that Bruce wasn't the only one with a big lardy ass. He let his gaze go down a depression fell upon Danial's shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBruce noticed this, trying to cheer Danial up he said: \"I am still the one with the largest ass in this room, ey?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanial smiled faintly to that statement. But after a short moment he only looked more depressed than Bruce had Danial ever seen. Even more so than the times they meet during finals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And to be fair, the stock I normally would have is gone. I had this binge and just ate it all last night.\" Said Bruce, trying to get a reaction out of Danial. Although cocky Danial wasn't always a pleasure to be around with especially after Bruce decided to just let go of his diet, depressed Danial wasn't fun either. And as old friends, he still wanted to cheer him up somehow. A silence fell between the two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lard ass.\" Danial said finally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There ya go!\" Bruce said with a smile, \"There is the Danial I know. Now lets see whats in your fridge, shall we?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O... k.\" Danial said hesitantly and got up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>What does Danial find in his fridge?</i></span></div></div>",

But he never expected to find it in the state he found it in: completely filled to the brim. Not a single empty spot was left over and Danial even doubt if he could get anything out without making something fall out of it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPies, pizzas, pastas, candy bars, and boxes and boxes of protein bars. A quick look in the internal fridge compartment made it clear that it also was filled with all kind of ice scream goodies. No room was left, even the light of the internal lamp got blocked by just all the food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBruce saw Danials surprised look, but couldn't see the contents as the door swung open to his side of the room. Bruce got up and walked behind Danial. Once he got to look inside he could only exclaim: \"Holy fucking motherload.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel's stomach gurgles just by the sight, and Danial damn well knew it wanted it all inside of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When did you got the time to get this all in here without me noticing it?\" Bruce almost whispered still amazed by the sight of all that food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...\" Danial tried to remember anything, but the only thing he knew should have been in there was a moldy sandwich, \"...  didn't buy this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, someone brought this in.\" Bruce said and pushed Danial aside. Trying to not let anything fall out, he tried to get one of the top boxes of protein bars. After some dexterous finger work, Danial never expected Bruce to have, he managed to get a box out. \"Let's see what it is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"MinoBull Maxi Proteinbars? Again that strange brand.\" He said after some quick glances. And passed it on to Danial. Bruce started to walk back and forth for a bit, before walking to his own fridge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holly crap, my fridge is the same. But mine is filled with soda and booze.\" He almost yelled from the top of his lungs, but returned to a deep thought, \"Again... MinoBull. What is it with this brand?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have no idea.\" Stated Danial.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I gotta go to the loo and maybe shower a bit.\" Bruce said while he quickly grabbed some new underwear and a towel. \"See ya soon, bud. And I would avoid eating that MinoBull crap until we figured out what it is. Maybe you could find something in the common fridge.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA load roar announced that Danial's stomach disagreement to the idea of leaving.

However, his gut brought in a few good arguments when it roared and threw in a few hunger pains to make Danial open the box. Unexpected he saw that the individual bars were rather big. About four times the size from the average of what he consumed himself on a daily basis. They were even laid in length of the box instead of the depth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe hesitantly grabbed one of the bars. The Minotaur printed on ever one of them winked at him showing of has massive guns. His gut let out another roar and a stabbing pain made Danial double over. He needed food, now!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happened next was more a haze to Danial. He ripped open the bar and bit off a large chunk. His mouth was completely filled and he had even trouble chewing. But the flavor... It was heavenly. It had ever favorite food he had ever tasted. And in a few more bites the bar was gone. He felt the chunks hit his stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust realizing what he had done he looked down on his gut, almost scared for what will happen next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>What happens next?</i></span></div></div>",

Danial was quite buff, however, Bruce was massive. Half way through the first year Bruce decided that the rate he was growing at was not fast enough. He started to ramp up on his exercises, then Bruce started to get into more experimental foods. To finally end up with juice, steroids, and more illegal stuff he somehow managed to get. The months that followed made Bruce inflate like a muscular balloon. Bruce tried to convince Danial to juice as well. Danial considered, and was tempted by the incredible results Bruce was making. However, he liked his balls a bit too much to see them shrink. In the months that followed Bruce kept outgrowing Danial, and just grew apart as lifting buddies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was now almost a year ago. Bruce has kept growing and was making it in the bodybuilding scene. But the juice didn't left everything undamaged. The fast growth made stretchmarks appear  There was something developing below Bruce's abdomen, that would only grow bigger if he kept up juicing the way he is doing now. One of the many things Danial tried to avoid with not juicing. Not that it mattered now, with all that fat in his gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, fat fuck! Why are you screaming so early in the morning!\" Bruce yelled at the back of Danial, still not recognizing him. But who could figure out that his friend, who was just a regular gym rat, would turn up so much heavier in just a few hours since they last met? The love handles which hung over Danial's boxers were not there, the fat fold in the back caused by the larger ass or the folds near the shoulders indicating some moob fat. This all was what Danial wasn't and even openly resented hours before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ssh. You don't have to make it worse.\" whispered Danial.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy fuck!\" yelled Bruce when he finally realized who he was talking to. If Bruce's mouth could hang on the floor in aw, it would have. Now realizing what the situation is, Bruce continued in a whisper: \"Wha-, how?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I- I Don't know! I woke up like this.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanial saw that Bruce was conflicted.

Bruce, in the mean time, started slowly to close in on Danial.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, to see what damage has been done.\" Bruce tried to clarify, but Danial wasn't showing any kind of improvement. Bruce let out a sigh. \"How heavy you are?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why? Wha- Why? Why would you like to know that?\" Bruce was now standing gut to abs against Danial. Bruce slowly lifted his arms and slowly laid his hands upon Danial's gut. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA shiver went through Danial's spine as that happened. He could feel the slight pressure that Bruce was applying on his gut. Bruce started to slowly circle his hands. Danial knew what was going on, but he denied it. He cannot admit to these feelings. This wasn't him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't know, but I got a heavy duty scale in our room.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was a surprise for Danial, he never knew that Bruce had one of such scales. Bruce squirmed his way past Danial to the door. Bruce managed to move in such a way that he stayed in contact with Danial's gut as much as possible. The rubbing provided a long and knee-weakening experience for Danial. All these sensations were still new for him, and it hit him like a truck still.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But lets first get out of here.\" Bruce said, \"Nothing to worry about, just wait a minute.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn with that Bruce slipped through the door. The audience who were still waiting outside reacted on the reappearing of Bruce. But Danial couldn't hear much other than muffled voices. Danial slowly shuffled to the door but it wasn't really needed as he could hear Bruce's powerful voice beaming through it saying: \"Nothing to see here. Just a small alcohol incident.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was followed by some ruckus. Probably some fellow housemates are trying to get access to the restroom to snap some pictures either for blackmail or just to post on the internet to make fun of the victim. This was soon followed by Bruce's voice \"No fucking way. You wanna get through me?\" A moment of silence followed. \"I thought so. Just go back to bed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few moments of mumbling later, it got quite on Danial's side. A few moments later Bruce knocked on the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is clear. Just hurry.\" Bruce said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Danial couldn't really hurry as much as he was used to. His thighs were rubbing as he tried to move, forcing him to waddle quite a bit to avoid making noises. Lucky for him their room wasn't far off. But chances were big that at least someone would have peeked, Danial just hope furiously no one would recognize him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a beating hearth of anxiety and a pit in his stomach of fear, Danial arrived in their room. Bruce already started digging under his bed to pull out a pile of filthy clothes and syringes. Danial let himself drop on his bed, forgetting his new weight. A few dangerous snaps and groans could be heard from Danial's bed  while his gut spread out on his lap. Danial let out a gasp, trying to sit completely still. Seemingly the situation has stabilized, but Danial made a mental not to not do that again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBruce in the mean time managed to get his scale out. Danial saw it was quite a high tech one. An imprint all over the weighing bed showed that it could hold up to 225kg (500lbs), an left Danial wondering why Bruce would want a scale which would go that high. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, give it a try!\" said Bruce. Danial could not deny a hint of pure joy in Bruce's voice. Was Bruce enjoying this?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a heavy grunt Danial got up from his bed again which made again some dangerous noises. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Still, I do not know why I want to.\" Danial contemplated just before stepping his first foot on the scale.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, don't you wanna know how much you wanna hate the person who did this to you?\" said Bruce with a grin from ear to ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanial gave in. On one side he didn't want to know. On the other, well, he was curious. \"It can't hurt, I guess.\" said Danial and stepped on the plate. But he knew deep down it would hurt a lot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>What does the display show?</i></span></div></div>",

He was fat and those numbers confirmed it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBruce whistled and said: \"Wow, you have become quite the piggy.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, what did you call me?!\" Danial responded with a frustrated voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are fat, so you are a piggy.\" Bruce explained while he started touching Danial's gut once more. But Danial had none of that and pushed Bruce away. Bruce staggered a bit, but didn't fall. \"Well, does our piggy suddenly become violent?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck off. What the hell is wrong with you!\" Bruce almost yelled at him out of anger. He knew what was going on. Danial had been suspecting it for the longest of times, what he looks at when they are out in the city, how he always hangs on certain shows while zapping through the channel list while watching television. Bruce didn't even tried to hide it anymore. Bruce was gay, but most of all, Bruce liked fatties. \"What kind of juice have you been taking to like this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have always liked them. Ever since I was young. Unfortunately we became friends before I knew how much you liked bullying them.\" Bruce said while slowly trying to approach Danial again. \"But now you are fat...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanial wanted to stop Bruce. However, both were interrupted by a low grumbling sound. The source quickly identified as Danial's stomach. His gut shook a little. One glance at Bruce's face could not hide the enjoyment he was having. But Danial didn't feel pleasure, it was gnawing, and it hurt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, hear that roar. Someone is getting a bit hungry, I see.\" Bruce teased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fu-\" Danial tried to say, but he was interrupted again by his stomach. It took all of Danial's willpower not to flinch. \"-ck you!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ey. I didn't called you a name in that one.\" said Bruce with a grin from ear to ear. \"Let me just grab something for you to eat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I won't be eating anything until I lost all of this.\" Danial said while he gestured at his gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess your stomach disagrees on that part. But does it hurt to just eat a little to silent that monster of yours?\" Danial caught a glimpse in in Bruce's eyes he didn't like. \"Let me grab you something as our fridges are empty. Or... do you want to go out yourself to be discovered as the new pig of the house?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Did... he just blackmail me?</i> Danial thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>What is Danial's response?</i><br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

His head was spinning, and he stumbled into the coffee table, nearly crashing right through it, but just about managing to steady himself. He laughed at his own drunken, clumsiness, and made his way to the bathroom, leaning against the wall for support. He was oblivious to the extra padding he had gained in the last hour, barely even acknowledging his bloated, ball shaped stomach as he crept along the corridor to the bathroom, wearing only his boxer shorts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"URRRRRP!\" Danial gave a loud belch, which he hoped wouldn't wake anyone up. He felt his stomach grumble, and for the first time, he touched it with his hands, giving it a soft rub in an attempt to ease his bloated gut. \"Woah...really bloated,\" he said, barely realizing just <i>how </i>bloated he really was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe finally reached the bathroom and slipped inside, pulling his boxers down and aiming his cock at the toilet bowl, while resting one hand on against the wall to steady himself. He took a very satisfying piss, pulled his underwear back up, and headed back out. The relief felt good, and cleared his head a little. In fact, he felt like he could finish off the other two cans now. But first, he popped into his room and grabbed his phone, which was now fully charged. He was pleased to find a text message from Lexi, a girl he had been flirting with on and off for a few weeks. She was exactly his type, and conformed to his extremely high standard's; slim, beautiful, great body and an awesome pair of tits. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sat down on the bed and checked the message, opening it up to find a selfie of Lexi in her underwear. Danial immediately felt a bulge in his boxers, and grinned eagerly at the message. Underneath the picture was written <i>\"now show me those sexy abs ;)\"</i>. Danial acted without thinking, standing up and snapping a picture of his brand new beer gut, and sending the message over. He hoped he would get a good nude pic in response...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Danial's nausea slowly abated as he ran home. He made a mental note to never order that shake again. He was confident he was about to lose the entire contents of his stomach after his interaction with that squat little geek. Ridiculous as the whole thing may have been, he still sensed something was off which was not unlike the slightest nip of anxiety just below his throat. Again, he attributed this to his earlier shake. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanial jogged up to the driveway of his home and noticed Bruce's car was still there. Bruce, being his roommate and longtime buddy since high school. \"Guess he doesn't work today\" Danial thought to himself.  He slid his key in the deadbolt of the front door and tromped inside. He threw his shoes off his feet, inadvertently knocking multiple shoes off the shoe rack his roommate had recently organized. He moved to the kitchen in search of more food \"God, I need something with more sustenance than that dumb shake\" he thought. He searched the cabinets and the fridge for something edible but came up empty handed \"Ugh, I gotta go grocery shopping.\" He noticed however, Bruce had a couple eggs and a veggie patty left. It was the last of his foot but that didn't matter to Danial, he needed to eat right then, Bruce would just have to deal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNoticing he didn't have any clothes to wear for the rest of the day Danial went to throw in a load of laundry when he saw the washer was full. Bruce had likely thrown in a load but forgot to dry it. Instead of putting it in the dryer, Danial simply put the wet clothes above the dryer and started his own load of laundry. Satisfied, he grabbed a towel from his room entered the bathroom for a shower. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanial flipped on the water and undressed as he waited for it to warm. He stared at the Adonis in the mirror. Tall with glowing skin and curly golden-brown hair. Danial's 6'5\" frame would be lanky had he not spent the majority of his years in athletics developing an extraordinary physique. With fit, wide shoulders capping strong arms and a lengthy, tapered waist, he could be a posterchild for any swim organization. Of course, his legs were as developed with lithe, muscular quads and hamstrings supporting a nicely bubbled ass. He wasn't huge by bodybuilding standards, but he was certainly reaching the peak of what he might obtain naturally. But, as a freshly aged twenty one-year-old, he figured he had a few years to go before he was ready to hop on any juice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the water finally warm he entered the shower and lathered his hair and body for some time before coming back out to dry off. He wrapped his towel around his waist, picked up his gym clothes, exited the steamy bathroom and noticed Bruce, sitting on a couch in the living room, obviously aggravated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBruce aggressively shot at Danial \"Hey man what's up?\" \"Nothing just got out of the shower\" Danial replied \"Oh nice, you had a good day then?\" The malice in his voice was impossible to ignore. Danial replied \"Yeah... you alright man? You seem pissy.\" \"Oh yeah, no. Someone knocked over the shoes I spent twenty minutes last night putting together, ate my breakfast so I have nothing to eat now and left my wet clothes on the dryer for literally no reason at all.\" \"Dude settle down it's no-\" \"Oh?! It's not a big deal?! Right? It's all the time with this shit. It's like every other day you make a mess you don't clean up or do something selfish. If you could not be a self centered asshole for like, ONE week that would be awesome. It's so fuckin hard to live with you when you're like this. Look, I'm fucking leaving to get some food, don't until you're ready to apologize for being a dick.\" With that he darted for the front door and slammed it on his way out. For once, Danial was stunned, he couldn't even think of something cutting to say about his friend's recently bulkier body which usually flies out of his mouth like a native language. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBruce, like Danial was similarly jacked but at a shorter height of 5'11. He had competed in a bodybuilding show the year prior but failed to place in even the top ten. Since then, he had been perpetually bulking, trying to build his physique as large as possible. In the process he had built a considerable gut beneath his rounded pecs and a rather bulbous butt above his  ham-sized hamstrings. Bruce was significantly stronger between the two of them so they no longer worked out together but Danial wondered when his roommate woould finally stop bloating his body further and further into blimp territory. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShortly after Bruce stormed out, Danial's nausea returned. But instead of feeling like he was about to vomit he felt like he was going to pass out. He felt short of breath and went to sit down, then he felt his entire body go numb. He thought he was having a panic attack. He darted to his room to find an old bottle of xanax. He dug the bottle out of a dresser, threw a pill into his mouth and chugged some water. He used to have panic attacks as a teen but they were never this bad. Danial noticed he was still in a towel and threw his last pair of undies and athletic shorts on then walked to the living room where he started pacing until his xanax kicked in when he started to notice a strange sensation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis shorts were tightening around his thighs and ass. The athletic shorts had a slight split at the bottom to accommodate for his thicker than average thighs. It was pulling apart more than ever though. Danial assumed he was just feeling weird from his panic attack but the sensation continued to increase until he ran to the bathroom convinced he was getting bigger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately he noticed how swollen he looked, his body had visibly added mass that wasn't there before. He hopped on the bathroom scale which read the same weight it had for the last week 210.3 lbs. He flipped back to the mirror and stared at his burgeoning body as it became more yoked by the second. He tried to convince himself he was hallucinating as his weight was the same on the scale. Danial had become even wider than his thick friend. He thought he was pushing 250 at least. His veins pressed out across his skin and stretchmarks were forming across his chest. He turned around to see his buns had risen into complete loaves without slowing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanial fumbled through the bathroom door, knocking his bloated shoulder into the frame and ran to his bed where he left the old prescription bottle, assuming he was hallucinating from an old xanax. The bottle stated that the medication was still good for another year. Danial's panic worsened as he realized he wasn't hallucinating, he was really getting bigger. He looked down at his ever swelling chest and noticed something odd. He gut was bowing out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis formerly lithe, athletic form was perpetually swelling out of proportion into a roided, growth-hormone pumped beast. His knees felt the stress of his new body and his arms were slowly losing mobility. As they pumped. He walked sideways threw the doorframe, feeling his mountainous back slide against it as he searched for his phone. He was going to call Bruce for help. He found it in the living room and tried to grab it, realizing how wide his hands were becoming. He clicked Bruce's contact and tried to hold the phone to his head but couldn't reach passed his shoulder from how muscle bound his arm had become. He switched to speaker and waited for his friend to pick up. He started walking to the bathroom when his friend's message tone came on. \"Of course he's not gonna fucking pick up right now!\" He hung up and again looked at his ever swelling body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe image that started back at him was terrifying. He had left the realm of beastly and entered impossibly freakish. Danial's neck was wider then his head and topped a bright red body stuffed with muscle. Danial's muscle bound physique was bigger than anything he has ever seen, easily passing 420 lbs in a matter of 10 minutes. His roid gut pressed out, striped with abdominal bricks. His balloon thighs pressed his legs apart and his muscular breast sat as pillows on his big belly. He dropped his phone in shock on the tile floor, shattering the screen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith his only line of communication gone, Danial was helpless to do anything but watch his formerly perfect body continue to morph into a ballooned caricature of an anatomy chart. Despite what the scale said he could feel his increased weight, his knees and shoulders aching with the additional weight they now held. Yet Danial still grew. Then it was as if the swelling kicked into overdirve to compensate for his already huge person. Even his jaw and eyebrow muscles grew, making his face blocky and wide. He tried to waddle out of the bathroom and barely squeezed his gut through the door<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis body, well over 600lbs now left him breathless to move, and despite all the muscle on his frame he felt like he could barely lift his massive legs up to walk. He fell over with a crash where he continued to bloat until Bruce came back home...</span></div></div>",

It became more a tingly, funny kind of feeling. It made Danial happy and there was this small familiar itch developing at his crotch. It was a fine day, he had a good workout, and Danial reckoned he might need some private time in his bedroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a big grin and with a small skip in his step, Danial opened the front door of his student house. He knew he just dodged one hell of an evening, full of acid reflux, painful groans and having no beer. After entering Danial quickly went into the common living room, which state would best be described as lived out. The only thing that was in somewhat great shape, besides his own body of course, was the quite large television and gaming set. It wasn't a surprise that he would find two of his house mates play Call of Duty on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanial let himself drop in one of the free sofa's and felt that his day couldn't be any better when he saw that beer was already served. He quickly grabbed one can, opened it, and took a large gulp, in one fluid motion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ey!\" yelled one of the gaming housemates. \"That is our beer! Either pay for it or beat it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanial wasn't phased by this guy and only laughed it off. \"Beat it? You?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey guy lost a few lives while he was giving Danial the stink eye. His name was Bill and he was pretty much the stereo gamer, wannabe bro: looked like he takes care of himself, yet has a bit of pudge from many beer chugs he couldn't hide under his large size shirt. Danial knew he would out muscle him easily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your not worth it.\" Bill finally said, while he grabbed the pack to place under his feet. \"Enjoy it, shitface.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith his recent encounter with Phyllis, which Danial counted as a victory, the following sentence was quicker out than expected: \"Well at least I got a nice bod going. Can't tell that much for you, shitbody.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanial would admit that wasn't much of an insult, lousy at best. But it felt great, fantastic in fact. It felt... erotic... It felt like he was seeing the best porn, no... having the best sex of his life. He felt his crotch go hot. Blood surged into his cock and went from a semi he already had to a full fledged boner in just seconds. He could barely hold in a groan of bliss as he felt some pressure build up in his pants. I didn't help that the fabric of his jeans didn't allow for a full tent. There was only one thing on his mind: He needed release.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanial launched himself of the chair, his boner fighting against the jeans for some leeway. Danial couldn't remember the last time he was that hard, that his boner was applying such a tremendous force on his jeans. For a moment Danial thought the squads made his ass pumped, but he didn't care anymore since Bill was staring at him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>So, what is happening?</i></span></div></div>",

Speeding by the kitchen he just yelled \"Needing some private time!\" without knowing if Bruce, his roommate, was actually there. But Danial just figured Bruce would be there, as he had never seen Bruce outside the kitchen on this hour of the day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUp the stairs was quite a hassle. His package just wasn't giving in, his boner rubbing against the fabric of his jeans. Danial wondered whatever he had done that day to feel so horny, to get such a boner. His dick was quite average, about 14.5 cm (5,7 inches) but his large body made it look rather small on him. And this always lingered in his mind. Maybe it was the driving force behind his need that he wanted to go to the gym in the first place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside his room he made sure the door was obstructed, his windows were concealed. He finally released his raging boner from the jean prison and dropped on his bed. When his hand meet his dick he felt an shudder travel through his own body. Never had Danial such a boner before. Without any doubt on his erotically clouded mind he started tugging his dick with a might he never did before.

He had more to work with, his tugs were bigger and somehow his dick filled his hand more in girth than he had to know over the years of masturbation mastery. However, his mind was too clouded to even process this thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvery movement of his hand made every part of his body tingle, it almost as some electric current was charging his whole body up. And every nerve was sending out a sense of bliss. Danial felt like he was in the clouds, not feeling anything else than his own body and his own cock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf Danial was paying attention he would have noticed his cock, was larger. By quite some extend actually. What was once just an average was now big. It was pointing up a good 20 cm (7,8 inches). His testes didn't stay behind as well, now being about the size of kiwis. But Danial didn't really interact with them all the way through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut every good thing comes to an end and Danial wasn't prepared for what was to come. He could feel his testes tense up, he tried to grab a tissue or something. But it didn't matter. He was too late, his cock erupted with a force he never felt before. The first few ejaculations were massive, it was only once a second. But it felt like it was sucking in air and blasting out spunk at quantities he had never experienced. After about ten seconds his ejaculations followed each other quicker but with less volume of jizz. If he hadn't closed his eyes he would have seen each ejaculation almost reach the ceiling before coming down. Some hit his body and the spunk was hot. Spurt after spurt kept coming out, and kept his mind in a state of eternal bliss, overworking his pleasure center of his brain. After half a minute the force of each ejaculation finally started to go down and the time between each ejaculation became larger. The last one finally leaving his cock after about a minute with only a very small amount of cum and absolute no force. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs that little bit started to dribble down his cock, it started to deflate fast. Rushing blood out of it to other organs. And Danial felt wrecked, pleasantly wrecked, but still wrecked. Whatever just happened was too good to be true. He could feel the cooling layer of spunk all over him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>What happens next?</i></span></div></div>",

This rule was instated after the 'big accident' a few years ago, involving a quite horny lady and a lot of oil. So, with a grunt Danial lifted himself of the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA moment of dizziness came and went, Danial started to clean. First he assessed the damage made, and was quite pleased. The amount of cum he managed to produce was incredible, a grand many fold of what was even considered normal. His whole bed was wet with his white sticky stuff, and a clear imprint of his own body could be seen on the dry spots. In the mean time, as Danial was standing, some of what got onto his body was slowly dripping on the floor. But it just didn't phase Danial. Still influenced by the after-glow he could only feel proud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly Danial threw of his shirt, and wiped himself off. Grabbed all the wet bedding and dropped it on a pile with his clothes. After he retrieved a clean set of bedding and a fresh set of cloths from the chaos that was his closet. First he changed his underwear, it cooled quickly and the cum was already getting crusty. Danial could feel his new boxer briefs were a bit snug, but he didn't had the time to mind that now. Next, he swiftly did his new bedding, cleared the barricade at the door, grabbed the large pile of slowly stiffening cotton, and carefully grabbed his new set of clothes and a towel. Danial launched himself in the hallway to reduce the chance of anyone seeing him. He ran down towards the washer and dryer room and in just a few minutes he had the washer up and running. With the new set of clothes and the towel he went to the showers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the way to the showers he passed the kitchen, where he was greeted by a familiar voice: \"Are ya done with ya private time?\" Bruce was clearly eating something while he said that sentence and didn't surprise Danial one bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, you fat ass. The room is all yours now.\" Danial answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally arriving at the showers, he closed the door with a sigh. He finally had the time to relax again. He dropped his boxers and started to see whats up with his junk. Danial always was a shower, his penis only tend to thicken a bit when he would get a boner. However, the increase in length was neglectable. Danial knew something was up. His balls felt heavier than normal, but Danial couldn't figure out if that was of that incredible load he just blew, or that his balls were indeed heavier. And as they were now hugging his body due to the cold temperature in the room, he couldn't make out if they were larger or not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, ...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Has Danial's junk changed and does Danial notice anything?</i></span></div></div>",

As if Danial's cock could have a different state of mind than himself...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, with nothing to do. Danial could only ponder about the day. That strange day that started out normal, but quickly became really odd. His workout was quite successful. The odd man on the way home. His massive wank he just had. Man it felt like he hadn't cummed in ages. But what was that fat man's name again? Harry? Pharry, Phario, Phyllie? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAh, never mind, close enough to remember that he burned that man to the ground. A familiar itch started to appear downstairs. It was a shame he had a bad case of foul shake, but it panned out in the end. A surge of misplaced prowess surged through his mind, and Danial made a move similar to a boxer striking the finishing blow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the mean time blood started to gush into Danial's cock once more and Danial felt it. Unlike the time in the bedroom, where he was staring at the wall, he could see his dick thicken with each throb. But two throbs in he saw something odd happen: his dick became longer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy fuck.\" Danial said and let out a whimper when he touched his cock which wasn't done going full boner yet. He felt how with each throb his hand, which was encircling his girth, was forced more and more open. \"Wha... the hell?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Danial's cock was closing on his new max of  20 cm (7,8 inches) and is alive and kicking. But what about the curse?</i><br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The running water that was falling on his dick didn't help either. Each drop, he could feel, set of a chain of lightning through his penis into his body and it didn't take long before Danial dropped to his knees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin just a few throbs of his slong it got to the size of 20 cm (7,8 inches) and he reveled in it. Danial saw he was way bigger than he was before, he also saw he was way bigger than anyone he'd ever seen in the changing room. And it felt good, greater than good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Throb* goes the cock, and it was a massive one. More blood went into it when his dick spread and elongated and his balls chubbed up a bit more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>How much more blood is going to Danial's dick?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Danial had to place his hands behind him to support himself. The sensations were already enough to weaken his knees, he didn't want to let himself drop on the floor like a wet towel. The rain of water from the shower head was enough to keep his boner going, Danial figured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Throb*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanial's cock just passed 25 cm (10 inches), his balls swelled to the size of softballs. He actually felt them swell with sperm. Stretching his scrotum, grazing the cold ground. That sensation made him weak in the stomach, but he could swear he could hear them churn to produce even more. Danial could only think, whenever he could between the surges of pure pleasure, about the amount of cum he would produce. There was no shred of doubt or concern on his mind, as he decided this just had to be a dream. Or that damn Bill spiked his drink and he was hallucinating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Throb*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA massive surge brought Danial's dick to the size of a 2L soda bottle, and just a little thicker than one as well. If he would grab a tape measure he would have found out that his dick was now about 31 cm long. If he was measuring in inches, he would have said he was 1 foot long. His balls were now firmly resting on the ground when they swelled to the size of small melons. Danial was hung like a horse, no, he felt bigger than a horse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>But surely such a big dick requires quite some blood to stay up, does Danial have it?</i></span></div></div>",

Let me introduce you to Danial Robsworth your average junior college jock. Living on the money of his wealthy parents, has and still is the most popular kid in the class, with an above average length of 1.95m (6'5), a broad shouldered 95kg (210lbs) muscular build, good at any sport he tries and an attitude that he damn well knows he is good. Others describe him as arrogant. Some minority groups would say that he is a bully. All that because Danial has the profound believe he is better than anyone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUntil one peculiar day, a day where magic will enter the life of many. And it will all start with Danial bumping into a particular man called Phyllis Trottenburg. And Phyllis, is not in anyway like Danial. He is a short 1.66 (5'6), carries around a fat 197kg (434lbs) and wears odd clothing which can be described as not from this world. Danial will insult the particular man, then humiliate him for being smaller and lesser than Danial thinks he is. Phyllis is not known for having a spine, but that day, that particular day, Phyllis decides that everything has to change. That he for once stands up for himself, reach out for a magical spark buried deep inside the many layers of fat and curse the one with all the anger build up from years and years of being looked down upon...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis is how Danial's story begins and his adventure starts to grow. But shall Danial relinquish himself and try to break the curse, or shall he loose himself in his new found power. You will decide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><u>Other characters:</u></div><br>\r\n<b>Bruce</b>: Roommate, (former) lifting buddy and friend of Danial. They have known each other for a while, think pre-college. But nothing is set in stone. His appearance may vary from fat-ass, powerlifter, to professional bodybuilder. However the initial height of Bruce is shorter than Danial. Personality can vary from caring, to dominant: think about him as a caring friend, but still has many secrets. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMessage me when you want to add characters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Nothing is real. Everything is permitted. Well, almost, I am going to use the following rules:</b><br>\r\n - <u>No stubs</u>, chapters need to be chapters, meaning they need to have at least <i>two</i> paragraphs containing a multitude of meaningful sentences. Exception on this rule is when you submit a story <i>defining</i> choice. Think of the caliber: go transgender or not, or sexuality decisions.<br>\r\n - <u>No extreme content</u>. This includes, but is not limited to: (messy) gore, scat, and bestiality. This is not a XGC story.<br>\r\n - <u>When you go transgender</u> for the first time in a story-arc, <u>make that a choice</u>. After that you are free to change gender as much as you want in the following chapters.<br>\r\n - <u>If Danial dies, the arc ends.</u> This can be taken loosely, for example: If Danial can still experience to continuation of the story because his consciousnesses is transferred and/or bound to an object, meaning he is able to stay in the living realm... well, you are free to continue.<br>\r\n - As you might figured from the intro, I highly encourage on the <u>use both imperial and metric measurements</u>. I do not care which you put first. As choices and chapter titles are character limited these are excluded, place whatever unit system in there you want.<br>\r\n - Keep the story consistent. As in, if the best friend of Danial is called Bruce in one arc, try to name him Bruce in other arcs. Now this can be taken with a pinch of salt as you might not be aware of characters added deep down in every branch. But lets keep the important characters as consistent as possible. If you have created a character and want to add it to this opening page: message me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf your submission applies to one of the above exceptions, I will send you a message with a 3 days notice allowing you to edit your own chapters to be more suitable. After that I will either edit it myself or delete your submission.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Last words:</b><br>\r\nThe dynamics of the curse.<br>\r\nThe curse is not static. The only thing what it does is change Danial in some way. It can evolve, stop, even reverse when the story you make allows it. Do you want it to leak to other characters, it can. Do you want the curse to suddenly start drain other people to make Danial even bigger, go for it.<br>\r\nThink about this being one of the most complicated spells a wizard in this world can cast, but that this one has been cast in a spur of anger and haste. It is imperfect, but that can make it so beautiful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHave fun!</td>",
