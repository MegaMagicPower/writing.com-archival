Still, it kind of sucked, being hungry like that. It made it kind of hard to concentrate. Still, Amy was able to find her way to Bankley Hall, where her class was going to be held. She even managed to make it before class started, which was definitely good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne thing that Amy noticed about the class was that there were no skinny people in there. Everyone clearly taste-tested their own food. Which of course, was only natural. But no one in class was as fat as the professor was. Their professor looked to be about in her early thirties, and was dressed in a white chef's coat that fit rather snugly on her. The professor's generous bust was easily outlined by the attire, and her pear-shaped hips and behind were covered by a long white skirt that matched the coat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe professor wrote her name, Professor Rosemary on a white board in the front of the class, before turning and talking. It was the usual first day of class spiel, where she outlined what she was going to teach and what she expected from the students in turn. It was positively torturous, and Amy was regretting skipping breakfast more and more. Finally, the professor announced that they would begin their first cooking project right away.

On the other hand, the pair of short-shorts she wore framed her wide hips and large butt nicely, and revealed her chunky thighs which pressed together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaking herself out of her reverie, Amy replied, \"Sure. Are you ready to go?\" Claire nodded, and the two headed out of the building, talking about random things as they left the dorm where they stayed. They talked about their majors (both undecided), their families (both glad to be away from them), and so on until they reached the dining hall, where food was laid out in a buffet-style affair where students would pile food on a tray and bring it to a cashier to pay for it (with a dining plan if they had one).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Since I'm the one who suggested this, the food's on me!\" Claire declared with a smile on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You sure?

Claire's body seemed to have extra padding all over it. Her face was round, complete with a double chin. She had a pair of C-cup breasts, which framed a blubbery potbelly. Most of Claire's weight, however, seemed to be concentrated below her torso. She had wide hips, which supported a wide ass and thunder thighs. And all of it was on display, since Clair had apparently slept in a too-small tank top and a pair of boxers which her stomach partially obscured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy mentally shook those thoughts out of her head, and replied to her roommate. \"Yeah, actually. Breakfast sounds pretty good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great! Just give me some time to get changed!\" Claire responded, heading out of the room's common area and into her bedroom, leaving the door open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire wasn't even gone that long before Amy's stomach started grumbling again. It was actually kind of in pain, now. Amy wondered if she could wait long enough for Claire to get ready before she had to do something about her hunger.</span></div></div>",

On account of moving everything in yesterday, she hadn't really found the time to eat dinner, and so was very, VERY hungry right now. So she headed over towards Claire's open door, the only thought on her mind to fill her belly. In the room, Claire was standing naked, trying to decide what to wear and lamenting that some of her favorite clothes no longer fit her soft and jiggly frame. Amy managed to sneak up behind her without much effort, and stuffed Claire's head into her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire tried to put up a struggle, but quickly tired herself out as Amy swallowed down her breasts, her potbelly, and then finally her meaty lower half. Claire's round buttocks and thick thighs tasted especially good, Amy thought. Finally, Claire's feet slid down her throat, and Amy found that she had to sit down on the edge of Claire's bed. As she rubbed her absolutely enormous belly, Amy sighed with relief. Finally full! Claire would try to move inside her every now and then, but her fatty meal had no real strength and was soon quiet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy simply rested for a long while, letting her body process all of Claire's calories.</span></div></div>",

She gave up wondering a few moments later, deciding to focus on the facts that she did know. Namely that it was now late afternoon, she was hungry again, and she would have to change her clothes on account that hers didn't fit anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe reason her clothes didn't fit, of course, was due to her new physique. Eating Claire had added a lot of new pounds to Amy's body. Her bigger breasts were barely contained by her shirt, her blubbery belly was exposed to the air, her ass was enormous, and her thighs jiggly. Amy got up, finding doing so was easier than she thought it would be. Considering that she was now only a little bigger than Claire had been, Amy rooted around in her ex-roomie's closet for something to wear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter some searching, she found a white button-up blouse that exposed some cleavage and a blue skirt that she managed to slip up her newly-fattened legs without too much difficulty. Amy decided it was good enough, and left the room, pausing only to slip on her flip-flops. It was a stroke of good fortune, Amy decided, that her room was on the first floor; she <b>really</b> didn't want to deal with stairs at the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter heading outside, Amy paused to decide where she should look for dinner. The campus cafeteria was an obvious place, but there might be a party that would start soon. Her stomach growling, Amy made her choice.</span></div></div>",

As she moved, Amy was reminded of how uncomfortable said clothes were. The slacks could barely contain her round butt, and it led to her belly to slightly muffin over it. Meanwhile, Amy had only barely been able to button up her shirt over her bust and belly, even then had to leave the top few buttons undone, revealing some cleavage (though that might not be a bad thing, considering). Amy finished up her pretzel as she got to the mall, fortunately with a few minutes to spare. Said hurrying had left her red-faced and gasping for air, but that was better than missing the interview by a long shot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer interview was for a position in a coffee shop in said mall known as <i>The Grindy Road Cafe</i>. Even now, Amy could see the \"HELP WANTED\" sign hanging in the window of the shop. Amy took a moment to take a deep breath to fortify herself, before heading inside. The interior of the coffee shop had a few people standing in line to place an order, while others who had already had their coffee were instead seated at little tables dotted around the cafe. Some had bags full of merchandise, some didn't, and all were talking. Amy moved over to the line, which was fortunately pretty short.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Amy got up to the front, and said to the barista, a chubby black woman whose name tag indicated that her name was Gertrude, \"I'm Amy Gainsworth, and I'm here for an interview today, actually.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGertrude nodded, before heading through a door behind the counter. A moment later, she returned, and said, \"Ok, Miss Gainsworth. Just head back through those doors there.

Even that left her a little winded, though. Still, she had enough time to finish off her pretzel, wasn't all bad. As she head into the locker room, she heard the members of the local baseball team, the Pepper City Shakers, going through their pre-game ritual where they psyched themselves up. Even through the closed door of the men's locker room, it was pretty loud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy, meanwhile, made her way to the women's locker room, where the Pepper City Shaker's Cheerleading squad was going through their own process of limbering up. As she headed inside, one of the women, a blonde with a lithe, athletic hourglass shape, walked over to her and gave her a hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi Amy! I was worried that you wouldn't make it!\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know that wouldn't happen, Mel,\" Amy replied. The cheerleader released her hug a moment later before going back to her stretches. Amy's gaze unconsciously wandered to Mel's ass, before she realized what she was doing and hastily headed over to her own, double-wide locker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy and Mel (short for Melanie) had been pretty close friends in high school. Melanie never fit the stereotypical role of the bitchy head cheerleader, and always had time to spend with Amy. It was during her junior year that Amy realized that she was in love with her best friend, but she never told Melanie out of fear of ruining their friendship. So the two would hang out together, with Amy relishing Melanie's attention while at the same time painfully hiding what she truly felt. Melanie had tried to pry a few times, but had stopped after Amy continually rebuffed her by saying \"it's not important.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two had gone to different colleges, with Amy completing an English Degree while Melanie got an athletic scholarship to continue her cheerleading career. Four years later and they had both graduated, though Melanie was more successful after joining the Pepper City Cheerleaders. Amy couldn't seem to translate her degree into a job, and so Melanie had managed to pull some strings to get Amy a job at the stadium. It was truly a bittersweet experience for Amy. On one hand, she got to see Melanie a lot more than she had during high school. On the other had, there was what the job really was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe reason Amy's locker was double-wide was so that she could store the costume of Peppy the Pepper Shaker, the Pepper City Shaker's mascot. Peppy was, naturally, a big pepper shaker with googley eyes, a perpetual doofy smile, and big gloved hands. Amy sighed as she got into the costume. It was rather hot and smelly in it, but a job was a job after all. It also meant she had a good view of Melanie's cheerleading routine every game, so that was a definite plus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, it was time for the game to begin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - - - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone on the team, players, cheerleaders, and Amy, were all panting. It had been a long game that had gone into overtime, but the Shakers had been able to eke out a tiebreaking run in the eleventh inning, beating the Cayenne City Chilis at 4-3. Amy could feel the sweat all over her body. She'd had to move around the whole time, rallying a crowd that was quickly becoming sleepy as the sun set during the game. Still, she had gotten to see that one routine where Melanie flew through the air, so Amy didn't mind it that much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stripped out of the sweaty costume, hung it back in her locker, and headed into the showers. While at first Amy had been hesitant about heading into a communal shower with her less-than-fit body, no one really seemed to make a comment about it. And the feel of cold water her round belly and meaty thighs was really good after several hot hours in the mascot costume. Finally, Amy finished her shower, dried off, got dressed, and headed for the door.</span></div></div>",

After moving to the island, Amy had discarded clothes as unnecessary in the tropical sun; her only adornment was a swiss army knife that she wore on a string around her neck. She briefly wondered why she didn't just build her hut on the beach, before remembering two things. One, high tides would definitely wash it away. And two, if any boat saw such a structure on the island, they might come to investigate. And getting away from people was WHY she had moved here in the first place. As she arrived at the jungle's edge, Amy quickly retrieved a pair of sandals woven from grass that she had stowed in a tree; with no one around, she might not need clothes for her body, but protecting her feet from sharp things on the ground was important.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy's first destination was the trap she'd set up a few days ago in an attempt to capture one of the wild boars that roamed the island. It consisted of several snares that, if triggered right, would render the thing essentially helpless. Sadly, there was no luck there, as the snares remained empty. With a sigh, Amy turned and made her way over towards the bamboo hut she had constructed. Along the way, she picked several fruits and berries that she knew were safe to eat. Amy ate a few as she walked, the juices flowing from her mouth and down onto her soft body. Food here was surprisingly plentiful if one knew where to look, and it showed on Amy's rounded form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Amy reached the hut. Inside it were a few of the other things that Amy had brought from civilization; a hammock, a blanket, a water filter, and the clothes she had come out in (a white tank top and spandex shorts). Everything else, Amy had procured on the island. With her knife, Amy cut into a coconut that she had found earlier in the day and brought back, drinking in the milk inside. She then ate what coconut flesh she could, along with the fruit. Finally she was full. With a contented sigh, Amy patted her round belly then got in the hammock and pulled the blanket over her as the sun finished setting. She wondered what would happen tomorrow.</span></div></div>",

Using her knife, she made marks in the bark of some of the trees that she passed by, so that she could find her way back to the hut if she needed to.

This, of course, led to a lifetime of hedonism which had left its mark on her plush tummy and bubble butt. Said fatty parts of her body were on full display in a bikini that looked far too small to be on her; her belly hung over the thong bottom, and the top barely contained her cantaloupe-sized breasts. Amy herself didn't really care too much how most people saw her; after all, she was one of the wealthiest people on the world; who cared what the little people thought? Just one example of her wealth was the fact that she had bought the island and the mansion built upon it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy climbed a small staircase from the beach to a large deck, where a butler who saw her approach quickly ducked inside and came out moments later carrying a tray that had a large subway sandwich and a martini on it.

Closer to her house she had set up an impressive garden with row upon row of assorted fruits and vegetables. Due to it being situated close to a river, a decision Amy prided herself on, her garden's yield was often plentiful. In fact, harvesting her garden was set to be Amy's first task for the day. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith her tools in hand, Amy started digging into the rich earth to gather the fruits (and vegetables) of her labor, the effort of continuously bending down and standing back up bringing a light sheen of sweat to the plump woman's flushed face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gotta do some hard work every-*huff*-now and again\", panted Amy as she loaded a basket with some freshly pulled carrots.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn hour had passed since Amy started harvesting her tasty crop, filling up quite a few baskets before she started to feel pretty hungry.

And, like every time she did so, she grumbled all the way as she climbed the stairs. Unfortunately, flight spells didn't really come that easily to her, and teleporting herself was a lot more difficult than teleporting others. So she had to move using her feet like all the other non-wizards in the world. Truly, it was one of Mogoria's greatest injustices.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt least, in a room near the top of the tower, she was able to summon up some breakfast. She'd made a deal with the Queen that in return for keeping the kingdom safe, the royal chefs would prepare her 3 square meals every day. And, because of her mastery of summoning, she was able to bring the food straight from the kitchen and into her tower. Today's meal was a rather large omelet, filled with all sorts of meats inside the perfectly cooked egg. Amy dug into the food with aplomb. Sure, it might have theoretically been possible to teleport the food straight into her stomach, but the royal chefs were among the best cooks in the land. Not tasting their food would be such a waste!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy finished her meal, letting out an unladylike burp. Amy didn't really follow social niceties unless in the presence of someone important. She then let out a contented sigh, rubbing her soft stomach. It was no secret that she'd been getting rounder, eating nothing but rich food all day. Again, it wasn't really a big concern of Amy's. So long as she could get better at summoning, why should she care how big she got?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy then turned her mind to the task at hand. She headed out of the room where she had her meals and climbed the final staircase to the roof, where she had been meticulously inscribing a summoning circle for the past month. It was easy enough to call up inanimate objects like food with a simple spell, but calling upon stronger entities took a lot of hard work to get right. Even after completing the circle, Amy had spent a week going over it again, making sure that not a single line was out of place.

Her belly was a round globe, looking rather stuffed, and upon it sat 2 pairs of fat, heavy breasts. The figure had a double chin, which lead to a porcine face. Literally porcine; the figure had a pig's snout, and was looking rather displeased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course I get summoned in the middle of a meal...\" the figure muttered, before standing up.

Not that surprising, really; after all, she had summoned something directly into her stomach just before summoning Hoggrah. What was currently occupying her stomach was a Pit Rat. They were noted for living in holes in the ground and for consuming large quantities of food as if their stomach was bottomless (hence the name). The idea was that the pit rat in her stomach would eat enough food to allow space for even more food. Then, once the contest was over, the rat would be digested away. Sure, she'd probably gain a lot of weight after all was said and done, but Amy wouldn't have declared an eating contest if she had been worried about her waistline.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo, the main worry here was if Hoggrah figured her plan out before the contest was over. Amy was pretty sure that Hoggrah wasn't skilled in detection magic, but one could really never tell with demons. At any rate, if Hoggrah discovered Amy's \"edge,\" then things could go really badly. After all, having outside help in a one-on-one contest would probably be considered cheating. And if there's one things demons hated (even more than paladins), it was being cheated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo Amy shoveled food into her mouth, much of it consumed by the pit rat as soon as it exited her esophagus. At any rate, the die was cast.

Then, Amy intoned the final word of the summoning spell, and a loud peal of thunder occurred along with a bright flash of blue light, which Amy instinctively shielded her eyes against with her arms. Moments later, she lowered her arms, and looked at the circle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding in the circle was a woman, a little shorter than Amy was. Her skin was a light blue color, with her eyes and hair sharing a darker hue of blue. The woman's hair was done up in a series of elaborate braids that were whipped around by the gusts of wind that accompanied her. The woman had a perfect hourglass shape, with breasts the size of her head, a waist that narrowed slightly before flaring out into wide hips and round yet firm buttocks and thighs. The woman's flesh was soft, but seemed perfectly, deliberately proportioned, and only served to enhance her beauty. Her figure was clad in a white sari that held back her bust and a white wrap-around skirt, an ensemble that left her soft torso and her meaty legs on display. Amy could honestly say that the being before her was the most beautiful being she had ever lad her eyes on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I assume that you are the one who called me, Sorceress? I am Jasmine, Genie of the Western Winds. For what purpose have you summoned me?\" the blue woman asked, her voice distant and commanding, like so many nobles that Amy had to interact with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Before we get to that, a gift,\" Amy replied, holding out her hand and summoning into her hands a silver necklace with sapphires worked into it. She then proffered it to the genie, going down on one knee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJasmine then squealed with delight, causing Amy to glance up curiously. The genie was slipping the gift onto her neck, her eyes dancing from gemstone to gemstone. Finally, she looked back at the summoner. \"Do you know how rare it is to receive gifts nowadays? People think that just because they find me, they're entitled to wishes. As if I don't have better things to do with my time!\" The genie was now speaking in a rougher, less formal tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJasmine then seemed to realize that she had dropped her act, and hastily resumed it with a haughty clearing of her throat. \"I accept your gift, Sorceress Amy Gainsworth,\" she said. Amy wasn't surprised that the genie knew her name; beings of her power had ways of figuring that stuff out. \"As such, I will grant you a boon. Name one wish you have, and I will grant it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was it. Amy had been preparing for this day for years. She had learned the summoning spell. She had worked at improving her skill at summoning so that she would be able to use the spell. She had learned what kind of gift would most likely please one of the genies. And now, finally, she would get her wish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy took in a breath, before saying, \"Jasmine, I wish...\"</span></div></div>",

I mean, your wish-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy sighed. \"Look. I know it seems petty. But a few years back, John the Royal Baker, Gaia bless his soul, passed away. And the new guy, he tries so hard, but his apple pies just lack that... something. So I want to eat the best-tasting apple pie there ever was.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJasmine shrugged. A wish was a wish after all. The genie waved her hands around in front of her body, before pointing at a nearby table. With a popping sound, a pie appeared there. \"Your wish has been granted,\" Jasmine said, without much fanfare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy bounced a little has she moved over towards the table, her soft body jiggling a little. She then inhaled deeply, taking in the pie's aroma. \"Oh my gods... This smells amazing...\" Amy gasped, a line of drool running down her face. She then summoned a fork and knife to her hand, carefully cut a piece of the pie, and brought it to her mouth. The pie, as specified, was the perfect apple pie. The taste was heavenly, something that couldn't be put into words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy instead just cut out another piece, more hastily this time, and crammed it into her mouth. Jasmine watched the spectacle curiously, a look of bewilderment on her face. Amy suddenly realized that, and turned to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You haven't dismissed the summoning spell yet,\" Jasmine explained. \"I can't go home if you can't do that.\"</span></div></div>",

Food tastes better when it's shared, you know?\" Amy replied, cutting a piece and offering it to Jasmine. The genie levitated the piece of pie off of the fork, and brought it to her mouth. Suddenly, Amy's reactions made a lot more sense to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This really IS good!\" Jasmine gasped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, right!\" Amy replied, excitedly. Jasmine moved over next to Amy, and the two made short work of the pie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two stood there for a moment, looking down at the empty pie tin. Jasmine then turned to Amy, a mischievous look in her eye. \"You know, I think I may have misheard your wish. Are you sure you didn't wish for the perfect apple pie<b>s</b>?\" she asked, with an emphasis on the plural.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy looked at Jasmine for a moment, her smile going wider. \"I... I think I did, Jas,\" Amy replied. She then paused. \"Oh, I mean, Jasmine-\" she started, worried that she was offening the genie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry about it. I'm fine with friends calling me Jas,\" Jasmine interrupted, causing the smile to return to Amy's face. Jasmine then waved her hands again, and suddenly there was a pile of pies in the center of the room. The two women took little time in heading over to them, Amy dropping her utensils and going at the pies with her bare hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - - - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took a while, but between the sorceress's sweet tooth and the genie's gut, the two girls were able to eat every pie that Jasmine had summoned. They both were, of course, extremely bloated afterwards. Amy's mage's robe rose over the expanse of her belly, which now sat upon her soft, exposed thighs. Jasmine's perfect hourglass figure now had a a bloated ball of flesh that ruined the hourglass effect. Not that Jasmine seemed to care. She caressed her engorged gut for a little, before moving over to Amy and moving her robe further up her belly, revealing it to the air. She then started to rub it, causing Amy to gasp with pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter massaging Amy's belly for a while, Jasmine got back up. Already, her supernatural body was processing the pie and starting to pile the extra fat on her butt and breasts, which were causing the genie's clothes to get tighter on her. \"This has been a lot of fun, Amy. But I think I should be getting back home now,\" Jasmine said.</span></div></div>",

Amy had found that her precise control of fire magic was rather handy that way. She then prepared herself a hearty breakfast, frying several eggs, rashers of bacon, and hash browns. All that food she was making was, of course, for research purposes only. The fact that she'd enjoy the large meal was only a secondary concern. As she tore into the meal, Amy thought about what she was going to do today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy's teacher had long theorized that a mage with greater body mass could more effectively wield destructive magic. She had gone on to try and build up her muscle mass, but Amy had decided to take a different approach. Amy had been experimenting over the past few months by repeatedly casting a fireball spell on stones, and marking down the results as her waistline grew. There was a slight increase to be sure, but nothing she could really call definitive. Amy hoped to finally discover if her theory was right, one way or another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy finally finished her breakfast with a loud burp, her stomach bulging against the fabric of her robes. Amy let her breakfast digest a bit first, before heading over to a small scale that magically sensed her weight. 165 lbs, it told her. Marking down that info in a small book that she'd been keeping her records of this experiment in, Amy then moved out of the tower in which she made her home and into the yard surrounding it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy focused a little, and with a cry, cast an earth spell that rose a boulder out of the ground. Amy used a few measuring spells to determine that it was similar to the other rocks that she'd been casting the fire spell on. A few minutes later, she was sure that it was. Amy was excited, but that didn't excuse sloppy work, after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Amy incanted a fireball spell. Her hand began to glow, and from it a globe of red flames sprung forward towards the boulder. There was a loud BOOM and a lot of dust. Amy waited for the dust to settle, hoping that the rock beyond was destroyed.</span></div></div>",

All those skinny witches and wizards who had mocked her ideas would have to eat their own words once they realized that they'd been looking at magical strength all wrong!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA thought then occurred to Amy.

But then again, this was knowledge that she could maybe use herself to focus on her own goals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy thought about the dilemma as she cooked and then consumed her rather large lunch.

Normally, she would have been attending to the different variables of her experiment, but with her accomplishment today she felt that she'd earned an afternoon off. Plus, it gave her the time to ruminate on her decision.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't take her that long to decide that she had to share this with somebody. This wasn't the kind of discovery one kept to oneself; the results of Amy's discovery could change the very way that magic was performed on Mogoria itself! Besides which, what if she died before the information spread? She was a sorceress; it was entirely possible that she'd meet her end at the spell of another wizard, a summoned monster, or worse. No, she had to tell someone. But who to tell?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Amy thought on the decision, she decided to draw up a hot bath. She always thought better when she was soaking. She headed into the bathing room of her tower, where an enormous stone tub sat in the middle. Amy first used a spell that filled the tub with water. She then magically lit a fire under the tub, and in no time at all some steam began to rise from the water. Amy smiled as she shrugged off her robe. It had taken only a basic water and fire spell to do what she just did, and she'd barely used any of her mana at all to cast them both. Just one more point showing that her theory was sound.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter thinking about her theory, Amy looked down at her body. Her breasts had become bigger in the months following the experiment, and she ran her fingers along her wide hips and fleshy thighs. They were both soft to the touch. She couldn't actually see them, due to how far out her belly was protruding. It was still stuffed full of the large lunch that she had just eaten, but quite a lot of its mass was pure fat. Amy smirked as she now rubbed her belly; who knew that the stomach was the biggest generator of magical power in the body?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat thought brought her back to her dilemma. Amy continued to think on it as she slid into the tub, her bulk causing some of the water to overflow the tub and splash down on the floor. Amy could come up with two main ways she could present her information. First off, she could share it with a few of her closest friends. She'd been keeping them in the loop about her experiments (they had noticed her growing gut, after all), and after some of the favors they'd done for her, it would be nice to help them back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen again, she could also present her findings to the Mogorian Circle of Sorcerers. There would be those among the Circle that would dismiss their work, but if Amy could convince enough of the wizards on the Circle that what she had discovered was true, then the next generation of Mogoria's mages would be fatter and more powerful then ever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy thought about both options for a while as she soaked in the hot water, rubbing her bulging belly.</span></div></div>",

She decided to go for a more casual sort of clothing for the afternoon, putting on a loose cotton shirt that went partway down her gut, and a skirt that was starting to feel kind of tight. After dressing herself, Amy went into her study, where she began composing two letters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne was to Lietha, a woman of human and elvish descent. Amy's teacher and Lietha's teachers had been good friends, and consequently the sorcerer's apprentices had spent time together. Lietha, unlike Amy, studied transformation magic. She had long blonde hair, pointed ears, and the slim body that was vogue among wizards. Well, not entirely; her breasts and hips gave her an exaggerated hourglass shape, one that wasn't quite wide enough to be considered scandalous. Although it might end up widening, if Lietha agreed with Amy's conclusions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other letter was addressed to Brianna, a young woman who up until last year had been Amy's apprentice. Brianna had brown hair, blue eyes, and an excess of enthusiasm for everything that she did. Brianna had helped Amy some with her grand experiment, and had consequently left Amy's tower after her graduation with pear-shaped hips and a bigger bottom. Not that Brianna had seemed to mind all that much; her excitement for what the experiment could mean nearly matched Amy's own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer letters composed (both asking the recipients to meet her for dinner at her tower tonight), Amy sent them flying away with a seeking spell. It probably wouldn't take too long for her to get a reply; Lietha and Brianna lived fairly close by, after all.</span></div></div>",

She could make a record of it in her grimoire and then if something was to happen to her or she changed her mind, she could share it with the world. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a groan, she moved to her study and set to work. First, she ensured her grimoire was properly enchanted so that only she could read it. Then she set about copying her research and results to the grimoire. Once everything was copied, Amy disposed of the rest of her notes. That way only she knew of this discovery. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next step was to make use of this knowledge. If Amy wanted to truly be the most powerful sorceress in the land, she also needed to be the fattest and that could take some time. She could do it the old fashioned way and simply eat more and move less. It might draw some suspicion, but it would be no trouble to order the kitchen staff to increase her meal sizes. It would take some time, but it was the simplest and probably safest way. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the other hand, she was a sorceress. She had great knowledge of the arcane arts and access to the Great Archive. There was bound to be something magical that could make her fatter. Be it a spell or ritual, maybe a spirit or a demon, or maybe some relic in a ruin somewhere. IT would be great practice in the magical arts that Amy would always welcome, exciting, and overall faster. On the other hand it posed more risks to herself and that someone might suspect something was up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter thinking long and hard, Amy decided what she would do. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

After a few hours of pouring over her months experiments, trying to discover a pattern to the data, Amy was forced to conclude that she couldn't find any. There seemed to be a slight correlation between the amount of fat on her body and the amount of power her fireballs packed, but it wasn't strong enough to definitely say anything. And Amy knew that if she wanted her theory to stand up to the scrutiny of the mages on the High Council, she'd have to have results that were much more conclusive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that, Amy took a look at something else that was beginning to concern her; her expenses. Between the lavish meals she'd been eating at the general cost it took to maintain a tower, her funds were beginning to run dry. Even the royal salary she was earning wasn't quite enough to cover everything. Amy had tried to appeal to the finance minister of the kingdom to increase her pay, but the musty old dwarf had apologized and said that money was tight everywhere. After looking over her ledger, trying to see what things she might be able to do without, she sighed and set it down. She was just too accustomed to her lifestyle, and couldn't imagine doing without anything. Which meant she'd have to find a way to make more money, and only one way leapt to her mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy despised adventuring. She really did. She had delved into a few ruins and goblin caves after finishing her apprenticeship, as most young mages did. Everything about the whole enterprise she found revolting. It was tiring, dirty, dangerous work, and one was expected to eat lightly while doing so. However, the treasure that one found in an undiscovered tomb or a dragon's hoard would be an awfully convenient way to solve Amy's money problems. And until those were solved, she wouldn't be able to continue her experiments.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she looked around her tower for odds and ends that would be useful while adventuring, Amy thought about how she should go about the enterprise. Mainly, if she should try and go it alone or not. If she searched a ruin on her own and found some treasure, she'd be able to keep all of it for herself. But splitting the treasure with a party also meant splitting the risk, in case she ran into something that her magic couldn't work on. She made her decision after she had gotten everything ready.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After leaving her tower, Amy followed the road into town. She'd put on an adventuring robe, which was a plain but sturdy garment. The belt that cinched it around her chubby waist was rather fancy though, with gold embroidery and a silver buckle. Tied to the belt was a magical pouch that was much bigger on the inside than it looked, in which Amy had stored the rest of her adventuring supplies. With her, she carried a solid oak staff topped with a carved ruby. She looked every bit the adventuring mage, albeit one who was chunkier than most adventurers usually were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she reached town, she made her way to the most popular destination for adventurers, the Dancing Goblin Tavern. She could smell it even before she saw the building. It took Amy a few moments to work up the nerve to go inside. Not because she was afraid, but because a part of her was still trying to find any other way she could make money other than adventuring. When she had determined that, no, she had to do this, Amy headed into the building with a sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike it usually was, the tavern was filled with all sorts of different people. There were a couple of elves who were playing cards at a table in the back, a group of gnomes appeared to be playing a game involving dice, and onstage a few bards were singing a song about adventuring. After looking over the room, two possibilities for companions became immediately apparent to Amy. Amy was an excellent magician, but terrible at hand-to-hand combat. Therefore, she needed someone who knew how to fight up close with her. The first possibility was a trio of dwarves who were currently being served drinks by the goblin bartender. The other was to be found at a table where an orc and a barbaric-looked blonde woman were engaged in a drinking contest.</span></div></div>",

Currently, Amy could only really see the woman's blonde hair, since many of the bar's patrons were in the way. Said patrons would let out a loud cheer whenever a drink was taken. Amy had just made it to the edge of the crowd when they all gasped loudly. Amy peeked through to see that after having one drink too many, the orcish competitor had passed out. There was a final loud cheer, and some patrons handed coins over to others, the results of bets made on who would win.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the crowd dispersed, Amy got a better look at the woman. The blonde got a good look at Amy too, and in a flash she had gotten up and wrapped Amy in a bone-crunching hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Amy! Is good to see you!\" she shouted in a thick accent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good to see you too Helga...\" Amy wheezed, the breath driven out of her lungs. She now remembered who the blonde woman was. Her name was Helga Bearpaw, and back when Amy had been adventuring Helga had been one of her companions. Helga was a barbarian woman from the Bear Tribe in the Northern glacier, and one of the fiercest warriors that Amy had ever known. Berserkers from the Northern Tribes had a reputation as some of the deadliest warriors around, and Helga had lived up to that reputation back when Amy had adventured with her years ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Helga released her hug and stepped back, Amy got a good look at her. Helga's unkempt blonde hair swirled about her head and fell to her back. Her skin was incredibly pale, and was marked all over with blue ink. Helga's face, chest, arms, abdomen, and legs all had designs tattooed on them; the different marks indicated how many enemies she had slain, if Amy remembered what Helga had told her correctly. Helga was currently wearing a fur bikini top and bottom; the Northerners all had developed high body temperatures to help them survive in the frigid conditions of the glacier, and all tended to wear skimpier clothes when in the Southern territories so that they would overheat. This left most of Helga's body on display. Said body was covered in a layer of fat, though Amy knew that under that soft tissue were incredibly powerful muscles. Helga's butt and thighs were definitely the biggest parts of her, which gave her a distinct pear-shaped look. Her belly was also soft, her breasts were pretty big, and her arms were thick due to the powerful muscles she'd needed to develop to swing her giant axe effectively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So? What brings you here? Thought you were done adventuring,\" Helga asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... I'm... kind of out of money...\" Amy sighed after a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I know where it went,\" Helga responded with a smirk, poking Amy's round belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't really have any room to talk,\" Amy grumbled back. Her response just made Helga laugh out loud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Relax! Just joking! So, you need money, hm? Well, Helga knows where some might be found...\" the barbarian woman said slyly.</span></div></div>",

If a gain that big didn't affect her magic at all, then it looked like her Master's theory about magic being affected by the caster's body was wrong after all. It took her the rest of the morning to finish her conclusion. She then set the journal down and sat down herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy idly drummed her fingers on her belly as she ruminated on the past few months. She'd invested quite a lot of time and effort into this line of research, and not seeing it pan out was really disappointing. There was also the matter of her excess weight. While the acolytes down at the Temple of Gaia might have been fine with bigger bodies, wizardly society tended to look down on fatter magicians. Amy couldn't begin to guess why, but she supposed that she should probably at least try to get her thinner body back.</span></div></div>",

Her shield was made of leather, marked with the Earth-symbol that signified her connection with Gaia. She then took her time to don her chainmail armor, and noted that it was getting a little tight on her. She was going to either have to get a new set made or get this set enchanted with a spell that would allow it to grow bigger. That could probably wait, though. Finally, Amy was ready, and headed into the main Temple of Gaia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the main temple, Amy soon found Mother Sucressa, the High Priestess of her order. The high priestess was, like most other high-ranking members of Gaia's clergy, extremely fat. It was mostly hidden under the ornate robes of office that she wore, but Sucressa couldn't hide how large she was. Indeed, why should she hide away a blessing from the gods? Sucressa's seat was a huge stone throne carved by the dwarves to specifically hold her bulk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, Sir Gainsworth!\" Sucressa said with a smile, addressing Amy by her title. \"Gaia's blessing be upon you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And upon you, Mother,\" Amy replied, striking a salute.

The village in question, Telmah, is near the border of Mogoria. You'll probably need to ride for at least a day to reach it,\" Sucressa answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy nodded. Trolls were dangerous foes, but due to the strength of Mogoria's armies and Gaia's holy order, they had mostly been pushed out of the kingdom and were mostly a problem for those villages that were on the fringes where it was more difficult to move an army quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well then. I shall go and protect this village in Gaia's name,\" Amy said resolutely. She then offered one more salute to the High Priestess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSucressa returned the salute, saying, \"Gaia's blessings be upon you, Child.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>- - - - -</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the High Priestess said, the trip to Telmah was fairly long and tedious. Fortunately, Amy was able to get a horse to make the trip shorter. The steed she had taken was a large and powerful charger, bred to carry the burden of warriors who tended to carry some excess weight. The scenery, fortunately enough, was lovely. It was mid-Spring, and Gaia's touch could be seen all over the kingdom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough, Amy arrived at Telmah, and not a moment too soon. In fact, she saw smoke rising above the village before she was even able to see the buildings  that made up the quaint settlement. Spurring her steed on the greater speed, Amy soon arrived in the center of town, where she could see a troll wreaking havoc. The monster was currently holding a young man up by his ankles, licking its lips ominously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe troll was about as tall as Amy was, with green skin that was dotted in some place with warts. This troll was a she, having round breasts on display. She was a mix of toughness and softness, with muscled arms and legs and a round stomach that seemed to be bouncing around. It took Amy a moment to realize that the troll had swallowed someone whole!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoving quickly, Amy got off her horse and grabbed her sword and shield. She then let out a loud shout of \"DROP HIM!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe troll turned to look at her new foe, and dropped the young man that she had grabbed. \"Heh. Szo the humies fin'lly szent a fighter?\" the troll asked, her voice raspy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm here to end your reign of terror!\" Amy replied, before moving in to engage the thing. The troll followed suit, hefting a large axe in two hands. Amy struck first, wounding the creature in its thigh. The troll roared and swung her axe, but Amy was able to intercept it with her shield, before striking back with her sword again. This was how the battle went; Amy making quick strikes then blocking the inevitable counterblow. It was clear that the troll had no real experience fighting a real warrior, and her frustration was mounting. Finally, the troll stepped back and raised her axe with the intention of bringing it down with enough force to cleave Amy's shield in two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy saw her chance, and brought her sword across the troll's bulging midsection with all of her strength. The troll let out a loud scream as her stomach was cut open, and the person who had been trapped inside, a young girl, tumbled out. Amy then brought her sword back and rammed it into the troll's heart. The troll stumbled back a few paces before falling over onto the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer opponent down for the count, Amy turned her attention to the girl she had just cut out of the troll's gut. Her clothes had rotted away and her skin was burned, but the girl was still alive. \"A doctor! I need a doctor!\" Amy shouted. It didn't take long for the village's healer, an old man, to hobble over. He sprinkled some healing potion over the girl's injured form before having his apprentice, the young man who the troll had been holding earlier, pick the girl up and take her away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you for your most timely arrival, Paladin,\" the doctor said, turning to her. \"Any later, and I don't think young Mina would have survived.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just wish I could have been here earlier to spare her that pain,\" Amy replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know the feeling. My name's Dorm,\" the old doctor said, offering a hand to Amy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am Sir Amy Gainsworth, of the Order of Gaia. It is a pleasure to meet you, Dr. Dorm,\" Amy replied, shaking Dorm's hand. She then walked over to the troll's body, looking it over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Something wrong?\" Dorm asked, confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Unfortunately, it isn't so easy to kill a troll. Look,\" Amy said, rolling the monster over with her sword. Already, the horrific wounds that Amy had delivered to the troll's belly and breast were healing, and a lot of the shallower cuts she had made early on in the battle had disappeared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"By the Gods... How do we kill them?\" Dorm gasped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fortunately, Gaia has blessed those of my order with the ability to finish these foul things off for good. It does look disturbing though, so look away if you feel you must,\" Amy explained. She then took off her chainmail shirt, her chubby torso now covered only by the cotton shirt she wore underneath it. Amy then took the troll by the feet, opened her mouth wider than should have been possible, and began to swallow. She tried to do so as quickly as possible, since the troll's flavor was truly repulsive. The troll's gut, while smaller than before, was still rather round and thus hard to take down, but Amy persevered. Finally, it was done, the troll safely taken into Amy's now distended belly, which peeked out from under her shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took Amy a moment to get to her feet, now burdened by the troll in her stomach. Still, she was able to do so. She then turned to Dorm, who was struck speechless. \"Many of the evil monsters of the world have enchantments which makes them hard to kill. Gaia has in turn blessed my order with the ability to return them to the natural cycle. Though as you can see, it is a litte... urp... inefficient. If it wouldn't be too much trouble, might you direct me to an inn where I may rest? I will also need accommodations for my horse.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah... yes, of course. Follow me, Sir Gainsworth,\" Dorm said, leading her down a street. Fortunately, it seemed like the inn wasn't too far away, and the innkeeper even gave Amy a room for free as thanks for her fending off the troll attack on town. The bed was sturdy enough to hold Amy's weight, and after stripping down to her underclothes, she fell asleep on it, her gut still churning away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>- - - - -</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning, Amy woke up feeling refreshed. She pattered her belly, which seemed to have gotten quite a lot of new padding. In fact, all of her seemed to be more well rounded, she found, as she tried to put her clothes on. Her cotton clothes didn't quite fit anymore, her stomach peeking out of her shirt and her trousers fraying a little as they attempted to contain her bigger hips and butt. Amy sighed, deciding to try and seek out someone in town who could make her new clothes. Gaia willing, the tailor hadn't been eaten before she had gotten here. She'd also need new armor, she decided; her chain mail had been tough to get on the day before, and now it would likely be impossible to do so. Amy still decided to take her sword and shield with her; it was just a smart idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she headed out of the inn, she ran into a young man. It took her a moment to recognize him as the apprentice doctor whom she had rescued yesterday. \"Good morning, Sir Gainsworth! I'm Mark, and first I'd like to thank you for saving my life and my sister's life yesterday,\" he said. He didn't quite meet Amy's gaze as he spoke, and there was a luminescent blush on his face as he did so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm just glad that the both of you are safe,\" Amy replied, a smile on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! Uh... Actually, there's something I need to tell you!\" Mark said.</span></div></div>",

And where have they been attacking from?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... uh... To tell you the truth, I was just sent to tell you to see the Council of Elders. They're meeting around noontime in that building in the center of the village, so...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then I'll be there,\" Amy said, cutting off Mark's rambling explanation. \"Actually, it's good you're here. Would you mind showing me around the village? There are a few things that I require before seeing the Council of Elders. Or would I be keeping you from something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-oh! No, not at all! Master's looking after Mina, and I don't think he'd object to me helping you at all!\" Mark replied in a voice that was just a little too loud, desperately trying to keep his eyes looking squarely at Amy's eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Relax, Mark. I'm not that scary, am I?\" Amy asked, amusement dancing in her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-well no! I... I mean, uh... Where did you say you needed to go?\" Mark asked, his face getting redder by the second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy let out another sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - - - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy's first stop was by the tailor. A plump little lady dwarf, she gladly helped Amy find some new clothes to encompass her expanded form. Amy actually had to argue with the tailor to pay her; the dwarf didn't want to take money from the savior of the village, a view that Amy disagreed with. They eventually compromised on a discount, and Amy left the tailor's shop more exhausted than she thought she would be. Nonetheless, her new trousers accentuated her butt nicely (at least, she assumed they did. When she asked Mark to comment, all he did was stutter and stammer and go even redder in the face, which Amy decided was as close to a compliment as she was going to hear from the flustered young man). The button-up cotton shirt also fit nicely, with room for her belly and breasts to expand more (which very well might happen, depending on how many trolls there were).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark next showed her to the blacksmith. Her visit here wasn't as fruitful, since the blacksmith, a stout-looking elven man, had no experience crafting weapons or armor, mainly focusing on crafting tools for the farmers to use. The visit wasn't a complete waste of time, since the elf was still able to sharped her sword's blade, lending it a keen edge. This second visit was her last, and soon Mark showed her to the Council building before excusing himself to tend to his sister. Amy waved goodbye to him, before heading into the council room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - - - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were 5 people on the Council of Elders. Amy recognized old Doctor Dorm, sitting on the very rightmost seat of the council. The leader, another old man, stood up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you for meeting us, Sir Gainsworth. I am Jediah, Mayor of Telmah. May I also introduce Doctor Dorm, Mother Hannah, Senel, and May.\" As he spoke, Jediah indicted Dorm, then a chubby middle-aged woman, a crusty-looking dwarf, and a frail-looking elf. Amy nodded to each of them, also giving a small salute to Hannah, who she recognized as being a part of the Church of Gaia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's get to the point, Mayor, so that you may be rid of this menace once and for all. Where are the trolls?\" Amy asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Glad to hear your serious. The trolls come out of a pass high in the mountains to the West of the Valley. We used to have an old wall that kept monsters in that pass out, but we think they broke through it. We also don't want to send people to repair the wall, since they may just end up as Troll Food,\" Jediah said, his voice calm and even.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see. Is there anything else I need to know?\" Amy asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not that I can remember. Gaia go with you, Sir Gainsworth,\" Jediah replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - - - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately, Amy's horse was able to bear her newly fattened form with little difficulty, and so she rode towards the mountain pass, bearing only her sword and shield. Amy rode the horse for a while until she saw the wall that had been mentioned; there was indeed a huge hole that had been bashed through it. Big enough to let a troll through, but small enough that it could cause a horse problems to get through. Amy got off her horse now, and sent it galloping back to Telmah, knowing that the villagers would take care of it until her return, or her death.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy moved through the hole with little difficulty, breathing a little heavier than she usually did. Gaia's blessings allowed her champions to move well even with extra weight, but she'd still need time to fully adjust to it. Her clothes slightly dirty now, Amy moved up the mountain path at a steady pace. She had drawn her sword and readied her shield, ready for anything. For the longest time, it seemed like there was only her in the pass, even the birds quiet. Then, gradually, she heard voices in the distance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoving as slowly as she could, Amy came upon the troll settlement. When she finally say it, she gasped.</span></div></div>",

Still, Amy counted four trolls loitering in it. There were five tents, but Amy had already dispatched one of the trolls already. She brought her hand to her belly as she thought. The only way she could know for sure that the trolls were dead would be to digest them. However, she'd only ever swallowed two things at once. To make sure that the troll threat was eradicated, she would have to devour four trolls at once. Only Gaia would know if she could handle it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat then brought about another question; how should she get the trolls into her belly? The Paladin Oaths that she had sworn dictated that she face her foes in honorable combat. But this was four-versus-one, and more importantly, if she failed then the village suffered. Did honor really apply here? Amy could see a bend in the rock where she could easily launch an ambush against the trolls. The tight quarters would limit their movements, and give her the advantage. But ambushing wasn't exactly fair, was it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy would have to make her decision quickly. She could her the trolls conversing among themselves, deciding not to wait for their companion anymore.

Why should I put even more lives in danger? And why was I given this gift, if not to use it to the fullest?\" She patted her midsection, suddenly feeling hungrier. \"... praise Gaia,\" she muttered, almost forgetting it in her move to position her weighty body by the rock for her ambush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We wait fer Shrrptngue, ya? More trolls, more fun!\" said one, whose voice was raspy but high. Amy couldn't see, but guessed she was another female. \"Ugh, nah nah! She eat too many humies ag'n. Prolly take nap, git lost. We go, find 'er on way back,\" growled another troll. Taking one last peek, Amy saw a male who had the height of a tall human, and despite his girth, a warrior's build. Probably a leader. The other two were short for trolls, but plump, and seemed to defer to his order.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, it was now or never.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now - feast time!\" The leader Troll growled as Amy leapt from the rock. In the air her jaw opened wide and her instincts were on target, she mouthed the foul troll's head and her girth drew her down his thick frame, and she was jostled as he turned to face his assailant but that just made her slide down his chest, his round, hard belly, and soon she was stuffing his large feet into her mouth, all in all just a few seconds and yet somehow, her stomach managed to just contain all that troll meat, which wasn't that bad now that she'd had a sample before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a mighty heave of her paladin's muscles, she swung herself to her feet, and her newly-expanded stomach thwacked the next troll, the argumentative she-troll, who landed square on her back. Wasting no time, Amy grabbed this troll by her bare feet and began to stuff her inside, and though Amy's prey had some hips designed to carry a liter of trolls, the hungry paladin did her work and swallowed, and pulled, and swallowed, and though it took longer and felt like ages, Amy now felt completely stuffed with two squirming warriors in her gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith fury in her eyes, she turned to the remaining targets. Horrified, they shrieked some Troll word she didn't understand and stuck their wooden clubs at her, as if to poke a ravenous dog away, but before she realized what she was doing her teeth had snapped the weapons in two and, pulling their wrists together, she began to devour them two at a time! She had to ignore the protests of her stomach and the doubt in her mind, and eat! If these monsters weren't digested, they'd surely come back with more... and she just concentrated her imagination on the idea of a score of trolls marching on a peaceful village, their fat bellies hungry for flesh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhy that image stirred her so, she could not tell. She put one hand to her dizzy head, wondering if she had dreamed what just happened, for she could barely remember... though the pain of a stomach twice as full as she had ever gotten it, brought her to reality. It was far too large for her to even come near reaching around, and though Gaia's gifts let her get shakily to a standing position, even she was shaking with so much mass in front of her, having to dramatically shift her stance to accommodate what was in her digestive tract.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... that's a whole camp in there,\" she sighed to herself. \"I can hardly believe it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In my six hundred years, I can't believe it either.\" Came a strange voice floating on the air. \"A Glutatdor'n, at last.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, who are you?

The current heir to Mogoria's monarchy was the eldest daughter of the king, the Princess Anastasia Mogoria, who had just turned 17. It was during the party celebrating her birthday, in fact, that the assassination attempt had occurred. A trio of hooded assailants had leapt from the ceiling, stabbed the princess's bodyguard (a veteran warrior named Mariel), and had nearly gotten to the princess herself before several soldiers had managed to overwhelm them with sheer numbers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It looks like Mariel will survive her injuries, but the wounds on her legs didn't heal right. She has had to retire,\" Sucressa explained, \"Which leaves the Princess without a bodyguard. The royal couple asked if there were any among our order who would be up to the task of ensuring that their daughter was safe. I recommended you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy's round face flushed with pride and embarrassment. \"Mother... I don't know what to say,\" she murmured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have served the Order of Gaia faithfully for many years, and have done your brothers and sisters proud. I do not doubt your skill and your compassion,\" Sucressa said, a smile on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When do I begin these duties?\" Amy asked. There was no need to ask if she would accept the deed; guarding the royal family was an honor that few ever did, and Amy was happy to take up that burden.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Today, if at all possible. Everyone wants the Princess to be protected as soon as possible,\" Sucressa answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then I shall prepare myself for this new duty. Gaia's blessing be upon you, Mother Sucressa,\" Amy said, before turning to head to her room. There wasn't much to pack, but it was better to have that done quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>- - - - -</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few hours later, Amy found herself standing in front of the Princess's room. A servant had led her to a room down the hall where she would be staying, so that she would be close to her charge in case of trouble. Amy was actually very nervous. Princess Anastasia was known far and wide to be a rather generous and kind young woman, and Amy hoped that she would make a good first impression. Slowly, she raised a hand to knock on the door of the Princess's room.</span></div></div>",

She spent so much time either cooped up inside the temple or adventuring that she didn't get enough time to explore the city as she would have wanted. Still, she couldn't take too long. After all, she had a very important meeting to get to! So after some time, Amy found herself in front of the Dancing Goblin Tavern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she headed inside, Amy immediately saw both of the people she was meeting. One stood around 4 and half feet tall, with a stocky frame and a bushy grey beard. This was Rock Steelbeard, a dwarf who had long been a friend of Amy's. He was wearing a suit of chainmail armor, and had a shield fastened to his back and an axe hanging at his hip. He was currently having a pint of beer and joking with Amy's other companion, an elven lady named Rose. Rose stood nearly six feet tall, towering over both Rock and Amy both. She had a slender figure with small breasts, though her hips flared out dramatically enough that no one would mistake her for a man. Said figure was easily seen through her leather armor. Rose had no visible weapons on her, but Amy didn't doubt that the roguish elf had several daggers stashed away on her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah! There you are! We were afraid we'd have to leave without you!\" Rock shouted as he saw Amy approach the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was right on time, as I always am!\" Amy replied indignantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you say so. Any, since Amy's here, Rose, why don't you show us that map that you found?\" Rock asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"With pleasure,\" Rose said, and with a flourish produced an old-looking parchment out of nowhere. It was a trick that Amy desperately wanted to know how to do; there were a lot of miracles that being a priestess of Gaia allowed her to perform, but pulling objects out of thin air wasn't one of them. The group looked down at the parchment, which as Rock had mentioned, was a map. Specifically, it was a map to...</span></div></div>",

Furthermore, the Badlands were just not very nice to look at. There was only dust and rock in all directions as far as the eye could see. Amy knew that if it weren't for Rose's flawless internal compass, she would likely be wandering in this desolate corner of the kingdom for a long time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut at last, after hours of hiking through barren wilderness, a speck appeared on the horizon.As they approached, they soon saw the speck was the front entrance of a large ruined building. Strange designs ran all around the walls on the building, and a stone slab with old writing on it had been placed over the entrance to the ruins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's some old writing. Can't make anything of it,\" Rose murmured, frowning slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's from a language that isn't spoken anymore,\" Amy said. \"Fortunately, I studied it as part of my training. It says 'This is the final resting place of Gloria, Mightiest of mages, Slayer of dragons, and Queen of the world. Beware, ye who enter to steal from her.'\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds humble,\" Rock quipped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... I guess we should enter. No time like the present,\" Amy said. She stepped forward into the tomb, with Rock and Rose at her side. The entrance hallway led to some stairs that descended into darkness. Rock, whose dwarven eyes allowed him to see in the dark, peered down into the abyss. \"Looks safe so far,\" he stated, before stepping down the stairs. Rose made a flourishing motion, and from out of thin air a small wand appeared. The elf swished the wand, and a small light appeared on the end of it. Meanwhile, Amy said a short prayer which caused a shining halo to appear over her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThus, the three headed down into the tomb.

Like... pottery shattering.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, probably just the vibrations. I'd wager this door was set to ol' Gloria's heft herself!\" Rock joked, giving it one last shove as the massive iron door swung fully open.

Amy rubbed her belly and silently prayed. Though neither could see Rose, they were sure she had hidden in the shadows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great... now I hear them breakings, too,\" Rock drew his axe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm... I smell something... good. Reminds me of the kitchens back in the temple.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Probably Gloria's perfu- ack!\" Rock shouted in alarm, landing hard on his backside (only somewhat padded by his armor). \"Step lightly, lasses! I think I found what was making the noise... \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Amy blinked in disbelief, she saw that Rock seemed to have slipped in a puddle of melted butter! Other clay pots began to shatter around them, the gooey, yellow liquid pooling in the center of the chamber. First it formed a massive puddle, then as more of the fatty stuff came together, it rose up into a blob, finally forming a fat belly, well-rounded breasts, thick arms, and even what looked like a feminine face on a human head!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A butter beast... never thought I'd actually see one in person, they're not really a popular style,\" Amy said aloud, mostly stunned at the bizarre sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This ain't no butterknife, you dairy demon!\" Rock boasted, and though he managed to keep to his feet this time, his deadly axe merely swept through the butter beast's middle, as ineffective as if he had tried to cut water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please try to keep it busy, friends,\" Rose briefly appeared between them. \"There is an exit, though of course it's locked. And booby trapped.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You could be less of a sneak and stab it in a weak point,\" Rock growled, fending off the attack of one buttery hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm pretty sure the butter has no weak points,\" Rose sighed, tired of explaining the limits of her abilities. \"I'm a rogue, not a patissiere.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo sets of eyes were on Amy, who was calling upon a prayer of protection to keep pools of melty stuff from getting under her feet and slipping up her as they did Rock. \"Only one way to defeat a butter beast... \" she suddenly remembered, nervous at the sight of a big, gooey belly inching towards her.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As Rock did his best to keep the monster's attention and Rose attempted to disarm the trap that was keeping them locked in the room, Amy attempted to remember everything she knew about butter beasts. The basics came easy to her. Butter beasts were creatures of dark magic, the creation of a powerful arch-demon of the First Circle of Hell who had wanted to destroy Mogoria by using the very food it created to wipe out everyone living in the kingdom. The story went that Gaia herself battled the demon, while her mortal servants fought with the dairy and produce that the demon had cursed to attack the innocent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRemembering that battle caused Amy to remember how the demon's army had been thwarted. After Gaia had defeated the arch-demon, she'd tried to channel her Holy Energy into the world to disrupt the curse. However, the battle with the demon had weakened her. Things looked hopeless when one of the butter beasts had tried to kill one of Gaia's paladins by forcing itself into her body and destroying it from within. In her moment of despair, the paladin had prayed to Gaia, and the goddess had sent some of her energy to the Paladin despite believing that she had been lost. However, while pure divine energy had dissipated harmlessly around the creatures when channeled into the world directly, it was concentrated in those mortals who were faithful to her. Thus, the butter beast that had tried to kill the paladin was killed and the demonic taint quashed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, though many had attempted to destroy the demon's edible army after seeing how the paladin had done it, not everyone was able to channel Gaia's power. Though the creatures were destroyed, many had been cursed with a demonic taint and wasted away over the course of several days. That battle was remembered as one of the greatest triumphs of Gaia's Church and one of its most sorrowful tragedies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlashing back to the present, Amy saw the butter beast getting close to her. She was starting to get worried, very worried. That she could defeat the thing was without question. But would she end up cursed? It was said that dying to a demonic curse was one of the most agonizing ways to go, and that those who did so were forced to spend eternity in Hell whether they were good or evil. But if she didn't do this, then Rock and Rose would die for sure. And she wouldn't let that happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have no power here, monster!\" Amy shouted, grabbing the beast's attention. \"In the name of Gaia, I rebuke you!\" Hearing the name of the Goddess it hated the most, the beast reached out a slippery hand and forced it into Amy's mouth. She heard Rock shout out for her, but Amy help up her hand to stop him. Quickly now, the thing was entering her stomach, which was quickly expanding to accommodate it. Most other people's stomachs would have ruptured by now, but Gaia's blessings (and a habit of stuffing herself silly on feast days) kept that from happening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, the whole butter beast was inside of her. Amy's abdomen had swollen up like a balloon, her belly positively enormous. She had to lean on her staff just to keep herself upright; she'd overbalance and fall down if she didn't have it. Rock looked at Amy with a mixture of concern and amazement. Slowly, Amy began to recite a long prayer to Gaia, the words had to get out because it had been hard to breathe while the butter beast had been forcing its way into her stomach. The chant grew stronger as she continued with it, and the tip of her staff began to glow. Finally, there was a burst of light as Amy finished her prayer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the light had faded, it was clear that something was different. For one, Amy's belly wasn't quite as swollen as it had been. It was still stuffed, straining against the fabric of her robe, but not as much. Amy was also quite visibly exhausted, panting heavily and gripping her staff tightly. She started to sway, but before she fell she could feel Rock's strong arms catch her. She looked up to see his bushy brows furrowed with worry, as well as Rose looking quite concerned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Amy? Lass? Are ye okay?\" Rock asked.</span></div></div>",

She wanted to scream, but it felt like she couldn't gather the air in her lungs to do so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Rock and Rose knew something was wrong without Amy having to say anything. \"What the hell's happening?\" Rock asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRose frowned, and murmured, \"I think she's been cursed. I've seen symptoms like this before, but nothing this intense. Whatever foul magic was animating that beast is now tearing Amy's soul apart.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I figured it was something like that. Lass is to selfless for her own good,\" Rock said. There was a moment's silence, before Rock said, \"So what do we do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know,\" Rose said, for once in her life at a loss. \"I've never been that skilled in the healing arts, and I don't think the healing potions I brought with me will help her at all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRock then looked back at the door which led to the entrance. \"Well, we can't help, but we know someone who can.

Surely she's in good enough with the Earth Goddess to ask a for a miracle.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But will we be able to get there in time before the curse takes Amy's life?

It is said that it will never run out of food, and that those who eat of it will be cured of all injuries, sicknesses, and curses.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But we don't know if that's in here for sure,\" Rock said. \"And we don't know how many more traps and beasties lay between us and where it is in the tomb.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"True,\" Rose said, \"But I think there's a chance that we can find it quickly enough to save her life.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" said Rock, \"We need to decide what we're doing, and quick.\"</span></div></div>",

Said fruit was, in fact, what she would be delivering. Her cargo ship, the <i>Muffin</i>, was currently being loaded with crates of the things. Amy had already filled out the necessary paperwork, so all that was left was waiting for the cargo to be placed in the <i>Muffin's</i> hold. Not that she minded too much. She'd made 3 deliveries over the past 2 weeks, often sleeping in her ship's cramped quarters rather than a comfortable bed. Getting a chance to indulge herself was a rare luxury.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut sadly, all good things had to come to an end. Amy soon finished her tart, and got an alert on her wrist communicator not long after that indicating that all of the fruit containers had been loaded onto her ship.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, back the the grindstone,\" Amy sighed, getting up. She soon found herself at Dock 113A, where the <i>Muffin</i> sat. The ship itself wasn't too special; it had a cylindrical body that contained the cockpit, living quarters, and cargo bay, with two cylindrical engines on either side of it held to the main body by struts. Still, it was hers, and that counted for a lot. Amy headed into the ship, finding its only other crewmember, a TX-67 robot that she'd named Tex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All pre-flight checks have been done, Captain. The ship is ready to fly on your orders,\" Tex said in a robotic monotone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, Tex. Let's get out of here as soon as we get the okay from ground control,\" Amy replied, strapping herself into the pilot's chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will do, Captain,\" Tex stated, seating himself (well, itself, but Amy preferred to think of Tex as a him) in the co-pilot's seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe okay from ground control was given not long afterward, and the <i>Muffin</i> soon found itself leaving Earth's atmosphere and blasting off into space.</span></div></div>",

She'd have to be far away enough from the Sun's gravity to engage the <i>Muffin's</i> faster than light drives. Tex was silent, having been ordered to remain so by Amy, since she found talking disrupted her ability to concentrate on her piloting. Finally, the <i>Muffin</i> made it past Neptune, and the FTL indicator on her ship went green. Amy then pushed a button, and the stars all became a blur as her cargo ship became faster than the light that they emitted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy leaned back in her chair with a sigh, before getting up. \"I'm going to go take a nap. Haven't had a chance to sleep all day,\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Affirmative. I'll remain at the controls, Captain,\" Tex replied, moving over to the pilot's seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks. See you later,\" Amy yawned, heading towards her quarters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rest well, Captain,\" Tex said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe trip over to the <i>Muffin's</i> crew cabin wasn't that long at all, considering how small the ship actually was. Amy soon found the cot that she slept in, a space-saving measure so that an even bigger cargo bay could be fit into the <i>Muffin's</i> chassis. She stripped down to her underwear, setting her clothes aside to be washed later. Amy yawned again, clambered into the cot, and soon fell asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn alarm klaxon woke her up quickly. Amy wasn't sure how long it had been; it certainly hadn't been long enough for a decent nap. But emergencies waited for no one, so Amy rushed towards the bridge, not bothering with putting her clothes on. She found herself there within a minute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's going on?\" Amy asked with steel in her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We appear to have entered a magnetic storm, Captain. The sensors didn't pick it up until it was too late,\" Tex replied in his usual monotone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wonderful. What ELSE could go wrong?\" Amy grumbled.</span></div></div>",

Such motion could result in a concussion,\" Tex stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm fine, it's just... Those fruit we're carrying... They spoil really quickly, don't they,\" Amy sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The fruit will begin to spoil within 24 hours if not kept properly refrigerated,\" Tex replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And we're at least two days from the nearest repair station. At least, if the navigation equipment isn't on the fritz too,\" Amy grumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The navigation equipment appears to be functioning as intended, Captain,\" Tex said after looking over the ship's controls for a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that's <b>one</b> thing that's going our way, at least. Set us on a course for the nearest habitable world where we can repair,\" Amy said, getting out of the captain's chair and heading out of the cockpit. As she did so, her stomach rumbled, and she placed a hand on her bare belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you intend to dine, Captain?\" Tex asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. Might as well have some of that fruit. I mean, it's going bad anyway,\" Amy responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I would advise against that, Captain. That fruit is only recommended for human consumption if properly prepared. I do not know what kind of effects it will have on you if you eat it raw,\" Tex said, though his monotone voice made his concern sound like it wasn't a big deal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, we've already paid for'em. And I'll only have one or two anyway,\" Amy said, heading out before Tex said anything else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe trip to the storage bay at the back of the ship wasn't too long at all. As Amy entered it, she immediately noticed that the air wasn't very cold at all. The refrigeration unit really was broken after all. Wishing again that she'd paid more attention to her mechanical engineering classes back when she went to school, Amy approached one of the crates that the fruit was stored in. She stared at it a moment, as sensors in the crate identified her via her retinas, and then the top of the crate opened, with the fruit sitting inside the crate revealed to the world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fruits were perfect spheres, about as big as a tennis ball. The fruit's skin was red, with blue splotches dotting the skin's surface, and a small green stem on top. Amy grabbed on, the fruit slightly deforming as her fingers found purchase on its skin. Without further fanfare, Amy ate it at once, getting sticky red juice all over her mostly-naked body and white undergarments.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy later wished that she had taken Tex's advice, because without proper preparation...</span></div></div>",

Despite sitting at the crux of several important intragalactic travel routes, the Malphox system as a whole had a rather small permanent population, but did have quite a large number of travelers traveling through the area, so goods like the fruit filling up the hold was a safe delivery to the world. This particular trip was so safe that the most exciting thing to happen for Amy was that one of the lighting strips in the small passage connecting the bridge to the quarters had to be replaced, and Tex was more than capable of taking care of that. The job still made money though, enough to keep the <i>Muffin</i> flying for a while longer and that was just fine for Amy in any case.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExiting the ship, she oversaw the unloading of the crates, even though it wasn\u2019t really needed, she just didn\u2019t have anything else that needed doing at the time. Confirmation of the delivery was soon sent out through the galactic communication net, which was quickly followed by the credit transfer for the job competition. Amy reviewed the relevant notifications on her comm unit, and nodded after confirming everything was in order, which now left her the matter of whatever her next job might be. Almost as if on cue, another message pinged in her inbox. Opening it up, she saw that it was indeed an offer for a job, and it was even starting from here, but there wasn\u2019t any identity information about who was hiring her. Frowning, she saw that the client wanted to meet with her in a public location to discuss the specifics. Her frown deepened when she saw that the public location was a tavern located in the spaceport.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy hemmed and hawed about checking this offer out, it seemed kind of fishy, but it wasn\u2019t like it was happening in a dark alley or anything and if push came to shove, she had her upgraded blaster in easy reach on her hip. She checked in with Tex and let him know what she was heading off to do, before heading out in the sparse crowd outside the landing bays. She had to call up a relevant map in order to find this place, but soon enough was passing through the doors. She was momentarily taken aback at just how many people were packed into the building, and from where she was standing, she only saw a few other humans in the place, with the vast majority of the crowd being made up of various alien species.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy glanced around, but didn\u2019t see any obvious signs to whoever was supposed to contact her. Squaring her shoulders and keeping her head on a swivel, she made her way through the thronging crowd towards the bar. After ordering a mild drink, she made her way to one of the back corners; she felt safer having a wall at her back and a view that covered most of the rest of the interior, and settled in to wait for a while and see what came of it.</span></div></div>",
