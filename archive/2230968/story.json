            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The sun was beginning to set on another pretty day. You, the Champion of Galar, had finished packing up shop in Circhester and had flown out into the wilds to unwind and spend time with your Pok\u00e9mon. The Pok\u00e9mon League paid well, a very nice bonus once a year after you defend your title as champion. A once a year paycheck isn't enough to live off of. The League encouraged you to take on sponsorships to fill in that needed income, but you found the idea of being adorned in logos like Leon was to be distasteful. Your solution was to open up a caf\u00e9 to make money on the side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou took a flying taxi to the center of the wilds and had Blitzkreg haul you and your equipment right in front of the lake next to the stone pillar. You set up your tent while Blitz took a much needed nap. He would wake up at the smell of curry later. You released everyone else on your team to stretch and run around while you got to work preparing dinner. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpooky did her usual of clinging next to you. You loved your Gengar as much as she loved you. Actually, you think she loved you a little more than she should. She was a shiny Genger born in Kalos. The champion gave you a Gastly egg and everything needed to Mega Evolve her when she became a Gengar. Once the League caught wind of this they called you swiftly to inform you to NEVER Mega Evolve her during an official League Match. A trick like that wasn't available to anyone other than you and was considered too big of an advantage. You had no issue with it though. Spooky was plenty powerful on her own. She loved to help you cook when you were alone. She got a little jealous when you were with Moon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMalachite and Dio immediately began sparring. However, a one sided beat down was more appropriate of a term. Dio never let up. Dio was the proud son of the Dragon Totem from Alola and was larger than your average Kommo-o. Dio always lost to the likes of dragon and fairy types and to a lesser degree ice types. He was obsessed with becoming stronger and beat up Malachite often as a result. Thing was that he couldn't get any stronger. He was maxed out already. Malachite was used to it. She would sit there and let Dio wallop on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's where Tranquilizer stepped in. She was the peacemaker of the group and broke up the one-sidded sparring by hitting Dio with an Ice Beam attack followed by coiling around him. After Dio calmed down she would let go as Dio would storm off. Tranqil would slither to you and coil around you and rub up against you. It got in the way of your cooking actually... Spooky would peel her off with a little poison to persuade her. That would start it's own little battle as the two of them would race off to battle. Zippo would have to break that fight up himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZippo was inside the tent sippin on whiskey when he heard the chaos. He screwed the cap on and sprinted out side. Zippo called out to all the Pok\u00e9mon who immediately snapped to attention. He was the ring leader and they knew it. Zippo started to run some some basic drills to get everyone warmed up before a large exercise routine. You still remember the first time you laid eyes on him 13 years ago. Leon gifted you that Pok\u00e9mon and you knew the two of you would be partners for life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn all your reminising you finished your dinner and called everyone over. You served all the portions up and fed everyone. You always made so much that everyone was sleepy and resting at the end of it all. Sitting down on a stump you watched all your Pok\u00e9mon pile together and drift away with a happy smile. 13 long years and you were as happy as can be. The ring of your phone took you out of it as you jog away to avoid waking up your team. You had two phones, one was your Rotem phone, the one you used for social calls and personal stuff. The second was a flip phone used purely for business. Calls from the league and the police were made here. Who was calling?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Go for it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Main Characters:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>The Champion of Galar (\u2642)</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nA 23 year old male who's been the new undefeated champion since he took the title when he was just 10. He loves to explore and camp out in the wilds. When he isn't doing champion-related activites or out roughin'-it in the wilds, he can be seen running a caf\u00e9 in Circhester. <br>\r\nHis default team is as follows:<br>\r\n-Cinderace (\u2642) Nickname: Zippo. The team leader when it isn't you. He puts a lot of stress on himself and sneaks sips of alcohol when he isn't looking.<br>\r\n-Gengar (\u2640) Nickname: Spooky. A gift to you from the Champion of Kalos where she was born. She can Mega Evolve and is really clingy to the Champion.<br>\r\n-Milotic (\u2640) Nickname: Tranquilizer. The peacekeeper of the group. She breaks up fights between team members and is also clingy towards the Champion. Her competetive ability spawned a rivalry with Spooky.<br>\r\n-Galvantula (\u2642) Nickname: Blitzkreg (Blitz for short). Blitz is twice the size of a normal Galvantula at 5'2 in hieght. He's the pack mule of the group and the Champion uses him as a mount to travel. He loves to sleep and eat.<br>\r\n-Tyranitar (\u2640) Nickname: Malachite. A sadistic Pok\u00e9mon in battle but shy in person. She's this way because Dio bullies her frequently. <br>\r\n-Kommo-o (\u2642) Nickname: Dio. Son of the Dragon Totem of Alola and is larger than normal. A gift to you from Moon. He picks on Malachite in the hopes of become more powerful. He has an on-sight rivalry with Melony, Raihan and Bede and a grudge with all Dragons, Fairies and Ice types. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>The Champion of Alola, Moon (\u2640)</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nA 22 year old woman who has also remained undefeated since she became champion. She's the Champion of Galar's best friend and biggest rival. She and him are 50/50 in wins and losses. She's very busy with champion business but never misses the oppertunity to hang out or at least talk to him. She has no predefined team.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Hop (\u2642)</b><br>\r\nThe Champion's good friend and pseudo-rival. He gave up trying to be the champion but that doesn't mean he's weak. He spends most of his time assisting Sonia as a research assistant. He still looks up to his big brother. His predefined Pok\u00e9mon are Rillaboom, Dubwool, Corviknight, Snorlax, and Pincurchin <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Professor Sonia Magnolia (\u2640)</b><br>\r\nShe took over her grandmother's research on Dynamax energy. With Hop as her assistant, she's a powerful ally to aid the Champion in his quests. She is non-confrontational and avoids combat. She has no predefined Pok\u00e9mon<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Leon</b><br>\r\nAfter he was defeated at the hands of the New Champion, he joined the police force to continue assisting his homeland. He rose through the ranks over the years and is the current second in command and face of the police force. His team is predefined as Aegislash, Dragapult, Haxorus, Mr. Rime, Inteleon and Charizard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Minor Characters:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Dr. Joy (\u2640)</b><br>\r\nA Joy a cut above the others. She herself is busy but helps the Champion when it comes to his Pok\u00e9mon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Marine (\u2640)</b><br>\r\nThe new leader of the Spikemuth Gym. Her team is a Liepard, Toxicroak, Scrafty, Morpeko, and Grimmsnarl. She provides minor assistance to the Champion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbove all I want you to have fun writing and reading the story!<br>\r\n</td>",
