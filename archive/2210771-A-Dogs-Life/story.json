Charlie is a common name for... but I'm getting ahead of myself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI live with my parents, my younger brother, Joel, and my kid sister, Kristen. For the most part, we get along, although Joel and I do like to tease each other. The more embarrassing it is, the less likely either of us will let the other one live it down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad's a veterinarian. In fact, his clinic is where this little tale begins... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">******************************</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was 15 years old at the time. Joel was 12, and Kristen was 5. School had let out for the summer, so I was doing odd jobs for my dad at the clinic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn this particular day, I had just come in, and Dad was finishing up his examination of a Cocker Spaniel bitch. (That's the word, look it up.) \"Can I pet him?\" I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Her,</i>\" Dad corrected me. \"She's perfectly healthy, so I don't see why not.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe liked having me pet her. (All Cocker Spaniels love it when you pet them. Trust me, I know this.) \"I don't think I've seen her before. Where'd you get her?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A fellow who works at that research lab outside of town brought her in,\" he answered. \"I assume he just got her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what's next? Give her her shots? Spay her?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUp until then, this Cocker Spaniel had been the friendliest dog you'd ever expect to see. The second I mentioned spaying her, though, she turned and bit me on the hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI cried out. As Dad took a look at my hand, the dog made good her escape. \"Wonder what brought that on?\" Dad asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was when I asked about spaying her,\" I said. \"It's like she knew what that was, and didn't like it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That hardly seems likely,\" Dad replied. \"Well, at least we know she doesn't have anything, and this bite isn't too bad. I'll wash this out, patch you up, then tell her owner that she ran off. Then we can forget the whole thing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, he washed it out, and he patched me up, and he called the guy. But we didn't forget about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot by a long shot.</span></div></div>",

Other than that, nothing major.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was getting ready for bed. I was in my pajamas, and I went to turn off the light in the ceiling. That's when it started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of a sudden, I could smell everything in my room. And I mean <i>everything</i>. I could even smell where Mom touched my pajamas when she washed them last.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile I was trying to figure that out, my hearing went wild. I could hear Mom reading Kristen a bedtime story down the hall. I could hear Joel playing a game on his tablet, even though Mom had a strict no-electronics-after-8:00 rule.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, something happened to my vision. Now, given how my sense of smell and my sense of hearing suddenly went to 11, you'd probably think I got incredible eyesight. I didn't, though. The opposite, in fact: while I could still see blues and yellows, everything green suddenly looked white. Reds, oranges, indigo, violet: these all turned dark gray.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was still trying to figure this out when everything went screwy. It was like dizziness mixed with a massive shift in perspective. I dropped to all fours, closed my eyes, and hoped that this wouldn't last too long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't, maybe 15 seconds. But, when I opened my eyes, I was wrapped in fabric that looked somehow strange and familiar at the same time. I wriggled out of it, and saw that it was my pajama top, somehow grown much too big for me. Or had I grown too small?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I looked around, I began to notice other things that were wrong. Like, there seemed to be something sticking out of my face. I lifted a hand to knock it away, and felt my face. Then I noticed that my hand didn't look right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy brain began to put it all together: my senses, my size, my shape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt all spelled one bizarre conclusion: I had become a dog.</span></div></div>",

There were so many great smells.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Okay, that's what this is,</i> I thought. <i>Mom's always on me about how much my room smells. I'm just dreaming I'm something that appreciates the odors.</i> Convincing myself that it was just a dream, I could go with the flow and see where this dream went.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, apparently, where it went was, I got tired, so I jumped up onto my bed.

On this particular day, none of us wanted to do anything in particular, so we just sat and watched TV. In retrospect, I was glad things worked out that way. I mean, imagine if what happened happened in a park, or at the movies... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe were sitting on the couch, and I straightened up, alert. \"Something smells good,\" I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know what,\" Mom replied. \"Nobody's cooking.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNevertheless, I followed the aroma of cooking meat to the window. Smoke told me people a few blocks away were grilling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd I could smell it. Through glass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of a sudden, the TV was blaring. I turned to ask who turned it up so loud, and saw the rest of the family sitting comfortably. Only I thought it was too loud. Just like only I could smell steaks cooking blocks away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>This is awfully familiar... </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as I thought that, my vision went wonky. \"Uh-oh,\" I said, \"that wasn't a dream.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What wasn't?\" Mom asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore I could answer, I dropped to my knees and began to change.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe whole family smelled shocked. Mom screamed. Somebody asked, \"What in the world... ?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKristen walked right up to me. \"Doggy!\" She helped me get out of my clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom,\" Joel asked, \"what's going on?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know,\" she replied. \"One minute, your brother's standing there; the next, he's a Cocker Spaniel.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>That can't be a coincidence,</i> I thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThinking the same thing, Dad got up and picked up the phone. \"It's Chris,\" he said. \"Read me the file on that Cocker Spaniel that ran off yesterday.\"</span></div></div>",

She had managed to avoid the dog catcher for months before finally getting caught.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving his phone on blue-tooth, Dad gently picked me up and quickly examined my front and back paws. Sure enough, I had five independent toenails, and I could wiggle them slightly, though I doubted I would ever be able to pick anything up with them. \"Anything else you found unusual or exciting, besides her toenails and intelligence?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We did not have her long enough to do a full study, but I did find that she seemed to recognize a lot of voice commands, which is unusual for any normal breed of Cocker Spaniel.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad frowned. \"I want the full report on my desk within the hour.\" Serious, he said. \"I'm on my way in with a patient.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI inwardly winced as a low whimper escaped my lips, hearing the word <i>patient</i>. Dad ended the call, then turned to me. \"Sorry, Ken.\" Softly, he said. \"The only way I know to help you at the moment is to give you the vet treatment.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA series of whimpers and yelps came out as I began to cry. Joel stepped up, concerned. \"Is Ken going to be okay, Dad?\" Worried, he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad sighed. \"I'll know more after I read the report and run some tests.\" Serious, he said. \"Everyone in the car, we're going to the Pet Clinic.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that said, Dad handed me to Mom, who carried me to the car, while Joel gathered up my discarded clothes.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Upon arriving at Pet Clinic, which Dad owned, we met one of his employees, David. He was young, in his twenties, with brown hair and brown eyes, a fresh graduate from Purdue University. \"Here is the report you requested, boss.\" Politely, he said. He smiled at me. \"Who do we have here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is a stray we found while on a picnic.\" With a straight face, Dad lied. \"Kristen has become attached to him, so I'm running him through the numbers.\" He then whispered, \"This stays off the books until we know for certain we have found a new dog breed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid nodded. \"Best not to jump the gun and risk making fools out of ourselves.\" Serious, he said. \"Do you need any help?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad shook his head. \"I can handle this, thank you.\" Politely, he said. \"You just enjoy the long weekend and... not a word about these two dogs until we learn more.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid nodded, then left the building. Once he was gone, Dad got to work on me, starting with measuring my weight and checking my heart and lungs. I was not prepared when Dad then pushed a thermometer into my  backside, and let out a yelp of surprise. If Mom was not holding me, I would have likely turned around. \"His weight is good for a normal Cocker Spaniel, as is his heart, lungs, and temperature.\" Calmly, Dad said. He sighed. \"Moving on,... say ah.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing inside, I opened my mouth, and Dad took a look at my gums and teeth. After a moment of looking into my mouth, Dad turned and began to prep a needle. This startled me and I tried to yell, 'Don't you dare!' Only what came out was Ront Ro Rare!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad paused, turning to me, but smiled as Kristen blurted out, \"Scooby Doo!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, Ken.\" Tossing the needle, he said. \"Force of habit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What were you going to give him?\" Worried, Mom demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was a standard vaccination shot.\" Blushing, Dad explained. \"While it would not have killed Ken as a human, it would have left him ill to be certain.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why can't Ken talk very well?\" Wincing, Joel asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, dogs are very intelligent creatures.\" Serious, Dad said. \"However, the shape of their mouths and tongues make it very difficult to impossible for them to form the complex words of any language, given they had enough intelligence to learn the words.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you think Ken will be able to talk to us?\" Wincing, Mom asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad shook his head. \"Even if he were to somehow find a way to talk to us, I would not recommend it.\" Softly, he said. \"The less attention he draws onto himself, the better, until we can get to the bottom of all of this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, I was taken into the X-Ray room, where Dad took a number of  pictures of my insides before returning me to Mom, who knelt down to allow Kristen to pet me. I do not know why, but being petted made me feel calmer, and I began to wag my tail in response. \"Nice doggie.\" Smiling, Kristen said. \"Can we keep him?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's your brother, not a pet.\" Firmly but kindly, Mom corrected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoments later, Dad returned with a worried expression on his face. Noticing this, Mom rose to her feet. \"What did you find?\" Softly, she demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad sighed. \"All of the tests point towards Ken... \"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

On top of that, his vision is superb for a dog. Second, his muscle mass is greater than any normal Cocker Spaniel I have ever treated... he has the strength of a Bulldog pup. What's more, he's just a puppy, which means he will likely get bigger and stronger.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom and Joel were stunned while Kristen seemed confused. \"So, Ken is a strong puppy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad gave a patient smile. \"Yes, in this form, Ken is a strong puppy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What else did you find?\" Softly, Mom demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ken's individual digits on all four of his paws do not give him the ability to pick anything up, but they do give him the ability to run much faster than any normal breed of Cocker Spaniel.\" Serious, dad said. \"In fact, he likely could give dogs twice his size a good run for their money. Plus, the X-rays showed that his bones and claws are more dense than normal breeds. Ken can likely do some damage with his claws if he wanted to.\" He sighed, shaking his head. \"An unknown breed, indeed....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Worried, Joel asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ken is not your usual Cocker Spaniel.\" Serious, Dad explained. \"He is stronger and faster, with superior senses, as well as claws that can be used in defense.\" He turned to me. \"I trimmed them down as a precaution.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You didn't hurt him, did you?\" Worried, Kristen asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad smiled. \"No, pumpkin.\" Kindly, he said. \"Everyone needs to have their nails trimmed here and there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI whimpered as my senses began to quickly dull. It almost felt as if I was about to pass out. Everyone turned to me just as I changed back almost instantaneously. I was now human again, lying naked on the examination table. Mom and Dad sighed as Joel turned away, turning Kristen around with him, who was pouting. \"I wanted a dog...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um,... can I have my clothes, please?\" Blushing, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom pulled my clothes out of a backpack and handed them to me, before ushering the others out so I could change. Within minutes, I was dressed, and was being taken to the car. \"What are we going to do, dear?\" Wincing, Mom asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad sighed. \"Until we sort all of this out, we are going to have to buy everything needed to raise a Cocker Spaniel pup.\" Somewhat sadly, he replied. \"We do not want this to get out that our son has become some form of Lycan.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Some form of Lycan...\"</i> Sighing, I thought. <i>Who would have thought that this werewolf becomes a Cocker Spaniel...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

Especially not when they were items to be used on me when I become a Cocker Spaniel. Still, because I was becoming a dog at seemingly random times, it was for the best that I stay put.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not fair...\" Pouting, I muttered. \"Why me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen I caught some movement and turned to find the female Cocker Spaniel from before that had bit me on the hand. She looked directly at me for a moment, then hurried off through some bushes and was gone. i was tempted to run after her, but the fear of changing out in the open with no way to identify me held me back. \"Was she checking in on me?\" Curious, I wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy family returned a few minutes later, with a large assortment of dog items in brown paper bags. \"We will go over everything, including a few new house rules for you, when we get home.\" Serious, Dad said. \"Just try to understand that none of them are personal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI pouted at that, getting the feeling that I was about to lose a lot of my freedoms. \"I- I saw that other Cocker Spaniel. I think she was sort of checking in on me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If that's the case, we may see her again.\" Calmly, Mom said. \"For now, we need to get the house ready for a... pet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm still your son...\" Tearing up, I protested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom sighed. \"Yes, you are.\" Patiently, she said. \"Only it would be difficult to tell people a Cocker spaniel is our child, so, while you are in that form, you will be a pet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not personal, Ken.\" Serious, Dad repeated. \"We are trying to avoid a darker fate.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A... darker fate?\" Gulping, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom nodded. \"Suppose word got out that you are some form of Lycan.\" softly, she said. \"There will be scientists and government agencies wanting to know how it happened...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd be a lab rat.\" crying, I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad nodded. \"It is better to be our pet occasionally, than a guinea pig for the rest of your life.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was crying at that point as we all drove home. There, Dad unloaded the pet products, which included all natural brand of dog food and dog treats (I wondered how soon before I would find out how those tasted), metal dog dishes, a large litter box with a big bag of kitty litter, and a long, strong leather leash with a collar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The metal bowls are more hygienic than plastic, and I know from experience that Cocker Spaniels can be litter box trained.\" Calmly, Dad said. \"This will prevent any accidents involving you changing back after going out to do your business.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The collar and leash are because Cocker Spaniels are hunting dogs by nature. They need exercise, or they will become restless.\" Calmly, Mom added. \"That means walks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But... if I change back,... \" Worried, I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is a risk, I agree.\" Serious, Dad said. \"However, it's not fair to just lock you up in the house while you are in dog form.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now for the new house rules.\" Serious, Mom said. \"You are not to go anywhere alone outside of the house, for any reason. No one is to tell anyone of Ken's condition, period.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As a dog, you will be named Charlie.\" Calmly, Dad added. \"You will wear the collar and leash at all times while outside, and, the next time you change...\" He sighed, wincing. \"You will need a dog license, and you will need to be chipped.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy eyes went wide, hearing that. \"Chipped...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm afraid it's the law, sweetie.\" Wincing, Mom said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's relatively painless.\" Sighing, Dad said. \"Also, it is nothing more than a way to identify a lost dog and link it to its owner.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about my friend, Josh, and my girlfriend, Madison?\" Worried, I asked. \"They're bound to find out sooner or later.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We will cross that bridge when we get to it.\" patiently, Mom said. \"For now, your litter box and food dishes will be in the unused breakfast nook off of the kitchen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that said, Dad set up the litter box in a corner of the breakfast nook and set the food dishes on the other side of the unused area. The dog food did not smell too bad as I watched him pour it into one of the bowls, but the thought of eating it was a bit of a turn off. \"This dog food is made of real meats and vegetables.\" Calmly, Dad said. \"Only it's balanced for a dog rather than a human, so I do not recommend trying it, unless you are Charlie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter dinner, I went to bed feeling a bit depressed, and fell into a restless sleep.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It made my mouth water as I opened my eyes, only to wish I had kept them shut. I was surrounded my my own pajamas, which meant only one thing: I was a Cocker Spaniel once again. Growling out my frustration, I struggled out from my pajamas and sheets before jumping down onto the floor, just as Mom called out, \"Kids, breakfast is ready!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI barked and scratched at my bedroom door, until Kristen opened it and gave a joyous squeal. \"Puppy!\" She then began to pet me, which caused my tail to wag, as it did feel good. Only I was more interested in getting something to eat, so I darted past her and bound down the stairs, where I was met by Mom. She sighed seeing me, then ruefully pointed to the dog dishes, which were filled with the dog food and cool water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry,... Charlie.\" Calmly, she said. \"It has to be this way. Maybe Ken will be around for lunch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing, I let out a low whimper and walked over to the dog food. To my surprise, it smelled great and tasted better. It was like having bacon, steak, eggs, and greens, all in one bowl. After licking my chops from my morning meal, I drank some water and turned to the litter box. <i>\"I guess now I have to learn how to use a litter toilet.\"</i> Sadly, I thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI stepped up into the litter box but paused as I spotted Kristen and Joel, watching me with a sense of bemusement. It was annoying to some degree... who likes being stared at while on the toilet? \"Rwat?\" Irritated, I demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Into the dining room, both of you!\" Sternly, mom snapped. \"No one likes to be stared at.\" She then sighed and said, without turning, \"We'll see if we can put up a privacy curtain for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing, I did my business in the kitty litter then buried it with my paw. After I was done, I felt the need to wash my paws. Fortunately, Mom had dropped a damp cloth onto the floor, so I used that. Unfortunately, Mom saw me and threw me a cross look. \"Dogs lick their paws to clean them.\" Calmly, she said. \"We can't have you looking too intelligent.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI winced inside. <i>Ew...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We should have called him Scooby.\" I heard Kristen say. \"He talks like him...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ro Bwother.\" Rolling my eyes, I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA whimper escaped my lips as I felt Mom gently grab my muzzle, holding my mouth closed. \"No talking while in dog form, Charlie.\" Sternly, she warned. \"We are trying to keep people from getting too curious about you.\" She then released my muzzle and held up the collar and leash. \"It's time to get your license and chip.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI whimpered at that, as I did not like the thought of having a chip in me as Ken. Still, I had no choice or say in the matter, as Dad carried me to the car...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I felt violated and betrayed, though part of me knew and understood it had to be done. Upon getting dressed and ripping off the collar, I felt the back of my neck... the chip was there, halfway between my shoulders and head on the left side. I had always known that a dog had a rough life, but I never expected to be living the life of one. A sigh escaped my lips as I looked at myself in the mirror. \"Why me... ?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA knock at my bedroom door startled me. \"Who's there?\" My voice quivering, I demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door opened and Mom walked in. \"Do you feel like talking?\" Softly, she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I feel like screaming and throwing things.\" Pouting, I replied. \"I have rights, you know!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom sighed. \"Yes, you have rights,... both as Ken and Charlie.\" Calmly, she said. \"Only we also have laws that ensure the safety of both personas, and those around them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" Taken aback, I demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ken,... Cocker Spaniels rarely live over fifteen years.\" Softly, Mom said. \"We want to ensure that part of you makes it at least that far.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI immediately began to tear up. \"Only fifteen years?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom nodded. \"If you are very lucky.\" Almost whispering, she said. \"Stress does not help those odds, Ken. We are doing all we can to help you,... try to understand that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy lips quivered. \"It doesn't make it any easier, Mom.\" Softly, I said. \"I'm not mad at Dad, or anyone else....\" I began to cry. \"I'm scared...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom pulled me into a hug as I cried onto her shoulder. She looked up at the door to find Dad standing there, with a pained look on his face. \"We need to find that other dog.\" Whispering, Mom said. \"she has the clues we need.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad slowly nodded. \"I know...\" Sadly, he replied. \"Only you are talking about finding a needle in a haystack... it will not be easy.\"<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

It was my best friend, Josh, and my girlfriend, Madison. Mom let them in, and they put their book bags down joined at the dinning room table. \"You two hungry?\" Smiling, Mom asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Josh is always hungry, Mrs. Maxwell.\" Grinning, Madison replied. \"I'll just have a quick sandwich before hitting the mall. We're taking our book bags along to carry our purchases.\" She turned to me. \"Care to come with?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI winced at that, causing Madison to sigh. \"What did you do...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ken is in quarantine.\" Serious, Dad replied. \"He was bitten by a female dog the other day, and it's having some... ill effects on him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison looked at me with pity. \"Is it bad or contagious?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you going to turn into a werewolf?\" Grinning, Josh asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKnowing Josh's sense of humor, I chuckled at that. \"Let's just say Mom and Dad are keeping me on a short leash for now.\" Ruefully, I said. \"I hope its not contagious, but I don't plan on biting anyone anytime soon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He is not to leave the house alone, as his... condition causes certain behavioral changes.\" Calmly, Dad explained. \"Also, we need to carry a change of clothes for him, just in case.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It sounds like a major case of rabies.\" Wincing, Madison said. \"Has he seen the doctor?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ken has had all of his needed shots, so he should be fine.\" Serious, Dad said. \"Only it's not rabies,... it's something more complex than that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as Dad said that, I felt it happening again, and immediately blushed profusely. Josh and Madison noticed right away, and watched in a mixture of horror and fascination as I almost instantly became a Cocker Spaniel right before their eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude!\" Shocked, Josh yelled. \"You <i>are</i> a werewolf!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison knelt down as I struggled out of my clothes and jumped off the chair to the floor. \"Ken, is that really you...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI nodded my head, to which Madison looked at me wide-eyed before petting me. I wagged my tail, as it felt good, especially coming from her. I was a bit disappointed when she stopped and turned to my parents. \"How did this happen?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're not sure.\" Sadly, Mom replied. \"Until we can find the dog that bit him, all we can do is try to keep him as comfortable as we can, in either form. By the way, while in dog form, his name is Charlie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We need to keep a tight lid on this.\" Serious, Dad said. \"We don't want our son to become some lab rat to some scientist somewhere.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is there any way we can help?\" Worried, Josh asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe I can take him for a walk.\" After a thought, Madison said. \"Perhaps the fresh air will help him relax.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go ahead.\" Sighing, Mom said. \"Just be certain to take a change of clothes for him, in case he changes back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, she handed Madison my leash and collar, which she put on me.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The walk was rather pleasant, to be honest, as I was experiencing sights, sounds, and smells I would have never picked up as Ken. It was even better, as I was spending some quality time with Madison, though I would rather have been doing it as her boyfriend. We had walked about a block and a half from the house to the public swimming pool when I felt the sensation of me changing back again. I pawed at Madison, whimpering until i got her attention, and pawed at the book bag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now...?\" surprised, Madison asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI nodded, whimpering again, to which Madison knotted her jaws and quickly led me to the public pool and rushed me into the boy's restroom. Fortunately, there was no one there at the time, due to a sign that read: <i>Temporarily closed for regular maintenance.</i>  I had just made it into one of the stalls when I changed back. \"Quick!\" Blushing, I whispered. \"Give me my clothes!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison opened the book bag then gulped, blushing herself. \"I must have grabbed my own book bag out of habit.\" Wincing, she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What...?!\" Blushing more, I demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, now, don't panic.\" Quickly, Madison said. \"I'll run back to your house and get the right book bag. It should only take me a few minutes. Just sit tight in there, and I'll be back as soon as I can with your clothes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, she ran off, leaving me alone and naked in the boy's bathroom stall. \"Please hurry...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI had only been waiting in the stall for about a minute when I heard small footsteps entering the restroom, coming towards the stall I was hiding. My heart skipped a beat as I saw a small shadow appear before the Cocker Spaniel that had bit me days before peered in at me! As she walked in under the door, I saw that she was wearing a long tube dress.  She looked up at me, with her tail wagging in a way I somehow recognized as bemusement, before she instantly changed before my eyes! I immediately blushed profusely, as there was now an attractive teenage girl standing in the stall with me! She was wearing the same tube dress as before, but stretched out almost to the point of being skin tight...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get over yourself, lover boy.\" Flatly, she said. \"My name is Kira. In dog form, I take the name of Fluffy. And yes, I heard all the jokes...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We don't have a lot of time to bullshit, Kira!\" Sternly, a deep male voice scolded. \"Open the stall door so we can get this over with!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing, Kira opened the door, revealing a short but muscular boy I had never seen before, in a bodysuit. He tossed me a clean pair of boxer swim trunks, which I quickly put on for dignity's sake. \"You have been watching over me all this time, haven't you?\" Softly, I demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, I feel sorry for you, as my bite was of bad timing.\" Sternly, Kira said. \"Still, you need to learn to control your transformations, before they control you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you going to teach me?\" Wincing, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not sure I can trust you or your family.\" Frowning, Kira replied. \"You try being kidnapped, locked in a tiny cage, called a bitch, and threatened with forced surgery...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI did not know what to say at that point, so all that came out was, \"Sorry...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enough!\" Firmly, the boy barked. \"I am Butch, top dog, if you will. I need you to pay close attention, your life will depend upon it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI gulped. \"I'm listening....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We are Lycans.\" Firmly, Butch explained. \"Nothing like the werewolves of horror stories you may have heard, just a people who can change into different forms of dogs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Our bite carries a certain poison that transforms humans into Lycans like us, but only for twenty four hours after a full moon.\" Serious, Kira added. \"It is how we procreate, thus my bite was of poor timing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As well as poor judgement.\" Frowning, Butch said. \"Thus, Kira's punishment is to keep an eye on you, until we can determine if your transformations have become stable.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How can you tell if it has become stable?\" Worried, I asked. \"What happens if it does?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If your transformations continue after the next full moon, we will know it has become stable, thus permanent.\" Serious, Butch said. \"Once that happens, you will either become a Cocker Spaniel for life or a Lycan like us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If that happens, we will welcome you among us.\" Softly, Kira said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean I won't see my family again...?\" Worried, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can stay with your family, if you so wish.\" Calmly, Butch said. \"However, with us, you will be family all the time, rather than a 'pet' part of the time. Think about it...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that said, he instantly transformed into a large bulldog, which gave a heavy bark before running off, with Kira becoming a Cocker Spaniel again and following. Less than a minute later, Madison returned, out of breath, with the right book bag with my clothes. \"Sorry it took me so long, Ken.\" Between breaths, she said. \"I went as fast as I could.\" She paused, seeing me. \"Where did you get those swim trunks... and why are you shaking?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was shaking; badly, in fact. \"I met the other Cocker Spaniel.\" Trembling, I said. \"You are not going to believe this...\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The old junkyard was an ominous place, even at dawn. There were a lot of dark places a dog could hide in wait. Dad and I stepped out of the car, leaving Madison in the back seat, to be greeted by dogs: two Russian Huskies, the large Bulldog, and the Cocker Spaniel. I was in human form at the time, feeling more than a bit unnerved. I counted at least thirty eyes staring at us from the many shadows around the piles of cars and car parts surrounding us.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We are here, as agreed.\" Calmly, Dad said. \"I'd rather keep this civil, if possible.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn an instant, the Bulldog and Cocker Spaniel transformed into humans, while the two huskies remained in dog form. \"I am the village leader.\" Serious, Butch said. \"Your letter said you wanted a better understanding between us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It would help to know if I am treating a regular dog or a Lycan.\" Serious, Dad countered. \"When Kira found her way into my clinic, I thought I was dealing with nothing more than a regular stray, and now I have a son with an uncertain future.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKira winced at that, but Butch remained unfazed, neutral. \"You understand that I cannot allow you to tell anyone of our existence.\" Calmly, he said. \"If word were to get out, none of us will ever lead a normal life again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My son is part of your secret.\" Equally calm, Dad replied. \"My word is my bond.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nButch turned to the two Huskies, who gave a nod. \"This is Samson to my right and Hercules to my left.\" Serious, he said. \"Their human names will remain private for now. They are among the few who live within your community in human form. They confirmed your words.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I talk to all of my patients, as Kira should be able to confirm.\" Dad said. \"I will ask each patient a simple question. It will be their response that will tell me if I am treating a Lycan or a regular dog.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nButch nodded. \"Agreed. Who is the girl?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My... girlfriend, Madison.\" Softly, I replied. \"She has it in her head to become a Lycan...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No one asks to become a Lycan.\" Serious, Butch said. \"There is still no guarantee you will become one, the next full moon will tell the tale.\" He sighed. \"The odds will be the same for your girlfriend unless you find yourself a Lycan and... become one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI blushed at that, knowing what Butch was telling me. Dad nodded. \"The poison is the most effective during the passion of intercourse.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Correct.\" Blushing, Kira said. \"Other than that, it's a coin toss.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There is no cure that we know of.\" Serious, Butch added. \"Many of us have tried.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll be sure to tell her.\" Blushing, I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKira seemed slightly disappointed that I had a girlfriend, but Butch spoke up before the moment became too awkward. \"Did you bring your tools of your trade?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I carry my tools everywhere I go.\" Honestly, Dad replied. \"You never know when you might find an animal in distress.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nButch sighed. \"In that case, I have a few patients for you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe gave a low but loud whistle. A moment later, a number of dogs of all breeds slowly, reluctantly came out of hiding. A lot of them were injured, and some of them seemed slightly malnourished, which brought tears to Dad's eye. He truly cared for animals. \"I'll get my bag.\" he turned to me. \"Get Madison, I am going to need two assistants...\"<br>\r\n  </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>One by one, Dad treated all of the injured and fed the malnourished. Most of them were minor injuries, but a few had broken bones, and one was badly torn up. Dad treated him first, with Madison and me helping. \"What on Earth ran into you, little one?\" Tearfully, Dad asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He was beaten up in dog form by a group of bullies.\" Frowning, Butch replied. \"Rest assured, those bullies heard from us that night.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The mauling I saw on the news.\" Frowning back, Dad said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nButch shook his head. \"That was another tribe.\" To my surprise, he said. \"Samson and Hercules dealt with the bullies using video of their actions as evidence. The four teenagers will be spending the rest of their summer vacation in juvenile hall for cruelty to animals.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe small pup cried and whimpered as Dad treated his broken bones and scarred ears. I began to cry with him. <i>*You are in good hands, kid.*</i> Sadly, I thought. <i>*Dad is the best animal doctor around.*</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe small Golden Retriever looked up at me, surprised, and I heard his thoughts in my head. <i>*You can talk to me as a human?!*</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was surprised myself. <i>*I- I guess I can...*</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>*I'm Toby in human form.*</i> Softly, the dog thought to me. <i>*In dog form, I'm Rocky.*</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nRocky gave out a happy bark, then licked Dad's face, causing him to chuckle. \"You are welcome, little one.\" Smiling, he said. He turned to Butch. \"He will need to rest for the next few days, to allow his bones to heal properly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nButch nodded. \"We will see to it.\" Calmly, he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Rocky was taken away, the next patient was brought to him, and I talked to each one, helping to keep them all calm while Dad tended to them, with Madison handing him the tools he asked for. Fortunately, it was my job to hold each dog still, so I was able to keep my ability to talk to them a secret... for the moment. It was frightening and exciting at the same time. I had heard of comic book heroes who could talk to animals, but I never thought I would ever be able to do it myself. Still, I did not know how Dad, or anyone else, would react to the news that I could talk to dogs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's the last patient.\" sighing, Dad said. \"If any of them need to see me, just...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>*Don't forget about me!*</i> Limping forward, a small dog called.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think we missed one, dad.\" Blurting out, I said. I pointed to the Chihuahua limping towards us before picking him up. <i>*We will take care of you.*</i> Calmly, I thought to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike the others, the Chihuahua looked at me, surprised, then gave a happy bark as I handed him over to dad to be treated. \"As I said, if any of you need extra help, I will leave you my personal number.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nButch nodded. \"We are grateful.\" Calmly, he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can pay me back by helping my son adapt.\" Surprising me, Dad said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain Butch nodded. \"He can sleep here tonight.\" Calmly, he said. \"We will teach him what it means to be a Lycan.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two shook hands before Dad turned to me. \"They can teach you more than I could.\" Softly, he said. \"I'll pick you up in the morning.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI did not know how to react, but I was curious about my new ability to talk to dogs, so I reluctantly agreed with Dad taking a reluctant Madison back home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Butch returned to his dog form, and I was able to understand his barks and whines. \"The Lycan do not actually live in the junkyard, it is where we meet.\" Serious, he said. \"We all live in homes of our own.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You still don't trust my dad.\" Sadly, I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not fully, no.\" Calmly, Butch said. \"However, you are definitely a Lycan.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because I can talk to dogs in human form...\" Sighing, I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nButch nodded then turned to Kira. \"<i>Fluffy</i> will take you on a tour of the town.\" Bemused, he said. \"She will show you how we Lycan live.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKira, Fluffy in dog form, sighed. \"Let's go...\" Huffing, she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCurious, I followed Kira out of the junkyard and onto the streets of the town. \"Where are we going first?\" Uncertain, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Johnson's house.\" Calmly, Kira replied. \"They live the closest to the junkyard, and they have a soft spot for... <i>Fluffy</i>.\" She gave a face, saying that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I take it you do not like the name.\" Making a face, I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We do not choose our canine names.\" Flatly, Kira said. \"Just as you did no choose your own, they are given to us by the humans we encounter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinutes later, we had reached the Johnson's house, where Kira scratched at the door and began to bark and whine, \"I'm here... hello...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPresently, the porch light came on, and the door opened to reveal Mrs Jane Johnson, who smiled kindly down at Kira and me. \"Fluffy!\" Beaming, she said. \"Where have you been hiding?\" She then took notice of me and giggled. \"I see you have a new suitor, hoping to win your favor.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI blushed at that, though I doubted Mrs Johnson would notice. Before I knew what was happening, I found myself being picked up and carried inside, with Kira following. I was placed onto a soft blanket, while Kira walked up and laid down beside me. \"As a dog, you will be manhandled more than you would like. But, if you want to be fed, you have to tolerate it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon after, two dishes of dog food were offered to us. I sniffed it and found the smell terrific. Without thinking, I began to eat, with Kira joining me. After I had finished the bowl, I drank my fill of cool water before asking, <i>*Are we staying here all night?*</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nKira shook her head. <i>*This is just my normal patrol of the town. We are here to check up on Daisy, see how she is doing.*</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>*Daisy?*</i> Confused, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKira nodded. <i>*She is a dry Lycan, stuck in dog form, a toy poodle.*</i> Serious, she explained. <i>*Still, she hears things that are useful to our tribe. In return, we watch over her, protect her.*</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon after, a white toy poodle trotted up to us, wagging her tail. She barked and whined to us and, again, I was surprised, I could understand it. <i>*Kira, glad to see you again.*</i> Happily, she said. <i>*The mayor is planning a capture and release program for stray dogs and cats.*</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>*Keep us posted on that.*</i> Serious, Kira said. <i>*You will find your usual payment in the back yard in the usual place.*</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaisy nodded then trotted off, while Kira walked towards the doggie door. <i>*Let's go...*</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nI followed Kira out of the house then asked, <i>*Can Lycan talk to normal dogs?*</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>*We can, but they do not understand human language.*</i> Serious, Kira replied. <i>*The most they can offer is where to find food, or to provide a distraction for a quick escape when needed.*</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I gulped at that. <i>*I was able to talk to dogs in human form...*</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nKira turned to me, surprised. <i>*Butch has that ability too.*</i> Softly, she said. <i>*It's a rare trait among Lycans. I'd keep that talent to yourself, unless you want to end up in a lab somewhere.*</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nFearful, I nodded, and Kira led me to our next stop...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

A bell was heard on the inside and the door opened before a lean Basset Hound appeared in the doorway. <i>*You're running a little late, Kira*</i> Scolding, he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>*So glad to know you care,... Houdini.*</i> Sarcastic, Kira said. <i>*I'm showing a new Lycan the ropes, in case he decides to join the tribe. He has the canine name of Charlie.*</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>*Ah, the kid you bit a while ago.*</i> Eying me, Dodger said. <i>*Well, fortunately, we have no new Lycans in the kennels, but there are a few new strays with a new brand of horror stories.*</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>*What news do they bring?*</i> Sighing, Kira asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDodger was silent for a moment before replying, <i>*Sport dog fights.*</i> He sighed. <i>*Both are scheduled for termination.*</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>*But... they're victims...*</i> Sadly, I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>*They have been made too aggressive to be deemed safe to adopt.*</i> Also sad, Dodger countered. <i>*That is the sad truth of the matter.*</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a thought, I said, <i>*Let me talk to them.

I could hear them throwing themselves at the walls and the bars, in an attempt to get out and fight anyone or anything. My ears dropped and my tail slowly moved down between my legs... I was terrified. Seeing me, Dodger sighed, shaking his head sadly. <i>*You have a good heart, Charlie.*</i> Calmly, he said. <i>*However, no one can save them all.*</i> He gave a reassuring whimper. <i>*They will be put down humanely, I can promise you that.*</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlbeit reluctantly, I followed Kira away from the pound down the street to a small restaurant near the edge of town.

Within seconds, there were only two scraps left, which Kira began to nibble on, with me following suit. Shortly after, Luigi returned with the water and gave us each a pet before walking back in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>*What was that all about?*</i> After we had left, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>*Not everyone in our tribe has a home.*</i> Sadly, Kira replied. <i>*Those scraps are all they sometimes get in a day.*</i> She gave a sad whimper. <i>*We watch out for each other, so no one starves.*</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>*Maybe my dad can help.*</i> Feeling sad, I offered. <i>*He is well known in this city, people listen to him*</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>*I hope so, Charlie.*</i> Serious, Kira said. <i>*People tend to forget the homeless, human and dog alike...*</i><br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Men, women, and children, entire families, huddled around barrels holding campfires. They were living in makeshift huts made of scrap metal, cardboard, anything they could rummage from the trash or along the roads of the city.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>*This is one of several parks where the homeless gather at night to try to sleep.*</i> Sadly, Kira explained. <i>*The homeless shelters were closed by the newly elected mayor, Johnson, to save money, while he got a fat raise in salary.*</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nI growled slightly at that. <i>*Here I thought he was a good guy...*</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>*There is always a part of someone they do not show the general public.*</i> Darkly, Kira replied. <i>*The mayor stepped on a lot of people to get where he is right now.*</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>*It's going to be a cold night.*</i> Wincing, I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>*They have endured nights far colder than this, Charlie.*</i> Flatly, Kira said. <i>*That is the unfortunate life of the forgotten...*</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nI turned from one side of the small park to the other, seeing little girls and boys crying under the shirt of a man, with his bare back facing the elements. it was enough to make me cry for them, until an idea hit me, and I knotted my jaws in decision.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>*Can you get them to follow you?*</i> Suddenly, I asked. <i>*I know of a place, and my family owns it, so they can't be kicked out.*</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nKira turned to me, surprised, then turned to the entrance of the park, seeing a number of police officers arrive. \"Okay, citizens, you know the law... no loitering on city property... move along.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI could hear children begin to cry harder, and I was tempted to bark in protest, but Kira turned to me sharply. <i>*You better know what you are doing...*</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, she barked at the leader of the homeless group, then ran off a short distance, then barked again. Getting the idea, I did the same, moving towards a place I knew that was safe. Albeit reluctantly, the man motioned the others to follow. I led Kira and the homeless to a complex of low buildings surrounded by a high fence. As luck would have it, I felt a familiar sensation, and changed back into my human form just as we reached the fence. Fortunately, I had listened to Kira's advice and had worn a jumpsuit. The leader of the homeless group, a tall man with matted black hair and green eyes, paused upon seeing me unlock and open the gates. \"Who are you...?\" Firmly, he demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um... My name is Ken Maxwell.\" Awkwardly, I said. \"Welcome... I'm glad Fluffy was able to lead you here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you want?\" More coldly, the man demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My family owns this property, and we are opening it to you, as a place to be warm and safe during this cold season of spring.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man turned to the others, uncertain, but Kira barked and followed me as I walked past the open gate. At first, they did not follow. Slowly, one by one, they walked through and followed me to the first building. I hit the code to open the door and entered, turning on the light. Inside was a warm and comfortable office setting, with several rooms that had beds, showers, and most importantly... a stockpile of canned goods, drinks, plates, cups, and a microwave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>*What is this place?*</i> Curious, Kira demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing her thoughts, I turned to the leader of the homeless group. \"This was a private walled community that failed.\" Calmly, I explained. \"My family intended to convert it into a veterinary hospital complex, only the mayor has thus far refused to rezone it from residential to commercial.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man gave a teary smile. \"I am Joshua Jones.\" Kindly, he said. \"You family honors us with their kindness and generosity.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI returned Joshua's tearful smile. \"The honor is mine...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>*Are you certain your father will go for this?*</i> Worried, Kira asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing her thoughts, I replied, <i>*Dad purchased this property with my college fund. I had been saving up with odd jobs over the past five years. So, technically, until he pays me back, this property is mine to do with as a please.*</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

What's the other thing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She was dropped off by a couple of researchers from just outside of town. Our receptionist says she overheard them talking as they left. According to her, one of them said, 'Wouldn't it be wild if she changed back while she was in the kennel?'\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh. I'm coming in with a patient, David. I'll be examining him personally, and it's not going in the books.

He made me as comfortable as a teenage boy who has turned into a Cocker Spaniel possibly could be. He told me everything he was doing. I was especially grateful for the heads-up before he used a rectal thermometer on me. I still yelped, of course, but I knew what was going on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce he was done with the hands-on portion of the examination, he took me to get X-rays taken. Then, he took me back to the exam room, where the rest of the family waited. Kristen started petting me again. I can't explain it, but being petted relaxed me better than the nature sounds device Mom and Dad had in the master bedroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs we waited, something strange happened. First, my sense of smell diminished. It was like my nose was stuffed up, even though I could breathe just fine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, my sense of hearing suddenly dropped. I could hear everyone in the room just fine, but I couldn't hear what was happening outside. On a hunch, I moved my head to indicate my clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully, Joel was paying attention. \"I think he wants his clothes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, then,\" Mom said, \"let's give them to him, along with some privacy.\" They left just as my vision became full color again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, the disorientation effect hit me again. When it lifted, I was a boy again, albeit naked and sitting on an exam table in a vet clinic. I got dressed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI just finished putting my pants on when there was a knock on the door. \"Ken?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad came in, along with the rest of the family. \"Good to see your face again, son,\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks,\" I replied. \"What's the good word?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"According to the test results, you are - or, rather, were - a perfectly healthy American Cocker Spaniel. Purebred, even.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do we do now?\" Mom asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now,\" Dad replied, \"we keep quiet about this until we have more information to work with. I'm as curious about that other dog as anybody, but we can't do anything until we know more.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs we left the vet clinic, I noticed Kristen looking sad. \"What's the matter, sis?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wanted a dog.\"</span></div></div>",

As they walked inside, and I closed the door, I certainly hoped I wouldn\u2019t regret this. I walked into the family room to find them sitting on the couch; Madison showing Josh something on her phone. Looking up at me, she said, \u201cI got some photos from my cruise, you want to see them?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure.\u201d Spotting a bag of garbage in the kitchen, I said, \u201cFirst I have to take out the trash. My dad wanted it done before they got home.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSounds good, babe.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking into the kitchen, I grabbed the garbage bag and walked out the backdoor. I went around the side of the house to the trash cans and put the bag inside. As I walked back around, I spotted a squirrel sitting on a nearby rock. Ignoring it, I was about to go up the stairs when I noticed my senses were changing. <i>Oh no.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nI barely managed to get out of my clothes, leaving them in a pile on the lawn, before I was once again turned into a dog. I suddenly found myself in the exact situation my folks wanted to prevent by keeping me at home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was about to go up the stairs and claw at the door when I spotted the squirrel again. Unlike earlier, when I chose to ignore it, something inside me took over \u2013 I started barking and running towards the squirrel. I chased it up a nearby tree, alternating between barking and growling, unable to figure out why I was doing this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly I heard voices behind me. I quickly realized they belonged to Josh and Madison. Turning around, I saw them looking at me with confused looks on their faces. \u201cWhat the hell?\u201d pausing, Josh said, \u201cHow\u2019d that dog get in here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d Pointing to my clothes, Madison said, \u201cI\u2019d like to know why Josh\u2019s clothes are on the ground.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking towards me, Josh said, \u201cWe should probably get this little guy inside the house before the neighbors start to complain.\u201d<br>\r\nRather than fight it, I let Josh pick me up and carry me inside, while Madison gathered my clothes up. <i>How am I going to explain this?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh put me down in the kitchen while he went to fill a bowl with some water. He was just about to place it on the ground when I heard the front door open.  \u201cKen, we\u2019re home!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom and Dad walked into the kitchen, surprised to find Josh and Madison standing there, but not nearly as surprised as they were to see me looking up at them.  Looking at Dad, Josh said, \u201cSomehow this dog got in your backyard. He was barking at something in the tree.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI was wondering when this might come up.\u201d Sighing, placing a bag on the table, Dad said, \u201cJosh. Madison.

I began to suspect that I was going to be like this for the rest of the evening.  Kristen and Joel were watching TV in the den; while Mom cooked dinner and Dad was in his office.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom had just let me back inside after I\u2019d gone out to relieve myself.  Grabbing a Kong bone that Madison had brought over this morning, I walked into the den and plopped down on the floor.  I could hear Kristen and Joel chuckling as they watched me chewing on the bone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI couldn\u2019t explain it, but something about chewing the bone was relaxing to me.  I lay on the carpet, chewing the bone, for a few minutes until Joel came over and pulled it away from me.  I growled briefly as I looked up at him.  \u201cRelax bro, there\u2019s no need to growl.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI watched as Joel then proceeded to throw the bone down the hall.  Something clicked inside me; as I got up and ran down the hall to retrieve the bone.  <i>So that\u2019s what he wants, huh?</i>  Running back down the hall, I dropped the bone at Joel\u2019s feet and watched as he threw the bone down the hall again.  We repeated this for a few minutes until Mom walked into the den from the kitchen.  Looking at me, she said, \u201cKen, honey, it\u2019s time for dinner.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI\u2019d smelled something interesting coming from the kitchen for the last few minutes.  As I followed Mom into the kitchen, I figured it was the pasta she was cooking for dinner.  I found out I was mistaken when the scent led me to the dog bowl \u2013 which was full of a mix of wet and dry dog food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe few times I\u2019d looked after Queenie, I found the smell of dog food to be somewhat nauseating.  But this time was different; it smelled downright delicious.  Before I realized what I was doing, I leaned over the bowl and started eating.</span></div></div>",

It was a rainy Saturday morning and I was in my room playing video games; while Joel and Kristen were off with their friends.  We still didn\u2019t want to risk me changing in public, so I was pretty much limited to the house at all times.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI had just gotten killed by another player when I heard the garage door close \u2013 my parents must\u2019ve returned with Bella; that was the name Samantha had chosen for herself as a dog.  I have to admit I enjoyed having her around; we played in the backyard regardless of what species I was, she slept on my bed and generally spent most of her time with me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe got to know each other as well.  It turns out she didn\u2019t have the best childhood growing up; her parents had died when she was a kid and she was placed in the foster system.  She didn\u2019t let that get her down however, as she worked her way through college until she got the internship.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI had just paused the game when I heard footsteps coming up the stairs; followed shortly after by Bella running into my room and jumping on the bed.  As she licked me excitedly, Bella said, *How do I look, Ken?*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*What do you mean?*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBacking away, Bella sat down on the bed and looked at me.  *Your parents took me to the groomers.* her tail wagging, Bella said, *I feel really pretty.*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI chuckled at that.  *You\u2019re a dog, Bella; how can you feel pretty?*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*I still think like a woman, Ken.* growling a little, Bella said, *Unless you want me to bite you again, you better tell me I\u2019m pretty.*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Okay, Bella, you\u2019re very pretty.* suddenly getting a familiar feeling, I said, *I\u2019ll be right back, I think Charlie wants to say you\u2019re pretty too.*</span></div></div>",

Her people, two men, seemed more amused by my interest than anything else. \"She's a bit out of your league, little fella,\" one man said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoel came and pulled me away. \"Come on, Charlie,\" he said, \"you're bothering them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think he can help himself,\" the other man said. \"We knew she'd be in heat soon. I guess today's the day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>In heat.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>That</i> was the smell I was reacting to. <i>Can this get any worse?</i> I asked myself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApparently, it could: When I changed back to Ken a few moments later, I still had an erection.</span></div></div>",

There's money in it for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe money only sweetened the deal, as there wasn't one of us who didn't love Queenie. We made a schedule for who would do what for Queenie when, and he left us the keys.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first evening of the watch, it was my turn to feed Queenie, so I went next door to do that. She was glad to see me as I came in, even though our schedule made sure that she was never left alone for too long. I put fresh food in her bowl (I was glad to see that she ate the same brand of dog food that Bella and, occasionally, I ate), then we played fetch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, while we were playing, I felt a change coming on. I got up to leave, but, before I got to the door, Queenie had a new friend to play with: Charlie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat's more, one sniff told me something that Queenie's master had left out: Queenie was in heat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd she was a hell of a lot more receptive to my charms than that Golden Retriever had been. Moments after sniffing me, she presented to me. I couldn't resist, and we mated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInteresting thing about two dogs mating: the male gets his privates locked into the female's nether regions for several minutes after the act is complete. I don't blame you for not knowing this; I didn't know it myself, until it happened to me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so it was while I was in that position that Madison came over. \"Hey, Ken,\" she called out, \"did you forget we had a date? I hope you and Queenie aren't having <i>too</i> much fun... oh.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was while she was taking in the image of me and Queenie locked together, that I changed back, which at least extricated me from Queenie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I cannot deal with this,\" Madison said as she left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so I got dressed and went home, instead of on the date with Madison.</span></div></div>",

That was three days ago and I hadn\u2019t returned to human form yet.  I know I should\u2019ve been worried; instead, I was actually kind of enjoying it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was out in the backyard playing with fetch with Kristen and Bella; who I\u2019m happy to say, is no longer ignoring me.  Kristen had just thrown the rubber bone towards the back fence, and I was about to go after it when the sound of a closing car door got my attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBella and I ran to the gate and started barking; overjoyed that our masters...I mean, my parents and Joel were home.  Joel came in through the gate and was immediately pounced on by myself and Bella; the two of us licking him excitedly.  After three days as a dog, it was getting easier for my dog-side to take over; I tried to fight it at first but realized it was going to win eventually.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBella had just finished slobbering on Joel\u2019s face, and it was my turn; only he pushed me away before I even had a chance.  I let out a low growl, to which he said, \u201cThere\u2019s no way I\u2019m letting you lick me, Charlie; not after what I saw you doing this morning.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">*****Flashback*****</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Mom had been gardening this morning, and she had an open bag of mulch behind her.  I don\u2019t know why, but the smell of the mulch was quite appealing and I ended up eating a small amount of it; that was until Mom put a stop to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mulch must\u2019ve upset my stomach; because I was soon vomiting on the patio.  Now I knew that dogs had been known to eat their vomit, I just never realized how strong the compulsion to do so could be.  I tried to resist but eventually started licking my vomit off the patio; just as Joel walked out from the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCharlie, no!\u201d Joel quickly shooed me away while he got a hose to wash the rest of the vomit away.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">**********</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling spurned by my master...brother, I slowly walked back to retrieve the bone.  Before I even got passed the swing set, I felt a familiar sensation.  It wasn\u2019t long before I was human again; which I couldn\u2019t help but feel sad about.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Things took a turn for the worse after Madison had caught me mating with Queenie. By the time I\u2019d gotten dressed and returned to the house, she\u2019d told everyone what she had seen Queenie and me doing. Before I could stop her to explain what happened, she grabbed her purse and ran out of the house without saying a word.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI walked back into the family room to find everyone staring at me. Joel was chuckling, Mom was staring at me in shock, and Kristen was confused, Dad was the only one who appeared to be sympathetic to what happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoel walked past me on the way to the stairs, saying, \u201cI can\u2019t believe you lost your virginity to a dog.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI glared at him while he walked upstairs. I was embarrassed enough already,... or so I thought. That changed when Kristen looked at Mom and said, \u201cWhat was Charlie doing to Queenie, Mommy?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom glared at me for a moment, as to if to punish me for having to explain canine mating to my sister. Turning to Kristen, Mom said, \u201cIt\u2019s just like when two people love each other very much, sweetie.  Charlie and Queenie were just... professing their feelings for each other.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Not exactly Mom; I think Charlie was the only one doing the professing here.</i>  Mom and Kristen walked out of the room, while Dad sat down on the couch. Looking at me, he said, \u201cDo you want to talk about it, Ken?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot particularly, Dad.\u201d Sighing, I said, \u201cI\u2019d much prefer to forget about it. Right now, I just hope I didn\u2019t ruin things with Madison.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m certain she\u2019ll come around eventually.\u201d Placing a hand on my shoulder, Dad said, \u201cIf the roles were reversed, I\u2019d like to think you\u2019d forgive her.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks Dad.\u201d Getting up, I said, \u201cI-I think I\u2019m going to go up to my room for a while.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll be in the office if you want to talk.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I walked upstairs to my room, I saw Bella walking out of my bedroom. Before I could even say anything to her, she took one <br>\r\nlook at me and started growling at me. Looking at her, I said, \u201cWhat\u2019s gotten up your butt?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>*Not you,*</i> pausing, Bella said, <i>*I can forgive you for the dog at the park. But why the stuck up poodle from next door?*</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took me a few seconds to realize what she was getting at.  Looking at her, I said, <i>*Wait, are you angry that I didn\u2019t mate with you?*</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBella didn\u2019t say a word; she just looked at me and walked down the hall to Kristen\u2019s room.  I just stood there in the hallway, as I tried to process everything that just happened. </span></div></div>",
