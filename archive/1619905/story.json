He slowly comes to realize how warm it is around him, not just warm, but hot. It's hot enough to make him rather uncomfortable. His arms come to life and slowly push him up off the floor. Some dust and small debris tumble off his back as he rises up. The burning pupils of his eyes take in their first clear view after regaining consciousness. It all comes back to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe apartment is still burning. Everything around is some kind of yellow or orange, or red. The colors flicker and mingle all around, making the hall seem like it fell out of a nightmare. The sounds of cracking and burning and breaking didn't help Kyle relax either. For a moment, all he could do was wander the hall like a lost soul, with nothing and no one to call out to or reach for. But amid the collapsing wood, steel, and stone; a possibly glimmer of salvation is spotted. Kyle sees a big metal door unharmed by flame. He looks up at the ceiling and scans the walls. They look safe, or at least they aren't obscured by whirling flames and chocking smoke. With his heart beating so violently, Kyle glides over to the door with his feet as light as he can make them. There is no guarantee that the floor will hold, he might as well jump into the fire if he runs across it. He is briefly startled when his hand goes through a portion of the wall. Fortunately, it is not hot and there is no fire on the other side, but his hand is now scratched and shallowly cut. He lets his strained heart clam for a second, but he knows that to stop is to die, and forces himself to push forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly two more feet and he should be able to reach the handle. He resists the urge to jump at the door, though it's his best hope for survival, he knows that it's really just a gamble. He doesn't know what's on the other side. He doesn't even know how much farther he'll have to go once he gets through. He may just be dead already.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he finally makes it, he leans lightly on the door. it's only warm so there's little chance that it conceals an inferno. He drags his hand across the space between the door and the frame to make absolutely sure. The air doesn't feel any hotter. His entire body quakes, he might just get out. With shaking sweating hands, he grasps the handle and twists it. The door creaks, but it's barely audible over the flames inhaling tons of raw oxygen and the building collapsing on itself. The door at last swings open, and Kyle finds himself looking into an almost black stairwell. The lights were all surely killed by the fire. He steps in and proceeds to feel his way down the dark stairs. Halfway down, he feels the floor buckle under him. Not sure of what to do, he freezes and hopes that the stairs hold. They only cry louder, as his weight causes them to grind into nothing. Panic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle bolts into a run despite being blinded by the near absolute absence of light. It's the all the stairs can take, and give way. Kyle feels himself falling. He is paralyzed. Four of his sense tell him nothing. He only knows that he is descending. Nearer and nearer to flames. Then his sight is restored, as are his hearing and his ability to smell. The taste of burning air is clearer than ever. Kyle is down. He tries to get up, but he cannot. Something on his back will not allow him to stand. There is pain. His head feels like it is floating detached from his body. Kyle's brown eyes continue to wander across the field of fire before him. His ears provide notice of the collapse of the floor above him, the sure to be cause of his death.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle is tired. He's alone. There is no one coming for him. There exists nothing that can save him. His eyes begin to close, neither of them bother to shed tears. It would simply be a waste.</span></div></div>",

Upon relaxing his focus, he notices that what he is looking at is actually attached to him. Oddly, his shirt has lost its gray color. It has become white, and the texture looks more like that of a dress shirt. Kyle reaches down with one hand to inspect his mysteriously altered attire, but as his hand runs over the material, he becomes aware of how very sensitive his chest has become.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle recoils in a very confused manner, then begins to unbutton his shirt, somehow calm while standing amidst growing flames. Halfway through undoing his shirt, he sees enough of his chest to find a startling revelation. He was not bare, but instead was wearing a bra. And it was filled. Kyle didn't even realize that he was looking at his own body, the fare sized breasts clasped by the bra just under his eyes were certainly his, but his mind just could not accept it. He released the unbuttoned shirt and slowly grabbed the exposed breasts. He felt an usually spike of information from his body. The synapses in his chest felt overloaded, he momentarily became dazed and fell a few steps back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know this must be a shock, but you cannot do this here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle looked around, the voice had no detectable bearing, it was as if it had emanated from all directions. However, this was enough to get Kyle to recall the situation that he was in. During the time he wasted examining himself, the fire had became slightly worse. The ceiling was glowing, there was no trace of any solid material above. It was ready to collapse. Kyle frantically began searching for an escape. The only thing he could see was a window down the hall, but he knew that he was still too far up to escape by jumping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your thoughts deceive you, you are not as you were, leap and you shall take flight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe same voice resonated over the screaming flames. Kyle looked at the window again. There was no where else to go. The only other option was to stand in the building a burn. He decided to follow the voice, but not out of faith, it was more so that he could divert the blame if jumping turned out to be as foolish as it seemed. He closed his eyes, and ran.</span></div></div>",

However, he does not need to. He throws his gaze down the burning hall. A lone window outlined by its burning flame is fixed to the other end. Smoke thick enough to consume blinding sunlight hangs to the ceiling and clings to the walls, while fire dances all around it. But it doesn't matter to Kyle anymore. Without any hint of human hesitation, he charges. His advance is so fierce, that the flames he tramples instantly die. The floor beneath him gives way again, but it is not because it threatens to devour him this time. The very ground is being shattered by Kyle's herculean steps. The last remnants of the wild flames retreat as Kyle comes to the hallway's end. Glass and wood fly out of the side of the building. The fire retakes its place in the hall howls out through the broken wall as it climbs towards the ever calm night sky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Earth seems to shake as Kyle lands. The drop of eighty feet felt no more violent than a skip to him. He turns to face the fire that threatened to consume his very being. The flames take notice and swirl all around the doomed building; they growl like a cornered beast, but they dare not approach Kyle and retreat into the falling structure. Kyle simply stands looking on, the fire put forth its best effort to destroy him, but he has proven his strength. He has won.</span></div></div>",

He had been pinned, tons of debris fell on top of him, and before all of that, he was unconscious in a burning building. He escaped by jumping from a window a few stories up, and his legs didn't even strain. He finds himself standing in a back alley under the cloudless night sky. The wind was picking up, though the flames were dying, aging into smoke that rose up towards the stars that they could never hope to reach. It was then that he heard a voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mortal, you have chosen this path. You answered our call.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA figure, heavily obscured, begins to condense in front of Kyle. It drifts in the air like an apparition. There is no face, no body, no limbs. However it still seems to release a familiar aura of humanity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have been freed from your elementary restraints. The very core of your existence now lies beyond the bounds of your fellow kind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe voice is indescribable. The figure can't actually be speaking, for it has no mouth. Yet Kyle can clearly hear it, though the sound of its \"voice\" is foreign to his ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The status that you have obtained permits you to control the most fundamental forms of reality that reside within yourself as if they were mere components of your physical body.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle looked down at his arm. He did not feel different. The sense of power that was in him had faded away, though he was keenly aware of the blood flowing in his veins. He could feel the pressure build as every beat of his heart injected a fierce momentum into the blood. He also felt excited, and restless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All of this has been done for one purpose. The one who believes that he is outside the bounds of all realms and all law has begun to move yet again. You agreed to stand against him. We have provided what you require. The ordeal that you faced was of his doing. There are already innocents lost to this senseless barbarism. For the sake of those close to you, you cannot remain in this realm. You have been elevated to another plane. The rest will become clear with the advancement of time. Enough has been said, go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe figure vanished instantly, and Kyle was left alone once more. The words that had been sent to him were not clear, Kyle had made no agreement. He knew nothing of \"the one who believes to be above law\". But he didn't feel the desire to turn any of it down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle relaxes his body for a moment and concentrated. He is taken back, and sees himself standing in the cold night. There is a sphere around him, perfectly round and calm. He opens his eyes. Laying to his side is a discarded can. He focuses on it. He does nothing but look at it. The can remains still. Kyle then turns his gaze to the sky. He picks out a star, Sirius, the brightest of them all. The breeze briefly kicks up, bringing with it a sheet of dust and leaves and little branches. They gather around the barren cement like a crowd assembling before a show. The sky above is perfectly clear. Kyle's eyes are locked in place, tracking the still star as it looks back. The can shoots off. There is not a sound, and hardly a sight as it ascends at great speed. This is all the confirmation he needs.</span></div></div>",

Its skin is burning, and it leaves a path of torched concrete with each stomp of its feet. Jets of smoke streak from its nostrils, with the very tails of its breaths releasing timid flames. Kyle feels the radiating warmth behind him and sets his eyes on his adversary. The beast is breathing heavily. Its stance is lopsided, and Kyle notices a wound across its chest. A gash crosses from its center towards to right shoulder releasing the precious blood that the monster needs to sustain life. If it can feel, it is probably experiencing great pain. Despite this, its eyes tell of only one thing, its intent to kill Kyle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe beast resumes staggering towards Kyle, foolishly approaching without guard. Kyle holds his place and merely waits. The panting of the beast becomes heavier, the glowing eyes widen. One arm, formerly limp, begins to rise. The claws of the beast are well displayed, colored like polished black stone and both smooth and sharp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle knows what it is. The fire, the beast before him is the same raging inferno from the now smoking apartment complex. Its rampage could not go unchecked. Kyle placed one foot back and readied himself. The monster keeps marching, oblivious. The hand clutching, itching to catch torn flesh and to feel the flow of warm blood trickle down its fingers. The marks left on the ground no longer just burning imprints of the beast's feet, but small rings of fire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt is time, Kyle makes his move. With speed beyond reach of any human, he leaps at the beast. It lets out a great plume of smoke from its gaping nostrils and brings its mighty arm crashing down. But this is all in vein. Kyle simply fades through the creature. It is left dazed and confused until it hears the sound of Kyle's sneakers landing behind it. The beast turns itself and pushes forward again mindlessly. However, it finds that it cannot move. The creature struggles to drag itself towards Kyle, swinging its one working arm. The tempo of the breathing climbs. The beast is covered in its own smokey fumes. The trails of black smoke are drifting back, but oddly float in place just behind the terrible beast. It takes the shape of a long cylinder, as if the air in that volume had been evacuated into a vacuum. Kyle turns away and walks on. All that he needed to do had been done. The beast finally begins to emit howls, becoming more and more determined to impale Kyle with its great clawed hand. Then the cylinder of smoke and air behind it narrows into a cone, with the point directly on the monster back. A horrible cry hammers the star dotted sky. The beast is being pierced by a burning jet of its own breath. It is struck with such immense pressure, that the needle of air simply burns its way through the creature's body. The monster releases a collection of sounds indicating its increasing agony before it goes silent and falls dead. Kyle is long gone.</span></div></div>",

He is now detached, merely an observer, one who no longer qualifies as part of the real world. Even with his new found strength, it is hard to bear. He must leave things he loves behind, leave people that he loves behind. All due to the actions of one. This being, who Kyle himself allegedly vowed to fight against for as long was he was able.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, those who Kyle is now serving are not pleased with a warrior weighed down by regret and uncertainty. In light of Kyle's state of mind, the voice from before returns.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mortal, do you doubt? Do you still doubt despite the understanding we have given you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time the voice is alone, there is no spirit, nothing visible or tangible, accompanying it. The words that carry its serious tone simply echo from all directions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have chosen this path of your own free will. Search yourself and ask. You will find that all is as we have said. Further, do not fear loss. All that you know has been cut from you, separated, thus protecting it. Once you have secured your goal, you will have everything returned to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle keeps his eyes on the city below. Lights flashing, jumping, moving; the only signs of life in the darkness of night, they remind Kyle that the situation at hand is very real. His decisions bear consequences and he is responsible for the lives of many. Though he doesn't recall anything said by the voice, it all makes sense to him as if he had heard it long before now. Or at least most of it makes sense, there is one thing that Kyle cannot simply accept. He turns and faces the sky, nearly shouting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who is it that I must destroy? You told me that he feels that he is above law, but who is he? What has he done?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wind picks up and howls with something approaching frustration, but Kyle remains fixed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mortal, we have given you understanding. You know that he is wrong and must be vanquished. What else do you require?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle sits and is calm. He is looking towards the ground, mindless tracing a path with one finger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have been given 'understanding', but all of this is beyond my experience. Though I 'know' that what you say is true, I cannot be sure that the knowledge is true. You have given me information in an unnatural way, bypassed my senses and merely burned what you consider fact into my mind. How can I take it without suspicion?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wind, which has become a breeze, dies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see. We have truly picked wisely, as it seems.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA small flame suddenly appears on the rooftop just in front of Kyle. It is not a malevolent flame, not like the one before, it merely serves as a symbol.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mortal, you cannot be sure. All that you have is what we have given, what the lawless one has given, and your own wits. If you must, confront the enemy before you slay him. However, be sure to never take the wrong path. Your cleverness has assured you that you have my confidence, but it is not unheard of that the great fall.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe flame fades, and Kyle rises, fists tightly clenched. He had hoped for more from the voice, but at the very least Kyle determined that he had not been employed by some mad spirit. He would do as the voice said, and confront the lawless one. Then, he would decide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mortal, as per what we have given you, destroy the four gates and you will find him. No other words are needed now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe night returns to silence as it is watched over by a lone figure on a rooftop, the one who will determine if such tranquil night will ever be seen again.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The gates, they are the entry points to, and the defenders of, the place where the lawless one keeps himself. Early on, before he began his crusade, the lawless one imprisoned himself in a realm he claimed as his own, a realm formed from one of the many voids that comprise the infinite span of existence. This realm was closed off from the rest of existence and became accessible only by the four gates that the lawless one created from segments of his own power. A power that he had acquired from those who now sought to destroy him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lawless one had a humble origin. He had merely been a man, a human no more weak and ignorant than Kyle before his awakening in the fire. He too had been called to transcend his humanity and mortality for the good of all, and he too accepted of his own free will. Sadly, he was not fit for the task at hand, and failed. All that was, was left in peril, and this lead the overseers, those who enlightened the lawless one and Kyle, to take drastic measures. As any called to fight for the overseers, the lawless one had bound himself to a contract by accepting their request to fight, and the overseers considered a contract unbreakable. Though he had failed, the lawless one was still bound to serve as a weapon against whatever threatened the overseers' perceptions of the stability of existence. The overseers, now sure that he had no use as a warrior, decided to turn him into a barrier. One that could possibly be required to stand for all time, cut off from the Earth and all other worlds and realms, to hold up against what was then taken to be a threat to all existence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lawless one derived much pain from this action, but he held to his contract and willingly sacrificed his existence for the sake of all others. It was in this way that stability returned to all realms, and the overseers' once again became satisfied. With his enemy destroyed, the lawless one believed that he had completed all terms in his contract and expected to return to his former life. However, the overseers informed him that his fate was to be very different. In altering his form by turning him into a barrier, they had completely torn him from his original manifestation of being. His life had been permanently lost, and his only consolation was the right to drift across all planes of existence without restriction, a gift from the overseers. The true nature of the lawless one's sacrifice was not revealed to him before hand, it was the most painful betrayal that he had ever experienced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lawless one crumbled under the weight of despair, and felt nothing but the need to lament for a duration that seemingly could not be encompassed by time itself. The man struggled with so much trying to deal with his loss, his sanity was constantly strained and he wondered why this had to happen. He sought for an answer in an unending state of painful thought, and it was only after he had wrung himself through more than most would be able to stand that he determined his course of action. It was during this period that he decided to turn again the overseers. They could not be correct, no force of good would trick someone into destroying himself, and no force of good would sit idly when there was one in as much pain as the forsaken hero who had outlived his usefulness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lawless one took himself to be the true upholder of justice, and the prime directive of his campaign was to return himself to his humble existence as a fragile human. The power he had gained as an immortal was not comparable to what he had lost; the companionship of friends and family, of wife and children. It was with astonishing force of will that he subjugated the power of the overseers and reshaped the gifts they had given him to suit his own needs. He became trapped in his own realm, and sealed it with four mighty gates that would destroy any intruder. There, he quietly waited, plotting his war against the overseers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe proceeded with such cunning, that the overseers themselves were hardly aware of the true nature of his plans. To them, he had merely vanished. The overseers found themselves perplexed, and were angered by this rare feeling which brought with it hints of inferiority and vulnerability. It was only when the lawless one made his first move that the overseers came to fear what he had become. With his power, he attacked the divides between realms, attempting to collapse many into one form. The overseers retaliated fiercely and even discarded their own laws to contain their enemy. They did not seek a willing defender, but instead confronted the lawless one themselves, and with their own strength, fought to a stalemate. From that point on, an unannounced truce, of sorts, took effect. There was no interaction between the two sides, and each side was left to guess at the other's doings. This went on for some time. The truce was broken much later with the lawless one's second attempt to merge Earth's realm with his own, and so the overseers scrambled to find a warrior to fight for them, a warrior bound by a contract accepted freely. Of those who answered the call, Kyle was determined the strongest. The overseers raced to enlist him, while the lawless one was driven to destroy him.</span></div></div>",
