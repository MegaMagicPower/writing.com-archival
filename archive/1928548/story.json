        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">This is an interactive story which will allow anyone who wants to to read and write about characters from the Vampire Diaries TV show on the CW gaining weight/ getting fat. Yes, this is a very specific kind of story for a very specific kind of person. This is also a unique story, for nowhere else on the internet does there exist a Vampire Diaries weight gain story (believe me, I've scoured the internet looking for one). So, please read, write, add, and enjoy! Both male and female weight gain will be allowed here, though I'm just in it for the boys. I do have a few ground rules:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. Please no vore. I know this is a vampire story, so some blood-sucking is okay, but no people eating people.<br>\r\n2. Sex is okay, but try not to get too graphic and don't just shoe-horn it in there. It needs to make sense for the characters/ plot.<br>\r\n3. Please try to add at least one paragraph per chapter, single-sentence entries are no-fun <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/frown.png\" alt=\"*Frown*\" title=\"Frown (Random)\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"> <br>\r\n4. You may add new characters to the Mystic Falls universe.<br>\r\n5. Try to keep the weight gain realistic (please no 'so and so gained 1000 pounds in one day!').<br>\r\n6: Please try to use correct spelling, grammar, and punctuation.<br>\r\n7: No spoilers from the current season. I don't want this to ruin anything for people who aren't current.<br>\r\n8: Have fun and be creative!</td>",
