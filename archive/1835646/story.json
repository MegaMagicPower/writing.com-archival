It was a once-in-a-lifetime event in the history of this country, and something that only occurred when one ruler had died or had decided to pass on the crown to a younger generation. That was the case today. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKing Hercules had ruled the country for over twenty years and he had decided to step down in favor of his eldest son, Leviathan. The Crown Prince, who had grown up in the palace and was known as Levi, had become a strong, young man. He was an expert swordsman and he had grown into a tall, muscular soldier who had made his father proud. Therefore, the decision to step down was relatively easy for Hercules, who had himself ascended the throne at a young age when his father had become too ill to govern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMerlin, the youngest great-grandson of Draxon, the son of Osric the Wizard who lived in the White Castle, had come over personally to attend the Coronation. After the convocation and the opening ceremony, Merlin had taken the crown and carefully placed it on Leviathan's head. The trumpets were blown and shots were fired from guns and cannons outside, announcing the peaceful transfer of power. Mountania had a new King!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThree youngsters looked on, smiling at their mother, Queen Athena, for they were now the Princes of Mountania who would have to rise up and be the next in line in case something were to happen to their father. And there was always something going on in Mountania: You had the Vladians lurking over the horizon, the dragons coming over the mountains and attacking the fields and the villages, robbers and thieves attacking and stealing items from transports between Mountania and Fatlantis, and more. There was the food festival, the Mountanian Summer Games in the Colosseum, the trade fair, the weapons fair, the music fair, the food festival, and more! Mountanians loved to party, they loved to compete, and they loved to have guests over from other countries!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPrinces Cassius, Gladius and Triton were the three princes growing up in the royal household. Cassius was 15 years old, and he was the oldest. Gladius was 13, and Triton was the youngest at 10.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He looked every inch an heir to the Mountain Throne. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was perhaps not very tall for his age. Only six feet, but he still looked like a prince of the mountain. Powerfully-built, with tanned skin, ripped guns, wavy blond hair and blue eyes. A chick-magnet of the highest degree. He worked out regularly and fancied himself a scholar, athlete, warrior and ladykiller. The ultimate prize-catch prince. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassius dipped a rag in a mix of sand, vinegar and piss. The substance was vile and smelt like a cesspit, but it sure as hell made his armour look shiny. He was already dressed in most his armour, except his helmet. He polished it furiously and breathed on it and spat on it and kept rubbing and scraping. Slowly, he lowered it onto his head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe raised the visor, peeked out and then slammed it shut. It fit perfectly. He took it off and headed out of his room, his servant-boy, who was an eager young peasant-boy named Aeros, jogging behind. He had dreams of becoming a knight, just like his master would be, and he followed him everywhere. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe prince went to the stables to check on his horse. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mere Nightfire\", Cassius said. The horse, jet black with white streak down its face, trotted out. Cassius mounted the beast and kicked his heels. \"C'mon! Eeyup!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNightfire snorted...stamped the ground...whinnyed...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then Cassius heard the droning, dribbling sounds of powerful urination. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh come on! Piss in your own time! Yaah!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe horse neighed and clopped out into the fields behind the stables. Aeros followed with a large, wooden shaft with a metal grip-guard at one end. Cassius picked up the hefty wooden lance and started doing laps, hoping to get used to the weight of the thing before the jousting tournament tomorrow... </span></div></div>",

They were competing in the Middle-Teens Jousting Tournament at the yearly Mountanian Games. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassius slammed his visor down and grabbed his lance. This was the last of ten rounds. If he won this one, he would've won the Middle-Teens jousting tournament! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"His Royal Highness, the Crown Prince Cassius! And his challenger, Lord Vortex Garathon!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLord Vortex was a boy of Cassius's age. He was slimmer and smaller than Cassius and had long brown hair. They were good friends in real life, but today, it was death or glory! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ready?\" the umpire shouted. The two boys lined up their horses on opposite ends of the run. They stared down the run and waited. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe umpire dropped his flag. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassius sped down the track! He twisted his lance over to one side! He watched as... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCRASH!!! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lance struck Vortex in the chest! The tip shattered on impact! Cassius watched everything happen in a split-second as Vortex was hurled off his horse! He hit the soft, sandy ground of the jousting-track with a heavy thud! Cassius stopped his horse at the end of the run and climbed off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"His Royal Highness emerges victorious!\" the umpire shouted. Everyone watching from the stands cheered! Cassius panted and jogged over to where Vortex was being helped up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"B-b-Bitch!!\" Vortex grunted, hopping over to Cassius, \"I think I did my ankle!...F-Fuck it hurts!\" he winced! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go sit down and let the doctor check it\", said Cassius. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe prince removed his gauntlets and shook his friend's hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No hard feelings, right?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure Cas...But if this doesn't heal I'mma challenge you to a duel!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassius laughed, \"Yeah I look forward to winning...again!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassius waved goodbye to his friend and headed away from the crowds to where everyone was eating and drinking in the huge marquees, tables and benches set up away from the main tournament-grounds.

Cassius strolled up to her, carrying his helmet under his arm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well hello there\", he said. \"Have we met before?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl got up as Cassius approached and curtsied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your Royal Highness\", she said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what's your name? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am the Lady Minerva, my lord\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Minerva, huh?

WHAM!!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt all happened so fast, Cassius wasn't even sure WHAT happened! When he opened his eyes, he realiesd he was lying on his back on the table! Pinning him down easily were three colossal Mountain men! He stared up at them from his position on the table, where his head was hanging off the end! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatta you think you're doin', huh boy?\" one of the superhunks asked. From his position upside down, Cassius could see that they were tall, insanely bulky and buffed up, tanned with varying shades of brown hair. They looked incredibly dangerous and they probably outstripped him by three feet! They all had to be in their later teens or even their early twenties! They looked mean! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassius watched the girl hurry over! Her tiny hands wrapped around a gigantic forearm and she tried feebly to pull it away! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jupiter!...\" she began, but the monster-hunk ignored her! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I said...Whatta yah think you're DOIN' BOY?\" he roared! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-w-what the fuck!?\" Cassius spluttered, \"Let me go NOW! Do you know who I am!?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're a little pipsqueak tryin' to feel up our sister is who you are right now!\" said the monster-hunk named 'Jupiter'. \"And if you don't start talkin' you'se gonna be the DEAD pipsqueak!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My name is Cassius! And I'm your fucking prince! Now let me go!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You touchin' our sister, boy!?\" one of the other interrogaters snarled! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cannius! Stop it!\" Minerva cried out, \"Stop you're hurting him!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We don't like it when folks start touchin' our girl without our sayso\", said the third monster-hunk. \"If youse hurt her again, we gonna do REAL nasty stuff to yah...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fortis I LET him touch me!\" Minerva shouted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three giants stopped. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You LET him touch you?\" the one named Jupiter asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...yeah. H-he's cute...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJupiter hauled Cassius upright and stood him on the ground. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright then\", he said. \"But if you make her cry. If you HURT her in ANY way, my bros and I are gonna be rippin' you a new royal asshole. You got that, your Royal Shortness?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, alright! Sheesh!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassius watched as the three giant teens rumbled off to find some food. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-i-I'm s-sorry about that\", said Minerva. \"T-those were m-my three brothers. That's Jupiter, Cannius and Fortis.They...um...Love me too much\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can see that!\" said Cassius, \"Damn!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...was um...approached...once and uh...ever since they kinda...follow me around to see I'm okay\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh-huh.

And ever since then, they've been swarming around me like bees!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha's wrong with it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh...WHAT'S WRONG WITH IT!? Penny! If they're guarding me day and night everywhere I go, how on EARTH am I gonna meet the right boy!? Every single one I meet, he's not good enough for them! He looks cheeky, crafty, dangerous, devious...I...I can't take it! Soon I'm gonna be that cute girl that nobody can touch and nobody's gonna come for me and I'll die alone like a spinster!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh you must've think that, missie! A time will come! It surely must...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh! Yeah! WHEN?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mayhap you have to make that time y'self...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You think?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If youse is so worried about it, you should try do somethin' 'bout it\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe you're right...Thanks, Penny\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yessum. Ah! That's all brushed and all the kinks taken out. Will you be goin' to bed now, miss?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think so, yes\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll be gettin' you y'bedwarmer, then...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinerva's bedroom in her father's ancestral castle was not enormous, but not small, either. It had a dressing-room, a bathroom with a privy, a main bedchamber with a fireplace, a huge canopy bed, and a bookcase, table, chairs and other assorted feminine necessities. Minerva sighed and climbed into bed. Penny slipped the charcoal-filled bedwarming pan out from between the sheets and went to empty the burning coals back into the fireplace. She looked out of the windows and closed the curtains. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sleep well, miss. The storm outside's gettin' worse!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes I know...Goodnight, Penny\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"G'night, miss\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinerva sighed. She lay in bed. She was so...frustrated! Those stupid brothers of hers! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerhaps she should speak to them...Yeah she should! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinerva shivered. It was surprisingly cold. She heard the thunder rumbling heavily outside and the steady drone of the pouring rain. She got out of bed and lit a candle. She shuffled to the windows and pulled back the curtains. It was a real monster storm outside! And the glass on the window was freezing! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she was younger, Minerva used to run to her brothers' bedrooms and ask to sleep there with them on stormy nights like this. She hadn't done it in years...but right now was the perfect time to take up an old habit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe left her room, carrying the candle with her... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fortis...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmm...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fortis!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmmmmmuuurrrrggghhhmmmm...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Foooortis!!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh!?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinerva held up her candle and stared at her largest and oldest brother slumbering in bed, his broad-shouldered, towering frame taking up almost all of the massive bed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huuurrrghhh...w-what do you want, Min...It's...one o'clock...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Forty, can I sleep with you?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The storm's scary...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eeeuuuggghhh...Hain't you grown outta that, yet?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fortis! It's scary and I can't sleep...Please?...I love you!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis sighed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A'right, a'right...put down that candle and get in\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinerva put down the candle on the bedside table and Fortis pulled back the sheets to give her admittance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"FORTIS!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You-y-y-you're not w-wearing any...any smalls!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? Hey, nothin' small 'bout it, sis...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...COVER YOURSELF!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis pulled the sheets back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Night Sis...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis chuckled. \"A'right, a'right. To protect your delicate, ladylike senses, I will cover that which nature has...<i>abundantly</i>...endowed me with...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinerva pulled a face!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Gross!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis laughed. He tugged on a pair of white undershorts...that still left nothing to the imagination, crawled back into bed and reinvited his sister into it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe crawled in and Fortis blew out the candle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinerva shivered and snuggled down. She felt her brother's huge chest and bulky arms wrap posessively around her, like a cage of alpha-masculine protection. She sighed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong, sis?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm cold!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Funny...no girl's ever said that to me before...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"FORTIS!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis silenced her by hugging her and kissing her on the cheek. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's up, sis?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fortis, I want to speak to you about something...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...boys\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't swing that way\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean ME!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why? You're not a boy...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"FORTIS! Today you...you and...Cannius and Jupiter...and...and what you did with the prince!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was a PRINCE?...Fuck he's tiny...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fortis! I...we...the prince was sweet! And he was nice! I want to be...to make friends with him! And we were just getting acquainted and you had to scare him off like that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you do that with EVERYONE! I'm tired of it! How am I supposed to find a boyfriend if you keep beating them up!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S...Are you even LISTENING to me? Will you lay off with the whole tough-guy routine!? Everytime I find a new boy, you chase him off! Please can this stop? At least for the prince? Crown Prince Cassius is really sweet, and I want to be friends with him...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...No\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"FORTIS!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Minnie, you need to be...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, I know...but...it's so BORING otherwise! Please Fortis? Just lighten up in the whole 'hands off my sister' routine?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright...You know, papa's going to the royal fortress at Ferramount in a week's time...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know. I want to go with him. I already told him. And I told him the reason why\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The prince?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...yeah...How do you know?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because we're going too?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh...NO!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! No you'll ruin everything!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Minnie, you're a cute, gorgeous, young, wonderful little girl...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis kissed her again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...You should be admired from a distance. There's LOTS of cads and rakes out there who'd LOVE to sink their claws into you...among other things. And we PROMISED momma on her deathbed, that we would LOOK AFTER YOU\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not again with the promise on momma's deathbed...\" Minerva groaned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir mother had died a few years ago, her dream of leaving her husband with a bubbly, cheerful baby girl finally fulfilled, after the agonising birthing of three big Mountain boys! Minerva had been her treasure, and she had made her three sons SWEAR to protect her honour and her...intactness...until marriage. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, Fortis...?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, I'll speak to Canny and Jupiter and papa...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you WILL have a chaperone!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"FOR-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NO BUTS! You will have a chaperone!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh cocksausages...I...Just one!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll see what papa says...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"ONE! I don't want all of you swarming around me like a pack of wolves! If I have to have one of you lumbering around behind me all the time, then I just want ONE brother, not the whole family tree!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll see what papa says\", Fortis said. \"Now shaddup will yah? I wanna sleep...\" </span></div></div>",

Here, she sat by the window, fiddling with her needlework. A bird sat on the ivy-vines outside the windows and she was poking the image into the piece of embroidery in front of her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey girl\", Fortis said in his typical greeting to his little sister. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No can doski, sorry.

We'll see you later. We're leaving tomorrow morning\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat evening, Minerva crept out of her room and downstairs into the courtyard. The carriage was packed and ready for the journey the next day. She walked slowly around it, examining it carefully. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tried the doors. They were locked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tried the trunk. </span></div></div>",

Behind Minerva, the carriage was in flames. Nearby, a body lay on the ground. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened?\" Minerva asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The carriage was attacked by outlaws\", Jupiter said. \"We got them just as good as they got us. Pop's dead. He took one through the heart. They set the carriage on the fire using grenades. We've managed to get all our luggage off of it, though. And those creeps are dead\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What're we going to do?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Take you home\", said Fortis, gruffly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No\", said Cannius. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Fortis asked, turning on his younger, and smaller, brother. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We just got attacked, bro. We gotta report this to the king. It's important that he knows about this stuff. We've got all our luggage. We can hike to the palace and Ferramount\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about the horses?\" Minerva asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dead. We're hiking alright\", said Jupiter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing that he was outvoted, Fortis sighed. \"Alright, we'll continue. We have some food...weapons...clothing...camping-supplies...We'll go to Ferramount. Minerva, you will come with us. You will obey EVERY command that I give you. This is NO place for a young noblewoman to travel unescorted, through the wilds of the Mountanian countryside. You will NOT wander from us at ALL under ANY circumstances. I don't care if you have to go behind a tree to piss, one of us will follow you\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinerva nodded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis picked up two trunks, strapped them together and then hauled them onto his huge, broad back. Cannius picked up the last trunk and strapped it onto his back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJupiter easily lifted Minerva off the ground and threw her over his shoulders, so that she was sitting on top of him! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah!\" she gasped. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not doin' this for fun, sister\", Jupiter said. \"But you never could keep up with us when we go out hunting. I'll carry you instead\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter walking for several hours, they made camp in a clearing near the road. Here, they found an old log cabin or cottage. It didn't look like it had been used in a while. Inside was some old furniture and a fireplace with an inbuilt stove. It wasn't big, but at least it was dry. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll camp here tonight\", said Fortis. \"It'll be too dark soon, to keep moving any further...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe examined the cabin. There was one bed, four chairs, a table, a couple of simple wooden armchairs, a bench and a couple of cabinets or cupboards...but precious little else. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bed wasn't even a proper bed. It was just the frame. Any mattress that had existed there previously, was long gone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey spent the rest of the day gathering soft grass for the bed, and wood and kindling for the stove and fireplace. By the time the sun went down, everyone was exhausted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey stood around the bed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So how do we do this?\" Cannius asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll sleep on the inside. You and Jupiter on the outside, furthest from the wall\", Fortis said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about the girl?\" Jupiter asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis placed a powerful hand on his sister's shoulder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Minnie's gonna sleep with me\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why can't I sleep on the bench in front of the fireplace?\" Minnie asked. She wasn't sure if she wanted to share a bed with her older brothers!...Jupiter snored... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We don't want nothin' happenin' to yah\", said Fortis. He bent down, opened a trunk and pulled out three pillows and three blankets. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We weren't expecting a stowaway on our trip, so there ain't much here for you\", he said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis climbed onto the bed and laid down. It was barely big enough to contain his broad, heavy, ten-foot frame. Minerva, only just past half her brother's height, crawled into his arms. He threw a blanket over them, locked his arms around her and rolled over. Minerva felt the bed creak as her two other brothers climbed in...it was going to be a long night... </span></div></div>",

She felt herself being hemmed in by Fortis's massive arms and chest, pinned down by his bulk, his body-heat keeping her warm. She shivered and snuggled closer, but found that she just couldn't get back to sleep... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWriggling out of her brother's grasp, she climbed over him...and Jupiter...and Cannius...to get off the bed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huurrrrk...\" Cannius grunted in his sleep when Minerva accidentally trod on a prize portion of his anatomy. She froze, and delicately lifted her foot away, before springing lightly to the floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fire in the fireplace was still burning. She loaded on some tinder, kindling and wood and started fanning the embers with her fan. It took a while, but soon, the wood began to smoke...and smoulder...and burn. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe checked the trunks. There was a small skillet, some plates, some knives and forks, some tankards...and the food! She examined it. There wasn't much there. Some salted pork, some bacon, and a couple of loaves of bread...that was about it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe would have to make some crude sandwiches. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe put the frying pan on the hotplate of the stove and started laying the meat on top of it to fry. None of the knives were sharp enough to cut the bread. She tiptoed over to the bed. Hanging off the bedposts were her brothers' leather belts. She unsheathed Fortis's dagger, a formidable blade of nearly two feet in length! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHolding the razor-sharp blade carefully, she began slicing the bread and toasting it using an old toasting-fork that she found. Her brothers had collected water from a nearby well and placed it in buckets. She poured the water into a small copper kettle and hung it over the fireplace to boil. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinerva didn't hear anything. The sound of the fizzling, crackling meat and the flames and the bread being toasted absorbed her completely. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the bed, Fortis began to stir. He yawned and groaned, brushing his dark blond hair away from his face and rolling over...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sat up with a start! Where was the girl!? Where the...Oh....!! Thank goodness... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis climbed out of bed and ducked to stop himself hitting his forehead on the rafters. He strode across the cabin towards the fireplace. He reached out and grabbed his sister roughly by the shoulder! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinerva jumped! She whirled around and stared up at her brother!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't you EVER do that again\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Make breakfast?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"LEAVE without my say-so!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh come on, Fortis. I'm in the same room, for goodness sake!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"GIRL I MEAN IT!\" Fortis rumbled dangerously. \"With papa at his rest it is my job to see that you're looked after and I'll be damned if you screw it up over your own stupidity! You understand me, girl?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinerva nodded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes brother\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A'right...What the hell is this?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just some simple toasted sandwiches...it's not much...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll find somethin' more tasty sooner or later...Thanks for the food...HEY WAKE UP YOU LAZY POTATO SACKS!

She slapped Fortis on the arm, \"Oh stop it!\" she squealed, her eyes watering with laughter. Fortis gave her a rough kiss. \"Thanks, Min\", he said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone sat around the table and started eating. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What shall we do?\" Minerva asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go to Ferramount and gain an audience with the king in his private hall\", said Fortis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you can gain an audience with the Crown Prince in his bedchamber...\" Jupiter teased Minerva. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't plant such stuff in her\", said Fortis, \"She ain't old enough\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I ain't plantin' nothin'...that's the prince's job...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"JUPITER!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A'right...I was jokin', cheese doodles...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How will we get to Ferramount?\" Minerva asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What stupid question is that? Walk!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But it's so far! It's three days by horse and carriage alone! Goodness knows how far by foot!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We don't have an alternative right now\", said Fortis. \"And we must get there\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What for?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To tell the king about those outlaws\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But they're dead!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He'll still want to know about them!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah...Yes, I...I suppose he would\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter breakfast...  </span></div></div>",

It's gotta be forced!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPacking everything, they started off down the road. Every now and then, the boys stopped and ventured into the woods.

The meal was crude - not at all like what they were used to, with plates and cutlery and a table and candles and cordial and beer...but it would have to do. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again, Minerva resigned herself to sleeping in a cage of muscles, swamped by her older brothers.

But she was glad at least, that they'd reached their destination. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sat with her three brothers in the foyer of the palace. A guard approached them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lord Fortis, King Leviathan will see you now\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis got up and followed the guard into the throne-room beyond. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The guard has told me your story\", said King Leviathan. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe king sat on a large, marble throne draped with red and gold fabric and cushions. Curled up at his feet was a large, golden-haired lion...which was asleep. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am very sorry for the loss of your father and you have my gratitude for dealing with the highway robbers that you mentioned, who had taken his life. Your father was a noble and kind man. You will, of course, as his firstborn son, inherit his title, his lands, his house, the estate and his fortune\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis bowed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes sir\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I imagine that your brothers and your sister have had a long journey\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We are very tired, sir. We've been walking since...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis checked his pocketwatch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Eight o'clock this morning\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And it is now eight o'clock at night\", said the king, glancing at a clock. \"You must all be very tired. Unfortunately, I expected you here several days earlier, but with the loss of your horses, I suppose that cannot be helped. But many of the guestrooms are full. But I'm sure I can arrange something. You might have to use the private guestrooms\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Private?\" Fortis asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The ones next to my sons bedrooms. They're usually used by their friends when they come to visit, but I suppose they'll have to be occupied by you, your brothers and your sister in the time-being\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis nodded. \"Thank you, sir\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA tall, slim servant-boy approached Fortis and led him from the room. He would show him where he and his siblings could sleep. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm afraid that the princes' guestrooms do have bathrooms, but they might not be big enough for a...person of your...stature\", said the servant-boy. He stared up at the young Mountanian's ten-foot, broad, muscular body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"'Sokay, dude\", said Fortis, \"Just show me a room which has a bath I can use\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, my lord. Follow me\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young servant-boy showed the four brothers and sisters to their rooms. Perhaps unknowingly, he showed Minerva into Prince Cassius's private guestroom! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinerva left her bedroom and headed down the corridor. She saw another girl leaning against a doorframe. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinerva hurried over. The girl looked a year older, and was slightly taller. She had beautiful dark brown hair that she was brushing with a hairbrush. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I haven't seen you here before\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Lady Minerva\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah? I'm Lady Eldonia. My father's here to speak to the king about some deal he has. I'm so bored! This place is a complete sausage-fest!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wouldn't think that's a problem...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh! Yeah, but there's no girls around here to talk to! I'm fifteen, for goodness sake!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm fourteen...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's close enough. So are you here with your father too, Minerva?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He...died. I'm here with...other relatives\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh...I'm sorry. Hey, you want to come to my room? We can chat\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two girls headed down the corridor and into Eldonia's bedroom. She sighed. \"This place is so dull...Are you staying here long?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Probably a few days, I'm not sure yet\", said Minerva. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you can keep ME company, at least\", Eldonia said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe froze. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong?\" Minerva asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's a light in my bathroom. I thought I blew out all the candles...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe headed to the door of her bathroom. That was when they heard splashing. Eldonia peeked in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's a MAN in my bathroom!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was about to open the door and confront her intruder, when the sound of rushing water told both girls that the 'man', whoever he was, was now standing up in the bathtub. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia peeked in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...and WHAT a man...Rrrraaawrr...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinerva tiptoed over and peeked in. She gasped! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's...Fortis!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know him?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's my oldest brother...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh you poor, poor thing...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Having such a fun TOY and not being allowed to play with it...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinerva giggled! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eldonia! You can't say things like that!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia opened the bathroom door. Fortis yelped and whirled around! Eldonia and Minerva gasped, covering their mouths! Fortis fumbled hopelessly with a towel that was far too small to accomplish the act of decency he was hoping to achieve. He held it over his waist, trying to cover that which made the towel look like a pocket handkerchief in comparison to! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow...\" said Eldonia slowly. \"...Minerva your brother is HAWT!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinerva giggled. </span></div></div>",

In front of them was an array of meat, cheese, bread, wine, smoked fish, mashed potatoes, gravy and other heavy, stodgy food. The kind of heavy, stodgy food that made Mountanian boys enormous. As if to prove that, Cassius was chowing down with amazing eagerness! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinerva smiled. She liked the prince. He was...cute...But he was also so different from every other boy she'd ever met. Her brothers...mostly. And it was her brothers who generally kept her from meeting other boys. She loved them all...especially Fortis...but they were all so overprotective! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs a result, Minerva had rather lost the taste for the giant muscle-hulks that most girls lusted after.

Away with you, girl!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis reached out and touched his sister. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You look...you look...um...you look...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can say it...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean...I think...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...C'mon big fellah...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...You're...real purdy...\" Fortis said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awww...Thanks Fortis...Are you BLUSHING?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NO!...Okay a bit...okay a LOT!...But...I never seen you like that...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well if you let me go to more parties, maybe you WOULD!\" she retorted, and she spun around on her shoes, letting her skirts swirl up and out in a beautiful swish! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Real cute, Minnie\", said Cannius. \"So Fortis, what else are you gonna wear?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dunno...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about those robes?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way! I brought them as sleeping-clothes! They barely fit me anymore!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't think you WORE anything to sleep...\" Minerva said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Minnie!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh just wear your hose and sandals and for goodness sake, tell me you've got a codpiece that fits, even if your armour don't!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't make a codpiece BIG enough to fit, you mean...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinerva groaned! Stupid, sick, gross, oversexed, overmuscled brothers...She was going to the ball! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinerva headed along a corridor into the main foyer of the enormous old castle. Here, hundreds of people were gathered. Noblemen, their wives, their sons and daughters. Famous soldiers and warriors, and their families, the heads of famous crafting-families, and a smattering of courtiers and government officials. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Minerva!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinerva turned around. Climbing down a staircase was Prince Cassius. He wore a white and gold tunic and hose, with sandals, and a dazzling silver breastplate. Across his front was a bright blue sash, with various pins and medals attached to it, most of them honorary military ranks bestowed on him by his father or grandfather. His blond hair was brushed neatly back and he wore a handsome gold medallion around his neck. He looked every inch the handsome Mountain prince of her dreams! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinerva curtsied as the prince approached and kissed his hand respectfully. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good evening, my lord Cassius\", she said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassius raised her own hand and kissed it in reply. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Madam\", he said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I did not know I was invited to the Queen's birthday celebrations\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well your grandmother knows my grandfather, and let's just say that between the two of them, they pulled a few strings...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinerva giggled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You WILL be my companion for this evening, won't you?\" he asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes!\" said Minerva. She was so honoured! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good! Come on, I'll introduce to my brothers...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe prince led her across the foyer to a boy with darker, brown-blond hair who was chatting to some girls. Cassius introduced him as his younger brother Gladius. Gladius smiled at Minerva as if he half-expected her to offer him certain...favours...which she would not have, of course. She felt quite revolted by the idea! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext, Cassius introduced her to a younger boy. He had not the muscles or dashing physique of his older brothers, but he was cute as an angel and very good-looking. He was about ten or eleven, and was much shorter than Cassius. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Minnie, this is my brother Triton. Triton, this is Lady Minerva\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi!\" said Triton, smiling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello!\" said Minerva. \"Oooh, what a cute little kitty!\" she gasped, stroking a pure white kitten that was wrapped around Triton's shoulders! It purred loudly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This here's Quicksilver!\" said Triton, stroking it. \"Say hello!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Miaow!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Triton, you're not supposed to bring pets into the dining-hall!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mother and father said it was alright!\" Triton said, looking hurt! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Triton! We don't want him running around under the tables!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He won't! He won't! Really he won't Cassius! He's a GOOD kitten!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTriton squeezed Quicksilver almost to death, determined not to let him go! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He BETTER be a good kitten, or else his tail's gonna become the lining of my scabbard!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"MOMMA!\" Triton yelped, and jogged away. \"Momma! Cassius wanna eat Quicksilver! And you <i>said</i> I could take him to the party with me!...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My lord, that was not very nice!\" said Minerva. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perhaps\", said Cassius. \"But Triton is far too attached to his pets. You know apart from the cat, he also has a goldfish named Bubbles, a Canary named Tweets and a Mountanian timber-wolf named Cerberus!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Timber wolf!? Aren't those dangerous?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was an orphan cub, and Triton took it in. It's quite tame and a bit of a baby, really...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLong ceremonial bugles were raised and sounded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! Time to head in!\" said Cassius, \"Come on\". </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The massive dining-hall was separated into three sections. At the very back of the room was the royal dais. Here sat old King Hercules, his son, King Leviathan, and Queen Athena, with their closest friends. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNearby were tables for great nobles and courtiers, famous warriors and soldiers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA little further down was the next section, with tables for the younger set. And at the very end were tables for the real children of the court. Prince Triton sat here with his friends...who were all trying to feed Quicksilver the kitten, some prime smoked river salmon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBetween the three collections of tables were large, communal areas, punctuated by huge buffet-tables. Servants and guests wandered and mingled, feeding off the tables and then chatting in groups around the vast dining-hall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinerva watched as Prince Cassius chatted to some of his friends. She got up and headed over to a bunch of girls who all looked roughly her age. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...And then papa gave me THIS...\" said an older girl of about eighteen, showing off an expensive-looking pendant that was nestled snugly between her generous breasts. It was shaped like a heart, with a diamond in it, and was made of gold. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooh that's beautiful! Claire you're soooo lucky...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello...\" said Minerva, nervously. She entered the group. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who are you?\" one of the girls asked. Minerva sensed at once that these were the 'cool' girls. They had those arrogant, annoying, lofty, stuck-up, smug voices that came from having everything that they could ever want, and giving nothing in return. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I'm Lady Minerva\", she said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah? Lady of WHAT?\" another girl asked, sniggering. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey shut up, Jasmine! Hi Minnie!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinerva smiled, grateful to see a familiar face! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eldonia!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiled back. \"Wow that's a pretty dress\", she said. \"Did you make it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! It...my grandmother gave it to me. And the tiara\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My mother gave me a diamond necklace and earrings for MY birthday...\" said another girl. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh ignore her...\" Eldonia said to Minerva. \"You SEE what I meant about what I told you earlier?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Earlier?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When you ARRIVED here! Remember what I said?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...something about there being no kids here...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. THAT is what I mean. They're all stuck up bitches...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ellie, that's not very nice!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"THEY'RE not very nice...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well why do you talk to them?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who else is there!? Maybe you, if you want to...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, the two girls chatted and shifted by degrees, back into the folds of teenage girls. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomewhere in between their favourite shoes and their favourite sports, some of the girls gasped and squealed! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who is THAT?\" <br>\r\n\"Where?\"<br>\r\n\"Over there! Next to the pot-plant!\"<br>\r\n\"Oooh...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Minnie!\" said one of the girls, rounding on Minerva, \"What's about ten feet tall, four feet wide, about 800 pounds with brown hair and a body of a GOD?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dunno, what?\" Minerva asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Neither do I, but it's comin' this way!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls squealed excitedly! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Minerva could turn to look...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YEEEEK!!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe felt herself being hoisted up under her arms! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-hey girl...How's stuff?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinerva grimaced. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-you's havin' a--a good time, huh?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've been DRINKING!\" she spat. The strong scent of beer was unmistakable. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"J-just a couple...or...four...Hey, youse want me, I'm over there, 'kay...?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinerva glanced to a group of older boys mingling in the corner. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinerva nodded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A'ight...Hey...Love yah, girl...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe beast kissed her and roughly dropped her to the ground before shuffling off in search of food... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What...was...THAT!?\"<br>\r\n\"Minnie is he your BOYFRIEND!?\" <br>\r\n\"Oh he's a HUNK!\"<br>\r\n\"What a BUTT!\" <br>\r\n\"Look at rrrrrawwwrrr...\" <br>\r\n\"You are SO lucky if you get to sleep with that!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"IT is her brother, the Lord Fortis\", Eldonia said softly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe squeals were deafening! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Minerva knew what was happening, she found herself alone as the girls swarmed around her older brother. He wasn't dressed in much, although that was more by accident rather than design. He had his hose and codpiece, and a belt and scabbard with his sword in it, but was bare from the chest up...mostly because his old ceremonial breastplate refused to fit him anymore! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See what I mean?\" Eldonia said. \"They're all gold-diggers. Searching for the next hot young thing to sink their claws into...Oh! Father's calling me...I'll see you later!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia hugged Minerva, who squeezed her back, and the two girls parted company. Minerva gasped. The noise in here was getting a bit heavy! She needed to try and cool off and calm down a bit! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe decided to head... </span></div></div>",

She left the dining-hall and headed out into the corridor outside. She needed...she needed the toilet! Yes, that was it! The nearest pubic privies. Somewhere clean, warm, quiet...where she could wash up, collect herself and then head back to the party, refreshed and ready to eat, and drink and be happy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinerva entered the corridor and then realised...she didn't know where the privies were! She knew where her own toilet was for her guestroom, but the public bathrooms? No idea! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe headed down the corridor, trying to find them. She reasoned that eating and toiletry were so closely linked that where there was one, there had to be the other. Surely, somewhere, there was a public lavatory. She didn't actually need to 'go', she just wanted somewhere quiet to freshen up. She turned a corner and stared at a bunch of older boys who were drinking and talking loudly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HEY!\" one of them shouted, \"Hey look!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinerva spotted the sign at the far end of the corridor that indicated the public bathrooms. She would just walk through and ignore them. She started down the corridor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He-e-*hic!*-hey...Y-you're cute!\" one of the boys slurred. He reeked of sweat, whiskey and...something else that Minerva rathered not guess of! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe reached out and grabbed her, \"You-y *BELCH!* You're purdeeeehehehehahahaha!!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boys all laughed! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh leave me alone!\" Minerva hissed, pulling her arm away. Living with three older brothers had given her the fortitude and strength to not be bullied by boys! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eeeh a fighter!\" said another one. He stood up and blocked her path. Minerva turned to go, but another boy blocked the way out! She tried to push through, but they were all bigger and stronger than she was! She suddenly felt hands grabbing her, touching her, squeezing her! She felt something rip and she screamed!! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"HEY!\"</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA voice bellowed down the corridor!

On your back, silly!...That's right...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassius tugged off the shawl and gown than Minerva was wearing, and slowly unbuttoned the back of her dress, sliding it down. He lit a few scented candles and reached for some scented massage-oils. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why does a BOY have things like this in his room?\" she asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do a lot of working out\", Cassius said. \"I don't want this room reeking of sweat all the time. So I light scented candles instead. And it's the same with the massage-oils...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aaah...\" said Minerva. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, Cassius started rubbing, squeezing, poking and drumming her back and arms. Minerva groaned and almost fell asleep! This was fantastic...this was...this was...mmmmmmmmm!! Oooh yeeeeeessssssssss... </span></div></div>",

But she could still feel something warm...and firm...and...handsome... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe twisted around to see Prince Cassius hugging her. She pretended to be shocked! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Does my lady consent?\" Cassius whispered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm!\" Minerva moaned. Cassius hugged her and kissed her on the cheek. Minerva gasped! She was being fondled and hugged by the heir to the throne!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe incredibly CUTE heir to the throne. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shuddered and slowly began to return the prince's favours. Soon, they were hugging and kissing, stroking and mussing each other on the bed. Eventually, Cassius pushed her away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-we should stop before someone comes in...\" <br>\r\n\"Is anyone likely to? You don't have servants, do you?\"<br>\r\n\"Well...yeah, but they have the night off...I was a BIT more worried about your brother\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh for goodness sake!\" said Minerva. \"If you're THAT worried about Fortis, DO something about it!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fortis doesn't want you hanging out with me because he thinks you're a WIMP!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh!?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're always so timid!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am NOT!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...well...you are around him!

She giggled. He was SO eager to please! She kissed him, curtsied, and left the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassius threw himself on his bed! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat a girl!! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe lay there, trying to figure out what to do next...</span></div></div>",

Someone strong...handsome...powerful...confident! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassius got off his bed and stared at himself in the mirror. He was all of those things! And more! Cassius was relatively tall for his age, about six feet three inches, and he had a slim, strong, athletic build. He stared at himself, still wearing his ceremonial armor. Now he would need some mental armor... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stood up straight, took a deep breath, and left his room. He headed down the corridor and around to the guest-wing. He found the appropriate room and knocked on the doors. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come in!\" a voice called out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassius opened the doors and stepped inside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe room was large and dark. There were candles burning either side of a huge canopy-bed, and a fire in the grate. And candles burning on a large dressing-table. Standing in front of the dressing-table wearing only his smalls was a giant of a man. His face was white with shaving-soap, and in one hand he held a massive straight-razor the size of a meat-cleaver. He was busy scraping his stubble off his face before going to bed. His musculature was clearly visible in the candlelight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassius cleared his throat. The giant finished shaving, washed his face, and turned around. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...it's you...What do you want?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First...\" said Cassius, stepping forward, \"It's not 'You'. You are my father's subject, Lord Fortis. And that makes you my subject. And that means you will address me as such. It will be Your Royal Highness, and nothing else...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh-huh...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis picked up his strop and began skimming his razor back and forth at lightning speed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"STOP THAT!\" Cassius barked. Fortis flinched, his shoulders rippling. He put down the razor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And stand up straight! Now...I wish to do the respectful thing here, and I expect you to give me respect in return!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh-huh...What's that?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wish to write and accompany your sister, the Lady Minerva\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis stepped forwards. Soon, he was in front of Cassius. He was so close that Cassius could almost lick him. Fortis was five years older and four feet taller than Cassius. And he outweighed him by more than double. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis smirked. \"Oh I get it. You save the cute girl from being ravaged by drunken hooligans. So you think her older brother's going to give you the permission you want to have your own way with her...huh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassius glared at Fortis. Fortis laughed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, okay...I see. Well...You got balls, boy. I like that. I see that you value my sister's company. Very well. You will have her, then\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassius nodded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"BUT...If you hit her. If you touch her without her permission. If you make her cry. If you do ANYTHING that compromises her reputation, I WILL rip you a new asshole. You will treat her respect and you will treat her with love and affection, which I expect you as a prince, know how to do\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassius nodded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If things don't work out, then you will tell me. And I will tell her. I don't want you screwing up a break-up and leaving her in tears. She would understand it better if I told her personally. Understand?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassius nodded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well. Then, you have my permission\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Goodnight. Your Royal Highness\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis gave a stiff, unnatural-looking bow from the chest. Cassius nodded in recognition, and left. </span></div></div>",

She stared at her tall, stately-looking grandmother who was helping herself to an array of fresh, wafting pastries on the sideboard of the royal dining-hall. As old King Hercules's friend, she always got special treatment...and she made damn sure that her grandchildren got special treatment as well...such as her darling granddaughter Minerva being allowed to eat with the Crown Prince! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassius nodded. \"I know\", he said. \"I would like to write to you, if it's alright\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes of course!\" Minerva said. She opened her purse and pulled out a neat little calling-card. She handed it to Cassius. \"There you are. My name and address\", she said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Say um...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassius gulped, \"Uh, it's still early and uh,...the court isn't as crowded now that mother's birthday is over. Um...Per-perhaps you'd like to uh...um...To see the palace? Wh...no you don't, um...uh, h-how about um...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I would love to\", Minerva said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-you would...YOU WOULD!?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like to see the palace\", Minerva said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...g-g-great! Um...Yeah! F-fantastic! Um...wait there!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassius got up and went to speak to his parents. The Queen smiled and King Leviathan nodded and seemed to be lecturing the prince on something, to which the prince nodded dutifully in reply. Minerva suspected it was something about gentlemanly conduct. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come along!\" Cassius said cheerfully, taking her hand. Minerva smiled and got up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...and WHERE do you think you're going with THAT?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh give it a REST, Fortis!\" Minerva sighed. \"He's just giving me a tour of the palace! We're not doing ANYTHING!\" she said. \"I'll give you a massage later if you let us go now...\" she said in a sing-song voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis groaned. He DID like his sister's massages. She used all those fancy scented oils that felt so wonderful and warm and...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh what the hell...Okay. But you be careful, alright!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes Fortis!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wasn't talking to you, girl!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinerva giggled, grabbed Cassius's hand and ran off down the corridor with him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sheesh! Is he ALWAYS like that!?\" Cassius asked. <br>\r\n\"Most of the time!\" Minerva giggled. \"Never mind! Fortis is harmelss!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not with those arms he's not! He looks like a gorilla!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinerva laughed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, I'll show you the armoury!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoom by room, Cassius showed Minerva through the palace. The armoury, the chart-room, full of maps and globes and all other documents regarding navigation and geography, the stone-room, full of display cases loaded with precious stones and jewels... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooh that one is so beautiful!\" Minerva said, pointing to a large, round diamond set in gold with rubies and sapphires around the edge. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's beautiful isn't it? That was my grandmother's. Mother occasionally comes in here to take jewels out and wear them\". He pointed to a fat, velvet cushion with a card on it which read: \"CURRENTLY IN USE by...\" and underneath was handwritten the Queen's name. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh she must feel so lucky to have a whole HALL dedicated to such amazing treasures!\" Minerva gasped. \"How ever do you keep it safe!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are YOU planning to steal them!?\" Cassius asked, rounding on her and pretending to pin her to the wall. She giggled, \"No! I was just wondering! It seems too easy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah you'd think that\", said Cassius. He pointed upwards to what looked like long spikes in the ceilings. \"Those gates drop down and lock if anyone breaks the glass or anything. They're on a very delicate hair-trigger mechanism. Anything more than a moderate jolt and...WHAM!!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinerva continued to wander around the palace. She could see the library, the nursery, the conservatory, the gymnasium, the royal bathhouse, and the forge... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh it's amazing!\" she said, staring at all the beautiful pieces of ironwork on the walls. She picked up a large, four-armed, five-socket candelabrum made of coiled wrought iron. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's so beautiful!\" she said, examining the neat, delicate twists and curls in the metal. \"To think such big arms and hands made something so intricate and delicate!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh it's not that delicate!\" said Cassius, picking it up and striking it on an anvil. The metal let out a loud 'CLANG!!' Minerva laughed! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here's something I made\", Cassius said. He pointed to a set of wrought iron frames. One low one and several higher, smaller ones. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are these?\" she asked. \"They look like...um...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're tables!\" Cassius said. \"These spaces here is where the tabletops go. I'm hoping to make them out of glass!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh how beautiful! And...and then you can see the metalwork underneath! That's ingenious! You're so talented!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassius BLUSHED!! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You MUST make me a set of tables like this! Oh they would look so beautiful in our living-room!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're not cheap!\" Cassius warned, \"I make them all by hand!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I can SEE!\" she said, rubbing his arms. Cassius flexed and she giggled. \"I can pay\", she said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well write me a letter\", Cassius said, \"And sketch out what you'd like your thing to look like, and I'll try and make it!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yes! Yes indeed! Thank you!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me, m'lady...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA young teenager of Minerva's age entered the forge, \"But thy brother is asking for you, m'lady\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, Penny?\" Minerva asked her lady's maid. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, Miss Minerva. Somethin' about packin' for tomorrow...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh goodness!\" Minerva gasped, \"But...I thought that was YOUR job?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's DONE, m'lady! But Master Fortis wanted to see you anyway, just in case...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can't you SEE who I'm with, Penelope!?\" Minerva gasped, frustratedly . Penelope gulped and curtised at once! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do beg your pardon, your roy...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's alright!\" said Cassius. \"Minerva, you better go. I don't want to get on your brother's wrong side again!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinerva nodded, \"Yes you're probably right. I'll see you at dinner!\" she said. </span></div></div>",

Although they tried, marriages in Mountania were infamously shaky, with frustrated wives and girlfriends seeking...satisfaction... with the next beefy hunk that showed up...and unfulfilled horny bachelors searching for hungry women who wanted that little bit...more...Stable marriages were almost mythical in this land of sweat, brawn and boastfulness, but they did exist. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeople began whispering, wondering if they were about to see the Crown Prince bed his first prey... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt dinner, courtiers and their families watched the prince and Minerva. They chatted, fed each other, held hands, and sat opposite each other. Everyone stared at Fortis. Fortis's extremely overprotective, almost stifling attitude around his sister was well-known in society. Stories abounded about what happened to the last person who tried to force his attention on the young nobleman's attractive little sister. What EXACTLY happened, nobody had ever found out...not even Minerva herself. But rumors of a violent and painful end wafted around the court like smoke. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nScandalous rumors that the young nobleman, Lord Fortis, held suitors to his sister at bay for his own...selfish desires...were as dreams coated in chocolate to some of the more chatty women of the court. Surely, such a pumped up young jock couldn't resist such a fine young...but they tried not to think of that. Fortis genuinely cared for his sister and to aneyone who really knew him, the idea that he would force himself upon her was ridiculous!...or was it? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhispers, sideways glances and peeks followed Minerva and Cassius all evening. The next day, Minerva was relieved to be leaving the palace! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe thanked Cassius for his hospitality and waved goodbye to the king.

They passed through the gates and over the bridge and into the grounds. The carriage rumbled down the drive, past the neatly manicured lawns and hedges...the passion of their head gardener, Mr. Hobbes. There he was! Minerva waved cheerfully at a fat, bearded man wearing a grubby old tunic. He was on his knees, pulling out some weeds. He waved back and smiled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe carriage pulled up in front of the house. The doors opened. Minerva climbed out. Her dainty, clean hand was grasped by a large, chubby hand, still slightly covered in dirt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"G'aftermoon, marm\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mr. Hobbes!\" Minerva cried out. \"Oh you didn't have to!\" she said. \"Thank you...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ma'am\", he said, bowing. \"It's a pleasure to be seein' you back here...if not thy father...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinerva sniffed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I beg 'e pardon, ma'am...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's alright\", Minerva said. \"Father's with the trees and the grasses now\", she added. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mr. Hobbes\", Fortis rumbled, hopping down from the driver's box and lifting the heavy travelling trunks off the carriage roof. The rotund Fatlantean gardener stepped back and bowed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"G'afternoon, m'lud!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is everything alright in the gardens?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yessuh!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good...good...I don't want to be doing no morning exercises outdoors in summer where the gardens ain't lookin' nice...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No fear o' that, m'lud!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good...Come on you two! Move your asses! You can't expect Minerva to carry all this!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCannius and Jupiter had fallen asleep in the carriage! They jerked awake! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh!? Wha...Oh wow we're home!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"MOVE IT!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis almost THREW Cannius a heavily-loaded travelling trunk, which bowled him over! Cannius scrambled to his feet and picked up the trunk. Minerva sighed. She would go inside. Penelope, her maid, opened the doors. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinerva shuffled inside. It was so GOOD to be home! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, she couldn't see! What was happening!? Somebody had grabbed her and covered her eyes!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guess whooooo!!\" a high voice cried out. Minerva stood there, frowning...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"GRANDMA!!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe whirled around and was enveloped in a hug from a tall, stately-looking older woman. Lady Athena smiled and kissed her granddaughter. \"Granny! Granny! Wh-what are you doing here!?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I arrived here a few days ago, after I left the palace. One of my Fantasmian friends agreed to send me here. I'm moving in with you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M-moving in!?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yes. With your father gone, and only your brothers, you need an older female around the house\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh granny!\" Minerva cried out, kissing her grandmother. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There there, my honeybucket...Nanna's here...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"MINERVA! MOVE YOUR ASS!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis lumbered in, carrying six huge travelling-trunks in his monstrous arms. Minerva jumped! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>WHAM!!</b> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe trunks crashed to the ground and Fortis stood up, cracking his back and groaning. \"Lazy bastards...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fortis! Don't say that in front of Granny!\" Minerva piped up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Granny ain't here! I'll say whatever the hell I want! YOU TWO! MOVE IT!...Useless lumps of meat...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fortis! You will NOT speak to your brothers like that!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis jumped and whirled around! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shit!...G-ggranny!\" he stammered. At once, all the bravado and machismo vanished! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-h-hhi-hi g-g-ggranny...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's better!\" she said. \"Now, give me a hug\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis stared at his grandmother. She wasn't exactly SMALL, but to someone like Fortis, she looked like a tiny, little old lady who had to be handled like some delicate antique teapot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh come on!\" she snapped. Fortis lifted her up and hugged her. He gave her a rough kiss. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Love you, Nannah\", he said, and lowered her down. \"So, how long are you staying?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who said I was leaving?\" she asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Granny's moving in with us, Fortis!\" Minerva said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's great...wonderful...WHAT!?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't you dare take that tone with ME young man!\" Lady Athena barked with surprising ferocity! \"You should thank me for moving in with you! It's obvious this place requires a woman's touch!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It DOES!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis grabbed Minerva. \"THIS woman!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinerva blushed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The rest of it is BoyCountry, the rest of it is...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A complete mess!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It wouldn't be if the housemaids spent more time sweeping the fortress instead of sleeping with Fortis...\" Jupiter said, entering the foyer. He bowed slightly and kissed his grandmother, \"Hi Nanna\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jupiter my sweet one...Fortis, I think it's very unkind of you to be taking advantage of the serving girls!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What advanta...Oh yeah, gettin' it on with me's gotta be pretty advantageous, huh...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three brutish boys laughed, but they froze to ice under the stare their grandmother leveled at them, even though she was half their size! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now go and clean up!\" she said, \"We're having dinner early tonight!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Set out before them was a huge array of sausages, bacon, bread, eggs, fresh garden salad, beer, wine and various roast meats. His grandmother sat opposite him. Minerva sat in the middle on one side, and her two other brothers sat together on the other side. Minerva stared at the beautiful array of food. She reached out tentatively for a dinner-roll. Fortis nodded, and she started eating, dipping the roll in olive oil and vinegar before nibbling on it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis stood up. He picked up the large carafe of wine and lumbered over to his sister. He held the carafe over her head. Minerva pushed her dainty silver goblet aside. Fortis filled it up and handed it back. He moved to his grandmother. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, darling\", she said. She handed him her goblet and he filled it up. She reached up to touch his huge arm while he handed the goblet back. She smiled at him. Fortis merely grunted and sat down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!\" said Jupiter, \"How's come we don't get no wine?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You ain't girls\", Fortis said gruffly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! Grandma's not a girl, you gave her wine!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You suggestin' grandma's a man?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinerva and grandma burst out laughing! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh enough, everyone!\" Lady Athena said. \"Let us eat! Girl, I want some of those sausages, with the tomato ketchup and the mustard-sauce, please\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes granny!\" said Minerva, passing the tray across. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooh these look very nice. What are they, Fortis?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis stared at the sausages. \"Pork\", he said. \"Salted pork. Imported from Fatlantis. We've got beef too if you want it...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No no no, pork will be fine...Oooh! This mustard is very strong!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hahaha...yeah...I was about to warn you about that..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh tush! I was spreading condiments more powerful than THIS on my food when I was your age, young Fortis...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt once, this sparked a debate of culinary toughness! Fortis called one of the serving-girls over and ordered her to bring forth from the kitchen, the household array of spices and chilies. Soon, they were adding everything to their food, from black pepper all the way up to Mountanian Fire Bells, powerful, bulb-shaped chili-peppers which were bright red and which packed an almost heart-stopping kick! Minerva chomped on one experimentally. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Girl, I wouldn't suggest...\" Fortis began. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAAAAAAAARRGGGHHHHHH!!!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...eating that...Girl!\" Fortis called. The housemaid on table-duty stepped forward. \"Find Lady Minerva some milk to wash that fire down with will yah?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes my lord!\" she said. She hurried away to the kitchens and came back with several jugs of milk and glasses for everyone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooh...ooooh...oooooooh...\" Minerva wheezed, gulping down the milk and sweating like a pig. Everyone laughed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I tell yah...\" she gasped, \"...those...f-fire bells...r-really c-clear out the nasal passages...AAAHCHOOO!!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Boys!\" Fortis said, \"Toast your sister. She's survived her Trial of Fire!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three brothers raised their goblets and clanked them together and cheered. Lady Athena giggled at her grandsons. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Good morning master\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis groaned. He opened his eyes to stare at a slim, short boy with dark blond hair and dark blue eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning, Koviac...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYoung Lord Koviac lived in the Earl's household. He was a page, a knight-in-training, to his master, the Earl. Fortis clambered out of bed, towering over his puny servant/student. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will you dress, my lord?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis shook his head. \"Exercise first...Then breakfast...then a bath...Then I'll change...No point otherwise...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes master. Breakfast will be ready when you are\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis lumbered out of his bedroom. It was still dark outside and he tried to be as quiet as possible, stepping as gently as he could past his brothers doors, and past the doors belonging to his sister and grandmother. He paused and opened one of them and peeked in. He could just see Minerva's hair on her pillows. He smiled and closed the door before sneaking off into the garden. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next two hours were filled with push-ups, sit-ups, weights and fast walking. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinerva woke up. She shuffled to her windows and drew back the curtains. She stared out at the rising sun to see her brother doing cartwheels across the lawn under her bedroom windows. She giggled. The idea of someone as enormous and heavy as Fortis doing something as dainty and ladylike as cartwheels! She opened her windows and stepped onto her balcony and walked over to the edge. She giggled again, covering her mouth. Fortis flopped down and stood up. He spotted his sister on her balcony. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What're you laughin' about?\" he barked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The idea of YOU doing cartwheels!\" Minerva squealed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anything that builds the body isn't stupid!\" Fortis retorted, and went back to splitting firewood... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn hour later and Fortis came back into the castle. He was stripped to his waist, wearing only his undershorts. His broad-chested body drenched with sweat from chopping and splitting untold cords of firewood. He lumbered heavily into the dining-room to examine the food on the buffet-table for breakfast...The sun was only just coming in through the windows and the candles were only half-lit. The young nobleman started shovelling out eggs, bacon, toast, sausages, beans, fried tomatoes and...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why Fortis! I do believe all that axe-swinging is doing quite the bit of good for your arms!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>CLANG!!!</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis jumped, knocking over silver milk-jug! He whirled around to see his grandmother sitting at the table, buttering her toast. Had she been there ALL that time...perving on him!? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"GRANDMA!!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLady Athena cackled. \"Go and CHANGE, boy!\" she chuckled, \"I'll not have you eating breakfast half-naked!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll eat breakfast how I choose, then I'll have my bath, then I'll change!\" he said haughtily. He sat down gruffly. Lady Athena walked up to her muscular grandson and patted him on the shoulders. \"You are a good boy, Fortis...\" she said, and kissed him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooooooh...\"<br>\r\n\"SHUT UP, GIRL!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinerva giggled and jogged in and gave her sweating brother a kiss. \"Morning, Sleepy!\" she teased. Fortis groaned. Could he have just a few MINUTES alone to eat, instead of having his grandmother and sister fussing over him? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe bolted down his breakfast and jogged out of the room and upstairs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Master!\" Koviac called out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Later!\" Fortis growled. He had to get a grip and find somewhere quiet to relax! And have a BATH...Yes that was it! He needed a bath! A nice bath...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Master!\" Koviac shouted, jogging after the young earl, \"I...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is my bath drawn?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes! But...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good! Leave me alone! I don't want to be disturbed for the next hour!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door to Fortis's bathroom slammed shut. A few minutes later, all that could be heard was the splashing of hot water. Koviac groaned. He knocked on the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Master! I need to...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"LATER!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing, the boy opened the door into the bathroom. Stretched out in a massive, twenty-foot long marble bathtub, the earl stared at his servant. \"WHAT!?\" he bellowed so loud that Koviac was bowled over! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This!\" Koviac hissed, waving a piece of paper at his master. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well why didn't you SAY SO! Stupid boy...Give it!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis snatched the piece of paper from his servant. He froze. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSealing the letter shut were three large, red wax seals. He recognised the one in the middle. It had adorned many important documents that his father used to receive. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe seal in the middle, of a dragon, meant that the KING himself had personally written, signed and sealed the communication that he held in his hands. Fortis froze in the water. He broke the three seals and started reading. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is it bad?\" Koviac asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he could even move, Fortis jumped out of the bath and ran! Water was flying everywhere! He sprinted downstairs to where his grandmother and sister were leisurely taking their breakfast. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, Fortis...\" Minerva said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen to this...\" Fortis said, waving the piece of paper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...yes, brother,\" said Minerva, \"But...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...By order of His Majesty, King Leviathan, Lord High Protector of the Realms...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fooooorrrrtis...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...owing to an unprovoked attack on communities along our northern borders, all members of the military class are to mobilise at once...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...FORTIS!...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...and assemble at Ferramount in a week's time, to be given their assignments...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis lowered the letter, \"What do you think? It means we're going to war! The Vladians again!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's wonderful, Fortis\", Lady Athena said flatly, \"And I'm sure you're raring to go...but DO put something on before you appear before your sister. Her sensitivities can't handle such things, you know...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh...WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARRRGGGGHHHHH!!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...I tooooold you there was something important...\" Minerva said, sighing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis rushed upstairs to start dressing. Minerva stared at her grandmother in alarm! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, honey!\" she cooed. \"All the men are like this. Especially when they're young...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeveral minutes later, and Fortis appeared, dressed in armour. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot dress-armour. Fancy, decorated ceremonial stuff for parties, dinners and state events at the great royal palace, parades or anything like that, but full battle-gear! A tremendous sword, six feet long, two shorter swords strapped to his back, daggers, knives...it was a terrifying display of weaponry. Lady Athena blushed and smiled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My goodness! Fortis you look so handsome!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not supposed to be HANDSOME, grandma! It's supposed to kick ass!\" Fortis growled. He turned around and then said in a lighter tone, \"Um...so...whatcha think?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLady Athena chuckled. \"Very very...um...impressive, my dear\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks gran\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis drew out the heavy, steel sword and handed it to Minerva. \"Here girl, hold this for me, huh...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinerva grabbed the huge, double-handed sword by the handle, but the weight of the steel was incredible! Fortis laughed and snatched it up easily with one hand. He smirked and then whirled it over his head! He started showing off his swordfighting maneuvers, swinging, thrusting, balancing, slicing...Minerva clapped! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You damn right it's good!\" Fortis shouted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She called her 'Snowflake'. Nearby were his brother's horses, Sulphur, which was a sort of tan colour, and Charcoal, which was jet black. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe stall at the end opened and a large horse, much larger than the others, clopped out. The horse had to be large and strong, to support Fortis's immense weight, and to be able to carry someone of his height! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAjax held the stallion by the reins while he strapped on the saddle.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"MOVE YOUR ASS, BOY!!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKoviac rushed to set up the quintain for his master! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe quintain was a mock-up of a knight. It had a wooden frame which supported a suit of armour and a helmet, with two arms that stuck out. One arm held a shield, the other, a wooden dummy-sword. The entire apparatus was mounted on a swiveling wooden stand. The idea was to hit the shield and then move out of the way of the avenging blade as the dummy swung around to counterattack. It was hard enough dressed in armour on foot, on horseback...well...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis brandished his heavy sword and charged the quintain. He struck the shield and pulled on the reins! Vortex snorted and wheeled off around in a sharp 180-degree turn, swinging out of the way of the dummy sword that whipped around as the shield swung off and away. Fortis kept attacking the quintain with various weapons. Swords, lances, javelins, spears, axes, each time moving faster and faster with greater and greater determination. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYoung Lord Koviac, the earl's page, replaced broken armour, removed rivets, hammered pieces straight and generally kept the quintain from falling apart under his master's vicious attacks. Koviac was used to Fortis's rough treatment. He'd been the young nobleman's page, his servant and student, since the age of seven. He had to learn such things as how to identify every single piece of armour, how they linked together, how they were put on, taken off, how they were cleaned, how to keep them shiny to prevent rusting, and how to use the various weapons which Fortis had in his possession. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeing of noble birth himself did not protect Koviac from his master's brutal treatment. It was deemed necessary to toughen him up for battle in the future. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"COME ON, BOY! THE LANCE! MOVE IT! NOW NOW NOW!\" Fortis bellowed. \"I SAID MOVE IT! IN TWO WEEKS YOU'RE DOING THIS SHIT FOR REAL ON THE LINE, BOY! MOVE YOUR ASS! HUP HUP HUP! FASTER! MOVE IT! MY GRANDMA CAN DO THIS FASTER THAN YOU! I KNOW, I'VE SEEN HER TRY!...ENOUGH DAYDREAMING!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lance was surprisingly heavy for just being a long shaft of wood! Fortis lifted it easily into his arms and galloped off! He wheeled around and came back, throwing it aside. Koviac passed up the sword. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Grow those arms, boy!\" Fortis called out as he galloped off, \"None of that half-assed bullshit on the battlefield!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis swung the sword! There was a sickening \"CRACK!!\" as the shield and half the arm was smashed off of the quintain! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"ANOTHER ONE!\" Fortis yelled. Koviac was already running towards the quintain. He broke it up, threw it onto a pile of other, decimated dummy soldiers, and started setting up another one. Fortis was wheeling around again for the attack, when he heard clapping. He stopped and stared to where his sister was standing under a tree. He galloped over and dismounted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Girl! What're you doin' here?\" Fortis growled. \"Don't want you gettin' hurt...this is man's stuff...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Fortis!\" said Minerva, \"I wanted to see you practicing! It's so exciting!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ain't excitin', girl! It's training!...YOU TWO! MOVE IT!\" Fortis yelled at his two younger brothers who jogged past, carrying enormous sacks on their backs, loaded with stones. \"That's only lap five! You got another fifteen! Now get your asses up!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinerva giggled. Giving orders seemed to come naturally to a big man like Fortis. She reached up and touched his armour. Fortis grabbed her under the arms and kissed her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'n'gramma keep the fortress safe, huh?\" he said. Minerva smiled and nodded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Atta girl...\" said Fortis, almost dropping her to the ground. Minerva moved to a safer distance. She watched Cannius and Jupiter round the side of the house again, sweating and gasping for breath! They crashed to the ground, panting and heaving for air! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"GET YOUR ASSES UP AND MOVE! THIS AIN'T SOME STUPID BATHHOUSE!\" Fortis yelled at them. Minerva laughed as both boys reached for large buckets of water and started gulping them down. She was glad that she was raised to be a nobleman's daughter, and not a warrior bride! A life of quiet and genteel living was the life for her! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis, Cannius and Jupiter... </span></div></div>",

Penelope smiled as she kept playing her violin, a special gift from the late lord, Minerva's father. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's nice to have music while we knit\", said Minerva, smiling approvingly. Athena nodded. The house was so peaceful and quiet...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>BANG!!</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The boys are back, I see...\" Athena said, not even bothering to look up from what she was doing. The doors to the parlour swung open and Minerva looked up to see the three, filthy, sweat-drenched hunks that stood in the doorway. They reeked of perspiration, their great Mountanian forms glistening in moisture! Fortis towered over his two younger brothers, his broad shoulders and arms dribbling sweat. All three of them were dressed only in their undershorts, drenched in sweat and clinging tightly to their bodies. Minerva tried NOT to pay any attention to the more-than-impressive bulges that she noticed...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He-hey gr-gramma...\" Cannius gasped, \"W-w-whe-when's d-di-dinner...?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not until you all go and wash!\" Lady Athena gasped, holding her hand to her nose! \"Wooof! You all smell like...I don't even know WHAT! Now leave at once!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You heard your grandma!\" Fortis barked. \"You're offendin' her delicate, ladylike senses with your presence! Now upstairs!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah Fortis, you know all about delicate, ladylike senses...\" Jupiter teased. Cannius and Minerva burst out laughing. Fortis just scowled. Upstairs, boiling hot baths were waiting for all three of them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNearly two hours later, and the three brothers returned to the parlour, freshly dressed and cleaned. They stared at their sister and grandmother, knitting dutifully away for king and country. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell is that?\" said Fortis. He indicated a long, sausage-like appendage hanging off of Minerva's knees. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's um...uh...it's a...When it's finished, it'll look like...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a cock-sock!\" said Jupiter.

Oil lamps and candles burned along the walls and on the table. Laid out in front of them was the glittering silverware, boneware, crystalware and pewterware, all filled with food. While it was generally true that Mountanians didn't eat nearly as much as their southern counterparts, someone of Fortis's size ate like a whale at the table. His immense body and the furious physical work that he did screamed for monstrous amounts of food. He helped himself to bread, oil, vinegar, cold cuts, roast meats, cold meats, salted meats, tomatoes, cucumbers, sandwiches, eggs...Minerva sighed. There was something faintly unattractive about seeing her oldest brother gorging himself at dinner, even though she knew he needed such vast amounts of food to keep him going. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do slow down, Fortis!\" Minerva pleaded, \"Such speed can't be good for you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut all three of her brothers seemed to ignore her!

You leave your sister to her dinner!\" Lady Athena squawked from the far end of the table. Fortis shrugged and reached for a tankard of ale. He was thirsty as hell after all that horseback riding, jousting, swordplay, archery and everything else... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happens now?\" Minerva asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis glugged down the last of his ale and belched loudly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"FORTIS!\" Lady Athena yelped. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whussat, girl?\" Fortis asked. He was now slicing into the sausages on his plate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The war or whatever it is\", Minerva said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Vladians are comin' down south. They're trying to get their filthy little hands on our mining-areas. Granite, coal, iron, tin, gold, silver, quartz...all that stuff. We gotta stop them before they reach that far. Then we gotta drive them back, or outflank them and cut them off and destroy the bastards...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fortis\", Lady Athena said, \"Your language\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They ARE bastards!\" said Cannius, slamming his fist into the table. \"Every few years they get the balls to come charging down south and we send back their heads in buckets!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cannius!\" Minerva gasped. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?

Her three brothers were sawing into monstrous steaks as big as their own chests! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You want some, girl?\" Fortis asked, noticing her staring at his plate. Minerva nodded slightly. Fortis sawed off what he judged to be a 'small' piece and dumped it into his sister's plate. The steak was enormous! But she didn't want to say anything...Fortis might take it that she was full, and then commandeer her entire plate!...It had happened in the past... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doors to the dining-room opened and one of the maids entered. She carried a tray with a card on it. Fortis stopped in his feasting and waved the girl over. He took the card and frowned.

He feared for my safety. The king has ordered our estate be used for the recuperation of injured soldiers. Father thought it not the best place for me. He said I should come here. I apologise for not sending a letter, we were rather presumptuous...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You were indeed!\" said Lady Athena. \"But you are most welcome to stay...Isn't she, Fortis?\" Lady Athena asked, forcefully, hardly giving Fortis a chance to say anything! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...um...uh...uh...uh...yeah!\" said Fortis. He got up from the table and lumbered forwards. Eldonia curtsied. \"My lord\", she said. Fortis waved a hand and some of the maidservants hurried forwards. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Take Lady Eldonia's luggage upstairs to the main guestroom\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked down at her. Eldonia was a bit taller than Minerva, but still looked tiny to a giant like Fortis. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll sit for dinner\", he said, gruffly. \"Teresa. Cutlery and such, for the lady...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes my lord!\" said the maidservant. She opened the doors of a cabinet and pulled out extra plates, cups and cutlery. She set them out and moved to the side of the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia sat down. There wasn't much left. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I could get something for you...\" Fortis offered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no! I've already had a small meal already. These leftovers will do fine!\" Eldonia said, reaching out for the food. She smiled at Minerva, who smiled back. It was wonderful to have her best...and really...only...friend, staying with her! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter dinner...since there wasn't much food left, it didn't last very long, the girls left to retire to the front parlour. </span></div></div>",

When she was sure that the house was asleep, she slipped out of her guestroom and down the corridor. She remembered from earlier, where Fortis's bedroom was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia was madly in love with Fortis. She'd had the hots for him ever since she met him at the palace ball for the Queen's birthday! He was big, strong, powerful, devilishly handsome and caring, loving and gentle at the same time. Eldonia could tell, from the way that he treated his sister, that Fortis, despite all his brute strength and raw power, had a soft, tender and loving side. It was a side that most Mountain men didn't have. Or at least, they didn't seem to have it in the ways that Fortis did. That made him different and very...VERY attractive as a possible...'mate'. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia opened the doors to Fortis's bedroom and tiptoed inside. She carried a candle with her, which she shielded with her hands. She put it down next to Fortis's bed and slipped inside, blowing out the candle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bed was enormous, and right in the middle was the slumbering giant. She sidled up to the monster and snuggled up against him. She prodded him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hurrrggghhh...Hey girl...\" Fortis mumbled, \"Whatcha want, huh...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDidn't Fortis usually call his sister simply 'Girl'? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia's eyes bulged. In his dozy state, Fortis must think that SHE was actually his SISTER! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia knew that Minerva sometimes slept with her older brother when she was scared or lonely...which was a lot more frequently now, since her father had died...Eldonia decided to play on this... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fooooortis...\" she whined, trying to make her voice sound like Minerva's, \"Forty I'm scared!\" she whispered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehehe...yeah?

Yeah...C'mere\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBingo! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia felt the giant's huge arms wrap protectively around her! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo WONDER Minerva did this so often! It was so HOT! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough Eldonia strongly suspected that Minerva and her brother never DARED to do what she was planning...but still... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia snuggled up to Fortis and began kissing him, stroking him, hugging him, squeezing him... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Feelin' touchy tonight, huh girl...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmmm...\" Eldonia muffled. She reached her arms slowly around him. Fortis hugged her closer.

Eldonia just smirked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, Fortis smiled. \"Well go on, girl\", he invited. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia started exploring the giant hunk. The ultimate prize! Minerva could marry the Crown Prince, the gorgeous Prince Cassius Van Draconis, if she wanted to! Eldonia was more interested in what was on top of her! She started hugging and kissing him, rubbing him, groping him. Meanwhile, Fortis was enjoying the fact that such a gorgeous and...active young girl...was interested in him. He returned her favours just as rigorously, if a bit more gently. Eldonia groaned! She didn't want this! She wanted it ALL! She grabbed him and pulled him tightly towards her! She wanted him to ravage her like a wild animal! She started tugging off her nightdress. Fortis grabbed the fabric and literally ripped it apart! The sheer display of brute strength drove her wild! She started arcing and bucking and grinding, thrashing around, desperate for completion! </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Fortis was by no means a stranger to sex.  At the tender age of ten, he was already over six feet tall and over 200 pounds of solid muscle and attracting the attention of girls many years older than he was.  He had begun exploring the attentions some of the servant girls had lavished on him then, but he didn't experience the wonderful delight of having a willing girl under him until he was thirteen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...Of course, the loss of his virginity was done out in the horse stalls, and his father had caught him.  He had expected his father to berate and condemn him, but all his father had done was admonish him to be more discreet in his liaisons, as well as to be more careful.  The last thing his father wanted was to have some nobleman show up on their doorstep with a pregnant daughter and force Fortis to make an honest woman out of her by gunpoint.  The former earl then even admitted, with a red face, that Fortis had been born a mere six months after he had married his mother.  His father didn't want to have Fortis experience what he had.  Fortis had been utterly surprised by this revelation, but he took his father's words to heart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, ever since, Fortis made it a point to be well-supplied in prophylactics...not that he indiscriminately sought female company ALL the time.  Especially as he had gotten older and his father had begun training him to take over the earldom from him, Fortis had become more choosy with whom he bedded.  In fact, he hadn't had the delight of a woman, other than his dear sister, in his bed for several months.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis knew that Eldonia was young, but the anticipation of war had his adrenaline up, and his body was strung tight and hard.  The fact that Eldonia was rubbing her lovely soft, curvy, nubile body against him so provocatively didn't help, either, despite the fact he was pretty sure she was a virgin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he completely lost himself if the haze of lust clouding his senses, he held Eldonia down with one arm, effectively pinning her to the bed and ceasing her alluring rubbing against his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia moaned and bucked.  \"F-fortis!  My lord!  Please!\" she gasped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sh, sweet,\" he said huskily.  \"Gotta make sure I protect you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point, Eldonia didn't care.  She knew the risks she was taking coming to his bed.  If the consequences of this one, what she was sure to be, magnificent night in his arms resulted in her becoming enceinte...well, then, that just meant her father would make sure she'd become a countess, and she'd get to enjoy every night in Fortis's gloriously strong, muscular arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry about it,\" Eldonia whispered, moving her hands to stroke his bulging pectoral muscles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis groaned.  \"Sorry, girl.  Can't do that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis grasped her wandering hands and held her arms above her head, pinning her body down with his and making sure his weight on her was enough that she couldn't move, but not so much as to hurt her.  Fortis then reached over to his nightstand and pulled open the drawer where he kept his condoms.  He frowned as he searched and searched with his hand, moving it all over and around the drawer.  He could have sworn he had several of the animal coverings left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, he remembered Cannius asking for a few several weeks back, and then he given some to Jupiter after he caught him messing around with a tavern wench.  He couldn't be out...could he?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis was getting desperate.  Eldonia was now using her head to entice him to take her.  She ran her soft cheek against his bicep and even began licking at the sweat collecting on his skin.  Fortis shivered as a particularly long swipe of her tongue sent a tingle down his spine that made his already hard cock throb with want.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop that!\" Fortis growled, getting frustrated at not finding his quarry and knowing he would soon lose what little grasp he had on his control with Eldonia.  He jerked the drawer out of the nightstand, and it clattered to the floor.  Unfortunately, he had used so much strength that the drawer shattered on impact, sending its contents flying over the floor, including under the large bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis cursed richly and swore down curses on the drawer and the nightstand.  Eldonia giggled at his harsh language and began placing hot, wet kisses on his arm.  However, this just made Fortis curse all the more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point, Fortis knew he had only two options:</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Fortis may have appeared brash, rough and uncaring, but he did have his moral side. He wasn't about to take Eldonia without some sort of protection first. He shifted his weight off of her and whispered, \"Wait here, will yah?\" he hissed. He got up and, draping his dressing-gown around his body (\"I WISH he wouldn't do that...\" Eldonia groaned to herself), he shuffled out of his room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis opened Jupiter's bedroom next door and slipped in. Jupiter snored and grunted. The curtains were drawn around his canopy bed, and the stone floors meant that there were no floorboards that could creak to give Fortis's presence away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis found Jupiter's bedside cabinet and reached in. He pulled out a few condoms and tiptoed out of the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe condoms were wrapped in simple, throwaway paper packages. He put two into the pockets of his robes and pulled the third one open with his teeth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe momentary distraction that had caused a...lack of rigidity...was quickly overturned when he re-entered his bedroom. Eldonia had stripped herself completely naked, but was hiding...most of it...under the sheets. Fortis closed the doors and locked them. He turned around, took off his robe and hung it up. Eldonia admired the view as he lumbered back to bed. He lowered himself down and slipped under the sheets. Out of sight, he slipped on his protective sheath before he kissed her and kissed her over and over. It was a distraction from what was about to come... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis cupped a hand over Eldonia's mouth! She let out a muffled scream as she felt the hot, heavy invader punch its way inside her! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mon girl...\" said Fortis, chuckling. \"Y'like it, huh...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia was in so much pain she was seeing stars! Fortis's face swam around in front of her! Slowly, he pulled out and she took several hard gasps of air! There was a couple of seconds' pause, and then a steady inwards thrust again. Eldonia felt her insides fill and stretch! Then she felt the pain return! She gritted her teeth and let out a howl! Fortis grinned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You like that huh?\" he teased. \"HUH!?\" he barked. He suddenly rammed himself in even deeper! Eldonia let out a scream of agony! Fortis smothered her face with a pillow to stop waking up his brothers! Fortis wasn't trying to suffocate her...more like muffle her. He held the pillow over her face and she screamed into it as he plundered her depths, marking his territory on this spicy young little virgin girl... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she'd gotten over the pain and shock of her insides being ripped open like a paper bag, Eldonia began to calm down and enjoy the experience! She knew she wanted Fortis not to hold back, but she didn't expect it to be quite THIS...energetic! Feeling too weak and dizzy to contribute much to the experience at the time, Eldonia lay there while Fortis ravaged her! He treated her almost like a rag-doll as he piledrove his way deep inside her, her body, the entire bed, vibrating to powerful and unrelenting invasions! Eldonia gasped and moaned, cried and groaned! She was gasping and fidgeting, squealing and thrashing around! Fortis was becoming more brutal and animalistic with every passing minute. The bed vibrated alarmingly as he went full-tilt! Eldonia was floating somewhere outside of her body! The euphoria of being ploughed by a mountain god for the first time EVER was driving her insane! Suddenly, they both screamed! Eldonia clawed at the bedsheets, her body convulsing as if she was possessed! She almost fainted. When she was done and they were both spent, Eldonia passed out, in a sex-coma. Fortis lifted her easily off of his bed and carried her down the corridor to her guestroom. He would leave her there to recover from her first night of...\"mountain climbing\"...as the younger set often euphemistically called it, when they'd scored a night with a true Mountain god... </span></div></div>",

Come on...tell Minnie what happened...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe grinned, teasingly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt all came out in a rush! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Minerva it was INCREDIBLE! He was such a BEAST! He was so STRONG and so...so IN CONTROL! He was doing EVERYTHING to me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everything?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The works! The lot! The whole package!...and WHAT a package...Oh man!

Eldonia gasped as she started being touched and groped, kissed and fondled by a mountain GOD! She was getting hotter and hotter and more and more on edge! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis reached into his bedside cabinet and pulled something out. He forced the hard, round wooden ball-gag into Eldonia's mouth and tied the securing-straps around the back of her head. She screamed! The ball was sufficiently large, and the ropes sufficiently tight enough that she was in no danger of swallowing it. Which was just as well, considering what came next. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold tight, girl...\" Fortis teased. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, Eldonia realised the necessity for the ball-gag. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eyes bulged and she screamed into the round, wooden plug! She was shrieking in agony and thrashing around, howling in pain! He was shoving himself into her without a shred of mercy! She felt herself being torn open by a monster the size of which she could hardly accept! Tears welled up in her eyes as she felt herself being violently penetrated by a truly colossal fuck-tool. It was being driven into her like a wedge, splitting her open like a log of firewood with each, savage thrust! The pain was mindboggling! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith each brutal insertion, she was seeing stars! She kept breathing, hard and fast, hard and fast! It took a long time, but by degrees, the pain went away. Fortis drove himself deep within her and Eldonia let out a wail of ecstasy! She grabbed him with surprising strength and pulled him downwards towards her! She wanted this BEAST to DESTROY her! She wanted him to ravage her and take her to places she'd never seen! Fortis was only too happy to give her the riding of a lifetime! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia continued to groan and scream as she felt her virginity being taken! She bucked and thrashed wildly! She wanted it! She wanted it ALL! She wanted to be...to...to...to...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven the ball-gag couldn't stifle her howl of the deepest most meaningful pleasure in the world. She collapsed back on the bed, shaking and weak. Fortis chuckled. Another girl had fallen to his expert ministrations...Slowly, he pulled out the ball-gag and put it onto the bedside table. He'd wash it later. Eldonia was groaning and gasping for air! Fortis stared at her with a dominating look in his eyes. For a couple of seconds all they did was stare at each other...and then they kissed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVery slowly, Fortis removed himself from her...cavity. He didn't want to hurt her now that he'd given her so much pleasure. Eldonia lay there, slowly rubbing Fortis's fantastic body. He really was a prize catch! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike a lot of hot-blooded Mountain girls, Eldonia was interested in only the very best catches. As were her parents! It was essential for a young woman such as Eldonia to marry well. To marry someone rich, powerful, and capable of protecting her and giving her warmth and pleasure. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis looked like he could do that... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the other hand, men only wanted girls who looked hearty and capable. The smaller, more delicate girls were sometimes passed over, because men typically wanted strong-looking partners who were able to breed healthy and strong sons. Minerva was beautiful, but she was also a delicate sort of creature. Some men liked that too. But some of those men were only interested in sex, and not in making an honest woman of her. It was for this reason that Fortis was so incredibly protective of his sister's virginity. He would shield her from everything until he was convinced he saw someone who would make her happy and safe, and not just want her for her sweet and innocent nature. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia on the other hand, Fortis could see, was a determined young lady. Determined to find a man in her life who was able to provide her with a home, money, safety, strength, security and...certain...other necessities. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis lay in bed and Eldonia snuggled up to him. She kissed him. He was VERY good... Fortis rolled over and Eldonia, exhausted from keeping up with him, passed out and fell asleep. </span></div></div>",

It was four in the morning. She groaned. She got out of bed and left her room. One last time before they left for battle, Minerva decided to enjoy her brother's company. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCannius and Jupiter were insanely jealous that their beautiful and sweet younger sister always chose to spend her time with Fortis. Minerva didn't care! Let them be jealous! Fortis was her favourite brother, and she never hid it from anyone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe opened her brother's bedroom door and tiptoed inside. She closed the door and crept up to her brother's bedside. Daintily lifting the sheets, she slipped in. She could feel her brother's warm and scent. She snuggled up to his warm, hard, slightly sweaty body and shuffled right up against him. He smiled in his sleep, shifted slightly and wrapped himself around her. Minerva's feet kicked down and her mouth opened in shock slightly when she realised that Fortis wasn't wearing any underpants!...She guessed she shouldn't be too surprised...It wasn't that often that he did! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if in some automatic, sleeping state, Fortis grabbed his sister roughly and squeezed her close. Minerva snuggled up and kissed him. She was going to miss this sort of closeness with her brother...she loved him so much! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe dozed off... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Err-ooh-err-ooh-roooo!

She rolled over and sat up in bed...What a night...with a knight...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe chuckled at her little joke and stared at the slumbering giant next to her. Fortis's broad, muscular back hid from her the other occupant in the bed which had crept in a couple of hours before. Eldonia snuggled up to Fortis and kissed him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well hello, my great big hunky protector...\" she teased. Fortis groaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh...oh...yeah...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis shifted and moved. As he did, Minerva's limp body rolled out from between his arms. Eldonia shrieked! Minerva jerked awake! They both stared at each other in shock! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are YOU donig here!?\" Eldonia yelped!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M-m-m-ME!?\" Minerva spluttered. \"What are YOU doing here!?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, I'm the one asking!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's MY brother! If I want to share a bed with him, then I can! What are YOU doing here!?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I...\" Eldonia spluttered, \"I...I was cold!\" she said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis chuckled deeply. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure she was, sister\", said Fortis, giving Minerva a kiss. \"So she came in here to warm up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah!?\" Minerva said haughtily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh-huh...And you've NEVER done that?\" Fortis retorted. \"Uh...let me think!...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis now put on a surprisingly good imitation of his sister's voice, despite his own being so deep. \"Oh Fortis!

Please...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's COMPLETELY different!\" Minerva spurted out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh come on!\" said Fortis. \"She was...lonely...So I gave her some company and...HOLY CRAP!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis suddenly jumped out of bed, buck-naked! He had just realised the time! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh crap! Oh crap!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis rushed around the room, his dressing-table, bookcases, shelves and paintings on the walls shaking and bouncing to his heavy footfalls! He snatched up clothes willy-nilly, throwing them over his body and struggling for five minutes to jam his right boot onto his left foot, swearing loudly! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's the matter!?\" Minerva gasped. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh...I'M GONNA BE LATE YOU STUPID BITCH!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinerva's face froze! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis had NEVER sworn at her! Fortis gulped. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe hung his head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry Minnie!\" he said. \"I...I'm just in a real, real, REAL big rush!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis snatched everything off his dressing-table that he'd laid there the night before and RUSHED out of the room! He hammered on his brothers' bedroom doors so hard that he nearly broke them down! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"GET OFF YOUR FAT LAZY ASSES AND MOVE IT! WE'RE SUPPOSED TO BE ON THE ROAD BY NOW! MOVE MOVE MOVE!!! COME ON YOU LUMPY MAGGOTS!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two girls were bewildered by the rush of activity! In less than ten minutes, the trunks had been packed, stacked, strapped to the roof of the coach and then with a neigh of horse, a crack of whip, a grind of wheel and crumble of stone, and a blast of panicked dust...the three brothers were gone! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...\" said Eldonia. She stared at her friend. \"Um...Quiet around here...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I bet it wasn't last night\", Minerva said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinerva whipped back the bedsheets to reveal Eldonia's torn nightie, and she picked up the ball-gag on the bedside table. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Had some fun, did we?\" she asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh!? Uh...um...uh...y-yeah!\" said Eldonia. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinerva sat down on the bed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...How was it?\" she asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How should it be!?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinerva's eyes narrowed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia broke down! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Minerva it was incredible! Your brother is fantastic! He was holding me down! He was doing CRAZY things! He was...he was...acting like a...like a...a...a MONSTER! And it was just...MINDBLOWING! He is WONDERFUL!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinerva smiled. \"I imagined he would be...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've never TRIED!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"ME!? Goodness, no! He's my BROTHER!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh-huuuuuuh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No seriously! I never have!...I know he's bedded a lot of girls though...But he's only ever invited ME into his bed as a sleeping-companion and NOTHING else...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinerva paused. \"Eldonia...You DID use um...'protection' didn't you?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Protection?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean...preventatives...Did he um...sheath his sword before battle?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sh...Oh! Yeah absolutely!\" said Eldonia, lying at once. \"Of course! You know your brother! The big, tall, gallant and honourable lord of the land!\" she added quickly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinerva laughed. \"Come on, I'm hungry and the sun's coming up! Let's go have breakfast in the parlour where we can see the sun rise...\" </span></div></div>",

These were fresh knights, who had all just finished their last years as arming squires. Fortis, as an exceptional warrior and athlete, had advanced rapidly towards being a knight. He already had two years of combat experience underneath him. He had a squad of twenty Mountain teenagers in front of him. They were all between sixteen and eighteen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're protecting our homeland here!\" Fortis said. \"We're protecting our wives, our mothers, our sisters, our daughters, our old folks what can't do shit! We're protecting our allies who supply us with crucial fighting equipment, food and other essentials! We are their protection and their security and their hope! So if you fuck it up, you're screwing over a lot more than you think!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA tall, young man in his late twenties walked up to King Leviathan. The tall, powerful monarch stood on a gallery, staring down at the courtyards of the palace below. He bowed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My lord...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, Achilles...\" said Leviathan. \"...What's the latest reports?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Vladian progress is moderate. They are encumbered by the terrain and by certain...um...elements of the civilian populace\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeviathan chuckled. \"You mean our dear friends the Valleyans...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They are proving to be quite the thorn in their sides, my lord\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeviathan laughed. \"I bet they are! Look there, Achilles. Our latest squadrons of knights...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom the High Gallery that ran around the top of the palace, the king walked around, pointing to the various open yards where knights gave pep-talks to the junior warriors under their command. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you think they will be effective?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We need everything we have to back up our seasoned warriors and knights\", Leviathan said. \"They MUST be effective\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Papa!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeviathan stopped. A tall boy with blond hair and blue eyes jogged up to him. He was wearing armour and carrying a large sword. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe king frowned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But papa...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are NOT OLD ENOUGH, Cassius!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are too SMALL!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you have yet to finish all your training!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Being a prince does not automatically give you ANY rights to fight on the front lines!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"ENOUGH!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassius swore! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How'm I ever gonna get a girl, pops!?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A girl??\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yknow...they got the long hair and the boobs and...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I KNOW WHAT A GIRL IS! WHAT ABOUT IT!?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pops a girl isn't gonna LOOK at me if I haven't got a few kills!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"KILLS!?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a big turn-on! They like knowing they're dating a proper warrior!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Son you are the Crown Prince! That should be status enough!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah but...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"STATUS ENOUGH! Away with you!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassius groaned. He stared into the yard. He recognised Lord Fortis, the oldest brother of his distant love, the delicate and youthful Lady Minerva. He watched him at work... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't forget, folks, that the Fatlantean people rely on us and pay us for their protection in food, cloth and other important materials, essential for own survival. It is vital that we remember that!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassius didn't hear anything, but apparently, Fortis did. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WOULD YOU LIKE TO SHARE THAT SENTIMENT WITH THE REST OF US, SQUIRE ATLAS!?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe squire gave an inaudible reply. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"SAY WHAT!?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sir, no sir!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"BULLSHIT! COUGH IT UP BOY BEFORE I MAKE YOU!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe squire remained silent. Another squire piped up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sir, permission to speak, sir\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it, Squire?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Atlas was saying sir, that the Fatlanteans didn't deserve the protection of the Mountanian forces, sir. They're a lazy and greedy people who think only of themselves, sir!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you!\" said Fortis, \"Do you believe that, Squire?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sir! No sir!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Squire Atlas! Let me remind you that the Fatlanteans are our vital and important trading partners to our south! We provide them with things they want, in return for them providing us with things we need! For your ignorance I expect a thousand push-ups!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A thousand!?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WITH your armour ON!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NOW! YOU WORMY LITTLE MAGGOT!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassius watched as the squire dropped to his hands and feet, steadily doing press-ups, counting off each one as Fortis continued to address the group in front of him. Cassius sighed. He wished HE had that kind of power. One day he might...but...He could dream... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, Fortis was bigger, stronger, taller, heavier, more powerful and older than he was... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Fortis watched Atlas doing his punishment, he started leading his men through swordplay drills. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Up! Down! Side! What's your other hand doing!? Jacking off!? Bullshit! Where's your shields!? And your daggers! Good! Oh come on! Grandma can do better than that! No! No! No! DOWN! FORWARDS! None of this poking crap! You're trying to rip chainmail, boy! Not checking if the roast is done for DINNER! PROPERLY! DOWN! IN! OUT! Good! In! Out! Twist it if you have to! None of this wriggling around crap! And don't be slicing off some other guy's arm! Make sure you know where your swordpoint is all the time! Good!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Young Lord Fortis seems to be putting them through their paces...\" Achilles noted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Indeed\", said Leviathan. \"They'll have another week of this, and then furlough before battle...I must speak to him about that. Don't make me forget now, will you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No sir\", said Achilles, scribbling down the appointment in a notebook in front of him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good...good...I'm hungry...\" </span></div></div>",

Lord of the Manor at Flinton...Yes I did call you here for a chat...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKing Leviathan was busy standing behind a large table. On it was a huge map of his kingdom. He had all kinds of figures and flags on it, which he was poking around with a long shaft. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your men have been training for several days now. Do you believe you've covered everything that they'll need to know before they head into battle?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis frowned. He stared up at his monarch. Leviathan was not named such, for nothing. A powerfully built Mountanian with royal blood and royal strength to match. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Their own masters will have taught them much\", Fortis said. \"I've covered everything else that they should need to know for battle. I know you want to send as many units in against the Vladians as possible\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do\", said Leviathan. \"At the moment, our magical nomad friends, the Valleyans, are wreaking havoc with the Vladians...here...and...here...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe king pointed to a number of narrow valleys and gorges on the map. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...But their strength, even with their abilities, is limited. They can slow them down, but only inflict a marginal amount of injury upon the enemy. The Valleyans are a people of craft, skill, artistry and magic. They are not warriors like us. Once the battles reach beyond these gorges...they reach the Mountanian lowlands...The chiefs of the Valleyan peoples tell me that they cannot guarantee their effectiveness against the enemy once they reach open land...There, they will fall back, and trust in the might of our armies and cavalries to drive the Vladians back. That's where you and your men come in\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happens next?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Our most experienced and seasoned knights and foot-soldiers, cavalrymen, et-cetera, are all stationed along here...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe king pointed to various hills, plateaus and shelves in the landscape. \"They will be able to engage the Vladians as they come south and do battle with them, significantly slowing their progress. The enemy's objectives, as far as we can see, is to reach the East and Western Ranges...here...and...here\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why should they do that? There's nothing there!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wrong! That's where our MINES are!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Oh!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have seen you at your work, my lord. You are effective and clear in your instruction and in your execution thereof. I grant your unit a week's respite. After which you will report back here for your first deployment into the field\".. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes sir\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If it's no inconvenience, I suggest you lead your men far from here. Take them to your home county and settle them there for a week. They will need rest before their ordeal\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes sir\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well. A week, mind. No more. You will be back here...it is now...Saturday morning...By Sunday evening at the latest, you must be here\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes sir!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well, you're dismissed\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two Mountain lords exchanged sharp salutes and Fortis left the room. Fortis returned to his own billet and sat down at his desk. By the light streaming in from the windows, he pulled forth a sheet of paper and a bottle of ink and a pen. He began to write... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><i>Sister, <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI have been granted leave by His Majesty the King, to return home to our estate. My men and I will be there for a week.

See you very soon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour brother,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis</i></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis folded the letter and wriggled his signet-ring off of his pinky-finger. He dripped red wax onto the central fold of the letter and then stamped his seal into the wax. It was the coat of arms of their family. Fortis turned the letter over and wrote on the front:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b><i>For: Lady Minerva Vanderstorm</i></b></div> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe headed off find a rider to send his letter off, before heading back inside to deliver the news to his men and prepare for the ride back to his family estate... </span></div></div>",

A single lamp burned above the front doors. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Around the side, men\", Fortis said, pointing to a driveway down the side of the house, towards the mews at the back. \"Stable your horses and then get inside\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe men rode around the side of the house. Fortis dismounted and led his horse, Vortex, to its stall, and closed it after it. He stroked the horse with affection and then headed inside. None of the squires and knights noticed a face at the window above the front door. It vanished... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe men entered. Candles were lit all around, giving the house a warm, yellow, welcoming feel. Standing at the top of the stairs was a young woman wearing a flowing white night-dress. Some of the squires grinned up at her. The girl stared at these strangers...and then her eyes fixed on the tallest and oldest of them. She slipped down the stairs, stepping nimbly from step to step until she reached the bottom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis reached out and grabbed his sister by the shoulder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everyone, this is my sister...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomeone let out a wolf-whistle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHO WAS THAT!?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone froze. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll not be making a SINGLE move on her without my PERSONAL permission...\" said Fortis. \"...Girl, these are my squires\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinerva curtsied and bowed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's nice you're home, brother...\" Minerva said. She headed upstairs and stopped halfway to give her brother a kiss on the cheek before skimping back upstairs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright!\" said Fortis. He turned around and stared at the men behind him. \"You...you...you...you and...you...stay here. The rest of you, this way...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis led the other fifteen brawny teenagers down the corridor to one of the unused reception-rooms. Here, simple straw-filled mattresses, old pillows and blankets had been laid out for them to sleep on. There was a fireplace, wood, and a bathroom nearby. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Make yourselves comfortable, boys\", said Fortis. He closed the doors and returned to the five boys standing in the foyer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You guys, upstairs\", Fortis said. He led them up to the landing. \"There's four spare beds here. Three singles and one double. In here...here...here...and over there at the end of the hall. I'll let you decide where you want to sleep. You boys have done well in your training. I think you should get a bit of a treat. But while you're here, you'll go into these rooms and ONLY these rooms. You will not disturb the ladies of the house. You stay here as my guests at my invitation and my pleasure. Do you understand?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey nodded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, to bed, then\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis opened his own bedroom doors and headed inside. He found a fire burning and candles lit. He took off his travelling clothes and stripped down. Fortis had a tendency to sweat a bit during the night, so he rarely went to bed wearing clothes...especially in the warmer months, although he might make exceptions during wintertime. Not bothering to open the curtains on his bed, he slipped inside and crawled under the sheets. He lay there, groaning... Then, he realised he wasn't in bed alone! Someone was snuggling up to him, close to him...hugging him...He reached out, wrapped his arm around the stranger and pulled...judging by the body-shape...her...closer to him...He rolled over... </span></div></div>",

Go ahead and stroke me, sweetheart,\" he instructed her, knowing she was still pretty inexperienced when it came to sex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia bit her lip and gently slid her hand up the silky length of Fortis's cock.  When she came to the tip, it bobbed towards her unexpectedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia pulled her hand away with a gasp, and Fortis chuckled.  \"Don't worry, darling.  He does that sometimes.  He's just excited.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis pulled her closer to his body so that his front was pressed against hers.  \"Are you excited, girl?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia shivered at feeling his hot, solid body pressed so closely to her own.  His chest hair rubbed against her breasts, and the friction made her nipples pebble.  She moaned as the sensations on her chest sent heat pooling in her belly and her groin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis grinned smugly at her.  \"Like that, do ya?  I bet you'll like <i>this</i> even better.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis flipped her onto her back before shimmying down her body, making her moan at having more delicious friction on her sensitive breasts.  When Fortis's head was in line with her breasts, he suddenly sucked a peaked nipple into his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia yelled and arched her back off the bed.  Waves of intense pleasure seemed to run in a direct line from her nipple down to her rapidly moistening womanhood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sh, now, girl,\" Fortis whispered as he let go of her nipple with a wet *pop*.  \"We don't want to wake the boys.  They need their rest after a long, gruelling week of training.  And we don't want to worry my sister, now, do we?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia whimpered at the sudden leave of Fortis's wonderful mouth from her body, but she shook her head back and forth to answer his question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you going to keep quiet for me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia eagerly nodded her head, hoping she could keep her word.  She clearly remembered how exuberant her cries of release were two weeks ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe I should get the gag out just in case.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!  No, I'll...be quiet.  I promise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we'll see.  Now, how ready are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis ran his large hand over Eldonia's breast, briefly grazing her nipple, making her moan once more, before drifting down her shapely side, down her soft, flat stomach, and to the patch of curls between her thighs.  Her rubbed his fingers over the petals of her sex, and Eldonia had to bite her lip to keep her moans from being too loud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis grinned lustily.  \"Yeah, you're ready alright--sopping wet with your cream.\"  He gently rubbed his fingers over her clit, which made her start thrashing back and forth on the bed.  \"If you think that feels good, wait til I'm inside you.\"  Fortis began to pant harshly.  Knowing the girl beneath him was eager and ready for his loving made his cock ache and throb. He HAD to be inside her...and soon!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis climbed back up her body, positioned his cock at her entrance, and drove home in one hard thrust.  He gritted his teeth and groaned at feeling her tight, hot pussy grip his cock like a glove.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia clapped her hands over her mouth to keep from screaming out.  Fortis was just as large and thick and long and borderline brutal as he was last time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis panted as sweat began to roll down his temples.  He set a rapid pace of thrusting in and out of her sheath, anxious to reach that oblivion he knew would be coming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia was able to get over the stretch and pain of Fortis's invasion more easily this time, and she was soon moving and rolling her hips in time to his thrusts.  She curled her arms around his biceps, digging her fingernails into his skin, as his manhood stroked and set fire to a million different nerve endings in her channel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's it,\" Fortis grunted between the increasingly erratic pumps of his hips and strong, clenching buttocks.  \"Move with me, Elly...show me that you want it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia moaned and moved her hands to his bulky shoulders, scratching her nails roughly and digging furrows into his skin.  This just made Fortis hiss and pump all the faster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore she knew it, the world exploded in a flash of light, and Fortis pressed his mouth over hers in a savage kiss to swallow her loud cries of release.  He licked and sucked the sweet flavor of her mouth as shivers and shudders racked her body.  He continued thrusting through her release, but her even tighter sheath rippling and caressing his tool had him coming right after her.  He groaned and moaned as he pumped his seed deep into her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen his body was finally spent, Fortis slowly withdrew himself from Eldonia's sensitive body, making her moan at the loss of his marvelous cock from her sheath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis flopped down at Eldonia's side, knowing that he would be too heavy to lie on top of her.  He yawned hugely and stretched his arms over his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia wrinkled her nose as the ripe smell of Fortis's unwashed body assaulted her nose.  He could certainly use a good bath.  She fortunately hadn't noticed the scent before, as she had been too excited at the prospect of having relations once more with the burly, hunky earl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Art thou tired, now, my lord?\" she purred, holding her breath and crawling up Fortis's side.  Fortis let his arm come around Eldonia's soft, lithe form, snuggling it close to his own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm,\" he murmured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wouldn't you like a bath before you go to sleep?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm...too tired....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Even if I attended you, my lord?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis opened one eye to look at Eldonia's innocent face.</span></div></div>",

Fortis chuckled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah, tomorrow\", Fortis said with a tone of finality. \"I am absolutely boned out. I gotta rest or else I'm gonna regret it tomorrow...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe well-built Mountain lord stretched out. Eldonia could hear his joints and bones crackling as he worked the kinks out of his body. She laid herself down alongside him. That warm, musky scent was kind of alluring...Perhaps she could put up with it...for tonight, at least... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning, Eldonia awoke. Sunlight was battering at the curtains, and she laid in bed, her lover's weight and arms wrapped around her. She fought her way out of his embrace and went to release the rays of light into the bedroom. She pulled back the curtains around the bed and then pulled back the window-curtains. Sunlight burst in on Fortis's long, well-sculpted body, tanned from years of outdoor work, with his blond hair a mess from last night's...events...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia tiptoed downstairs to find the servants boiling water. Apparently, they'd anticipated that the lord of the manor would be wanting a bath. Chambermaids carried the covered buckets of boiling water up the stairs to Fortis's bathroom, filling up the enormous, king-sized bathtub, large enough to fit a person of Fortis's height and girth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia smiled. All the hot, soapy, steamy water was exciting her. She lit the candles around the bathroom and shaved some soap into the water. She tossed in some salts and a few perfumes and oils and then slipped in, kicking her nightdress under the towel-rack. Then she heard the creaking in the next room. The Master had awoken... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia took a deep breath and slowly sank beneath the frothy water. She could heard Fortis's heavy, lumbering footfalls as he entered the bathroom, and the thud of the door being kicked shut. She waited...and waited...then, she slowly raised herself out of the water. She stared longingly at her bedfellow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis stood in front of a full-length mirror in his bathroom. He was completely naked...much to the horror of the chambermaids...and he was busy lathering up for a shave. He hadn't had a decent one in nearly a week. Eldonia watched as he picked up an enormous razor with a blade two inches wide and nearly six inches long. As he shaved, Eldonia leaned against the side of the bathtub, watching his body and muscles ripple and move as his arm and back shifted around...He finished, toweled off and started to turn around. Eldonia slipped beneath the water. It was by now, very soapy and frothy and it was almost impossible to see under the surface. Fortis climbed in and let himself fall into the water. It was soooo good...He felt ready to fall asleep! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was until he felt something grasping his...equipment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, Eldonia broke the surface of the water, her sleek body shiny from the soap and moisture. She stroked and rubbed his hard, firm body, sitting in his lap. He smiled and she grinned. She wrapped her arms around him and he drew her close. He gave her a kiss and Eldonia felt herself go limp and melty...his arms were exploring her body...touching her in special areas...to which she gave her unspoken consent...She could fall asleep here very easily, wrapped in his arms...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He was so wonderful...so wonderful...so...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fortis!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two lovers sprang apart faster than opposing magnets! Fortis grabbed Eldonia by the hair and pushed her under the water just as the bathroom door swung open! Lady Athena didn't know about their late-night liasons. And he wanted to keep it that way! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh-y-yeah gramma?\" he asked. Lady Athena smiled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My big, brave handsome boy!\" she said. She bent down and gave him a kiss. \"Oh! You shaved!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course I shaved...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good boy! Breakfast is ready downstairs!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay grandma, I'll be out in a bit\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door closed and slowly, Eldonia emerged from the water. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was close!\" she said, gasping. Fortis chuckled. \"Forbidden love is always the best...\" he said. \"Now come on, we gotta get ready for breakfast\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two climbed out of the bathtub. Fortis toweled himself down and...Eldonia watched him do it...it was mesmerising to see his arms and legs and the muscles twitch and flex in such alluring ways...the sign of a man in the prime of life...She toweled herself down as well, making sure that her eyes were not for one second, obscured by fabric, so that she could watch her boyfriend moving around...The big, strong Mountain lord... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey got dressed and headed downstairs. Fortis sat down at the table as one of the housemaids brought out the food. The family dined in their own private dining-room. Fortis's twenty men dined in another room in the castle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Morning, Susanna...\" Fortis grumbled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe kitchen-maid curtsied. \"My lord\", she said. She laid a butter dish on the table and took off the lid. Fortis grunted his thanks and she skimped back to the kitchens. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How long are you staying with us, Fortis?\" Lady Athena asked, reaching for eggs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not so long, grandma. I'm leaving on the weekend. But I guess while I'm here, I can do stuff for you, if you like...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just firewood...\" said Lady Athena. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis nodded. \"Sure gramma\", he said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, I could help!\" said Eldonia. \"I could um...carry in the split wood!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gentlewomen do NOT concern themselves with the labours of men, my dear!\" said Lady Athena. \"You are a LADY and you will conduct yourself accordingly! That means not interrupting them when they are at work!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh it's no trouble...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My girl...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think what Eldonia's saying, granny\", said Minerva, \"Is that she wants to be there to make sure Fortis doesn't get hurt...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah!\" said Eldonia quickly, jumping on her friend's excuse. \"Minerva's right! Absolutely! It could be dangerous for him to do it all alone with nobody around. What if the axe broke in half and injured him!?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sure that wouldn't happen, darling!\" said Lady Athena. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"With those arms of his, I don't know...\" Eldonia said. Fortis let out a grunt and flexed his powerful biceps when his grandmother was occupied with her toast. Eldonia and Minerva giggled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll join her, granny!\" said Minerva, \"We could eat luncheon outside in the garden!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh that's a wonderful idea!\" said Lady Athena, \"I could join you!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia gave her friend quick 'No! NO!\" motions, waving her hands back and forth and shaking her head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh!...g-granny, Eldonia and I wanted to be alone in the garden. We'll be talking about...well...boys and clothes and...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And the war\", Fortis interrupted. \"You don't wanna hear about all that, gran'ma\", he added. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"R-right!\" said Eldonia, \"You shouldn't hear about that, Lady Athena!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, I can tell when you want some privacy...\" the old woman said. \"I'll cloister myself upstairs in the library for the day, then. Run along, children!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chil-\" Fortis began. He was NOT a child! He was a MAN! He was LORD of the estate! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinerva kicked her brother under the table to silence him, in case his outburst caused their grandmother to change her mind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll go get the axe and the sledgehammer and spikes...\" Fortis mumbled, getting up from the table. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She whistled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oysters, sandwiches, bread rolls, butter, sausages, cold cuts, smoked meats, fish, cookies, two cakes, bottles of mineral water and homemade lemonade, Lucian chocolates...How many people are coming!?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just us two!

She grabbed the basket and hefted it up the few short steps to the dining-room. She seemed to be making a big effort out of it. Not that she didn't find it really heavy, but because...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bottles and plates jangled as Eldonia let the hamper fall onto the rug around the dining-table with a soft 'clunk!'. Just then, Fortis entered, wearing only boots and shorts. Splitting logs was going to be sweaty work. The giant Mountain lord lumbered over. He watched as Eldonia put on a rather convincing show of not being able to lift up a picnic-hamper! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My lord!\" Eldonia gasped, \"Oh you couldn't help us, could you? We need to carry this around the side of the house, only it's SO heavy and FULL! And you're so STRONG and POWERFUL and TALL!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiled up at him. Minerva watched from the kitchen door as Eldonia buttered up her older brother. She was practically wrapping herself around him like a snake! If Fortis tried to take a single step, he'd fall over the dining-table! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis chuckled and played along. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, such a cute, baby-girl like you shouldn't be carrying such a big, heavy hamper! You leave that stuff to the boys!\" he said. \"Huh...?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe bent down and lifted the hamper. Eldonia watched the display as his arms bulged as he hefted the basket into them and carried it outside. Minerva watched as her best friend practically skipped outside with him! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Minerva!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinerva turned around. Her grandmother strode up to her. \"Where's your friend Ellie?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's outside, granny, with Fortis!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! It is nice to see her getting on well with Fortis...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, she's getting *on* him, alright...you have nooo idea...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing gramma!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinerva flitted out of the dining-room and into the gardens. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two girls sat in the gardens on a rug on a smooth patch of grass. Nearby, Fortis was busy splitting logs. Eldonia watched as the mountain lord's arms and back rippled and flexed as he swung a huge sledgehammer through the air, smashing heavy iron spikes into a tree-trunk. The wood cracked and split open under the vicious assault. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is he a monster or WHAT!?\" Eldonia said, as Fortis slammed the sledgehammer down, clefting a section of trunk in one blow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How DARE you talk about my brother like that!\" Minerva fumed, \"I'll have you know that Fortis is a LOVING and CARING and COMPASSIONATE man! He might show it in a sort of rough and tumble way...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Minnie you have NO idea...Hehehehehe...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eldonia!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's such a catch!

She was feeling rather hot and bothered...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...because in the garden below, was the lord of the manor splitting firewood without a shirt on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, Fortis could have gotten one of the servants to do it, such as one of the stableboys, but he insisted on keeping in shape. Which was fine by Eldonia. She got to enjoy the show... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis rolled the last massive tree-trunk segment into place. He started hammering the wedges into the log and then picked up the huge sledgehammer to drive them through. He raised the hefty, 1,000-pound lump of iron over his head and was about to bring it down when the sound of galloping distracted him! He turned around to see a rider bearing royal colours charging towards him! The man dismounted and jogged up to the young nobleman, waving a sealed envelope in his hands. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My lord Fortis!\" the man gasped. \"Important news from the king's palace!\" he said. \"You are wanted at once, my lord! Your orders are contained within!\" he added, waving the sealed envelope in Fortis's face. Fortis tossed the 1,500-pound sledgehammer aside like a teaspoon and broke the seal on the envelope and quickly flashed over the contents. He reached into the pocket of his shorts and handed the man a gold sovereign. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, my lord!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go on! Scat!\" Fortis grunted. \"Tell the king I'll be coming as soon as I can\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes sir!...Yah!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rider kicked his horse and it took off at a sharp gallop out of the gates. Fortis read over the orders again in greater detail and then jogged inside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doors into the second dining-room burst open and Fortis stood there, panting. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright men!\" he shouted, to the gaggle of teenagers who were busy playing cards and chess. \"Pack up your stuff! We're moving out!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're here a week!\" said one of the squires. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're needed at the Front as soon as possible!\" Fortis said. \"It can't wait until tomorrow, we're leaving today! Pack everything! We're going in an hour!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis rushed out of the room and sprang up the stairs, almost running over his own squire! Young Lord Koviac jumped as his master came barreling towards him! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pack your shit! Get downstairs and then tell the stable-boys to saddle up the horses!\" Fortis shouted, crashing off towards his room. \"We're leaving! Now!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, everything was ready. Wagons were loaded, horses saddled, chests, cases and bags were packed and everyone was ready for the off. Fortis burst out of his bedroom, ready for travel. He nearly bowled over his sister and Eldonia who were standing in the hallway with his grandmother! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Darling, you'll be careful, won't you!?\" said Lady Athena. She hugged her oldest and biggest grandson. Fortis hugged her back. \"Sure grandma\", he said. \"I'll be safe, don't worry...I love you...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Forty I'm'ma miss you...\" Minerva said, hugging her brother. He hugged her back and hoisted her into his huge arms, and gave her a kiss. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh, miss you too, girl\", he said, as always, addressing his sister not by her name, but her gender. \"Hey, I'll write you whenever I get, okay?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinerva nodded. She pulled something off her body and draped it around her brother's broad, hard chest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Take this for luck\", she said. Fortis stared at the chain and the delicate, ladylike pendant at the end. He fumbled with it in his big hands, and popped the locket open at the bottom. Inside were little portraits of himself and his sister. He smiled and snapped the exquisite gold locket shut. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure sweetcakes\", he said. He dropped her to the floor with a 'bump!'. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia hugged her lover and kissed him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You be safe, my handsome lord...\" she said. \"And don't forget to write to us all!\" she added as Fortis broke away and then headed downstairs. He stopped at the bottom and waved. Lined up in the foyer were all the house-servants. Fortis hugged and kissed each of the maids as he headed towards the doors. At the threshold, he turned back and waved to the servants, and then to his family standing at the head of the stairs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll be back\", he said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe turned and his squire, Koviac, opened the doors. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The men are waiting, my lord...\" he whispered, \"We must leave now!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis nodded. He mounted his horse and watched as the servants closed the front doors. He stared up at the ancient and grand house before him, and sighed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yah!\" he barked, \"Come on, Vortex! Move it!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe kicked his horse's sides and started off out of the estate. His men followed on horseback, or by wagons bringing up the rear. From the windows on the first floor, the members of the Vanderstorm household watched as the posse of men disappeared out the gates and down the road... </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Fortis!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis clopped through a maze of tents, wooden huts and fires. He tugged on the reins and Vortex clopped to a halt, snorting loudly and urinating powerfully. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA tall, young man with brown hair walked up. He had broad shoulders and a heavy tan. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damascus!\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young knight leaned against a massive shield. \"You FINALLY got here...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh shut up! I had boys to train...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So did I, but I got here a week ago...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So the king thought I did a better job. He let me have a week off. Maybe you would've too, if you put more effort into it...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDamascus snorted! \"Huh! Yeah...whatever...Come on, I'll show you around the camp\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis dismounted from his horse and led him by the reins. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright...\" said Damascus. \"Over here's the stables...you wanna put Violet there...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Vortex\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two knights headed over to the stables and Fortis let his horse relax. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Over here's the officers' tents...this here's the mess-area...fires...over here's where we are...knights and such...over there is the regular men...and over there are the latrines\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis surveyed the rows of tents, simple wooden huts, fires, worn-down paths and a small valley which served as the latrines. He hoped he wouldn't have to go there anytime soon... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mon!\" said .Damascus. \"You're hungry. You been riding all day. I'll show you where chow is...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two young knights headed towards a huge series of fires where meat roasted on the flames. Here and there, shorter, fatter men dressed in white moved around, with large knives and forks for carving off the roasts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fatlantean cooks. Best in the world. And of course, the King insisted that we're all well-fed. Who better to pick?\" Damascus asked. Fortis laughed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My lord!\" said a fat, blond-haired man with a neat moustache and a goatee beard, \"What'll it be?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Beef, bread, butter, some of that salad, the potatoes, sausages...\" Damascus said. \"And the same for my buddy here\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And to drink, gentlemen?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Four pints of your best Mountanian lager\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very good!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fat chef waved his knife through the air, and gestured to several yards away. Crude wooden benches were set around a number of stone rings, where fires burned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis stared around. He now noticed that there were other fat men, and teenagers and boys, milling around the camp. He stared at Damascus for an explanation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's with all the fatties all over the place?\" he snorted. \"I thought this was OUR war!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well it is!\" said Damascus. \"The Fatlanteans are part of the Mountanian Military Catering Corps. They provide us with all our food and service! Here, sit down!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two Mountain warriors sat down on a long bench in front of a fire. A chubby boy with dark blond hair waddled up, carrying two large plates of food. Another boy approached carrying huge flagons of beer. The boys handed over the food and bowed before backing away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis took a long, hard pull of his beer, and groaned. He needed that like he needed a hot bath and a clean shirt. He hadn't had either in a week! Combined with the riding and camping, he was beginning to feel rather manky... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs more and more knights gathered around the fires to eat, drink and make merry, food vanished and beer evaporated at an alarming pace! After several hours, things began to quiet down. They would need to sleep and rest-up for the day ahead. As they sat around the fire, chatting, Fortis leaned forwards, resting on his powerful thighs. Something fell out of his shirt and dangled around his neck, catching in the firelight and sparkling... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey what's that?\" one of the knights asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis glanced down. He picked up the dangling gold locket that his sister had given to him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A...keepsake...from...someone...\" Fortis said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh...cute...Yeah...\" said the other knight. It slowly transpired that every knight with a woman or a girl in his life had also brought something along: A ring, a bracelet, a necklace, a box, a knife. One even managed to show up with a pillow! The objects were passed around the fire and examined, and then returned. One of the knights popped open the locket that Fortis had handed into the circle of \"show-and-tell\", and smirked at the pictures inside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh...yeah...cute...\" he said. \"She's sweet, who's that?\" he asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis was busy talking to Damascus and didn't hear. \"Huh?\" he asked, turning away and looking up, \"Wha?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This!\" the other knight said, waving the locket around, \"The girl's cute! She available? Huh? She looks like she wants it...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...Excalibur...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Such purdy eyes and a cute widdul mouth...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...stop it...\" Damascus whispered. Fortis fixed Excalibur with an icy stare. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So like, she takes it good, huh!?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore anyone could stop him, Fortis was on top of Excalibur in a flash! The two fully-grown Mountain warriors were brawling on the ground! Fortis held Excalibur firmly on the ground, punching him, over, and over, and over again! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fortis quit it!\" Damascus shouted! He tried to pull Fortis away but only succeeded in being thrown back! He finally caught Fortis's right fist and getting him into a powerful arm-lock! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enough!\" Damascus shouted, \"You can do all that tomorrow, Forty! Stop it! He's just a stupid, drunk schlubb who ain't worth it!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDamascus picked up the locket from the ground and helped Fortis to his feet. Excalibur lay on the ground with a fat lip and a bloody nose! Many of the assembled knights stared at him in disgust. Not even able to stand up for himself! What a loser... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What would Minerva think of you!?\" Damascus said, wiping blood off of Fortis's knuckles and wrist. \"Her big, protective older brother, Fortis, beating up some other guy just because he got too drunk and stupid to guard his own mouth...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis looked about ready to rip Damascus's head off, but Damascus was too smart for his friend. He grabbed his arms. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright big fellah\", he said, \"Just relax. Here's the locket. Now you better get to bed. We got a big day of kicking ass tomorrow...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis just snorted. \"Yes, granny\", he sneered. Damascus sighed. \"Come on man,\" he said. \"You can let it all out tomorrow...\" </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Fortis tossed and turned on his pallet.  While he was used to sleeping on the hard ground with minimal padding underneath him, he wasn't used to sharing his sleeping quarters with other men--men who snored loudly!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter getting Minerva's locket back from Excalibur, Damascus had led Fortis to a decent-sized tent near the front of the grouping of knights' tents. All the beer he had drunk had unfortunately gone through him, and Fortis scowled his way down to the latrine, breathing through his teeth as he relieved himself. When he had gotten back to his tent, he stripped himself down to his skin. Fortis then realized that Damascus himself was getting ready for bed. Soon, four other men stumbled into the tent, laughing and cackling drunkenly. Fortis scowled at their loud behavior. However, Fortis soon laid down on his pallet, dragged a light blanket over his hot, heavy body, and closed his eyes, trying to block out the sounds around him and the light from the still burning fires casting shadows on the tent walls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe grasped the locket lying on his sternum, and his thoughts turned to his sister. He grimaced as he remembered the leering comments Excalibur had made about his young, innocent sister. No one treated his precious Minnie like a piece of meat! Thank goodness Grandma Athena and Eldonia were staying with his sister. He hated having Minnie out of his sight. He didn't trust any young man any further than he could throw them! He snorted and rolled over when he thought of the Crown Prince. He didn't entirely trust the young man, either, but at least he was going about courting Minerva the right way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis growled as his eyes slowly drooped. Prince Cassius had better KEEP courting her the right way....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Fortis was weary. His entire body ached. His armor had fresh new dents littering its formerly shiny surface. He had numerous vicious chips in his swords and daggers. He'd have to hit the smithy hard to make sure he was prepared for the next time the Crown called him up into service again. Vortex snorted and whinnied as they clopped up the road that led to his home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe war had gone on for several years. Fortis hadn't had a chance for a furlough since those few precious days after training his recruits. He had religiously sent letters home to Minerva, but he had scant few from her in return. He hoped that she was alright. She had been constantly on his mind during the long weary encampments and battles that littered and scarred his memory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMountania was victorious, but the Vladians had been just as stubborn and clever as his own people had been, making the small border skirmish erupt into a full-out war. Fortis breathed in the fresh air. Three years he had been at war. Minerva would be nearly seventeen now. He left her a girl, and now she would be a woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Fortis neared his family home, he urged Vortex into a quicker pace. He was anxious to finally be done with his travelling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe leaped off his horse and gave the reins to a waiting servant boy, who bowed and looked overjoyed to see the young earl once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis barrelled through the front door and yelled at the top of his lungs, \"MINNIE! GRANDMA! I'M HO-OME!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Forty?!\" came a delighted squeal from the library.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinerva hurried towards her brother, and Fortis caught her up in a crushing hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, girl! You have no idea how much I've missed you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Forty! I'm so glad you're safe and sound! I've heard stories....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I promised I'd come back to you! Besides, it takes a lot more than a Vladian blade to bring me down!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked up into his face, and she gasped before running a soft hand along the right side of his face. A long, jagged, pink scar ran the entire length of his face from his temple down to his stern chin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Forty!\" she sighed, tears gathering in her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hush, girl,\" he said gruffly. \"I'm alive. That's all you need to know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinerva sighed and snuggled back down into her brother's arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis frowned when he finally registered his sister's soft flesh beneath his hands. She felt curvier and softer and rounder than when he had left. She had definitely put on weight.  He let go of her gently and put her at arms' length to examine all her changes more closely. However, he immediately saw what his hands had felt, and his face flushed red in fury.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHO DID THIS TO YOU?!\" he yelled, pointing at her rounded belly. \"I KNEW I SHOULDN'T HAVE LEFT YOU WITHOUT A PROTECTOR! WHO DARED TO PUT THEIR HANDS ON YOU?! WHO TOOK YOU AGAINST YOUR WILL?! I'LL CUT HIS COCK OFF AND RAM IT DOWN HIS THROAT! I'LL KILL HIM! I'LL KILL HIM!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Forty! Fortis! Please, calm down!\" Minerva clung to her brother's muscular arm, her face pleading. \"No one took advantage of me! There are...things I haven't told you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis didn't listen. He shook his sister off and began stalking through the house. \"WHERE ARE YOU, YOU FILTHY, STINKING PILE OF HORSE MANURE?! WHEN I FIND YOU, YOU'LL WISH YOU'D NEVER LAID EYES ON MY SISTER!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What in the world is all this racket?\" came a young man's voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis saw red when he saw an older Crown Prince Cassius walk into the room, a wide-eyed toddler on his hip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YOU!\" Fortis roared. \"I SHOULD HAVE KNOWN TO NEVER TRUST YOU WITH MY SISTER!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis charged at Cassius, who leapt to the side just in time, Minerva screaming and crying the entire time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My lord, you don't understand!\" Cassius pleaded, quickly handing off the toddler to Minerva and facing Fortis squarely. \"I have never treated your sister with anything but the utmost respect and dignity!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"THEN WHY IS SHE PREGNANT? IS THAT BABY HERS, TOO? HOW DARE YOU!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis charged at Cassius once more, but Cassius growled and met the earl head on. The two fell to the floor, grappling each other, punching, kicking, swearing, and trying to beat the stuffing out of the other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Both of you: stop it!\" Minerva cried, tears streaming down her cheeks. The baby in her arms was crying and screaming, too, in response to the tense activity in the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fortis, if you would just listen: Cassius is my HUSBAND! He never touched me until our wedding night!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis paused, his arms around Cassius in a Nelson hold around the prince's neck. \"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinerva knelt down, a steadying hand on her pregnant belly. \"Cassius courted me properly after you left for war. When everything began escalating, and I heard next to no news from you, I was scared! Cassius promised to always take care of me, and he offered me his hand in marriage to protect me, since you couldn't. I...I'm sorry, Forty! I had no way of knowing if you were dead or alive! So, I...I married him. We've been married for two and a half years now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis swallowed hard. \"You married him only six months after I had left? I don't understand! I sent you a letter every week since I left! Didn't you get them?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinerva slowly shook her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis sighed and hung his head in shame. How could he have let down his sister so that she felt she had to get married in order to protect herself?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you let me go now, my lord?\" asked Cassius hoarsely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis released the prince's neck and closed his eyes. This was not at all what he expected to find when he got home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassius rubbed his abused neck, then crawled over to Minerva and their still sobbing baby. Cassius took the toddler into his arms and kissed the chubby cheeks. \"It's alright, Valerius. Daddy's fine. Are you alright, Min?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinerva nodded her head, and Cassius gave her a small kiss on the lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why didn't you tell me?\" Fortis asked wearily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I didn't know how,\" Minerva answered shyly. \"Besides, my last several letters to you were returned to me. No one knew where your company was. I...I thought you might be dead. When I learned you might still be alive, I was already married to Cassius and expecting Valerius.\" Her cheeks turned pink, and she smoothed a hand over her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassius grinned at her and placed his own hand on her belly. \"We're hoping this one will be a girl.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis looked at the two of them smiling happily at each other. His little sister had grown up on him. She was now a wife and mother. She had Cassius now. She didn't need him anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you two doing here? If you were married, I would think you'd be living in the palace.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, we do most of the year,\" answered Cassius, \"but we always come back here around this time of year on holiday.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinerva looked at her brother sadly. \"I always come back here on the anniversary of your departure...just in case you might come back home. This year...I was lucky. I'm so glad you're back, Forty.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me, too, girl. I...er, missed you a lot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I missed you, too, but not near as much as Eldonia.\" Minerva's sad countenance turned into a smile that became more of a smirk, making Fortis feel taken aback. He didn't recall ever seeing such a look on her face before. Minerva giggled. \"Wait till Eldonia hears that you've returned.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis sucked in a breath. His thoughts had dwelt on the lovely girl much in the past three years. He admitted she starred in most of his wanking fantasies. She'd be about nineteen now. He wondered what she looked like...if she had married...if she would welcome him back in her bed as she had once upon a time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is she...well?\" Fortis asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,....\"</i></span></div></div>",

Why? Is there something wrong with her?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinerva shared a look with Cassius. \"No, not wrong per se,\" said Minerva, \"but I have no doubt she'll be delighted to see you again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As well as her father,\" Cassius said under his breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing,\" said the prince with a shake of his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where is she? Isn't Eldonia here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinerva shook her head. \"She's been staying with her parents for the past couple of years, since not too long after your furlough.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis frowned. \"I don't understand. I thought she was going to stay with you. Why is she back with her parents?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinerva sighed. \"It's a long story, Forty--one that I'm not at liberty to tell you. Besides, did you honestly expect her to just stay here and keep me company when you've been gone for three years? She missed her family after a while, and she needed them, so she returned home. However, I can tell you that she's been worried as much as I have about you and would greatly appreciate a visit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis sighed and got to his feet. He felt inordinately tired, but it looked like resting after the war was going to have to wait.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis helped Minerva to her feet, then embraced her gently (well, for what Fortis thought was gently, particularly since she was in the family way). \"I'll go see Eldonia at her father's estate; then, I'll return back home here. Wait for me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinerva giggled and gave him a kiss on his unscarred cheek. \"Always.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis looked sternly at Cassius. \"I expect you to watch over her while I'm gone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassius raised an eyebrow. \"I wouldn't do any less than I have since you left, my lord.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis then left his family home. He had the stable boy saddle up another of his prized stallions, since Vortex needed a much-deserved rest, and kicked the horse into a fast gallop towards Castle VonGewalt, the seat of Eldonia's father's earldom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs events often go in dreams, Fortis hadn't travelled long--merely over two hills--before he reached the VonGewalts' home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Fortis rode up the dirt road, he saw a woman chasing two small children around the large grassy lawn. Well, the woman was chasing a little girl with long sandy blond pigtails, while a strapping little boy was chasing the woman. They were all laughing and smiling. Fortis pulled on the reins to halt his mount and sat to watch, smiling at the cute youngsters, who couldn't have been more than two or three years old. He chuckled when the little brown-haired boy gave a great war-cry right before catching his mother around her skirts. The boy and the woman both toppled to the ground, still laughing. The woman gathered the little boy to her and began tickling him. The little girl soon joined in, and the sound of trio's laughter rang throughout the courtyard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis couldn't help himself and began laughing loudly, too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman suddenly turned at the sound of his laughter, and the look on her face instantly changed from gaiety to shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis sucked in a quick breath. \"Eldonia?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fortis?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis dismounted, threw his reins around a conveniently placed tree limb, and slowly walked over to Eldonia. Eldonia quickly got to her feet and held the two little children close to her, one arm around each child.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis's breath quickened at the sight of her. She was even lovelier than he remembered. She was truly a woman now, with her face having lost all the chubbiness of youth. Her body had certainly rounded out nicely. Her cleavage was larger than he remembered. Her hips were more ample. Her waist had thickened a bit, too, but overall she was curvier and shapelier. Just the sight of her had his cock hardening and twitching in his pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was surprised at how much the sight of her affected him, for he hadn't stayed celibate in the least while he was at war. He'd had several tavern wenches over the last three years, as well as numerous women that the generals allowed into their camps in order to give the soldiers and knights conjugal visits. There were always plenty of Mountanian women that wanted to give a war hero a good time. War itself was an aphrodisiac for most Mountanians. Further, the generals knew that such visitations helped alleviate the stress of war and helped the men keep their focus on the battlefield.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Momma?\" asked the little boy. \"Who that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis then looked at the boy, who was pointing a finger at him. Momma? Eldonia was a mother?! Fortis thought the children were her younger siblings or cousins or something. How could they be her children?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis then took a better look at the little boy. His eyes widened. The boy had large, brown eyes...the exact color of his own!  It couldn't be!...Could it? Fortis was in shock! It was as if he were looking in the mirror at himself twenty years ago!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis looked at the little girl in a panic. She was sucking on her thumb, and her angelic face looked exactly like her mother's, except she too had the same large, brown eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis's eyes then flew to Eldonia's bright blue eyes. Eldonia was giving him a sly smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This, Atlas,\" Eldonia said to the boy, \"is your papa.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Daddy Forty?\" asked the little girl, popping her thumb out of her mouth long enough to ask the question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Daddy Forty.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You my papa?\" the little boy said, tilting his head to the side and looking Fortis up and down intently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Elly,\" Fortis croaked out. \"How...Why...When...? I....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia laughed at Fortis's speechlessness. \"Well, we weren't exactly taking any precautions, were we? These two were born nearly eight months after you left. This is Atlas and Artemis.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis just stood there, taking it all in. He had expected to be a father some day; after all, he had to have a son to pass down the earldom to. However, he hadn't expected to come back from war to realize he had gotten Eldonia pregnant before he had left! No wonder her figure was more mature--she had given birth to twins!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis slowly knelt down to the ground. He gave a small smile, first to the boy, then to the girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi, Atlas, Artemis,\" he said softly. \"I'm...I'm your papa.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe little girl walked slowly over to him and looked him closely in the eyes. Fortis gulped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You gots my eyes,\" she said softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis smiled. \"I do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, I got Papa's eyes, too!\" said Atlas, hurrying over to his sister's side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis chuckled. \"You both do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Momma say you gone a long time 'cuz you were keeping bad people from hurting us,\" said Artemis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis looked up at Eldonia, who just smiled and nodded her head. \"That's right, Artemis. I was fighting the Vladians.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You look strong,\" said Atlas in wonder, running a small hand over Fortis's armor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course I am! And someday, you'll be just as strong!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAtlas straightened up to his full height and threw out his little chest. \"I already strong! I help keep Momma and Artie safe!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis ruffled his boy's hair. \"I'm sure you did.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eldonia? Altas? Artemis? Where are you?\" came a deep voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh oh,\" Eldonia said softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There you are! What are you--?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis slowly stood. He saw a middle-aged man pause in coming down from the house. The man's demeanor instantly changed upon spying Fortis. The man snarled and drew the dagger from his waist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YOU!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis sighed. How ironic that Eldonia's father should come at him the same way he just went at Prince Cassius. Only Fortis deserved it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEarl VonGewalt was charging at Fortis, and Fortis barely made out the whites of the man's eyes before...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"GAAAAAAHHHHH!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis sat straight up off his pallet, his heart beating wildly in his chest. He wiped a hand over his sweaty forehead and took a deep breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man, whatchoo yellin' for?! Go back to sleep!\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah, what're ya wakin' us up for?\"<br>\r\n\"*Yaaaaaawwwn!* It's not even three AM yet!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis gritted his teeth, but replied, \"Sorry, guys. Had a nightmare.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe five other men in his tent snorted and cursed. \"Yeah, right. Whatever,\" one of them said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis laid back down. What in the world would have possessed his mind to imagine the scenarios he had just seen? Minerva marrying the Crown Prince for her own protection? Pregnant with her second child? All grown-up and not needing him anymore? And then there was Eldonia. Why would he have dreamed that she had bore him twins out of wedlock?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis ran a tired hand over his face. Yeah, they hadn't been as careful as they should have been, and he'd taken her more than once. But he doubted she'd get pregnant from the few times they'd had sex. No other girl he'd been with had gotten pregnant before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis yawned, then smiled as he turned over and closed his eyes. He had to admit those kids were cute. He had no intention of being a father just yet, but he could do a lot worse than a little boy who was his spitting image and a little girl who was as cute and lovely as Eldonia.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was a couple of weeks later that Fortis entered a large tent on the battlefield. Inside, King Leviathan sat at a large, folding table. He had a large map in front of him and around him, his generals were chatting. Fortis cleared his throat loudly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Oh! That will be all, gentlemen\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe generals saluted and left the tent. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You called, my liege?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I certainly did\", said the king. He walked up to Fortis and looked him up and down. \"My lord. Your service and conduct in this conflict have been exemplary. You don't waste time doing things that don't need to be done. You are a fast and efficient warrior, deserving to retain whatever past acolades and rewards that my ancestors have bestowed on your name and your house\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis bowed. \"My liege\", he said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have trained your men well. They fear not, and are strong of heart, determined of mind and capable of limb. Although I understand that you have lost two of your men\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes sir\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Regrettable. There is nothing you can do about that. Their loss could be seen as detrimental to your methods of training...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"SIR!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, ah, ah...\" said King Leviathan, raising a hand. \"I do not accuse. You would not have reached your current rank if your training methods on your men were not effective, which indeed they are. It's whether or not they choose to listen to them, and apply them, that matters\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They were in a situation outside of their control\", Fortis said. \"They're recovering in the infirmary-huts\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Indeed, but they will be some time. A broken leg and a broken arm do not fast heal, my lord\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No sir\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You will require replacement men if your squad is to be fully effective\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, sir\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good! I have two replacements for you. Depending on their skills, you may determine if they'll be temporaries, or if they'll be permanent additions to your men\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes sir\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe king turned to an aide. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Show them in\", he said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom behind the king, two young men entered. Fortis stared at them, and they stared at him! Fortis cleared his throat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you SURE this is wise?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why not?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought it was against military policy to group family-members together\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In special circumstances, yes. But not here. Your brothers are inexperienced...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HEY!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"SILENCE CANNIUS!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yessir!\" said Cannius at once, cowering under his brother's glare. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...and I decided that they would learn faster and be more effective if they are with family\", the king finished. \"They are now in your charge\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis nodded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're all dismissed\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three brothers left the tent. The moment they were outside, Fortis rounded on them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You little snot-nosed pricks better be doin' what I'm tellin' you. I'm not gonna be tellin' gramma that you two cockwads got yourself killed because of stupidness!\" he snarled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay so we took a little longer with our training...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Catch-up courses are a week long\", Fortis said, \"You took what...a MONTH? I wouldn't call that a LITTLE longer...And while you're here, you are not my brothers, you are my MEN. You will conduct yourselves accordingly. That means it's YES SIR, NO SIR...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Three bags full, sir...\" Jupiter mumbled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"SHUT YOUR MOUTH, BOY! You screw things up, it'll get you killed out here. So you make sure you understand every single fucking thing I tell you! There's space in my tent for you two to sleep. Go set your crap up and then get dressed\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, alright...Can we snuggle up to you at night when we're cold...?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis gave his two younger brothers glares that could freeze water. They laughed and headed off to their tent... </span></div></div>",

GET THE HELL UP NOW!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh what!?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis jerked awake! He could hear people running around. Damascus was shaking him awake! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay okay stop! I'm up!\" Fortis groaned. He got up and stared at his friend, \"What the hell!?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The bugles sounded already! You slept right through them! We're readying for battle!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh shit!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis got up and whistled loudly. His squire, Koviac, ran up to him! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, boy! Hurry up!\" Fortis shouted. He stood up while Koviac hefted the solid steel sheets of armour onto his master's impressive form. Koviac was not short, but he still had to stand on a stool to dress his master! First the shoulder-pads, the arms, then the backplate, the breastplate, the abdominal plates, side-plates...all done up with buckles and leather straps so that they hung off of each other. Then the shins, thighs, kneecaps, and the metal coverings over Fortis's boots. The young teenager struggled to lift the immense dead weight of Fortis's sword! Impatiently, Fortis snatched the sword up, taking Koviac with it! He shook the boy off like he was a dead fly, and strapped the scabbard roughly around his armour. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm going out!\" Fortis grunted, \"You stay here and you find a spot where you can see me, okay?\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes sir!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDamascus jogged over with their horses. Fortis climbed up onto Vortex and held his shield. The two knights trotted off to join the others of their class, lined up. They would be in the reserve. Once the battle was well underway, they would charge in as the scale-tippers. From their vantage point up on the escarpment, they would be able to see everything, and judge when was best to enter the fray. They could judge the movement of the troops by the banners and colours flying in the wind. A battle could last a few minutes, or it could last a few days. Or even longer. Weeks. Months. Fortis leaned on his horse, stroking Vortex gently. The horse snorted and stamped its feet...just like its master, it was bored... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis watched the colours move back and forth, side to side. Vladians were a stupid people. Living so far north and cut off from the other kingdoms chilled their brains and dulled their senses. They were a mess of warring lords, tribes, villages and communities. Every few years they tried to do a little sabre-rattling. In recent years they'd been growing stronger, and this kept the Mountanian Army on the alert at all times. Fortis watched as the banners moved again. He saw Vladian knights entering the battlefield. They had no real discipline. Fortis watched as ordinary Mountanian foot-soldiers speared them off of their horses and butchered them on the ground. Fortis sighed...this was gonna be a long battle...or not...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sniffed the air. He could smell...smoke and...blood and...something not nice...and...smoke and...something REALLY nice...He turned back to see the Fatlantean army-caterers. They were carrying paper bags and trays filled with what looked like rolls or buns or sandwiches or something...something to eat before the big event. How typical of them to always think of food first...at least their hearts were in the right place... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, their impromptu brunch was interrupted by the sound of a bugle! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shit!\" Fortis swore. \"Come on guys! Move it! Vortex! Yah!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis charged down the slope into the fray. He held a heavy wooden lance under his arm. He harpooned three Vladian soldiers in one swift lurch! Dropping the lance, he drew out his sword, slicing and slashing through the sea of enemy soldiers! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a knightly tradition that knights only fought with other knights, but King Leviathan had said to call the Vladian knights 'knights' was an insult to the knights that served his own kingdom. As a result, Fortis fought indiscriminately. His sword sailed through the air, slashing and slicing, smashing his way through like an explorer hacking his way through the wildest jungles. Fortis dismounted his horse and landed on the ground. The Vladians who were nearby suddenly realised that this horrific being was just as tall on his feet as he was on horseback! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis's size meant that he needed stronger and thicker armour, that his body was well-capable of carrying. It also meant that the Vladian swords couldn't pierce it. Fortis's heavy sword thrummed through the air, cracking and smashing into the enemy like a can-opener. And Fortis wasn't alone. Dozens of other knights, elite warriors and professional killing-machines with the strength of mountains, bore down upon the enemy, slicing them up like mincemeat. They avoided killing each other purely by virtue of their size and the heraldry on their shields. Fortis's shield, like all the others, had the coat of arms of his family. A helmet, a quartered shield, with a slab of stone, a lightning-bolt, crossed swords and a length of chain. It reflected his family background of the warrior elite, as builders, as being born of bad weather, of protection, and togetherness. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter hours away, Fortis and his fellow knights returned. Fortis was filthy. He was covered in blood and sweat, and he reeked to high heaven when Koviac unwisely removed his armour, to be hit with the full pong of battle! He regretted it even more when he asked Fortis to raise his arms so that he could remove his chainmail! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You clean that good, boy!\" Fortis rumbled, \"And you get all the dents and crap out of it. And fix the buckle on the left shoulder. Damn thing keeps coming loose...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes master!\" Koviac said. Koviac considered himself fortunate to have Fortis as his master. Fortis was not known for being gentle. He treated everyone rough, even his sister Minerva. Koviac had seen the bruises on her arms. But he knew that Fortis had never actually hurt her. He was not known for being gentle, but he was known for being loving, caring, compassionate and attentive. He simply didn't know his own strength, was all... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKoviac knew that Fortis was one of the best knights in the king's army. He excelled in his training which was why he was already so established at such a young age. Koviac knew that if he ever hoped to be a full knight himself, as was his family's wish for him, he would do well not to cross his master, and obey his every command. For only then would he hope himself, one day, to have his own armour, his own sword, his own shield, coat of arms, horse, and have all the cute girls fawning over him... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKoviac knelt and started cleaning Fortis's armour. He had with him a bowl of sand and vinegar, seasoned with a healthy dose of urine. It smelt revolting, but it certainly got all the crud off the metal. Koviac scraped it over the metal with a rag, scrubbing and polishing as hard as he could. Fortis would not be happy if the metal wasn't sparkling clean by the next time he had to use it. Polishing the metal wasn't just to show off, it also prevented rusting and breakage. Koviac didn't mind all the hard work...He just hoped that Fortis had a BATH before he saw him again!...Although that was pretty unlikely! </span></div></div>",

He started with the helmet and began scrubbing and scraping, with the sand-piss-vinegar polishing agent. Why couldn't he just use soap? He sighed... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKoviac was so busy polishing that he didn't hear Fortis return. The young knight kicked up a chair and sat down. He had several large, brown paper packages with him. He watched his squire scrubbing away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No no no no no!\" Fortis rumbled, \"What the HELL are you doin', boy!? AROUND! AROUND! You do it like that, you gonna give it scratches everywhere! AROUND! Circular motions! You not scrapin' off fried bird-shit...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes master!\" said Koviac, adjusting his polishing motions. \"Was it a good battle, master?\" he asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis nodded. \"It went good...Oh jeez...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis got on his knees and picked up a rag, \"You're gonna be polishing this crap all day at your speed...\" he said, picking up the massive breastplate and scooping up a large amount of the sandy-piss mix and scrubbing it on. \"Come on, boy! Put some of your muscles into this!\" he said. \"Pressure! Around and around!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith Fortis helping, the pile of polished armour grew surprisingly fast. When they were done, they wiped their hands clean and then Fortis picked up the paper packages. He handed two to Koviac and kept four for himself. Koviac unwrapped the paper parcel. Inside was a huge, double-decker burger. Cheese, pickles, beef, bacon...he was hungry! He started munching on it at once. Fortis obviously had a much bigger appetite. Without his sister around to chide him on his manners, he ripped into his meal like a starving wolf. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How you fittin' into all this stuff?\" Fortis asked. <br>\r\n\"Sir?\" Koviac asked. <br>\r\n\"Bein' out here in all this shit...\" Fortis said. \"Cold, cold, cold, windy, cold, windy, windy, cold. No fires, no warm beds...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My lord, I'm sure you don't enjoy this!\" Koviac said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn right I don't...I wanna get the hell back home 'soon as I can\", Fortis rumbled. \"Ain't gonna happen no time soon, though. You missin' anyone, boy?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My mother...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh. Yeah it's good to have a girl you wanna look after...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I wouldn't exactly say...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis chuckled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well what about you?\" said Koviac, hotly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The girl\", said Fortis. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Girl?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"MY girl\", said Fortis. \"THIS girl\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe tugged on the locket around his neck. Koviac recognised it at once as Lady Minerva's. He nodded soberly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, my lord\", he said. He didn't dare say anything else. He knew that his master was sensitive when it came to the issue about his treasured baby sister... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Minerva was sitting in front of her vanity as her maid Penelope was brushing through her long, dark blond hair.  Minerva looked forlornly out of her bedroom window.  The trees were beginning to lose their leaves, and the weather was turning colder.  She moved her eyes to her calendar posted on the wall next to the window.  Just last night she had crossed off another day--another day that her brothers had been at war with the Vladians.  The days her brothers had been gone now totalled 165.  Over four months of loneliness and blandness as she puttered around her family home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGranted, she wasn't completely alone, with her servants, her grandmother, and her friend Eldonia staying here.  However, Minerva was tired of the endless worrying.  Her days were mostly filled sitting beside Grandma Athena and Eldonia as all three knitted blankets and clothing for the war effort.  Everything they made was sent off to make-shift hospitals and orphanages to help those that had been wounded or otherwise negatively affected by the loss of loved ones in the war.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Minerva wasn't knitting, she was writing letters.  She wrote to all three of her brothers nearly every day, but she had gotten scant few in return.  She understood that they were busy, but every single missive she got reassured her that her family was still alive.  She had lost her father not quite six months ago.  She couldn't stand it to lose one of her brothers right now, especially Fortis.  She knew she shouldn't have favorites among her brothers, but she couldn't help it.  Fortis had always been stronger and bigger and more protective of her than Jupiter or Cannius.  He had always spent more time with her, too.  She looked at a small oil painting of her brother that sat on her vanity.  She smiled sadly.  She hoped the war would end soon so Fortis could come back home to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All set, my lady,\" said Penelope with one final primp of her mistress's hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, Penelope.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Minerva stood and left to go downstairs for breakfast.  Both Eldonia and her grandmother were already sitting at the dining room table having breakfast.  Despite being just the three of them, a large spread was laid out for them.  Lady Athena was sipping at her cup of tea and demurely eating a scone.  Eldonia, however, was eating at a rapid pace.  Minerva laughed at the sight of her friend stuffing food into her face as if there wouldn't be enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hungry this morning?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia merely nodded her head and put together the most disgusting sandwich Minerva had ever seen.  Eldonia took a piece of buttered toast, placed fried tomatoes, pickles, and slices of apple on top, before drizzling honey and spreading cranberry preserves on top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinerva looked practically ill as she watched Eldonia take a large bite, close her eyes, and hum happily as chewed her rather gross-looking concoction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Elly, are you...feeling alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm, never better, Min!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure?  That sandwich you're eating looks rather...er....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, Minerva, dear, let Eldonia eat what she wants,\" said Lady Athena.  \"After her lack of appetite the past several weeks, it's only natural that she'd make up for lost time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinerva just shrugged her shoulders.  \"Yes, Grandma.\"  She supposed if Eldonia wanted to eat that weird combination of foods, it was her choice.  Minerva, too, was glad that her friend had recovered her appetite.  Eldonia hadn't been quite herself since the boys left for war.  She had been rather tired and irritable and had barely touched her food.  Minerva just thought her friend was depressed.  After all, Eldonia and Fortis had struck up quite a...'friendship'...before he left.  Minerva thought of Prince Cassius and sighed.  Pining for a boy was enough to still her appetite, too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooohhh,\" Eldonia moaned as she scooted her chair back from the table.  \"I think I ate too much.\"  She placed her hand over her mouth and gave a delicate burp.  \"Excuse me.  I think I'm going to go lie down and digest a bit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Take as much rest as you need, dear,\" said Lady Athena.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia rose to her feet, one hand on her belly.  Minerva looked at her friend in surprise.  Eldonia seemed to have put on quite a bit of weight recently!  Her normally flat stomach was now quite rounded and distended from her body.  Was she eating so much now to take her mind off of Fortis?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Eldonia waddled a bit from the room, Minerva's brows drew together.  Eldonia's weight gain was rather low in the belly--much lower than where her stomach would be.  Why would....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinerva gasped and put a hand to her mouth.  A horrible thought occurred to her.  Her mind ran frantically through all the changes she'd seen in her friend over the past several months, and she groaned.  Why hadn't she seen it before?  Eldonia was pregnant!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinerva shook her head and sighed.  Eldonia had told her she and Fortis had been careful when they were together.  Minerva snorted.  Yeah, right!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinerva looked to her grandmother.  Lady Athena nodded her head.  \"I see you've finally figured it out, my dear,\" Lady Athena said.  \"I wondered when you would put all the pieces together.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know?  About Eldonia?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAthena snorted.  \"Of course I know!  I've been around plenty of women in her condition, including myself.  I recognized the signs right away!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aren't you...mad?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mad?  Why would I be mad at Eldonia?  The foolish chit got herself with child.  She's going to have to deal with the consequences of bearing an illegitimate child, and I do not envy her that, nor the conversation she will have with her father once she's told him.  But she's not my granddaughter.  I know that YOU know better than to get in her condition.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinerva blushed.  \"Yes, Ma'am.  But...even though she's not your granddaughter, I thought you'd be upset, since she carries your great-grandchild.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLady Athena went absolutely still.  \"What?\" she said quietly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...Eldonia.  She's carrying your great-grandchild.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinerva cringed as her grandmother went livid.  \"I can't believe one of my grandsons would be so careless!\" the older woman seethed.  \"Which one was it?  I bet it was Jupiter!  He never could keep it in his pants!\"  At Minerva's head shake, Athena said, \"Cannius never was the most intelligent when he was around a girl.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Minerva shook her head again, Athena rose to her feet.  \"Not Fortis!  Fortis knows better!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinerva cowered in her chair, but she bit her lip and gave a tiny nod of her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAthena fumed.  \"I cannot believe my oldest grandson would take advantage of a girl her age!  What was he thinking?!  Well, it was obvious he wasn't thinking, or rather it was obvious what he was thinking WITH!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinerva blushed, but her grandmother continued on.  \"When he gets back home, he will have to sort all this out!  He will own up to his actions, and I will make sure he does right by the girl!  She is, after all, the daughter of an earl and of respectable lineage, despite her irresponsible behavior.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLady Athena took several deep breaths.  \"She could be carrying his heir.  I will NOT see the earldom fall to an illegitimate son because Fortis couldn't take appropriate precautions!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAthena walked down the table to Minerva and gave her a strained smile.  \"I'm sorry, my dear.  I did not mean to frighten you.  However, I have some letters to write.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Lady Athena swept out of the room, Minerva sighed and took a shaky sip of tea.  She had rarely seen her grandmother so upset, but rightfully so.  Anger was starting to bleed through Minerva's shock, as well.  Had Eldonia planned this?  Did she intentionally become pregnant to trap Fortis in marriage?  Was her so-called friend so desperate for a good match that she would sleep with a newly titled earl so that she could guarantee she'd become a countess?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinerva got angrily to her feet and left the dining room.  She would seek out Eldonia and have a good talk with her 'friend.'</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Minerva found her friend in the front parlour. She was lying down on a couch, breathing lightly. She'd evidently just gotten over her latest bout of morning-sickness. Minerva could see it all now, the trips to the bathroom, the strange eating habits, the abdominal swelling, the strange foods, the cravings... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinerva sat down on the couch at her friend's feet and sighed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened, Eldonia?\" she asked. \"How...how did this happen?\" she asked again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinerva, like her grandmother, was recovering from shock, in a way! Fortis always acted as the big, tough, dangerous, hot-tempered, womanising, hot-blooded young nobleman, but Minerva knew from experience that her oldest brother had strong principles. He would NEVER force himself on a lady. Minerva remembered once, joking that he would. He had scoffed and said 'no' for two reasons. He was far too strong for any woman to resist him, and that wouldn't be fair...and he'd also sworn to uphold the three codes of chivalry, one of which was defence and respect of the womenfolk...which, he frankly admitted, he often practiced on Minerva herself! Minerva had laughed at this, but she thought it was sweet... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut now!? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone knew that Fortis was having regular sex. The occasions where the household chambermaids went into the young lord's bedroom to \"clean\"...at 1:30 in the morning...had always been regular and uninterrupted tradition. But Fortis had never actually gotten any of them PREGNANT!...Their father would've murdered him! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen it dawned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFather wasn't here. Fortis was lord of the manor now. Minerva supposed that being at the top of the food chain now, Fortis felt he didn't have to worry so much and explain himself to anyone. And he wouldn't, if grandma wasn't here. Oooh boy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia groaned. \"It was all...well it was kinda my fault. I...I got the hots for him when I met you at the castle during the Queen's Birthday...He was so different from all the other idiots there...They're all cocky, jocky, penis-hockey...seeing how many girls they can pass around between them. I hate those guys, they're so boring! Fortis is so different!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is he?\" Minerva asked. She was at a loss to see WHAT was so different about her brother...Okay, if she thought about it, maybe she'd come up with something...but... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I could see it!\" Eldonia said. \"H-how he acts around you. He...he treats you so...so nice...It was sweet and...and well...how he makes sure you're always comfy and safe and happy and how he teases you and makes fun of you and how you let him do that...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well he's not gonna change, so...\" Minerva said. \"...I have to make SOME concessions to him...and he's not so bad...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well that's it!\" Eldonia said. \"He's sweet and he's sexy and strong all in one. Do you know how many of those there are out there? Not many! And you have no idea, Minerva. You're the youngest of four! I'm my father's only child! There's a lot of pressure for me to marry good! I could see that Fortis was something special and well...I suppose I took advantage and...and I was a bit...well...opportunistic...?\" she finished, not sure of the word. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinerva listened in silence. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YOU TOOK ADVANTAGE OF...!!!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Minnie PLEASE don't be angry! I don't even know what my FATHER'S going to say! It all happened so fast! He was sweet and loving and playful, I was looking for someone who might be a cool boyfriend. Things kinda got out of control! I led him on and opened myself up to him, I admit it...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You opened your LEGS!\" Minerva said hotly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...and even then, not far enough...\" Eldonia said. Minerva glared at her 'friend'! Eldonia gulped. Normally their dirty little teenage-girl jokes were met with giggles, but apparently Minerva wasn't in the mood! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look I'm sorry alright!? But Fortis is really sweet! I'm sure we can work something out!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We better!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And when we get married, then you and I can be more than just friends!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinerva stopped...that WAS true...Eldonia would be around all the time...they could hang out whenever they wanted, play with the babies...eat, drink, be merry...maybe it wouldn't be so bad? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's all too far ahead!\" Minerva finished with a huff, \"The baby isn't even BORN yet! You STILL need to get married. And then you have to PRAY that Fortis legitimises the baby! If he doesn't recognise it as his, you're in deep trouble!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course he will! He wants an heir to his estate, doesn't he!?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope you realise he won't do it if it's a girl! A girl's no use to him! Who heard of a Girl Earl? He needs a BOY to take over the estate when he dies!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Minnie don't TALK like that!\" Eldonia sobbed, \"It's hard enough! Now just...just leave me alone!\" and she burst into tears! </span></div></div>",

There WILL be a marriage. He must take care of the girl, and attend to any children that she might bear. I shall write to Lord Von Gewalt and tell him what has happened. And I shall send a letter to your brother...if I can...and tell HIM what has happened. At the nearest possible convenience, he is to come home and attend to his responsibilities!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinerva sighed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I'm sure it will not be so bad!\" Athena said. \"You know Fortis.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Over the coming weeks and months, Eldonia's appetite steadily increased. As did her desire for...strange food combinations. Minerva wasn't sure at WHAT stage in her life she would ever desire fresh Lucian oysters dipped in chocolate...but...to each her own, she guessed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Eldonia grew more and more pregnant and her weight made it harder for her to move around, Lady Athena became more and more determined to find some way to contact Fortis! Meanwhile, Minerva and the housemaids decorated and prepared one of the empty guestrooms. It would now become the nursery for the new baby. Minerva climbed up into the attic and came downstairs with a heavy, wrought iron cradle! The cradle was jet black and very dusty! It had a solid iron frame and bars around it, and a pretty, protective metal mesh between the baby and the bars, to prevent it from getting its arms...legs...or even its head!...stuck between the bars. The cradle was simply decorated, with snails and flowers and birds, all hammered and bent out of iron, and welded to the outside bars of the crib as a form of decoration. The canopy over the crib had dusty old lace curtains. Minerva removed the curtains and shook and cleaned them thoroughly before putting them back around the crib. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's so beautiful!\" said Eldonia, examining the rough elegance of the cradle. \"Who made it?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One of our ancestors\", said Minerva. \"It's pretty, isn't it?\" she said. She hung a mobile above the bars of the cradle where the baby could watch it spin around when the little clockwork motor was wound up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's very pretty\", said Eldonia, smiling. She stared around the nursery at the changing-table, the couch, chairs, and toy-chest. She gasped and then sat down heavily on the couch! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you alright!?\" Minerva asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm...I'm fine! I...the baby!\" Eldonia gasped. \"He's getting so BIG now! Ooh!\" she groaned. \"It is kinda...hard to...hard to move!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're carrying the baby of a big, strong Mountain lord within you!\" Minerva said. \"I think you should expect it to be of larger than average size!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think it passed THAT point three months ago!\" Eldonia gasped! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir conversation was interrupted by Lady Athena entering the new nursery with a letter! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Finally, a WORD from your brother!\" she said. \"He writes...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"...My dearest Nanna,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt is a great joy to hear from you. I have had so little news from anything outside of the fields of battle. Our efforts against the Vladians amount to steady victory. I know not when I will be home again. Perhaps in a few months. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Lady Eldonia is a fine and virtuous young woman. Spirited, strong and determined. She is very different and is most attractive. I foresee us being very contented. Your news of her expectation was a surprise. But I am sure the child will be a healthy young lad who I shall love and tend to for ever and always. Give her my love. Oh, and tell the girl I will return to her soon. Young Minerva must miss her big brother's attentions, hmm?...\" </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's a winking face, there...\" said Lady Athena.

It was getting harder and harder to move up and down stairs! She shuffled heavily towards her bedroom. She gasped! She could feel a twitching sensation! She kept moving. Then she felt it! A distinct clenching feel in her abdomen! These must be the 'contractions' that Lady Athena had mentioned! She gasped! Was the baby COMING already!? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe headed down the corridor and opened her bedroom door! She nearly stumbled when she felt something painful jolt through her body! She gasped and staggered in! These contractions were SHARP! And painful! They were like the worst-ever muscle-cramps and windings that she'd ever had! She was having trouble breathing! Another painful jolt! She staggered to her bed but fell short, hitting the floor instead! She started breathing hard and heavy! The contractions were getting tighter and tighter! She let out a groan of agony!

We'll carry her into the bed together! Come along now! That's right, strong grip! Up! One...two...UP! That's right! Easy now...easy...down...down! Legs up and over and onto the bed...good!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia gritted her teeth!

Well HURRY!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe womenfolk all dispersed to find the necessary equipment! Two huge buckets of boiling water, a bowl, a sharp knife, some string, plenty of towels, a bottle of smelling-salts and all other manner of things! Lady Athena positioned Eldonia's body, sitting her on top of a pile of pillows so that she would be slightly sloped downwards. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Legs up, darling! No! UP! NO! Like THIS!...Skirts up! That's good! Now...towels!...Put them there...Now push darling! Come along! Puff-puff-puff-puff! That's it! Let it out! LET IT OUT! SCREAM!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia screamed alright! The windows vibrated as she shrieked in pain! She felt like she was giving birth to a COW, not a baby! She gasped and felt a release! Something wet flopped out! It landed with a 'whump!' in the bundle of towels and Lady Athena reached for the knife to cut the umbilical cord and to pull out the rest of the cord and afterbirth. She bundled up all the soiled and used and otherwise unwanted products and equipment of the birth and stuffed it into an old basket. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here girls!\" she said. \"Take it away! Burn it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Burn it!?\" one of the girls asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The WHOLE THING! We don't want any of it near the baby where it might get sick! Go away now!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls carried out all the towels and the afterbirth and other bits and pieces, and left the room. Athena staunched the bleeding from the birth with a towel. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now...keep your legs shut! That'll hold the towel in place. Of course, if you'd done that to begin with, we wouldn't be where we are now...\" she mumbled. \"Now, let's have a...My goodness!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I got the smelling-salts granny! I...Woah!\" Minerva gasped! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLying on the bed was the new baby. It had dark blond, brown-mixed hair, a cross between his mother and father. Minerva stared at the baby! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's so BIG! No wonder you were in so much pain Ellie! Here's the salts...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia sniffed them and coughed! She was sweating heavily! Athena handed her a towel and wiped her down while Eldonia caught her breath. She finally fainted against the pillows, spent and exhausted! It was now that they heard the crying... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAthena picked up her great-grandson and dumped him into the buckets of water to clean him off! She toweled him down and turned him every whichway, to see how the next generation of her family had measured up! She smiled. He was a PERFECT baby! She smiled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello little darling!\" she cooed softly, \"Hello! Do you know who I am? I'm your Granny Atheny! Yes I am! And you, you are...are...eh...are...um...Huh...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned to Eldonia, who was drinking down an ocean of water! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...What do we call this young master?' she asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia stared at Minerva! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know...I never talked about it with Fortis!...\" Eldonia said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well lucky for you, I wrote down a list of names the moment I knew you were expecting\", said Athena. She pulled them out of her pocket in her dress and shook the piece of paper open. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's see now...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Virgil?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think Fortis would make some horrible sex-joke out of that...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Zeus?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah, that's boring...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maximus?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Too common!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Atlas?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia frowned and ran the word over her tongue. \"No...I don't think he's an 'Atlas' anyway...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Erectus?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh don't name him that!\" Minerva cried out, \"He'll get bullied!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or it could be the best name in the world for him, if he's inherited anything from his father...\" Eldonia whispered. The two girls giggled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hercules?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Again, too common\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bacchus?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh sure, name him after a drunk!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about Augustus?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Booooring...I want something COOL! Something GRAND! Something POWERFUL! I bet that's what Fortis would want!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I bet he would!\" said Lady Athena. She glanced down her list of names. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about...Daemon?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe if the hair was brown...I don't think he's a Daemon\", Minerva said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about...Jasper?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's a BOY, not a cat!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...What about...Leonarrrrrrrdo...?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinerva smiled. \"Ooooh!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia ran the name through her lips. \"Leonardo?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Classic, powerful, upstanding, alluring. And his brown-blond hair could grow out long like a lion's mane\", Lady Athena suggested. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia stared at Minerva and the two girls frowned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Leonardo Fortis Vanderstorm...\" Eldonia whispered. She grinned, \"Oooh, I think I like that!...Hey we can call him 'Leafy' for short, because his hair looks like autumn!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three women burst out laughing! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think we have a name!\" said Athena, smiling and kissing the baby, \"Don't we little Leafy?\" she teased. \"Ooooh!\" she said, squeezing the baby tightly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia had recovered from the exhaustion of the birth now, and she took hold of her baby and snuggled it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello Leo!\" she cooed, \"Welcome to the world, my darling...\" she whispered, kissing him on the forehead. \"Mother loves you!\" she added. </span></div></div>",

The carriage rumbled into the center of the main front-line camp and the doors opened. The mail-carriers got out and a man blew a whistle several times, long and loud, to get everyone's attention! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"MAIL CALL!\" another man shouted out. People lined up and huddled around as packages and parcels, letters and envelopes were handed out to the gathering crowd. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For you, my lord\", said the mailman, handing Fortis a large, folded sheet of paper. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis examined the letter. There was a large seal stamped onto the fold in the paper. He broke the seal and opened the document. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My darling Fortis...awwwwww...Much love and great affection and concerns for your safety...yadda yadda yadda...writing to you about Lady Eldonia...again??...say that she has...WHAT!?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone within hearing-distance turned around to stare at Fortis! Fortis ignored them and kept reading! His expression kept changing, from one of joy, to worry, to anger, to panic! He jogged away and entered a large tent where King Leviathan was busy with his most senior officers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Then you will go...ahem...another time, gentlemen\", said Leviathan. The generals saluted and left the tent. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My lord\", said Leviathan. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis saluted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your Majesty I...I received a letter from home\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. Was that the mail-coach that just came?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes sir\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh good!...Achilles! Send these off at once, will you?\" the king asked his manservant. He shoved a number of sealed documents into the younger man's hands. He bowed and left the tent at once. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, what is it?\" the king asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...ahem. I...um...\" Fortis wasn't sure how to say this. He handed over the letter instead. The king started to read. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...Oooh...Ooooooooooh...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe put the letter down and smiled. \"So I see...\" he said. \"Been expanding the kingdom, have we?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh...so it seems!\" said Fortis, brightly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe king chuckled. \"You are here to ask for time off to attend your new son...and your FIRST son, I believe?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes sir!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm!...\" </span></div></div>",

It's a long way out of that gully, and those idiot Vladians have just about dug their own graves. Well, it's our job to bury them there.

A noble cause\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis thought about this as he left the tent. The king was right! He was fighting for his child...But what kind of child was it? The only information in the letter was that it was a boy, and that they'd named it Leonardo Fortis. Leonardo was a classical and powerful name, suggestive of strength, intelligence, good looks, a creative streak, and a penchant for being a free spirit...What would the baby be like? Would it live up to its names? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis packed up all his stuff, said goodbye to his friends, mounted his horse, Vortex, and took off down the road...He was going home again... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe journey was long, but Fortis was young, strong and determined. He rode his horse hard and stopping for only the briefest of respites. When he finally reached Castle Vanderstorm, it was extremely late at night and both he and his horse were exhausted! Fortis stabled Vortex, and tiptoed into the house. Somewhere in here, there was a new baby boy... </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Fortis sneaked into the castle via the servants' entrance near the kitchen. He tiptoed past the kitchen table, the servants' hall, the servants bedrooms and upstairs. These stairs seemed SO much smaller than when he was 15...when he used to sneak downstairs to...'play'...with Rosemary the chambermaid...aaah, good times... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis entered the front parlour. A fire was still burning in the grate. He added some logs and stoked the fire until it was burning properly. The light filled the room and the warmth washed over him! He NEEDED that! He stood up and stared at the fire. He then picked up a candlestick and lit the candle in it, before heading upstairs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf there was a baby in the house, where would it be? He kept moving until he saw a door with a beautiful floral wreath on it. A baby-ring. He smiled and opened the doors to the nursery. He tiptoed inside and moved around, lighting the candles on the tables and wall-brackets. Then he recognised the old, wrought-iron crib in the middle of the room. He walked up to it and lit the four candles in the sockets on the sides of the crib. The candles were far above the crib, with wax-pans underneath to catch the dripping wax, so there was no danger to the baby. With the four candles lit, Fortis could bend over the crib. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeing tall was a sign of strength, virility, power, security and protection in Mountania. Mothers liked their sons to be big and strong, fathers wanted them to be healthy and carry on the family line. Girls saw big strong, towering husbands and boyfriends as being strong providers, good producers and incredible bedroom performers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis wasn't about to deny that he was all those things...but being tall DID lead to a few issues...He hated having to bend down this far to look into the damn crib! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe knelt down and peeked into the crib. Wrapped up tightly in a blanket was a baby boy, with only its head visible, sleeping on a bright blue pillow. It had wheat-coloured hair of browny-blond. Fortis chuckled. So this was his baby boy... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey little fellah...\" he said in his deep, rumbling bass. \"You awake, huh?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe poked the blanket. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>wriggle!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe chuckled and kept poking. The blanket kept wriggling. Then, the baby's eyes opened! Fortis smiled. He had bright blue eyes! So big and beautiful... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey little buddy!\" said Fortis, softly. \"Huh? You awake, huh? Fortis slowly unwrapped the blanket to reveal a sky-blue fleechy romper-suit. Free from the blanket, the baby kicked and wriggled around! It giggled up at Fortis. Fortis lowered a hand down and the baby grabbed his finger! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehehe! You ain't scared of anything, aren'tcha?\" said Fortis. He easily lifted the wriggling mass of baby out of the crib and stood slowly up, holding the baby tightly in his huge arms! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBaby Leonardo didn't KNOW who this strange man was! It was okay when he was just staring at him and whispering to him and giggling, but now he was being carried up and away from the safety of his home! He wriggled and kicked! The man held him tightly in his powerful arms! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heeey! Shhhh...It's okay...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis tried to get a closer look at Leonardo's face, but the baby kept turning his head away! Fortis sighed and sat down in a rocking-chair. It creaked loudly, but held, and Fortis began rocking back and forth, stroking and squeezing the baby. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Leo decided that the big scary man wasn't a danger to him, he opened his eyes and stared at him with wonderment. The man smiled back and chuckled. His voice was deep and soothing...the baby liked this voice! He yawned and snuggled up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis chuckled. He hugged the baby, got up and started walking around the room, rocking it gently in his arms... </span></div></div>",

She wasn't sure who would be moving around the house so late at night! She armed herself with a candle and a large knife that Fortis had given her, and slipped out of her bedroom. She tiptoed along the hall to where she saw the nursery doors slightly open! She hurried towards them, her nightdress fluttering! She pushed the doors open to see all the candles lit! She stared around the room and then she saw a HUGE figure standing by the windows, his massive arms held up, obviously holding something! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis saw the reflection of his sister in the window and turned slowly around. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey girl!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinerva dropped the knife! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey don't do that! I spent a long time making that for you!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinerva picked up the knife, and put it on a cabinet, out of reach of the baby. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're home!\" Minerva said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not for long. Only a week\", Fortis said. \"I thought I'd come and see this baby that everyone's been talkin' about...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Isn't he darling?\" Minerva whispered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.

No harm done!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinerva just sighed and shook her head.  She couldn't really fault her brother for wanting to spend some time with his son when he first got home.  Too bad he was only going to be home for a week.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How is the war going?\" she asked as they left only two candles burning near the crib and quietly left the nursery.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're beating the Vladians' butts!\" Fortis said with a grin.  \"In fact, the whole reason I'm home is that our offensive line is doing so well, the king felt he could spare my military expertise for a week.  I bet the Vladian lines will be obliterated within a month, and then I can be home permanently.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinerva frowned.  \"At least until the next war starts.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that goes without saying!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So,...are you going to marry Eldonia?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis sighed.  \"I don't know, girl.  I have to think about it for a while.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?!  What is there to think about?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Keep your voice down!\" he hissed, gripping her arm and hauling her back to her bedroom.  \"You'll wake up the whole house, including the baby!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinerva glared at her brother, her arms crossed over her chest.  \"You took advantage of my friend, Forty, my BEST friend!  Who also happens to be the only daughter of Lord Von Gewalt!  You HAVE to marry her to make an honest woman out of her!  Besides, if you want little Leo to be your heir, you have to legitimize him by marrying Eldonia!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You think I don't know any of this, girl?!\" Fortis growled.  \"I'm not stupid, you know!  I just...have a lot to think about!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, better not think about anything too long!  Grandma Athena won't take too kindly to you delaying longer than necessary!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis sighed and rubbed the back of his neck.  \"Look, I can't do anything until the war is over, anyway.  And I want to make sure to do this right.  Eldonia deserves a proper...wedding...and all that.  I'm sure you and Grandma will help her...er...prepare for everything.  Get her a dress and all that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinerva's eyes brightened.  \"Are you going to propose to her before you leave again?  How romantic!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis cleared his throat.  \"Well, I can't honestly do that until I speak to her father and ask his permission.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh.\"  Minerva bit her lip.  \"Y-you should know that Eldonia hasn't told her parents yet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She hasn't?\"  Fortis swore ripely.  This week was definitely NOT going to be the funnest week of his life!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinerva yawned and shivered a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, girl.  You need to get into bed.  Let me stoke the fire a bit for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis led his sister to her bed, tucked her in tight, then used the poker and several strong breaths to stir up the coals in her fireplace.  He laid a couple more pieces of wood on the fire to ensure it kept burning through the night.  Then, he went back over and pushed his sister's bangs off her forehead.  \"Good night, girl.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*Yawwn!*  Good night,...Forty.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis left her room, closing the door.  He headed back down the hallway towards his own room, but stopped in front of Eldonia's.  A wicked grin erupted on his face.  He had actually missed the fiery girl over the past several months.  He also thought often of their interludes they had had together.  He hadn't seen any action since he had left for war.  He wondered if she would be up for a little \"mountain climbing\" before the baby needed a midnight snack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis silently let himself into Eldonia's room and crept over to the bed.  The room was freezing, as the fire had gone out, but Fortis knew they'd be able to warm each other up plenty with what he had planned.  He hurriedly stripped off his clothes, leaving then lying haphazardly on the floor, and got into bed next to Eldonia.  He snuggled up close to her, his chest to her back, and wrapped his strong arms around her soft, warm body.  She was wearing a light sleeping gown, but Fortis reckoned she wouldn't be wearing it for long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had to hold back a moan at how wonderful she felt in his arms.  His cock was already hard and ready, and he pressed it firmly into the cleft of her buttocks.  He ran one hand down her side, marvelling at how much fuller and softer and curvier her figure was, and he gently cupped one of her breasts with his other hand.  He breathed in the sweet scent of her hair as he palmed her breast, noting that it too was larger and fuller than he remembered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia moaned in her sleep, and Fortis smiled into her hair.  He began to play with her now-straining nipple, feathering and plucking and pinching the firm peak, making her gasp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha...who...F-fortis?\" she panted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis chuckled and tangled his legs with hers.  \"Yeah, it's me.  You've been busy since I've been gone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia bit her lip as Fortis's attention on her very sensitive breast made warmth bloom in her belly and spread down to her core. \"Y-yeah.  Wh-when did you...get in?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"About an hour ago.  Had to stop in and see my son first.  He's a big, strapping boy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia giggled a bit.  \"He is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Elly, I'm...er...I didn't mean for that--him--to happen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fortis, don't worry about it.  Please?  I don't regret anything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, no?  So, you wouldn't mind having a little more...fun with me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis's voice turned husky at the end, and his warm breath on her ear made her shiver in delight.  \"Oh, yes!\" she breathed.  \"But...Fortis...I only gave birth a couple weeks ago.  Your grandmother said I won't be healed for several more weeks yet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA pang of disappointment spread through Fortis.  He desperately wanted to make love to her.  However, he also clearly remembered the horrible ordeal his mother had gone through giving birth to Minerva.  Considering what a large boy Leonardo was, he could only imagine how difficult a birth it had to have been for Eldonia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe slid his hand forward from her hip and down to her belly.  It was quite soft still, and not near as flat as when he had left.  But, he found his arousal kicking up a notch.  He had always appreciated a fuller figure on the women he had bedded.  Eldonia had been one of the thinnest he'd ever had.  However, he appreciated the changes bearing his son had on her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then got an idea.  They might not be able to have full intercourse,...but there were certainly other ways of pleasing each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You may not be healed yet,\" he panted harshly, rubbing his hand over the curve of her belly, dipping a finger into the indentation of her belly button, \"but there are other things we can do to...reacquaint ourselves.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis then made a suggestion that had Eldonia gasping in want.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"I assume you've never done this before, so let me...educate you in how to pleasure a man,\" Fortis said gruffly.  \"I would love to teach you how to suck me off, and in return, I'll make sure you see stars.  So, what do you think, Elly?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis had nearly said please.  He was anxious to experience release by Eldonia's hand or mouth.  He had to bite his lip from sounding too desperate, but his body craved this girl's attentions after only having had his own hand to satisfy him over the past too many months at war!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia panted harshly.  During the middle months of her pregnancy her hormones had made her uncomfortably randy.  She had wished so much for Fortis to be here and slake her need.  Despite the lingering soreness in her nether regions from having given birth, she relished the thought of exchanging touches and sweet caresses with her favorite Mountain Lord.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" she said huskily.  \"You have no idea how much I have missed you...and your touch while you were gone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe rolled over in his arms to face him and raised her arms so that her hands cupped his face.  A wicked smile spread across her face, which Fortis gladly returned in relief.  She raised her lips to within a hair's breadth of his.  \"Teach me, my lord,\" she whispered.  \"Show me what my touch...and mouth...can do for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis moaned and closed the distance between their mouths.  He sucked strongly on her lips, Eldonia opening hers immediately upon having his pressed to hers.  He swiped his tongue eagerly into her mouth, relishing her sweet flavor and groaning as her tongue tangled enticingly with his own.  He pulled her closer into his arms and couldn't resist pumping his hips a bit and thrusting his hard member against her shapely thigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia giggled and let her hand slowly drift down his body, remembering how well-developed and packed his frame was with muscle.  With all the swinging and slashing and hard maneuvering wearing armor day in and day out on the front lines, Fortis's strong frame was even more solid and bulky with muscle than when he left nearly a year ago.  She shivered at feeling his firm muscles beneath his skin, making her feel safe and protected and secure here in his arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis was breathing harshly as Eldonia's soft, cool hand made its descent.  He knew exactly where she was headed.  When her small hand encircled his straining manhood, he let out a satisfied groan.  A wave of lust ran down his spine.  It had been so long since he'd been with a woman, he knew he wouldn't last that long.  Time to start her tutelage in fellatio before she inadvertently pumped him to completion with her hand!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here,\" he said softly.  He maneuvered them around so he was on his back, and she was hovering over his lower half, her face in line with his impressive groin.  He tugged at the ribbon keeping her gown closed.  \"Take this off,\" he growled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia smiled and got up to her knees before whipping the \"offending garment\" over her head, throwing it to the floor.  Fortis looked his fill of her, raking his heated eyes over her lovely, shapely figure.  He lingered on the larger globes of her breasts, fascinated by the now dark color of her tight nipples, before wandering down to her softer belly and broader hips.  He could just imagine filling her again and again with his seed, seeing her round and full with his children.  His cock seemed to harden even further at his thoughts.  He finally reached the dark delta between her thighs.  He would have to make sure to be plenty gentle with her when he touched her there, since she was still tender.  However, he hoped she was just as sensitive and easily aroused as she had been before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Does my lord like what he sees?\" she teased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis growled and hauled her down to him, making her squeal as he pressed her down so that her face rubbed against his large cock.  \"Does that answer your question?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia giggled and couldn't help nuzzling his long length.  This made him grasp her hair tightly and thrust against her nose and cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what would you have me do?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis panted, anxious to finally have her mouth on him.  \"Lick...my head...then on down my...shaft, first.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia slowly examined him.  She had seen cocks before--what Mountanian lady hadn't?  Mountain men were not known for their modesty, after all.  Eldonia had to admit, she was impressed at seeing him up close like this.  She knew he was thick and long from how he had felt inside her, but seeing him in all his glory made her shiver in excitement.  He was exquisite.  She gently grasped as much of him as she could with her hand before slowly sticking out her tongue and giving his plumy head a small lick.  His skin here was really soft and silky to the touch.  He didn't taste unpleasant, so she gave several more small licks around his head.  When she licked over his slit, he moaned and gripped her hair even tighter.  She smiled.  He must be sensitive here.  She licked over his slit more strongly, in turn tasting more of his unique flavor.  It was...different.  A little salty.  A little bitter.  Not bad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a deep breath, Eldonia let her instincts guide her and began alternating licks and kisses over his head.  Eventually, she slid her lips completely over the tip.  She licked and sucked on it, like he was a lollipop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis let out a short, hoarse yell at this, and thrust himself further into her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia's eyes widened in surprise, and she clamped her mouth around him at his sudden invasion.  She choked and gagged a bit, but he kept moaning and pumping into her mouth.  Eldonia tried to keep her mouth from strangling him, but her jaw was getting tired already from being open for so long.  She tried to help him come faster by licking on the backside of his cock and sucking strongly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis suddenly groaned and lifted her head off him, practically tearing her hair out.  His come erupted from his cock, landing on his belly, with several spurts coating her cheek.  Eldonia was frozen in surprise for a bit.  She hadn't expected him to force her off his cock!  She wasn't sure she was ready to have a mouth full of seed, but she was grateful that he had the foresight to spare her that.  She smiled.  She loved his unexpected thoughtful side.  She knew how he was with Minerva--gentle and tender and sweet.  She had just known he'd be the same with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia crawled up his side, then leaned over him to find a handkerchief in her nightstand.  She wiped the seed from her face.  Then, she looked at Fortis.  His face was red, and he was still breathing hard, but he had a sated, satisfied look on his face.  She cuddled up close to his side, running her hand gently along his bicep, her touch so light it was a tickle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Was that...satisfactory, my lord?\" she purred.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis chuckled.  \"Indeed, it was, my lady.  I haven't come that hard or that quickly for a long time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia, without being told, went back down his body and lovingly cleaned the copious amounts of seed from his belly and his cock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis sighed.  Eldonia was sweet.  He hadn't expected her to do that.  He felt a clutch in his heart at how well and how easily she had pleased him.  Was she more to him than just a hot lay?  The mother of his son?  His sister's best friend?  After all, if the powers at be had their way, she'd soon be his wife.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Eldonia had disposed of the handkerchief and had climbed back up his side, he grasped her suddenly around the waist and rolled on top of her.  She squealed and laughed in delight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is my lady ready for me to return her much appreciated favor?\" he asked huskily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia's heart sped up.  She couldn't wait to experience pleasure by his hands or his mouth.  \"Y-yes, my lord.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe rolled her hips up against his body in encouragement, making him chuckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As my lady wishes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, just as he was about to kiss her again,...</span></div></div>",

She felt his hard, smooth skin press up against her, and her breasts rub up against his perfect chest. She felt his hot breath. She felt...she felt...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><i>WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!! WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!!! WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!!</i></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMother and father sprang apart like magnets! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crying was surprisingly loud! But then Fortis remembered that Eldonia's bedroom was next door to the nursery! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh jeeze!\" Eldonia groaned, \"He's HUNGRY again!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis rolled over and lit the candles on the bedside table. They draped their nightgowns around each other and headed into the nursery, bleary and holding candles. They set them down and Eldonia bent over the crib while Fortis added wood to the fire in the fireplace. It was important to keep the room warm for the baby. He pushed the heavy fire-screen back in front of the grate to prevent any accidental burns, and then lumbered over to the crib. Leo was crying and sobbing! His tummy had that bubbly empty feeling that he didn't like! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooohkay!\" said Eldonia. She sat down in the rocking chair and sat Leo on her lap, \"Okay! Mother's here! Mother's here...suckle-suckle-suckle!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeo attached himself to his mother's chest and started sucking HUNGRILY on her breasts! Fortis stood nearby, his arms crossed. He had a strange look in his eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Eldonia said, noticing his face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What if I did that to you, huh?\" he teased. He knelt behind the chair and wrapped his arms around his lover and kissed her. She smiled. Fortis reached down and stroked baby Leonardo. Leo barely noticed his father's hand. He was too busy suckling on his mother's teat! Eldonia stroked the baby and smiled. Once Leo had suckled down his fill, and been burped sufficiently, Eldonia returned the baby to its crib. Full of warm milk, Leo's belly didn't feel loose and empty anymore...He snuggled up and was soon asleep... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis smiled at the baby, stroking it with one of his hands...</span></div></div>",

She stopped at the doorway to see Fortis throwing his baby into the air and catching him over, and over, and over again!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whooo!!...Waaaah!...Wooooh!! Waaaah! Hahaha! C'mon! UP!!...Down! Hehehe...Cute little fellah...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Forty!\" Minerva called from the hallway, \"Sleep already! And the baby's exhausted!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis chuckled. \"Yeah...Your little Aunt Minnie's right, boy...\" said Fortis. \"Time youse went back to sleep...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis laid the baby in his crib and started wrapping him up in his blanket. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right over left, and pull, and tight...middle...up...snuggle in...Heh!

The ultimate humiliation! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, fellah\", said Fortis. He rolled the baby gently onto its side and wrapped it up in its blanket again. He blew out all the candles around the room, apart from one, which would be kept burning as a night-light, and began to tiptoe out of the room. He placed one hand on the doorknob, and...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Waaaaaaah! Waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!!!\"</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn it!...Shhh! Alright, alright! I'm here! It's ooookay...Papa's here! Now shut the HELL up you stupid little...awww...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis stroked his baby son as he lay in his crib on his back. Leo giggled and smiled up at the big giant man. He still wasn't sure who this person was, exactly, but Leo knew that the man was BIG and STRONG and SAFE!...And Leo didn't want all that to go away! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Fortis reached in to stroke his son, Leo grabbed one of Fortis's fingers with both his tiny hands and held on with surprising strength for a newborn! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mon now...let go!\" said Fortis. \"Let...GO!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Leo WOULDN'T let go! He clung on TIGHT! Fortis tried to shake his finger loose without hurting the baby, but Leo refused to relinquish his prize! Then, he pulled Fortis's han and arm into the crib and hugged it, wrapping his tiny body around it in an amazing display of infantile strength! Fortis raised his arm out of the crib to find his offspring firmly attached to it! Fortis sighed. He'd seen the same sort of behavior with Minerva when she was about this age...He knew what THAT meant! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright. Come on little fellah\", Fortis said. He brought him to his chest and cradled him. Slowly, Fortis started walking out of the room. Leo relaxed his grasp and snuggled up against his papa...Yeah that was it! Papa! That's who this strange man was! His papa... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis chuckled. He looked so darn cute all curled up like that... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One day you gonna carry all kinds of pretty girls just like I'm carryin' you...\" Fortis whispered. \"'Cause you gonna be a BIG and STRONG Mountain lord! Leonardo Fortis Vanderstorm! Hehehe...C'mon little fellah! Bedtime...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis carried the baby into his room and crawled into bed. He laid down and held the baby close to his chest, wrapped in his arms where he wouldn't get hurt. Leo liked this! All warm and snuggly and safe...but it was all so hard and lumpy! He kicked and fidgeted! He didn't like hardiness and lumpiness! And the harder he kicked, the tighter papa's grip became! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!\" Fortis hissed, \"Will yah stop it, son? You wanna sleep here, you sleep here! This ain't time for kickin' around, okay?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Big, wet blue eyes. <br>\r\nTrembling lips. <br>\r\nWinkly widdle nosie...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooooh no!\" said Fortis, \"Don't you DARE!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\"WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!!\"</b> <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn it!...Alright, alright! Sheesh!...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis tried to make the baby comfortable, but Leo wouldn't stop crying! Thank goodness the door was closed, otherwise the wailing would've woken up the entire house! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDesperate for a solution, Fortis came up with an idea! He got out of bed and jogged to his closet. He opened it and rifled through the drawers... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where is it, where is it...c'mon damn it!...Where ARE you!?...I'm sure...Ah!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis pulled out a wooden box. Found it! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe carried it back and sat on the bed with the box in his lap. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! Hey Leo!\" Fortis said. He shook the box. \"Leo! Guess what's in here, huh?\" He whispered. \"Leo look!\" he whispered! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeo was replenishing his air-supply for another bout of tears when he saw the box!...A box! Oooh boxy boxy boxy! Leo want boxy! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See Leo?\" Fortis said, \"Now we take off the lid...and in here we have this!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis tipped out a soft, white cloth bag. Leo stared at the bag. It was done up with a sort of drawstring thing. What was it!? Leo tugged excitedly at the strings. Fortis kicked the box under his bed, and slowly opened the pouch. Inside, he pulled out... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See Leo? This is for you! This was your papa's, but papa's a bit too big for him now, huh? So now he belongs to you! Do you like him, huh son?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeo stared at it. It was a bright, yellow...thing! It was very squishy and soft! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This here's Mortimer! You like Mortimer, don'tcha?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Mortimer', was a fat, plushie cat which Fortis had owned since he was a baby. It was a present made for him by Grandma Athena. It had been loved, hugged, squeezed, squished and resewn several times, the necessary restorations required because of Mountanian rough love. Fortis handed the fat, yellow and white kitten to his little son. Leo was fascinated by the bright colours and the glittery glass eyes, more than anything else! He hugged the kitten tightly and snuggled it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright...now give it back!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeo refused! HIS KITTY!! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis laughed. \"Awww. Now you take good care of Mortimer, won'tcha, son? He's a very special kitty and you gotta feed him all the time with hugs and snuggles...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeo was doing that right now! Fortis laughed. He pulled the covers back over them, blew out the candles, wrapped his son up in his arms, and curled up to go to sleep...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Minerva frowned as she knocked on her brother's bedroom door.  It was unusual for her to be up before Fortis in the morning.  He was usually outside training, running, and lifting weights before the rest of the house even contemplated waking up.  When she thought a bit harder, though, she had to admit that Fortis had gotten in during the wee hours of the night and had stayed up for a while playing with Leo before going to bed.  Maybe she should leave him to sleep a bit longer.  However, Grandma Athena and Eldonia were both anxious to see him again, and both ladies were already downstairs in the dining room having breakfast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, Minerva heard a soft cry coming from Fortis's room.  It sounded like Leo's whimpers that he usually gave before gearing up for a good cry.   Eldonia had mentioned that she hadn't had to get up as many times last night to feed Leo as she usually did, so the baby must be pretty hungry this morning--and most likely needed a nappy change, too.  However, why was Minerva hearing Leo's cries from Fortis's room?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinerva cracked open her brother's door and peered inside.  Fortis was snoring away, his body sprawled out over his large bed.  However, he was holding a blanketed bundle tightly in his arms, and the bundle was wriggling and writhing.  The whimpers were emanating from the blanket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinerva smiled as she crept towards the bed.  Fortis had slept with his son last night.  Minerva's heart just melted at how sweet her brother was.  She tried to pry his arms away from Leo so that she could take the baby to change his nappy and give him to Eldonia for his breakfast, but Fortis's arms were like bands of steel around his son.  Leo's cries were beginning to get louder, and Minerva winced.  She had no desire to hear Leo in a full-out tantrum.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmmph?  Wha...?  Mmmm...,\" Fortis murmured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Forty!\" Minerva hissed.  \"Let go, Forty!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!  My Mortimer,\" he said softly in his sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinerva frowned.  \"Mortimer?  Who's Mortimer?  Your son's name is Leonardo!  And you need to let me take him before--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHH!  WAAAHAAAHAAAHAAAAA!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis was instantly awake and shot up in bed, holding Leo tightly in his arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?  When?  Oh, phew!  What is that smell?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinerva grimaced, but gave a small smile to her brother.  \"That would be your son.  He needs changing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis gladly handed over his smelly son to his sister, his nose wrinkling in disgust.  \"How can someone so small make such a big stink?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinerva giggled.  \"I'm sure you were just as stinky when you were Leo's age!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way!  There's no possible way I would have done something that uncute!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinerva laughed and peeled the blanket away from Leo's face to comfort the baby as his cries began to escalate.  This make the blanket slack enough that Leo was able to free his hands and begin waving them about in his discomfort.  Minerva then noticed the white and yellow plushie clutched tightly in Leo's fist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Forty, what's this that Leo's holding?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm?  Oh, that!  Um...it's just a...present that I brought for him!  Yeah, that's right!  I couldn't come home to my son empty-handed!\"  Fortis wasn't about to admit to his sister that the cat had been his when he was a baby and that he had kept it all these years!  It wasn't a very manly thing to do, after all!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's so cute and precious!  How thoughtful of you!\"  However, when Minerva got a closer look at the plush cat, she saw clearly that the toy was far from new!  In fact, it had been quite thoroughly used!  It had dirt in small smudges in places, and different colors and varieties of threads overlapped on some of the seams.  The tail was permanently bent to one side, and the tip of one ear was missing.  Where did Fortis come by this cat?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinerva then remembered a couple portraits she'd seen of Fortis when he was younger.  He always had a small object cradled in his arms, and it was white and yellow.  Minerva gasped!  This cat had been Fortis's!  Minerva's heart melted, though, at this realization.  Fortis had gifted Leo with his own plushie!...that...Fortis had kept...all these years!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinerva giggled.  She couldn't help ribbing her brother a bit.  \"You know,\" she said after clearing her throat.  \"This cat looks a little worn.  I think the merchant who sold it to you gypped you!  You ought to take it back and get your money back!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?  I will not!  I will not give Mortimer back to anyone!  He's Leo's now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mortimer?  You named the cat Mortimer?!\"  Minerva laughed!  That was the name that Fortis had murmured in his sleep!  \"Admit it, Forty!  This cat was yours when you were a baby!  I heard you mention it in your sleep!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis scowled at his sister.  \"Okay, fine!  That cat was mine, alright?  And now it's my son's!  And he better take care of it and not lose it or anything!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww, Forty has a special toy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut it, girl!\" Fortis growled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinerva smiled softly.  \"I think it's sweet, Forty.  Now Leo has something special from his father to keep him company when you have to go back to the front lines.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis sighed.  \"Yeah, yeah.  No get out of here so I can get dressed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinerva left the room, wincing as Leo let out a loud cry.  \"Alright, alright, little man.  I'll get you changed, and then I'll take you to your momma.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinerva took Leo to the nursery, quickly changed his soiled nappy, and then carted him down to the dining room.  All the while, Leo held Mortimer the plush cat tightly in his little hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here, Momma,\" Minerva said to Eldonia, depositing Leo in his mother's arms, \"this little guy is anxious for his breakfast.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoo, and about time, too!  My chest is aching from him not having fed as much last night.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia quickly undid her bodice, and Leo latched onto a nipple hungrily.  Eldonia sighed in relief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let that be a lesson to you to not go too long between feedings,\" said Lady Athena.  \"What is that thing Leo's holding?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis just stepped in the room when he heard his grandmother's question.  He sighed and shook his head, just knowing that the ladies were all going to twitter and laugh about his gift.  He looked up at Eldonia and smiled broadly.  She looked lovely, sitting there with his son at her breast, like a portrait of a Madonna.  He couldn't wait to spend some alone time with her and reacquaint himself with her body for the short time that he was home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinerva smirked as Fortis entered the room, kissed their grandmother on her wrinkled cheek, and took his seat at the head of the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why, Fortis!\" Lady Athena exclaimed with a broad smile.  \"It's so good to see you again!  When did you get in?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Late last night, Grandma.  I had to meet my son, but it was so late, I merely went to sleep instead of waking everyone up to tell them I was home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, and he even slept with Leo snuggled up in his arms last night.  That's why he missed his late night feeding,\" said Minerva.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia looked over her beau hungrily.  She had missed Fortis greatly while he'd been gone.  \"I'm so glad you're home safe and sound, my lord,\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA footman laid a plate overflowing with breakfast foods in front of Fortis, who eagerly dug in.  \"I'm only here for a week,\" he said between mouthfuls of food.  \"The king wants me back to help finish off the Vladians, but we should be declaring victory within a month!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's good news!\" said Lady Athena.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, this plush cat,\" said Eldonia, \"where did it come from?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis's cheeks turned a bit red, and Minerva replied, \"It was Fortis's when he was a baby.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, that old thing?!\" said Lady Athena with a roll of her eyes.  \"Fortis carted that thing around with him everywhere!  Didn't give it up until he was five!  I had to restitch the sewing on that poor cat so many times....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww, how sweet!\" Eldonia gushed.  \"Leo has a piece of his heritage with him now to remind him of his father.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, well, he better not lose it or make a mess of it.  Ultimately, it's still mine,\" Fortis grumped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeo began to fuss, and Eldonia put a cloth on her shoulder before raising Leo and gently patting him on his back.  Leo waved his little hands in dismay.  His tummy felt uncomfortable and full.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, little guy, burp for Momma,\" Eldonia said quietly.</span></div></div>",

Sometimes he acted just as if he was four years old again... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe maids entered with pancakes and whipped cream, honey, strawberries, blueberries, blackberries and a whole host of other berries, picked fresh from the lord's orchards the day before. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fortis my darling...\" Athena began. She was about to ask how the king was faring under the war, when she was interrupted by a distant \"WHAM!!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone jumped! Fortis got to his feet and reached for a nearby sword...this being a Mountanian house, there were naturally swords in every room. Mostly for display-purposes, but they were kept razor sharp at all times...just in case. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey heard heavy footsteps coming down the corridor from the foyer and then two figures appeared at the doorway. Twin brothers Jupiter and Cannius! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What're YOU doin' here!?\" Fortis growled. \"You supposed to be out fighting!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are YOU doing here?\" Cannius snapped back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm on leave!\" Fortis retorted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well so are we! Hey granny!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAthena got up and hugged her two younger grandsons. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My darlings!\" she said, kissing them. \"Oooh! You're both a bit ripe, aren't you?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, we been riding since dawn, give us a break!\" said Jupiter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And some breakfast!\" said Cannius. \"We haven't eaten since yesterday afternoon!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis called the maids and they set up two new places at the table for the lord's brothers. They sat down and attacked the food. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Whoogah!\"</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's that, sweetheart?\" Eldonia whispered. She was feeding Leo a sort of milky porridge slurry. It was sweet and hot and semi-liquid, easy for a baby to digest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeo pointed at the two newcomers! He didn't know who these two were! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh hey, a baby!\" said Cannius, \"Hello little baby!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Oooogah!\"</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Son, you don't pay no attention to your ugly Uncle Cannius and you get back to your porridge!\" Fortis rumbled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"SON!?\" the two brothers blurted out! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey'd been away from home for so long that they'd quite lost touch with the rest of the family! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Forty...a tiger in the sack...\" said Jupiter. \"So, who's the mother?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am!\" said Eldonia. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Oh...Sorry Lady Eldonia...So...Is Forty good?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jupiter!...Yes...\" she said, blushing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis smirked. \"I'm always good...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh please!\" said Minerva, \"Can we talk about something a BIT more pleasant?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah!\" said Cannius, \"What's your name, little fellah?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's called Leonardo Fortis Vanderstorm!\" said Minerva proudly, \"Leo, this is your Uncle Cannius...and this is your Uncle Jupiter!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hah!\" said Jupiter, \"Get that, Canny? UNCLES! Hah! Cool! Hey, we should make him stuff, I know, I could make him his first sword...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sword!? You couldn't make a SPATULA!\" Fortis roared, \"And I've seen you TRY!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe table erupted with laughter! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That heat-weld on the handle was useless! I remember Mrs Tibbs trying to use it to fry eggs! I don't know how you made that thing, but it snapped in half from the heat! Don'tcha know how to quench your stuff so it doesn't go brittle?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJupiter blushed. Metalwork was never his strong suite. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...Well...I could make him toys!\" said Jupiter, \"I can make stuff outta wood!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like what, a walking-stick?\" Cannius teased. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can SO make more stuff than that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, blocks can't be THAT hard to build...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis and Cannius laughed.

He was only half-dressed in a pair of leggings and sandals, but that wasn't going to stop him! He reached up for one of two swords hanging on a rack above the fireplace in the dining-room, and charged into the kitchen! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe kitchen at Castle Vanderstorm was behind the dining-room and down a short corridor. It had three entrances: Two into the dining-rooms and living-rooms, and one into the back yard and kitchen garden. Fortis burst into the kitchen to see the housemaids, housekeeper and cook terrified at the sight of four Vladian mercenaries! The back door was busted off its hinges! The men looked to be in terrible condition! Fortis had no doubts that they were Vladian deserters who were on the run, and searching for food! They probably figured that the menfolk in this household were away at war!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING IN MY HOUSE!?\" Fortis roared, so loudly that in the background, he could hear Leonardo burst into tears! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe terrified girls hurried behind their gigantic master! Fortis shoved them roughly away and through the doors into the servants' passage, and held his sword out front. The four men were all heavily-built, beefy soldiers, all about six or seven feet tall, but the sight of Fortis struck an unnamed terror into their hearts! They tried to run out the back door! With one hand, Fortis grabbed the heavy kitchen table and shoved it across the floor! It slammed against the back wall with a CRASH!, cutting off their retreat! Fortis swung his sword down and the four men drew out their own swords! The clash of steel on steel radiated out from the kitchen! The swing-doors leading into it slowly opened as pairs of eyes peeked in to watch the show. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis didn't have a dagger with him, like he usually did, so he was a bit limited, but as he passed a knife-block, he pulled out the largest of the blades he could find! Swing! Thrust! Parry! Block! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoft gasps and squeals emanated from behind Fortis as his sword plunged into flesh! A crunchy, squishy, squelchy sound! The sword...all eight feet of it, was drawn out again, drenched in blood! The remaining three Vladians stared in horror and scarpered! Fortis grabbed the last, impaled man and hurled him out the door with the rest! Not caring about his horrendous injury, the man sprinted off with the rest of his cronies! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe kitchen door opened and the maids and servants hurried back in! They swarmed around Fortis! Their lord and master! Their big, hunky protector! Fortis chuckled. He wrapped a thick arm around the shoulders of Mrs. Tibbs, the housekeeper. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This isn't gonna delay lunch is it, Tibby?\" he asked, his old baby-name for the aging servant. She laughed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooh you!\" she said, chuckling, \"Not at all, my lord! And we thank you for coming so swiftly to our aid!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We could'a held them off!\" said one of the feistier maids! \"This is a KITCHEN! We got knives everywhere!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be so, Eliza!\" Mrs. Tibbs scowled, \"You should be thankful his lordship is here to serve those who serve him!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh we are!\" said another girl, wrapping herself around Fortis's waist. She looked up at him with big, wet, puppy-eyes. Fortis chuckled. He stood proudly in the middle of the kitchen with the sword-point resting on the ground...blood still dripping off the edge! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, the girls began righting the kitchen, stacking up all the pots and pans that had fallen over earlier. With even greater ease than earlier, Fortis pulled the heavy kitchen table away from the doorframe and set it back to rights in the middle of the room. </span></div></div>",

Fortis smiled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooooh! Thank you my lord!\" said Mrs Tibbs, the housekeeper. She was an old, short, stout woman, even older than Granny Athena. She had served the Vanderstorm household since she was a child, and had watched Fortis grow up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n...and up... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n...and up...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...and up!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe hugged him and Fortis hugged her gently back...or as gently as he thought he was, at least.

See that he doesn't get into any mischief and that he plays nice, hmm? Like a good boy?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure sweetheart\", said Fortis. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was TALKING to Leonardo!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinerva laughed! \"Oh Eldonia! Don't TEASE him so! Come on! Or the shops will be closed!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis smiled. He scooped up his son in his huge arms and carried him upstairs. He spotted Mortimer his plush-cat pinned to a clothes-horse in the front hall. Leonardo reached out hungrily for the toy!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah-ah-ah!\" said Fortis, \"He's all wet still, son! Gotta wait, huh?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeo sighed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Patience son...\" Fortis crooned. He remembered when HE was a child and HE wanted to play with Mortimer! Mother had said he wasn't ready to play with. Forty would find a way! He would warm up kitty so he would dry faster and so he could play with him!...Unfortunately, Fortis's idea of warming kitty was holding him over a candle...ever since, Mortimer had been a cat without a tail. Athena had refused to sew a new one back on, to teach her grandson the virtue of patience. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis carried Leo into the library and searched the books. He pulled down a battered old tome of children's stories and sat down in front of the fireplace with his son in his lap. Fortis opened the book and flipped through the pages. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay...How's about poppy reads to you, huh son? You like that? How about...Sir Vladamir and the Lava Spewer?...No? Or...The Little Shoemaker?...No? What about the Blacksmith and the Talking Anvil?...Hey careful!...Oooh you want this one, huh?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeo wasn't particularly interested in the stories! He was slapping the paper because he liked the pretty printing on the pages! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Story of the Luck Dragon\", Fortis read. He flipped to the page and propped Leo up in his lap. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here we are...Once upon a time, there was a very poor Mountain family. A mommy...a pappy...a granny...and their little baby! See? There's baby, just like you!...And they were very scared because the mean landlord was gonna throw them off his land because they had no food to pay taxes! But the weather was very bad and the harvests had been poor! And the little Mountain Family only had enough food for themselves and couldn't pay taxes! Very scared, they packed everything up and ran away to the big city!...see? Here they are...and here's the big city far, far, far away!...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeo leaned close to look at the pretty pictures! He slapped the paper excitedly. Fortis smiled and hugged his son. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...As they went, the snow got very bad and they were so cold! So they built a fire using ten big stones to make a fire-ring, and then they burnt some wood to keep them warm in a cave. They fell asleep around the fire and when they woke up, the baby was gone!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeo burst into tears! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis laughed. \"Oooooh! And then...and then the granny saw that there were only nine stones around the fire! One of them was gone! She saw that the stone had broken apart into little pieces! The family followed scruffy scratchy marks on the cave floor and out into the snow. They found baby sleeping in the snow. And wrapped around it was a shiny red and gold baby dragon that was blowing fire on the baby to keep him warm and snuggly! Without the dragon, the baby would've frozen to death! So the family kept the dragon to bring them good luck! And that is why they're called Luck Dragons!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis hugged his son. \"And Luck Dragons are VERY very rare! Their eggs are stored in big scary volcanoes that are very hard to get to! It's very dangerous! Papa wishes he could give you a luck dragon as a present but they're very hard to find!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeo looked sad! He wanted the cuddly baby dragon! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis laughed. He wrapped his son back in his baby blankie and left the room, returning the baby its crib. By the time he'd come back, Fortis realised that the library was not empty! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKneeling in front of the fireplace was a girl dressed in a maid's outfit. Just from her size, Fortis could see that she was quite young...and cute... Fortis approached the girl and then sat down in his chair, putting his feet up and relaxing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl shrieked! She dropped the tinder and flint and whirled around! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! I...I...I...I beg your...your pardon my...my...my...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis rose slowly to his feet and approached the girl. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is my LORD...girl...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My lord...\" she said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm. You are new here\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, my lord!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your name?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Emma, my lord...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma curtsied. She had beautiful light brown hair and blue eyes. She looked scarcely ten years old! A mite of a girl! Fortis frowned. Emma's feet shifted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is something wrong?\" Fortis asked. He moved closer. He TOWERED over her! Sitting down, Fortis hadn't realised QUITE how short she was! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I...no-n-no!\" she said quickly! She couldn't help but stare at this attractive, adonesque figure before her... A tall, strapping, young, handsome member of the military elite...Oh her parents would be SO happy if one day, she could marry someone like this! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then what are you staring at!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-no-nothing!\" she said quickly! She averted her eyes from his...family-package deal...and raised them just a few inches to ogle at something else... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You been here long?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-no sir! O-only a...n-nearly t-two weeks, sir!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis nodded. \"Enjoying your work? How has your time been, hmm?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...l-long!...Hard!...GOOD!\" she stammered! Trying to get the proper words out! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Long, hard and good, eh? I could do that...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"MY LORD!\" Emma gasped! She'd HEARD stories of...well...lecherous young noblemen...but...wow! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis roared with laughter! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Reeeelax, girl!\" he said, chuckling. \"You're a kid! I ain't interested in that! Youse just a couple o' years younger than mah girl Minnie...And I don't touch a hair on her head...'ceptin' when I wanna look after her, 'tis...Why, what's you heard, huh?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I...well...the girls...t-told me...s-stories...about...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-you...and...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothin' bad, I hope...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no! Oh no my lord! Only that...well...um...you were...um...are...um...'experienced'...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've racked up a few hours...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My lord, I am only a child! I am whole and unbroken...I know nothing of...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis smirked. \"Relax! Why're you so TENSE!? I'm not gonna do ANYTHING! Don't forget girl that you are working in the household of a VERY old knightly family...and a knight is sworn to protect innocents and womenfolk...like you...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma blushed! She guessed that WAS true...and she HAD seen how Fortis fought off those intruders earlier! She guessed she was wrong to jump to such assumptions about her new master! He seemed genuinely charming and heroic! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't hold back on the girls of the house\", Fortis said. \"They'll do what they'll do. But NEVER would I force them to do a thing against their will...for one thing, my sister would never look me straight ever again. I was only joking! You don't have to worry. Now continue with your work\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma knelt and resumed building and lighting the fire. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So why is it you're HERE, anyway?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Father is dead. Mother said I should find work. She said the house here was good. With Lady Athena living here, there was a low-level vacancy for a housemaid...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I see...The old 'she-gets-promoted, so-let's-all-move-up-a-broom' thing...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...yes!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis got up just as Emma finished. She turned to leave. Fortis blocked her, pressing a hand against the mantle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want the girls in this house to feel safe and protected\", Fortis said in a surprisingly soft voice! \"So if you ever got any problems...You come tell Lord Fortis, you understand?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma nodded! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good...\" <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She headed upstairs, deposited her purchases in her bedroom and headed down the corridor to find her grandmother and ask about sewing supplies. She was passing the library when something out of the corner of her eye caught her attention! She spun around, caught the doorframe and whipped her head around! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fortis!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis smiled and turned casually around. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hah! Hey girl! Just uh, getting better acquainted with the latest addition to our household servantry...and a VERY fine addition too...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fortis Vanderstorm you should be ashamed of yourself!\" said Minerva, \"You've only just met! This is Emma. Ever since grandmother moved in, we've needed extra help, and Mrs. Tibbs agreed to be nursemaid if she got an extra pair of hands around the house\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mrs Tibbs is the Housekeeper.

And I bet you wouldn't be, even if there was a war to fight!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YOU!...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"DON'T YOU DARE!\" Minerva barked back! \"At any rate, Eldonia can't be looking after the child on her own! She has other details to handle at present, or did you forget that, too?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis seethed! He let out what sounded like a harsh, grudging rumble of resignation. His massive shoulders lowered slightly. Minerva could see that Emma was alarmed by Fortis's sudden temper and show of force! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh away with you!\" said Minerva, staring at her brother. \"Go and polish your pocketknives or something!...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis rumbled off.

Really you mustn't! He's no harm really. He's just...well...a man! And they are SO difficult...Especially when they're like him\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well they always think they're right! Showin' off...Now you mustn't be scared or intimidated! Fortis is nothin' but a big kitty! He'll not harm a hair on your head, that I can promise you. And if he does, which isn't likely, you come and tell me and I'll set it right!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma nodded! She was a bit scared, working for a giant like Fortis!

What news?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lord Vanderstorm has returned, your Majesty\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah. The capable Lord Vanderstorm...Very good. Send him in\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your Majesty\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man bowed and left the tent. King Leviathan sat in his folding chair. The war had moved swiftly. His armies had trapped the Vladians in a number of passes and canyons and had driven them back and surrounded them. Their retreat had been cut off behind them by merging Mountanian forces, and soon, the armies of strength would crush them utterly, closing in on four sides to grind them into dust! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sir\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeviathan stood up and smiled at the young, powerfully-built warlord. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My lord. I trust you have enjoyed your short sabbatical?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes sir\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your son, is he a fine young man?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He is eager and spirited, my lord.

Remember that you fight for your son and your family, my lord. And remember that a wife is faithful to a husband of whom faith is worth\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...uh...what?\" Fortis mumbled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you show her love and protection, respect, adoration, security and warmth, if you are an able performer of the necessities of marriage...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh-huuuuuuh...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe king chuckled. \"...She will desire your touch above all others and will remain close. Remember that men and women together have needs and that if they are jointly satisfied, a marriage will remain\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I can satisfy her, don't worry about that...\" said Fortis smugly. The king laughed! \"Good! Then she's bound to provide you many healthy children! What is the boy's name?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Leonardo, my liege\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, a healthy name. Strong, determined, powerful! A fine name for the son of a Mountanian lord\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes sir. Thank you, sir\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, to business...Tomorrow begins the final push. The Vladians are trapped here...they are as stubborn as they are stupid. If they had any brains at all, they would've retreated long ago, instead of getting themselves jammed and bottle-necked in here...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe king gestured on his map, to a number of valleys and gullies with high ridges on either side. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The main force is located here...We are located here in the north, here in the south, and here on either side. I will be leading the main charge up from the south tomorrow. What forces of theirs don't turn to engage us will flee north, as their routes are cut off on the East and West. I want you and your officers and men to see to it that this passage here...is cut off. Ambush them, confront them, attack them, do whatever you have to do. But this is where it ENDS and they will NOT pass out!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure they'll pass out. Once they see ME!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe king smirked. \"I'm sure they will. But remember. You must not go until I have made my move. We are to hit them, one after the other in close succession for the fullest effect! Once we have laid in on them, the two sides will come down here and here...they will be completely trapped with no escape!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes sir\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well.

I thought you said they'd turn?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh they'll turn alright! That's the main force there! Just keep watching them! Look! There's the king's archers and lancers! They're opening up with the trebuchets and the catapaults! They're coming! They're coming! Get ready!...Alright MOVE!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ground thundered and rumbled and dust rose as hundreds of thousands of men charged down the valley to clash with the Vladians! At the same time, the two flanking armies charged down from the ridges, surrounding the Vladians on all sides!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright!\" said Fortis, drawing out his sword and dismounting from his horse. His friend Damascus was nearby. \"Let's have some fun, man!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two towering knights lumbered into battle. Their heavy, solid armour being too strong for the Vladians to pierce, the two Mountanian warriors harvested their way through a sea of the enemy, slashing and slicing, smashing and carving! Cheap Vladian armour split open like aluminium cans, blood ran everywhere! Fortis harpooned every Vladian he came across, and then hacked them to pieces with his dagger! The ground was soon soggy with sweat, blood and tears! Fortis could feel his blood pumping, his heart pounding, his body sweating! He could even feel and uncomfortable tightness in his groin!...Yeah, warfare tended to do that to him...Suddenly, he felt something hit him in the back! Something cold and sharp! Something warm! He gasped and staggered to his knees! He could feel something in his back! He could feel warmth and heat! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA roar! Fortis gasped as he felt something lift him into the air! The idea that such an action was even possible was beyond Fortis! But it wasn't like it was an easy lift; Fortis could tell that the person was struggling! He gasped and then blacked out... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n--- --- --- --- <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is he alright?\" <br>\r\n\"I dunno! He conked out once I dragged him off...\" <br>\r\n\"Did you get it out?\" <br>\r\n\"Yeah it's out! But that wound's gonna take some time to heal. I cleaned it best I could...but it might take a while...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis groaned and slowly opened his eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's awake!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uugh! Of course I'm fucking awake you pansy bastards...\" Fortis groaned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Warfare hath mellowed our lordship's temperment...\" someone said. Voices laughed! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis gasped and groaned. With frustrating lethargy, faces swam into view before him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAround him were most of his men. And his friend Damascus, and nearby, the surgeon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-what happened?\" Fortis groaned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You were speared in the back by a Vladian lance\", the surgeon explained. \"Fortunately the lance broke before it could be driven in far enough to cause serious damage. I have removed it, staunched the bleeding, cleaned and dressed the wound and stitched it up. There shouldn't be any lasting damage. A young man such as yourself should make a full recovery. But there may be a scar there\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Scar?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"About three or four inches long, below your left shoulder...ah! Don't move! I don't want those stitches popping out!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A scar...\" Fortis said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. There's no telling if it'll go away. It may, it may not\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cool. I can show it off to the kid when I get home...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, everyone spread apart as a figure entered the treatment tent. King Leviathan stood over the bed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My lord\", he said. \"You have fought valiantly against the enemy to protect your kingdom and its subjects. It is my honour to present you with this reward\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe king handed Fortis something in a smart wooden box. Fortis opened it. Inside was a red and yellow silk ribbon. At the top was a handsome gold mounting with two crossed, gold swords and a strong clasp-pin. Hanging off the bottom of the medal was another gold mounting, set with a huge red ruby and smaller diamonds around the outside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I present you with the King's Order of Valor, for services rendered in battle despite personal injury...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe king indicated the blood-red ruby in the middle, and the pure, sparkling diamonds around the outside. Fortis seemed a bit overwhelmed! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YEAH!\" someone shouted at the back of the crowd. Everyone laughed and clapped loudly! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Th-thank you your majesty...\" said Fortis. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have been rather out of it\", said the King. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've been unconscious for six hours!\" said Damascus. \"I don't think you remember much. You were groaning so much when the surgeon was digging that spear-point out of your shoulder, he gave you a sleeping draft to knock you out!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-spear-point?\" Fortis slurred. The surgeon held up a steel spear-point. The point had been cleaned, polished, and there was a chain threaded through the holes in the shaft which were supposed to attach to the spear-shaft. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A little souvenier\", said the surgeon, draping it over Fortis's mighty shoulders. Fortis picked up the spear-point with his right hand. \"Heh...cool!\" he said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now everyone out!\" said the surgeon, \"He needs to rest!...Here, my lord, drink this...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis gulped down another sleeping draft and was soon in a land of clouds and blue skies...</span></div></div>",

When he was assured that his faithful squire, Koviac wuild be following him, he started off away from the base hospital and on his journey home. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The baby must look a lot like you my lord!\" Koviac said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis nodded. \"Of course he does. And I want to try and bring him home something special from the war,\" Fortis said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A sword would make an excellent gift, my lord!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That'll be for when he's older, not now,\" Fortis said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two riders, master and student, had been on horseback for serval hours now, and truth be told, Koviac had only started talking to his mast out of sheer boredom. Although fortis was chatty and jovial enough with family and close friends, Koviac always trod a fine line with Fortis between being considered his friend and just being his squire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKoviac was just about to suggest another potential gift for the newborn mountain lord when Fortis's attention was captured by huge amounts of smoke pouring from a distant mountain-range...</span></div></div>",

He defends the weak and enfeebled, he is generous and kind, he is friendly, he has a loving disposition, he knows a great deal about...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Koviac never got a chance to expound on Fortis's vast stores of knowledge! Because at that precise moment, Fortis had disappeared! The young squire stared around and saw his master's broad shoulders vanishing off across a field. In the far distance, Koviac could see a large mountain range. Smoke curled and wafted up from between some of the peaks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was the intense volcanic activity around Mountania that gave it the precious metals, stones, and vast mountain-ranges for which the northern kingdom was famous for. And right now, Fortis was charging off towards one of these massive volcanoes as fast as his horse could take him! Koviac knew better than to try and stop his master, and instead, charged off after him to see if he could help! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mountain looked just like Fortis. Towering, hulking, dangerous, alluring, mysterious, attractive and begging for someone to climb into its embrace. And Fortis was too much of a daredevil to resist. He'd heard stories about Mountanian volcanoes and the treasures that were supposed to lie within their fiery cores, treasures that only the bravest and most daring of Mountain men, and sometimes, spunky Mountain women, would be able to retrieve. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce they'd reached the top of the volcano, Fortis had stripped to his undershorts! The heat was intense! Steam and smoke wafted up in thick, heavy clouds, and far below, a semi-solid crust of cooled magma opened crevices where lava bubbled out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I always wanted to see one of these!\" Fortis shouted over the sound of the volcano. \"Father never allowed me to come! Man is this COOL or WHAT?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKoviac didn't care! He was too scared! Fortis scanned the volcano, shaking his head in awe and grinning like a schoolboy. This was AWESOME! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Fortis kept staring, he spotted something in the mouth of the volcano, perched on a ledge near the bottom of the crater. From this distance, it looked quite small, but was in fact about the size of a large watermelon, and roughly the same shape. It was also a bright, glittery golden colour. Fortis recognised it at once for what it was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKoviac saw his master's body tense. Something had obviously caught his attention. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Boy gimme the rope!\" Fortis said. Koviac shrugged several yards of rope from his shoulders and handed it to Fortis, who tied it to several more yards of rope coiled around his own upper body. Creating a noose-knot at one end, Fortis looped the rope around a suitable wedge of rock at the mouth of the volcano and tied the other end of the rope around his waist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My lord!\" said Koviac, when he realised the object of Fortis's mission, \"Are you entirely sure this is safe?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You stay here!\" Fortis yelled back, \"You keep an eye on that rope!\" he ordered. Fortis pulled something out of his pocket and handed it to Koviac. It was his whistle that he carried on him, just in case of emergencies. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If anything happens, you blow this to get my attention, okay?\" he shouted. Fortis had to shout because of the constant rumbling noises. Koviac nodded. He wasn't happy about this, but he knew he would not possibly be able to stop a giant like his master! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rope gripped in his powerful hands, Fortis began to abseil from ledge to ledge, down and down into the volcano, wearing only his shorts, his sandals and a large leather satchel-bag, slung around his shoulders. Koviac watched from above as Fortis leapt from rock to rock, pausing every now and then to prepare for the next jump, or to gather stuff from the inside of the volcano. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a long way down. By the time Fortis had reached the large golden thing, it had been nearly half an hour! Fortis wrapped the thing in a blanket taken from his bag and stuffed it inside. Then, he began the painstaking task of hauling himself out of the volcano. Steam rushed up, covering Fortis's body! When it had disappeared, Fortis appeared hot, wet and shiny, as if he'd just left a sauna! Repeated blasts of steam covered his body as he headed back up. By the time he'd reached the top again, Fortis was soaking wet from all the moisture! He looked like he'd just stepped out of a bathtub! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I forgot my soap!\" he shouted. Koviac laughed, and helped his master back onto the safety of the ledge. Fortis unwrapped the rope from around his waist and Koviac gathered it up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n--- --- --- --- <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it that you have there, my lord?\" Koviac asked as they headed back down the mountain a few minutes later. Fortis opened the bag and peeled back the blanket. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a...DON'T TOUCH IT! It's extremely hot!...This, young Kovi, is a very rare object, the egg of Draconis Felix\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Egg of what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Mountanian Luck Dragon. Whoever so finds an egg and rears the dragon from young will be granted good luck\", Fortis explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooooh...How?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...dunno, actually!\" said Fortis, laughing, \"These eggs are VERY hard to find! As you can probably see\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKoviac nodded. If they were housed in active volcanoes, no wonder they were rare! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Granny used to tell me about these when I was a kid. She'll know what it is. We'll show her when we get home!\" Fortis said. </span></div></div>",

She curled up and snuggled her bolster, wriggling around until she could get into a comfortable position. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Creak!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinerva ignored the sound and closed her eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Crreeaak!!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinerva opened her eyes. It was of course, pitch black inside her room.

Suddenly, she felt something wrap itself around her in a CRUSHING embrace! She felt a hand press over her face to stop her screaming! She struggled and fought, but her captor was FAR too strong! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shhhh! Shhh-shhh-shhh...\" a voice whispered. Minerva let out a muffled \"MMMMM!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eyes widened! A hand was touching her in some<i>very</i> special places! Then she felt hot breath on her face and a rough kiss on her cheek and an even tighter, bone-crushing embrace! And then, a deep, heavy bass chuckle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey girl\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>WHACK!</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Huurrrkk!!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinerva felt her captor let out a very unmanly whimper as she attacked HIS special area! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"THAT is for SCARING me!\" she hissed. Then, she rolled over and hugged him and gave him a kiss on the cheek. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And that's for coming home...\" she whispered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis chuckled. \"H-h-Hey girl...\" he gasped. \"Wow...You got strong huh...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinerva blushed. \"You want me to kiss the boo-boo better?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ye-...NO!! No! It's fine, it...it don't hurt so bad...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Liar...\" Minerva muttered. Fortis laughed and hugged his baby sister and gave her a kiss. Minerva rolled away and lit some candles. She smiled at him in the firelight. He was so charming. Then, Minerva noticed something around her brother's chest. It looked like a...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fortis what IS that!?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? Oh this? Just a Vladian spearpoint. The surgeon dug it out of my back about a month ago.

Can I borrow your...FORTY!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia raced into the room and jumped onto Minerva's bed and hugged him. Fortis chuckled and squeezed her back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey girl!\" he said. \"Muah! Love yah! I got presents back for all of you!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Presents!?\" said Minerva. \"Eldonia did you HEAR that!? He's back all this time and he doesn't give us presents!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia pretended to look EXTREMELY offended! She slapped him on the back in mock-scolding!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Naughty Forty!\" she teased, and the two girls giggled. Fortis chuckled. He opened his sack and reached inside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"These are for you both\", said Fortis. he handed the girls something wrapped in cloth pouches. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia looked at them and frowned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Pebbles?\" she asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pe...PEBBLES!?

Eldonia blushed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And this is something special for granny\", Fortis said. He picked up the wooden box with the handsome ruby and diamond gold medal of valour inside. The two girls squealed! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh she'll be so PROUD of you!\" said Minerva. \"Ooooh!\" she added, hugging her brother. She snatched the medal out of the box and held it over the candlelight. \"Oh it's so sparkly!\" she cooed, \"Eldonia isn't it pretty?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh it is!\" said Eldonia,\"Forty, you should pin it to your tunic...<i>at-our-wedding</i>...\" she added, punching out the last three words. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh!

The girls got out of bed to examine the round, egg-shaped golden orb that sat on the floor between them!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my!\" said Lady Athena.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's very pretty!\" said Minerva, kneeling down to get a closer look. \"um...what is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dunno for sure,\" said Fortis.

Sooner or later, Leonardo would take his father's current room, though, and Eldonia would move into the master bedroom with Fortis...after the wedding...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wedding...Fortis wondered what it would be like. There were some very old Mountanian wedding traditions, and he'd been to a few weddings in the past, mostly friends of his father's, or grandmother's. But his own wedding was rather daunting! He was just imagining what it would be like, when a muffled wailing wafted in on the air... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis groaned. The baby...He rolled out of bed, stood up, cracked his back, and shuffled sleepily out of the bedroom and down the corridor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, alright, I'm COMING!\" he groaned. As he shuffled along, his sister, grandmother, and girlfriend all exited their bedrooms. They filed into the nursery, just as Leo stopped crying. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeo's face was flushed and warm, slightly pink in colour, and his eyes were big and wet. He was leaning against his crib, and staring at something. Fortis turned. The baby was staring at the large brazier holding the golden dragon's egg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Somethin' wrong son?\" Fortis asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, there was a rustling sound! Ashes and partially burnt charcoal fell from the brazier into the ash-tray underneath, and the egg rocked and jostled around in the steel fire-basket! Leo wailed and cried! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's scared of the egg!\" said Eldonia, \"Oh Leo, honey-baby! There's nothing to be alarmed about! Oh here, look!\" she said. She picked up the baby and carried it over to the basket. Leo leaned over to stare at the brazier and its strange contents. The egg kept rocking and vibrating in the coals! Leo cried and covered his eyes! Suddenly, the egg cracked open!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Forty! Forty it's hatching!\" Minerva cried out, \"Oooh Forty look!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLady Athena bent over the egg and watched. \"Remarkable!\" she mused. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll at once, the cracks on the golden eggshell all met up, and the whole thing split open, lengthwise, from top to bottom! They flopped open and something small, red and golden flopped out, sizzling slightly on the coals... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a baby dragon!\" said Minerva, \"Oh granny it's all reddy and goldeny! Awww it's cute!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe baby dragon sneezed! A small fireball shot out of its nostrils!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeo was fascinated by the latest addition to his tiny domain! It was a baby lizard!...He wanted to play with the baby lizard!! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe luck dragon unfurled itself and stared around, its big eyes flitting from side to side as it took in its surroundings. It flapped tiny, underdeveloped wings and scittered across the flaming hot coals... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's rather..small...\" said Eldonia. The dragon was about the size of the baby she held in her arms! Perhaps even smaller!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It'll grow!\" said Athena. \"It'll grow a lot! Aah! Look to the baby, child! Before it burns itself!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia tightened her grip on Leo! He seemed ready to fall out of his mother's arms to examine this new creature! The dragon, too, seemed to be examining Leo. The dragon scittered up onto the rim of the brazier...then with a weak spring, it bounded onto Eldonia's arms! Eldonia screamed! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shhhh!!\" Lady Athena said, \"Not so loud, my dear! And you needn't be scared! He's not interested in YOU!...watch!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if she was cradling an incredibly poisonous spider, Eldonia barely dared to breathe! Instead, everyone watched what would happen... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragon crawled up Eldonia's arm and then wrapped itself around Leo's body! Leo giggled and snuggled the dragon. The dragon breathed fire on him! Eldonia reacted in shock!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's alright!\" said Lady Athena, \"They do that.They breathe fire on the baby to keep it warm and safe from the cold. Here, let me!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLady Athena scooped up her great-grandson and smiled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello Leo! Granny Athena's going to put you to bed now...In you go!...And in goes your new petty-pet!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone watched. Granny tucked Leo in, Leo curled up and laid down on his pillow. The dragon curled up on the blanket and shut its eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They'll be inseparable!\" Lady Athena declared. </span></div></div>",

He had not the impressive, bulky build of some Mountanians, but his demeanor was solid and strict. He had a mane of silver hair and a neatly trimmed beard and mustache. His face was fixed in a permanent frown. He was once tall, but age had withered his growth, and he was now only about 7'3\". He was in his fifties, but he looked much older. The product of a rough life. A long scar ran down one side of his face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know how very much this must be an inconvenience for you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Never mind...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your wife is not here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lady vonGevalt found herself unable to attend\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course...I quite understand\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You will explain to me, please, what I am doing here\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-well it's quite simple, really. My grandson and your daughter are to begin their wedding-arrangements\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLord vonGevalt grunted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And where are they?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, upstairs!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Show me\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLady Athena led the aging nobleman upstairs. She stopped outside a door and opened it a crack. Inside, the lord could see clearly the person who had enjoyed the most intimate attentions of his young and inexperienced daughter. He grunted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He at least seems a capable young man\", the old lord rumbled. \"He's how old?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nearly twenty-one\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lord raised his eyebrow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's um...He's...developed...for twenty one...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So everyone tells me. Of exceptional strength, size, intelligence...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And virility, it would seem\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...yes!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And where is this cause of their union?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The child!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! Yes of course!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis and Eldonia had been so busy with their own problems that they barely heard their parents. Lady Athena led Lord vonGevalt down the corridor to the nursery. Inside, Leo was playing with his luck-dragon, giggling at the pretty fireballs that kept spurting from his pet lizard's mouth!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm!\" said Lord vonGevalt, for the first time, registering something more than a modicum of approval, \"A luck dragon for the baby...Very hard to find...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yes!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...A capable lad, your grandson...Very capable...Very difficult to find...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLord vonGevalt rounded on the baby, who now realised that there was a stranger in his chamber! He sniffled and fidgeted, and seemed to hide behind his reptilian protector!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now my lad...\" said Lord vonGevalt, \"What is your name, hmm?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"His name is Leonardo Fortis Vanderstorm\", Athena said, proudly. Lord vonGevalt nodded. \"A nice and solid sounding name\", he said approvingly. \"And you know who I am, my lad? Hmm?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeo turned away! He didn't like this new person! He wanted granny! Why wasn't granny stopping this horrible man!? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeo felt himself hoisted into the air! He wasn't having ANY of this! He made a face, fidgeted and...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shhhhh!!\" the old lord mumbled, \"Shhh...It's alright...\" he cooed, stroking the sobbing, wailing baby! \"Grandpappy's here...It's alright...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo it wasn't! Leo's sobbing and sniffling escalated into outright crying! The nursery doors swung open as Leo's concerned parents burst in!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey gran'ma, what's going...on...\" Fortis said, stopping short when he saw Lord vonGevalt. He paused, stood tall, and then bowed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My lord\", he said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So this is the fruit of YOUR loins, is it?\" Lord vonGevalt asked. The sight of pappy and Mammy had calmed Leo down now, and he nestled securely in this new stranger's arms, staring at everyone with wide, wet, blue eyes...and sucking his thumb. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...Yeah!\" said Fortis, a bit uncertainly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And WHAT loins...\" Eldonia teased. She moved up to her father who held onto the baby with one arm and hugged her with the other. \"Papa! Papa please don't be angry!...You always said I should marry someone well-hung...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I said well-OFF!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Oh!...Well he's that too!...And just as much as the first...Oh papa don't be angry please! Forty's a lovely boy! He's ever so sweet and thoughtful. Look! He brought home a live dragon for the baby! And he's big and he's strong and he's SOOOO cute!...and that's just the dragon! I haven't started to talk to you about my Forty yet...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis watched as Eldonia steadily buttered up her aging father. Boy she knew how to work him! She was practically wrapping her ass around him, doing the big, butterfly-eyes, the sweet smile, the gentle, daughterly hugs... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLord vonGevalt cleared his throat loudly! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Harrehmmm!..ahem...Be there as it may...um...darling...This is a SERIOUS issue!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh of COURSE papa!\" said Eldonia, sweetly, \"And Forty and I ARE gonna get married! And we ARE gonna be wed! And we ARE gonna be a good momma and poppa to baby Leo!...and maybe a few other babies...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia gave her future husband a hungry look that her father wasn't able to see... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am in no position to grant you my permission for this union\", Lord vonGevalt said gruffly. \"But...I give you both my blessing. For a happy, prosperous, loving and affectionate marriage, strong, healthy and plentiful children, and a bright future together\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"THANK YOU PAPA!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLord vonGevalt felt the wind knocked out of him as his daughter locked her arms...and legs!...around him, squeezing him like a snake! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My lady!\" Lord vonGevalt, gasped, \"I...I think we h-have a w-wedding to plan! Eldonia NOT so tight, my dear! I'm not as young as I was...\" </span></div></div>",

Ooooooh man...Jupiter!! Write that down...honey...honey...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLady Athena tried to look cross and serious, but she let out a slow smile. She well-remembered her own wedding, all those years ago, to a man who sadly was no longer alive, who had made her life a whirling sensation...Aaah youth... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And we gotta have a fire-breather!\" <br>\r\n\"Ooooh yeah! Fire-breather...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Girls are NOT going to appreciate THAT at a Hen's Night!\" Athena called as she left the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What GIRLS? We're talking about the Buck's Party, gran'ma! Get with it!\" Jupiter called after her. He sighed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCannius wrote \"Fire...Breather...\" on a pair of growing lists on the table next to his bed. One for the Buck's Party, the other for the Hen's Night. Not ever having hosted one before, Minerva wasn't quite sure what to do! She had suggested something a little naughty and had considered hiring a stripper...Until Eldonia reminded her that Fortis was all the stripping she was ever gonna need!...and more!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn his bedroom, Fortis was more worried about the ceremony rather than fire-breathers or unclad maidens drenched in honey... He stood in front of the mirror, mumbling over his vows. He would of course be guided through them on the day, but still...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"With my sword I will protect, with my hands I will hold, with my body I will love, and with all mine worldly goods I thee endow...and then I...um...um...I...do the ring-thing...and uh...the aisle...uuh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Forty?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis JUMPED!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wouldn't think a 10ft Mountain giant like Fortis was easily startled or surprised by anything, but he jumped! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hammers and anvils! What the...Oh!...Oh sheeeeesh! Don't you DO THAT!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinerva tiptoed into her oldest brother's bedroom and smiled up at him. She whirled around on the spot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you think?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinerva was decked out in a dazzling white silk gown splashed with sky blue ribbons and trailers, and a beautiful pair of white shoes with silver buckles, polished so intensely that they nearly blinded Fortis when he looked at them! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Harrumph...um...You look...um...cute!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"CUTE????\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...purdy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinerva frowned!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Sweet?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Elegant!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah!...Um...that too!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinerva tittered forwards, hopped up on tiptoe and gave her brother a kiss...which he had to bend down to receive. As she peered behind him, she saw something. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is THIS what you're wearing?\" the little sister asked. Fortis turned to see. She was staring at his gleaming ceremonial body-armour and sword. Fortis nodded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You like?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where's your medal of valor, my lord?\" Minerva teased, \"Best put that around your chest!\" she said, caressing the well-developed body-area with a teasing hand. Fortis turned RED. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...y-y'think I should?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course! Eldonia will LOVE it!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis sighed and lifted the acolade out of its box and slung it over his head...it WAS pretty dashing...</span></div></div>",

Lady Athena wasn't going to have any more shame brought upon the noble and ancient House of Vanderstorm. She wafted between room to room. The girls were to stay inside, and the boys were to stay outside. She surveyed the scene of the Bucks Party from the balcony of the Master Bedroom. Flaming torches lit the yard, and a huge fire-pit served as a roasting-center for sausages, steaks, and huge, bloated hog-carcasses, a gift supplied by some far-off Fatlantean friends. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo doubt, the boys were all drinking and telling lewd, rude, crude jokes, and probably eating just as much as they were drinking, but at least the gathering looked civilised. Or as civilised as a gathering of young, horny mountain men could be... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDownstairs, Eldonia and her friends drank and ate, and chatted and gossiped about the boys. Who was still available, what was good about him, why he was worth even considering, and what did everyone think of her prize catch? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinerva wandered between the two parties, making appearances among the men and women, usually assisting guests or serving food or drinks, as their mutual host. She headed out into the garden, where the scents of beer, sweat, smoke and roasting meat hit her heavily in the face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey GIRL!\" Fortis bellowed, \"C'mere!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinerva trotted over. She smiled meekly and curtsied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, you trained her good, Forty...\" said one of the other boys. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis whirled around! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You said WHAT?\" he snarled. \"This is my SISTER! I ain't trainin' her to do squat! You be talkin' 'bout her like she some sorta clod-hopping pot-scraper again I'll break your NECK!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis's friend, Damascus, got shakily to his feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey...hey guys...We's all a bit pissed...Um...Tyson...I...think you oughta perhaps STOP altogether before you fall into that rose bush again...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe air was punctuated by loud bouts of laughter! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...So...so let's not try and um...say stuff or whatever that's gonna like...screw up...stuff...\" he finished, flopping back down into his chair, missing his aim and falling ass over heels on the grass with his folding chair collapsing on top of him! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Th...th...this...this here's...Girl...\" Fortis said drunkenly, to a new group of friends, \"Sh...she...She's m...m-my sis...sister and um...yeah she...um...she so sweeeeeheheheheheeeeeet!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis lifted his sister into the air and gave her a drunken kiss! Minerva was REPULSED! She loved all three of her brothers...but not when they were in drink! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"G'awn!\" Fortis slurred. He dropped her roughly to the ground and slapped her on the behind! \"Go hang with the girls, girl...\" he said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinerva sighed.

Eventually, she held it in place with a couple of decorative hat-pins and smiled at the results. She had a thin, white, silk wedding-gown, and her hair was brushed up into a bun, and braided at the back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very pretty, my dear!\" said Lady Athena. She helped her future granddaughter-in-law adjust her gown while Minerva left the room and tiptoed down the corridor. She peeked in on her two brothers, who were busy getting into their dress-armour for the occasion. She slipped open a bedroom door and snaked inside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding in front of a mirror in all of his military glory, the Earl of Castle Vanderstorm was busy checking himself out. His gleaming steel and brass ceremonial armour sparkled and gleamed in the sunlight from his window. He had his ceremonial sword strapped to his waist, his medal around his chest, and his helmet under one arm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do I look good?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinerva sidled up to her brother and smiled. \"Wonderful!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do I look um...nice?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very gallant and noble!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I meant SEXY!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinerva burst out laughing! \"Fortis, DO stop thinking about your little sword! At least until AFTER the wedding!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ain't nothin' little about it, girl! So, do I look good?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like a knight should!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn right!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis whipped back his long dark blond hair and smirked at the mirror. He exited the room. Minerva rushed downstairs to see the guests. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the dining-hall of the castle, were the assembled guests. Standing outside, was Lord vonGevalt. The old, lion-looking nobleman eyed his future daughter-in-law. She was a flighty young thing. She would make a man very happy one day... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAssembled in the dining-hall were friends, family, and visiting nobles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Minerva!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinerva jumped and spun around. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore her stood a vision of royal wonderment. The Crown Prince had answered her invitation! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrown Prince Cassius, first son of King Leviathan, stood in his own dress-armour, in a corner of the room. He was a vision of royal good looks. Minerva stared at him! Had he gotten even...TALLER?? And...wider?? and...Did he put on weight? He was certainly looking considerably more solid and...<i>hunky</i>...than the last time she saw him! She curtsied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My lord\", she said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe prince gave a courtly bow and extended a steel-sheathed arm. Minerva curtsied and he kissed her hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was CERTAINLY getting bigger! Those hands weren't that size the last time she touched them! And judging from the size of the codpiece, other things were growing, as well!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>WHAM! WHAM! WHAM!!!</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone jumped as the M.C., Fortis's friend, Damascus, slammed his rod against the floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"His Lordship, Fortis, Earl Vanderstorm. Lady Eldonia vonGevalt and her father, Lord vonGevalt...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone stood up. Up in the minstrel's gallery, music started playing... </span></div></div>",

Do you take this woman to be your lawfully wedded wife?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will you forever guard and protect her? Her body, her spirit, and her worldly honour?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will you forever love her, defend her, and provide for her needs?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And will you swear before these assembled peoples, that she shall, forever be, the sole recipient of your favours and affections?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhhhh...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiggles and laughter rippled throughout the hall. Lord vonGevalt silenced them with a frozen glare. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aaahrehm...yeah!\" said Fortis. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDraxon turned to Eldonia. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lady Eldonia Elizabeth vonGevalt. Do you take this man to be your lawfully wedded husband?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will you forever love and cherish him? Share with only him, your favours, affections and deepest desires?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooooh yeah...I...I mean yes!...I mean I will!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crowd laughed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will you honour and obey him as your husband, for as long as you both shall live?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia nodded. \"I will\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And do you swear to do your womanly duty, and sire him healthy children, to the best of your ability?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDraxon cleared his throat. He stepped aside. People could now see that he was actually standing in front of a cradle that was sitting on the table behind him. Curled up inside it, was baby Leonardo! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And do you both accept this child as being natural and the fruit of your loins? Will you hold him in legitimacy and honour this child, and forever raise and care for it as your own?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis gulped and Eldonia went a bit red... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We do...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You may kiss the bride!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia screamed and people cheered as Fortis literally swept her off her feet into his arms! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well hello there Lady Vanderstorm...\" he teased. Eldonia burst out laughing and the two of them embraced. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Flowers to symbolise delicacy, beauty and life, coins to represent industry, strength, wealth and prosperity. The pennies clattered onto the floor and everyone cheered! Fortis led his new bride away from the dining-hall into the huge gardens outside. Here, benches, tables, chairs and huge marquees had been set up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guard of Honour for the new Lord...and Lady...Vanderstorm!\" Damascus shouted out. All of Fortis's friends withdrew their swords and held them over their heads, forming a tunnel of steel that the young earl and his bride walked under. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Three cheers!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hip-hip!...Huzzah!...Huzzah!!...Huzzah!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bride and groom entered the central marquee and people filed in after them. Sitting on a low table was a towering, five-tier wedding cake! It was encased in white frosting and on the top, were two little models. A knight in shining armour, his sword between his legs, and a bride dressed in her glimmering white wedding-dress. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce everyone had gathered, old Draxon smiled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let us gather, friends and family, to witness the cutting of the cake!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone clapped and gathered around. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis stared at the table where the cake was standing in presentation. He frowned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...there's um...there's no knife...\" he said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Silly boy!\" Eldonia scolded! \"Of course there's no KNIFE!\" she said, \"THIS is all the knife WE need!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wrapped her arms delicately around her husband's waist, and tugged playfully at the ceremonial sword strapped to his side. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh!\" said Fortis, blushing. \"Right! Okay...um...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone gasped and a few people stepped back as Fortis drew out his enormous ceremonial sword. It was a fearsome blade, nearly five feet long and razor sharp! Fortis whirled it impressively over his head and the crowd \"Ooohed!\" and \"Aaaahed\" at the display. Fortis brought the sword whistling down, stopping an inch from the cake. He looked at his bride and Eldonia grabbed the handle of the sword. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis gave the briefest of nods and together, they thrust the blade in, and down, making the first cut! The crowd cheered!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis then withdrew the sword and, holding the blade to Eldonia's mouth, he waited as she nibbled off some of the cake-residue. Fortis then inserted the blade down his throat, closed his mouth, and slowly drew the sword out again, licking the whole thing clean! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He sure is a show-off, huh?\" <br>\r\n\"My lord!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinerva stared at Cassius. \"Well...Yes...!\" she said, blushing. She snuggled up against her Prince Charming, watching as the rest of the cake was sliced and then slowly dished out. It was a traditional Mountanian fruitcake. Heavy, stodgy food, that was drenched in pints of brandy for a week before the wedding. It was incredibly sweet and was floating in alcohol. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my!\" said Lady Athena, as Fortis handed his grandmother a quite considerable chunk of cake! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fortis! I can't possibly take the whole thing!!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's what she said...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"FORTIS!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry! Sorry...alright, I'll cut it in half...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinerva watched as her two other brothers, Cannius and Jupiter, chatted up the bridesmaids. Knowing her brothers, later on in the party, at least two bridesmaids might mysteriously disappear, to re-emerge later, shaken, shivering and with silly, puppy-dog looks on their faces... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis relaxed. He needed to sit down. Lady Athena handed Fortis baby Leonardo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey baby!\" said Fortis, teasing his baby son. Leo sat in papa's lap, watching Fortis wave something in front of him. It was the little model knight from the wedding-cake. Leo reached up for it with his chubby hands! Fortis handed the knight to his son, who stared at it curiously. It was a mini-papa! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeo sat on Papa's lap. Papa was hard and clankerly! Leo didn't like that! He wriggled off and went to find momma...Momma was soft and snugglesly... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the wedding feast had been finished, and the cake had disappeared, along with turkey, goose, venison, several bottles of wine and champagne, and just as much brandy and whiskey, the stuffed, inebriated guests swaggered and staggered indoors for the next part of the grand party. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Laaaadies and GENTLEMEN!\" Damascus shouted, \"Please re-enter the dining-hall for the evening's dancing!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone headed inside. The chairs from earlier had been cleared away to the sides of the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The first dance is for the men only!\" Damascus shouted. \"Will the groom and all the men in the audience willing to take part, proceed to the center of the hall! Everyone else, take a seat! Our first dance of the evening is the traditional Mountanian Sword Dance...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooooh!\" said Athena, \"Oh I remember seeing this at MY wedding! Oh I haven't seen it in YEARS!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it, granny?\" Minerva asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just watch, darling! Watch and pay attention...Look!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomewhere up above, a violin, cello and accordion started playing. The men had paired off in two long rows. In one movement, they'd all withdrawn their swords! They raised them up and struck them together, before breaking off, stepping back, spinning around, and striking swords again, breaking off, spinning, and striking yet again. It was half dance, half choreographed stage-fight. The crowd watched and gasped. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooh it's so elegant!\" said Minerva, watching. She hadn't thought her rough, tough, manly brother Fortis, was capable of being so...arty!...She would have to tease him about this later! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not an easy dance\", said Athena, \"It requires great strength and skill to wield a sword like that without injuring your partner. One wrong move...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe drew a bony finger over her throat and made a hoarse, choking sound. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinerva winced!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe music stopped as the men joined up into two lines again, sheathing their swords and bowing to each other. Everyone applauded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Next, we ask the bride and groom to dance...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis and Eldonia stepped onto the dance-floor. Fortis had removed his armour and was dressed just in hose, codpiece, shoes and...no shirt... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia still wore her glamorous wedding-dress. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite their height difference, the bride and groom joined hands. Fortis pulled something out of his trousers and held it in front of Eldonia. A gleaming dagger. He held it in his teeth and the music started. It was a tango. It started off slowly, as they moved around the dance floor, as the music sped up, Fortis became more aggressive. He spun, dipped and whirled Eldonia around with some quite vicious movements! The crowd gasped and sat, riveted to the scene before them.It was so raw and powerful and...quite sexy! As the dance reached its climax, Fortis pulled the knife from his teeth! He threw it at the floor where it hit the floorboards, sticking straight up in the wood! The duo danced the last few bars around it, before ending in a tight embrace, the knife between their feet. Everyone laughed and cheered! </span></div></div>",

The guests had all headed to their rooms, or to the village inn, to sleep off the effects of the party. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So tell me...\" said Fortis, holding his bride in his arms, \"How does it feel to be married?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia started stroking her husband's arms and chest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh it feels GOOD...\" she said, teasing, \"It feels hot and heavy and...mmmmmm...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis smiled and hugged her, pulling playfully on her hair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere would be no love-making this evening.

Minerva smiled and left the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia snuggled Leo. Leo snuggled his toy.

Even though he was not yet a year old, he was now able to crawl, a feat that pleased his father, thrilled his mother, and which worried his great-grandmother! (\"Crawling! Oh gosh he's going to be walking soon, and then I'll never catch him!\")<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeo loved this new skill, and used it all the time. Snuggled up in mama's arms, he wriggled out of her grasp...and then tried to wriggle out of the much more formidable grasp of his father! Leo crawled across the bed and off the end, onto the linen chest. Then with a soft 'fwump!' onto the carpeted floor below. Sunlight peeked in through the curtains and filled the room with a soft half-light. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeo crawled around the room. He sat in front of the wash-stand, the dressing-table, the closets...but then he saw something that really fascinated him! He crawled over to it excitedly! He sat in front of the object and ogled up at it. It was so big and shiny and pretty! Leo wanted to touch it and play with it! He reached out and slapped the object!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis tiny hand hit an invisible forcefield! He stared at it in shock! He kept slapping the strange, invisible barrier! Why couldn't he touch the big shiny thing?!? He sniffled and wrinkled his nose! Then, he started to cry! He wanted to play with the shiny thing and he couldn't! What started off as a sniffle moved onto lip-trembling, and then a soft, high-pitched wailing! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh!?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis groaned. He was used to being woken up by strange noises. A leftover trait from the battlefield. He groaned, yawned, stretched out his gigantic body and rolled over. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whuuuurrgghhh...wh-what...huurgh...ugh...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis stretched, and felt his bones cracking! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe rolled out of bed and stopped! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting in front of a tall, glass display-case was his baby son! Leo turned when he heard movement! Papa was up! Leo crawled to the case and started slapping on the glass panels again! He wanted to touch it! He wanted to touch it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, hey, hey!\" said Fortis softly, \"What're you doin', son? Whatcha lookin' at, huh?\" he asked. Fortis tiptoed out of bed and carefully pulled back one of the curtains. Sunlight sparkled into the room and Fortis smiled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooooh...You like it, huh?\" Fortis asked. Leo sat on the floor, pointing at the object in the case! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You wanna see it?\" Fortis asked. He walked over to the case and opened the doors. </span></div></div>",

Fortis lowered the blade to the ground and Leo crawled up to it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah! No touchy!\" said Fortis, \"Big knives aren't for little babies...But you can look at it\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeo did look at it! He started making faces at the swordblade, giggling when he saw his reflection in the steel. Fortis got down on the floor and showed his son the handle. Leo tried to grasp the massive handle with his tiny hands. Fortis let the sword drop to the floor and watched as Leo tried to push it, or lift it, or move it! He couldn't, of course, but it was a great source of amusement to his father that he tried. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis picked up his son and the sword and put the sword back in its case. Leo curled up in his father's arms and sucked on his thumb. Fortis chuckled and stroked the baby. He was so fucking CUTE! He kissed him and carried him out of the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis carried the baby back to the nursery and sat him in his crib. The New and Improved, Extra-Cuddly, Super-soft Mortimer the Plush Cat was waiting for the baby in the crib! The baby immediately snatched up the toy and hugged it adorably. Fortis chuckled. Granny had made it for him and it was so cute! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young nobleman left his son there and headed downstairs. He was so bored! He left the house and headed into the garden. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis had no real interest in gardening, but he liked playing with wood. Chopping wood, slicing wood, carving wood, hammering out stuff and building things...that was what he liked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis stared at some huge logs of firewood in the back yard. They needed splitting, and Fortis needed a workout. He headed into a storage-shed and came back with a sledgehammer, spikes, and a huge splitting-maul. The sledgehammer and the maul were huge, solid chunks of iron, each one with a weight of 500 pounds. They felt like nothing in the young beast's huge arms, but he was one of the few in the family who were able to wield such gigantic tools. Jupiter came close, but he soon tired out after just a few swings. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWHAM!! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe huge splitting-axe smashed into a particularly large log! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HUURGGHH!\" Fortis growled, ripping the axe out, heaving it over his head and slamming it down again! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nServant-girls in the kitchen watched through the windows as their handsome gigantic master started rending the log apart, his huge arms flying up and down, bashing the log to pieces! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Girls!\" said Mrs. Tibbs, the housekeeper, \"Away from that window now and back to your cooking! What's out there that's so interesting that it should distract you from your duties!?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The master's splitting firewood...\" said one of the girls in a dreamy tone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMrs. Tibbs let out a \"humph!\" of matronly disapproval and waved the girls back to their kitchen and cleaning duties. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Fortis released his strength on the firewood downstairs, upstairs, the rest of the family were waking up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinerva got out of her bed to find her maid, Penelope, smiling at her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mornin' ma'am\", she said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Morning Penny...What's that NOISE!?\" she gasped, hearing a distant, steady, muffled thumping sound. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooooh! His lordship's outside! He's splittin' firewood...\" said Penny in a dizzy, dreamy sort of voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Penny! You've seen him do that so many times! Get a grip on yourself!...Does he have his shirt off?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young maiden blushed and giggled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDown the corridor, Eldonia rose from her own bed. Her husband and son were gone and she headed to the windows to see the bright sunlight. Where did little Leo get off to now? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe left the bedroom and headed to the nursery. Leo was sitting in his crib. But he wasn't alone! </span></div></div>",

She smiled, and curtsied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's an excitable little fellow!\" said Merlin, chuckling. He watched the baby crawl around the room, chasing a bright yellow and red rubber ball. The ball bounced around and the baby chased after it! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope you don't mind, I brought him a toy\", said the boy wizard, pointing to the ball. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I think he likes it!\" said Eldonia. \"It's nice to meet you!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMerlin smiled and sat down on the floor. He waved his wand and watched the ball shoot across the room! Baby Leonardo let out a squeal of excitement and scampered after the ball like a puppy! Eldonia laughed! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh that's cute!\" she squealed, \"Oh it's adorable!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMerlin smiled. \"I just wanted to drop in and deliver that little gem\", he said. \"Good day!\" he said. He bowed, and vanished! </span></div></div>",

Minerva was sitting at the breakfast table. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Girl\", Fortis grunted. He lumbered past one of the housemaids, who bobbed and curtsied. Fortis helped himself to an obscene amount of food before sitting down at the head of the table. Minerva reached out and touched her brother's colossal left forearm. Fortis flexed and grinned roguishly at his sister who giggled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come along, honey-muffin!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia entered the dining-room, carrying baby Leonardo in her arms. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look sweetums!

Now you sit on my lap and I'll feed you yummy porridge! You want that with honey and cream? Hmm?

Fortis chuckled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Girl, you can't sit him in your lap like that!\" said Fortis, \"He can't hardly see over the table!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't have anywhere else to put him!

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Fortis headed upstairs and got dressed. It was surprisingly warm, so he didn't bother wearing much clothing. He put on his hose and his shoes and then simply strapped his swords and daggers onto his back using the cross-strapped leather harnesses. He threw a bright red cloak around his broad back and shoulders, buckling it across his vast chest with a handsome gold buckle...just in case he got cold! Unlikely, but just in case. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young lord headed downstairs and hitched up his horse, Vortex, to a small cart. He flicked the reins and trotted off into town. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe nearby village of Dynamos, just over the hill, had for a long time, been the property of the Vanderstorm family. They owned land everywhere around here. Dynamos was a bustling town. Not large, not small, but certainly active! Fortis headed into town and stared at all the industry going on. Carvers and carpenters, tinkers, smiths, blowers, weavers, butchers, bakers and candlestick makers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe watched as a burly glassblower spun a huge rod in his muscly arms, whirling a glob of molten glass around, the blazing red orb whistling through the air! Nearby, women and children watched on, entranced! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's easy!\" the man said. \"The force of the spinning stretches out the glass!\" he shouted. \"And it makes...Urgh!...Nice...long!...cylinders!...Like this!\" he said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe glazier stopped spinning to show a long, slender tube of glass. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then we break it off...crack it open, melt it down...and we have...what?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Plates!\" a girl said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WINDOWS!\" the man shouted back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone clapped and the glazier bowed. Fortis chuckled and drove on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis hopped off the cart in the square and led his horse to a drinking-trough to quench its thirst. Village maidens swarmed around their hunky young overlord...what a pity he was married! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning, my lord!\" said one of the girls, curtsying. Fortis let out a grin and she giggled! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Girls\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe assemble of femality giggled and squealed as he headed off down the street. What a GORGEOUS hunk! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis headed to the village sawmill. Here he saw burly workmen sawing, splitting and chopping wood and storing it under huge sheds to dry. Fortis selected some likely lengths of timber and had them carried out to the cart. He headed next to the blacksmith's down the way to pick up some nails and screws. He passed by a large warehouse along the way. Men were throwing sacks of flour out of a second-storey window into a cart parked below. Clouds of white puffing upwards with each descent. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Morning, Thor...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA burly young blacksmith slammed down his hammer on his anvil and smiled, shaking Fortis's hand with a not-inconsiderable paw of his own. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My lord\", he said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis smiled as he looked around the forge. \"I need nails\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes my lord!\" he said. \"Over here\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, a pretty maiden carrying a simple wooden tray with sandwiches on it, entered the forge. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thor! I made...Oh!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl gasped and nearly dropped the tray when she caught sight of the visitor in her midst. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning, Miss Sapphire\", Fortis rumbled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"m-m-morning, m-my lord!\" she said. She turned to her brother and slapped him on the arm, \"WHY didn't you tell me that His Lordship was here!?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He only just arrived! Is that smoked ham sandwiches with cheese that I spot...Ooooh...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My nails, please\", said Fortis. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I'll get them!\" said the maiden. She led the lord into the back room of the blacksmith's house to find the storage-barrels. She opened one and reached for a smaller box in which to put some nails. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My brother! He only thinks of his forge and his food!\" she said. \"Never about me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh now Miss Saphy, you're a very beautiful girl!\" said Fortis. \"And beauty like that is strong...Maybe he's too weak, eh?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perhaps! In the spine-department! You'd think he'd be able to pay more attention to his dutiful sister!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well perhaps you need something STRONGER?\" Fortis asked, stepping up behind her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My lord! You would not wish to compromise your position!\" she said. </span></div></div>",

He nodded. It was unusual in Mountanian society for a woman to hold herself in waiting for her husband. Such things didn't always matter, but to some couples, it was important. He smiled and patted her gently on the shoulder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks for the...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis was about to say \"thanks for the nails\", when someone rushed into the back room! It was a man covered in flour! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My lord!\" he cried out, clearly panicking, \"My lord! I beg of you! I beg you, come at once!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis turned, \"What's the matter?\" he asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"An accident, my lord! Old Cuppy!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Old Cuppy' was an old warehouse worker. He got his name because he always carried around a set of measuring-cups to dispense deliveries of flour. Fortis left the blacksmith's shop with the man and hurried into the town square. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside the village flour-barn, the huge warehouse where sacks of flour were stored after being ground up in the nearby watermill, there was a scene of complete pandemonium! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis grabbed the warehouse foreman, almost ripping his arm off! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell's going on here!?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Old Cuppy was hitching up the reins to the horses, my lord!\" the man gasped, \"It was a full load! He was removing the chocks from under the wagon-wheels when the spokes gave way!...YOU THERE! JUST CHUCK IT OFF! WE GOTTA LIGHTEN THE LOAD!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis pushed his way through the crowd. The fully-loaded goods-wagon had broken two of its wheels and it was resting completely on top of an old man who was lying face-down on the ground! He was gasping and wheezing for air! The weight of the cart was crushing him to death! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright move!\" said Fortis. He ripped off his cloak and his sword-belts and hurried forwards!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Out of the way! Out of the way! His lordship's comin' through!\"<br>\r\n\"Come here, Eliza! Don't get in the way! Stand here and watch!\"<br>\r\n\"You men, move aside! Quickly!\"<br>\r\n\"But his lordship can't lift it!\" <br>\r\n\"MOVE!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis hurried up to the cart and squatted down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright! I'm gonna move this thing! You guys over there, grab his arms and yank him out!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis gripped the cart under one side and with a heavy grunt, stood up! The cart creaked and groaned! Fortis heaved and snorted! People screamed as with a CRASH!! the entire cart was rolled over onto its side! Four men hurried in to grab the victim and carry him away! People cheered! Fortis panted, his mighty chest heaving up and down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe village doctor was roused from his house. He hurried out to examine his new patient. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really, Cups!\" he grumbled, \"How many times have I told you!? You're far too old to be working at the warehouse anymore!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"R-rubbish!\" the old man wheezed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold still...now let's see...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OWWW!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm...Oh dear...alright...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's the verdict, doc?\" Lord Vanderstorm asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm...How's this...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YEEEOUCH!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...I see\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doctor got up while four men stretchered Old Cuppy to his house down the street. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's in a rather bad shape, my lord...\" </span></div></div>",

And BIG! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm just here for my nails, and some screws\", he said firmly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've been waiting for a few nails and screws myself...\" she said. \"But they never show up...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sapphire, your brother wouldn't appreciate it if he knew what you were suggesting\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh he's so boring!

Why were all the good ones always taken!? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis returned home and headed into his workshop in the basement. He'd pinched a small table and chair from upstairs to serve as height references for his new high-chair that he was making for the baby. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young nobleman started measuring the chair and table, and the lengths of wood that he'd brought home. What good Mountanian male didn't carry around a good measuring-tape, after all? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sawed the wood to length, and hammered the nails into place, drilled holes, drove in screws, and gave everything a rough sanding with crushed-glass paper. After several hours' work, he sat the chair upright and smiled at his handiwork. He carried it upstairs and into the dining-room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Girl!\" he bellowed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinerva and Eldonia hurried in from the drawing-room down the corridor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fortis what are you...Oh!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinerva hurried to the chair, \"Oh it's darling!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sweetie you made a chair for the baby!\" Eldonia cried out. \"Oooh, look Minnie! Oh isn't our Forty a smart cookie?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where's the baby?\" Fortis asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Upstairs with his uncles, I think\", said Eldonia, \"I'll go get him\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe bounded up the stairs and into the nursery. Jupiter and Cannius were on their knees playing with Leonardo, throwing a ball around the room. The baby boy scampered after it on his hands and knees, giggling and laughing. She smiled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come here, Leo! Come to mama! Downstairs, papa's got a present for you!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooh a present!\" said Jupiter, hoisting his baby nephew into his arms, \"Didja hear that, Leo? A present! Let's go see what Momma has!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia giggled as her two brothers-in-law scooped up her son and whisked him downstairs! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeo was very interested in papa's present! Now he could sit in a chair like the big people and eat his food at his own little table! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now son!\" said Fortis. He dumped his son into the chair, \"You sit here and the table goes over like this...see? And you're all safe and happy!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeo shook the chair excitedly! It rocked and wobbled, but remained solidly on its four legs. He bounced up and down, the whole thing vibrating as he exerted his boundless energy on it! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia screamed when suddenly, the baby fell out of the chair! Leo slipped out under the fold-down table! Fortis grabbed him and held him in his arms! Leo burst into tears! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooooh there there sweetums!\" said Eldonia, holding her son, \"Fortis Vanderstorm! Our son is NOT sitting in that chair until you make some safety-improvements! Perhaps a security-bar between his legs so that he won't slip out from under the table again!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But Mountanian boys don't like things between their legs...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJupiter and Cannius burst out laughing and keeled over in uncontrollable sniggers. Eldonia fixed them with a frozen glare and stormed out of the room! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think it's a wonderful chair!\" said Minerva, kissing her brother on the arm...the highest place on his body she could reach...and hugged him. \"It just needs um...modifications!\" she said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He lifted the baby up and dumped him in the seat. Having Leo around did have its advantages! He could have instant feedback on his new creation. He watched as his baby son wriggled around in the seat. Fortis smiled. Attaboy! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the chair was done, Fortis painted it a bright red and blue. When he was done, he lifted his son up to have a closer look at it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like it, fellah?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Goooooh!!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehehehe...Now you be a good boy and sit here while papa tidies up\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeo sat on papa's workbench, staring at everything. All the tools...he watched as papa put away buckets of paint and brushes and all other kinds of things. Leo picked up something on the table. It was long and flat and rough. He banged it on the table and giggled at the loud noises! Fortis turned to see his son smacking one of his files on the table. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!\" Fortis said. He reached for it but Leo held it out of reach. He waved it at his father, giggling. Fortis laughed. He picked up another file and held it like a sword. Clink! Clink! Clink! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh boys!\" Eldonia sighed, when she came downstairs to see what all the noise was, \"You and your swordplay! Come on sweetheart, let's go upstairs! Let the paint dry on your new chair!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe scooped up her son and carried him upstairs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiled as she hugged him and tousled his hair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awww...Such a precious little poppydoodle!\" she said, kissing him. \"Such an adorable little angel!\" she said, stroking him.

Fortis laughed and hugged his wife roughly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What IS all this shouting about!?\" Lady Athena cried out, entering the nursery. \"You'll wake the baby!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No chance of that, gran'ma, the baby won't sleep without his toy!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean this?\" Athena asked, \"He drooled all over it! I was giving it a clean!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"PUSSEH!\" Leo cried out, wriggling desperately to grab hold of the object in granny's open hands! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, alright!\" said Fortis. \"Here's pussy! It's okay...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeo snatched the toy out of his grandmother's hands and hugged it so tight its head might pop off! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pusseh...\" he said softly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awww...Well now you two are going to have to watch your mouths now that he's picking up words!\" said Athena, \"Especially you, Fortis!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me!? Oh come ON, gran'ma!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe old woman glared at her gargantuan grandson with a look that could freeze fire. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...ahem...yes grandmother\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiled and kissed him. \"Good baby!\" she said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia giggled once the old woman left the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Fortis grunted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Baaaaaaby!\" she teased, giggling. </span></div></div>",

He dreamed of dragons and knights and baby kittens, of warriors and great battles! He wondered his little head about the people in his life about whom he knew so little... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeo yawned and wriggled in his sleep...Then he opened his eyes! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere was pussy? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeo wriggled around, and kicked off his blankets! He crawled around the small space of his crib and picked up the toy kitten. He hugged it fearfully and looked around him...It was so dark! The only light came from the fireplace, and the four candles burning around the top of his crib. Outside, the wind wailed and the firelight cast strange shadows everywhere! The little baby stared at everything in alarm! It was so dark! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat was hiding in the darkness??<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeo was a VANDERSTORM!...Vanderstorm babies didn't cry!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...but it WAS very dark...and the shadows were big and scary! He watched them, spinning and flitting around...A WITCH!...no...no that was just a moth...A SPIDER!...no...no just some smoke blowing out of the chimney...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeo sat up in bed, holding onto his kitty and gathering his blankets around him...he was so scared! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitties were fearless creatures! Kitties explored everything! If Leo had kitty, Leo would be safe... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, something moved! Leo heard it move! Something! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeo turned and tried to get to his feet. He pulled on the bars of the crib and managed to pull himself to an unsteady standing-position. He saw something outside in the window! Leo stared around the room. Everything was so dark! Why did it have to be darkness time now? Why couldn't it always be light-light-time? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeo wanted the people he saw! He wanted the pretty lady and the other one, and the old woman who gave him snuggles, and the big man who was making all those funny noises! Leo wanted someone! Leo...Leo...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeo collapsed into his cot and started to cry! He couldn't help it! He wanted someone to be with him and cuddle him and keep him safe from the darkness! He sniffled and wailed and sobbed and cried! He had a stranglehold on kitty! Nobody was going to take kitty away! Nobody was coming! Why wasn't anybody coming!? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Leo remembered the big man. He kept saying this strange sound that Leo didn't know! He kept saying it and Leo didn't know how to say it back!...Maybe if he said it now, the big man would come and scare away all the blackness! What was the sound? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeo cried as he tried to remember it! What WAS IT!? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was something like poppy...or...pappy or...Pa-Pa! Slowly, Leo tried to make the sounds in his mouth...He found that by pretending to spit, he could make the short 'peh' sound and by opening his mouth, he could make the other sound too! He practiced and stammered and then wailed! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"P...p...p...pa...papa!\" he sniffled. It wasn't loud enough! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"PAPA!\" he said even louder! He sobbed and wailed! It wasn't working! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"PAPA!!!\" he cried out, sobbing and crying, tears filling his eyes and spilling down his face! \"PAPAAAAA!!\" he screamed! He was screeching at the top of his little lungs! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"PAAPAA!!!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blackness was everywhere! Leo sniffled and kept crying and screaming! Suddenly, he heard a noise and squealed even louder! Then he saw a light moving! The light was chasing away blackness! He crawled towards the light and stared at it through the bars of his crib!</span></div></div>",

He got out of bed and lumbered over to his fireplace and threw some wood onto the burning logs and coals already in the grate. The room was already baking hot, and Fortis wanted to be sure that it stayed that way. He shuffled over to the windows and stared outside. He pressed a hand against the glass and winced! It was freezing! As he stood there, wondering and dreaming, he fancied he heard a noise somewhere...He frowned. What on earth...Nobody else was likely to be awake at this time of the night...Nobody except...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe baby! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis picked up a candelabrum from his bedside table, opened his bedroom doors and headed down the corridor to the nursery. He could hear the crying distinctly, now, together with a high-pitched wail of \"Papa!!!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis opened the nursery door and saw his son standing up in his crib, crying and screaming! He kicked the door shut behind him and lumbered over, and knelt down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, hey, hey!\" he said, \"Quitcher wailin',willyah? Grandma's next door tryin' to sleep!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Leo just kept crying!

All clean!\" he said. He put the baby back in the crib and piled on more wood. Then he bent down to pick up his candelabrum again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeo burst into tears! Why was papa going away again!? He didn't want papa to GO! He wanted papa to STAY! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis sighed. He lifted the baby into his arm. \"Alright, I guess you can sleep with me tonight\", he said. \"C'mon son\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis carried the fidgeting baby out of the nursery and into his own room. Leo liked papa's room! It was big and homey and had a lot of light from the fire! Leo reached out towards the fireplace as he entered his father's bedroom. Fortis smiled. \"You like the fire, huh son?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeo sat on his father's bed, gazing at the fire, just going \"oooooooooh!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis laughed. He got into bed and pulled his son in with him, wrapping him up and then encasing him in his huge arms. \"Alright son, now you sleep with pops and you promise to be quiet, okay?\" he said. Leo let out a soft googling noise and squeaked: \"Papa!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis gave his son a kiss and rolled over in bed. Leo snuggled down and dozed off... </span></div></div>",

He dozed off, sleepy and exhausted from crying and screaming. He shut his eyes and was soon asleep...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...and all too soon, awake again! Fortis jerked upwards, knocking his son over and waking him up when he heard a CRASH! of glass! This was followed soon after by a loud scream! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You sit there!\" said Fortis to the baby, even though he was sure the baby didn't understand such an order! He snatched up the candelabrum by the bed, lit it from the flames in the fireplace, and grabbed a sword that hung above the mantelpiece! Fortis threw his bedroom doors open and ran down the corridor! A door opened and Eldonia stuck her head out! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Forty!?\" she cried out, \"Forty what's going on!?\" she cried out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up!\" Fortis shouted. He skidded to a halt in front of Minerva's bedroom door and kicked it open! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinerva was sitting up in bed, shivering and terrified! Fortis and Eldonia hurried inside! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's the matter...\" Fortis began, but then he saw the smashed window. Outside, the storm wailed and howled! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One of the shutters broke off!\" said Penelope, Minerva's lady's maid, \"It swung around and smashed the window, my lord! It scared us out of our wits!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis put down the sword and candles and Eldonia stepped forward, but quickly retreated when she saw the glass on the floor! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't nobody move!\" said Fortis. \"Minnie, c'mere girl!...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinerva crawled off her bed and Fortis carried her over the glass. Her screams had woken up the whole top floor and her grandmother and two other brothers soon appeared at her doorway. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What on earth!?\" Lady Athena cried out, dressed in a nightgown. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just an accident with the storm, grandma, go back to bed!\" Fortis said, \"Minnie just had a scare, that's all...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My dear!\" said Athena, hugging her granddaughter, \"Oh you poor thing! Fortis! There's glass everywhere! She can't sleep here tonight! And not with that broken window!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She could sleep in my room!\" said Penelope. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Absolutely not!\" said Athena. She wouldn't hear of her granddaughter sleeping with a SERVANT! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She can sleep in my bed tonight, and I'll have a look at the window in the morning\", said Fortis. He brushed up the glass using a small broom and then drew the curtains across the broken window to try and keep out the rain. Fortis slung the sword and its scabbard over his back and lifted his sister in one arm and bent down to pick up the candelabrum in the other. That was when he noticed a sealed letter on the table with a familiar coat of arms on it. He picked it up and frowned. He turned it over. It read: \"To the Family Vanderstorm\" on the other side. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why didn't you tell me about this?\" Fortis asked as he carried Minerva out of the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" Minerva said, she was still in shock! She stared at the letter, \"Oh! I...I forgot!\" she said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis kicked his bedroom doors shut and laid his sister on his bed. He broke open the seal and sat down to read it. Baby Leo crawled over to his Aunt Minnie, who took him in her arms and stroked him gently. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh!\" said Fortis. \"Min you should've opened this the moment you got it!\" he said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What for?\" she asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's from Wolfgang...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wolfgang!?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You remember Cousin Wolfgang...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The last time I remember him, he broke my arm!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh come on, he was just playin'...He says...uh...Him and his missus are...being sent by the king's court to fulfill the post of...Ambassador...to the royal court of Fatlantis...in Regis City.

The house ain't ready yet!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll figure it out, a delay of a day isn't so much...\" Minerva yawned. Fortis grunted. \"Oh, and he says he's bringin' his kid along. I forgot his name...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Champion\", said Minerva. \"A rather pretentious name, if you ask me\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now Minnie...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well it is! I never understood this fascination with naming sons such...such...aspirational names! What if he doesn't live up to it?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, pops named me Fortis! I live up to it, don't I?\" He asked, he laid down next to his sister and smirked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you know what Fortis MEANS?\" she asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure I do. It's Latin for...somethin'...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's Latin for \"Strong\"\", Minerva informed him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I aaaam...\" said Fortis, flexing a massive bicep. Minerva sighed.

She stared up at the imposing giant before her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good evening, young man\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...yeah...um...uh...uhm...I um...yeah\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And THIS little one must be...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore anyone could stop him, Leo snatched Ursula's eyeglass away from her and started waving it around! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...the baby...\" she sighed. \"Naughty baby! You give Aunty Ursula back her glass!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeo refused! He tugged on the chain, gathered it in his hands and started waving the glass around. He caught it and peered mischeviously through the lens, back at its owner!...Then he burst into tears, cried and buried his face in his father's arms!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis chuckled, \"Cheeky little bugger...I'm sorry, Ursula, but he's always been rather curious...Son, you give back her eyeglass right now!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gnah!\" the baby pouted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Leo! You don't give it back, and papa won't play with you...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeo handed the glass back at once! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good boy!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUrsula hobbled upstairs into the nursery where a table was set up. She sat down and everyone sat down as well. The table was circular, with a red cloth on it, and chairs all around. She stooped down, and opened her bag, pulling out a handsome wrought iron stand, and a crystal ball that would sit on top of it. She sat it on the table and then opened up a small pouch. She sprinkled the contents of the pouch all over the ball and all around the base. She reached out, and as if under a spell, Leo crawled out of his father's arms and over to the ball. He sat down obediently and stared at the ball as if it was the most fascinating thing in the world! He rubbed the white powder and started putting some of it into his mouth...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Leo no!\" said Eldonia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's alright!\" the witch said, \"It's not going to do him any harm at all...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it? Powdered bones? Ashes? Ground-up arrowroot?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Actually it's sugar\", the witch said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sugar!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Something sweet to keep the baby's attention so he won't want to wander away. Now let us begin. I want you all to lean forwards. Rest your elbows on the table, and place at least one hand on the ball. Close your eyes and let your bodies relax. Now young Master Leonardo. Let's see your future, hmm?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe baby was now constantly touching the crystal ball, trying to get more and more of the sweet powdery stuff off it. The more he touched it, the more powerful the vision became, until it enveloped them all. At first, all they could see around them was a swirling blue mist...and then...the mist cleared in their minds' eyes...and a vision appeared before them... </span></div></div>",

He was tanned and impressively muscular. He had longish brown hair and, as he turned around, they could all see, a handsome, solid-looking face, with bright eyes. He had what looked like a small smirk on his face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young hunk looked around the room and then lumbered out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HEY GIRL! WHERE ARE YOU!?\" he shouted. The voice was strong, deep and powerful. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo answer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"GIRL! It's lunchtime!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe stud left the bedroom and jogged downstairs. He headed outside and strong sunlight flashed across his hair, revealing streaks of blond in the brown. The bulk and heft of his body created shadows on his muscles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"GIRL!\" the hunk roared, \"WHERE ARE YOU!?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDistant giggling floated along with the breeze, along with \"Rommie! Rommie stop!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe titanic teenager broke into a jog and ran around the estate. He burst around the corner and spotted two youngsters playing with wooden swords! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yah! Gotcha! En Garde!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No no no! No fair! I wasn't ready!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"GIRL! LUNCH TIME! NOW! ROMIE!! YOU TOO!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But we're playin'...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Granny says LUNCH! I been lookin' all over the house for you little pips now MOVE IT!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two youngsters sighed, downed their wooden playthings and trotted after him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn elderly woman tottered out of the back door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There you are!\" she cried out, \"I have been sending your brother ALL over the house looking for you! Lunch time, dearest! You too, Romeo!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But grandma!\" the younger boy said, \"I was gonna win!...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A blood nose!\" the girl retorted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Was NOT!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Was TOO! You can't block! All you do is step back and back and back! One day you'll hit a wall and then you'll be sorry! You should play more with Leo! He can show you how to do it! Huh Leo?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giant hunk grinned, \"Hey yeah...\" he said. \"C'mon girl, lunch...ROMEO ARE YOU COMING OR NOT!?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm comin' I'm comin'! Jeez! Will you stop beltin' like that for once!?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe scene changed to the dining room downstairs. Sitting around the table was a rough-looking giant with long, dark blond hair and nearby, a society beauty with her hair done up in long, soft silky braids. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Found them!\" the old woman creaked. \"Now Julie you sit down! Romeo you too!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Found 'em pops!\" said Leonardo, \"They was outside doin' swordplay\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you win, son?\" the older man asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Liar!\" the girl pouted. The woman laughed and hugged her baby girl. \"Oh you're so smart, sweetums!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl leaned over and hugged her mother. \"Love you momma...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeo sat down and started eating lunch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Leo yelled at us!\" Romeo grumbled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Son...\" said the older man. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was CALLING them!\" Leo defended himself. \"And Reo, don't chop up your meat like that!...Oh give it to me before you massacre it! The damn steak already died once, you don't have to kill it again!...Like THIS!...You're old enough to know how to cut your own meat...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl stuck out her tongue. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ju'let, you keep that in your mouth or later I ain't playin' with you...\" Leo warned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJuliet closed her mouth at once! The hunk smiled and hugged his baby sister, \"Sure I will sweetcakes\", he said, kissed her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n--- --- --- --- <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awwwww!\" said Lady Athena as the ball turned clear and the vision before them faded away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooh he's gonna be handsome!\" said Eldonia, squealing and scooping up her baby son, \"Yes you are my little fighter! You gonna be SOOOO cute! And you already ARE! So you gonna be adorable adorable adorable!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh jeez! Stop doin' that!\" said Fortis. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you gonna have a little bruddah and sister!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh he might not\", said old Ursula the witch, carefully packing up her crystal ball. \"That vision only shows what MIGHT happen. He may not have any siblings at all!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You questionin' mah skills in bed, Ursie?\" Fortis asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh tush!\" said the old witch, \"Thou vile Mountanians think of nothing else!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia laughed and hugged her big bad hubby.

WHERE ARE YOU?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe loud, gruff voice echoed through the stone corridors, making Minerva jump and shiver.  The dark-haired toddler in her arms burst into tears, and Minerva tried to soothe the child with hushes and soft words.  However, the voice kept yelling for her, and Minerva made her way out of the bright, cheery nursery into the dank, cold hallway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was several years older, probably in her late teens or early twenties.  She was several inches taller and appeared fully mature, though weariness and fear marred her lovely face instead of happiness and joy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There you are!  Where have you been?!  I've been hollerin' for you fer five minutes!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tall, imposing man with dark hair and a neat goatee stomped up to her.  He was at least ten feet tall and as ruggedly and hugely built as Minerva's brother Fortis.  However, this man was obviously much older, as gray decorated his sideburns and the hair at his temples.  Frown lines were cut deeply into his cheeks around his mouth.  His dark eyes were intense and scary as they glared at her.  He grabbed her upper arm roughly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aurelius!\" she hissed, struggling to keep hold of the still-screaming child in her arms.  \"Quiet down!  Please!  You're upsetting Nero!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAurelius gave a hoarse laugh and grabbed the child from her.  \"Ah, the child just needs to learn to not be frightened by loud noises!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe held the toddler up to his face and gave him a mocking, tooth-filled grimace.  The child just screamed harder, making Aurelius laugh again.  \"That's right, boy!  EVERYONE should be scared of your old man!  NO ONE crosses Lord Aurelius Vergallen!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinerva beat her small fist on his bulging bicep.  \"Aurelius!  Stop it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAurelius snarled at her and pushed her away, making her fall to the floor in a heap.  Minerva moaned as the fall aggravated the bruises she still had on her hands, arms, and thighs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You still haven't learned yer lesson, have ya, wife?\" Aurelius sneered, dumping the child on the frightened and cowering nursery maid and closing the door behind his still-sobbing son.  \"I woulda thought after four years, you'd have learned to still your tongue and watch yer manners!  Seems I still need to beat the fire outta ya!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinerva's eyes widened and she scuttled back a bit on the floor.  \"N-no, my lord!  Please!  I'll...I'll do anything!  Please, not again!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAurelius laughed harshly and hauled her up into his arms.  He crushed her tightly to him, his arms like unyielding bands of steel around her that made her attempts at squirming essentially nonexistent.  He walked quickly and firmly down the hallway to the master bedroom, Minerva pleading all the way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAurelius locked the door to his suite of rooms and plopped her on his enormous bed.  She tried to move away to the other side of the bed, but Aurelius merely grasped her ankle and hauled her back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, ah, ah!\" he said mockingly, waving a forefinger in front of her face.  \"You need to learn to take your punishment, my dear.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe settled his long, hard body on top of her to keep her from moving and grasped both of her wrists easily over her head with one of his large, calloused hands.  He then reached for the scarves he had tied to the bedposts and quickly tied her wrists to the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-n-not the scarves!  Please, Aurelius!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe slapped her cheek with a snarl!  \"WHAT DID YOU CALL ME?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinerva gasped at the stinging she felt on her face.  She even tasted a bit of blood in her mouth.  \"I...I mean...m-my lord!\" she whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right!  I'm your lord!  Your master!  You will learn to show me RESPECT!  ESPECIALLY IN FRONT OF MY SON!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinerva bit her lip to keep from saying anything more, knowing that whatever she said would probably just rile up her husband that much more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAurelius stood up from the bed and quickly removed his clothing, leering at his young wife all the while.  Minerva merely turned her head away, silent tears running down her cheeks.  When Aurelius was completely disrobed, he moved back onto the bed.  He took a bejeweled dagger from underneath one of his pillows and expertly sliced the expensive gown and undergarments from his wife's body....</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my!\" said Ursula, quickly ending the spell and pulling her startled fingers away from the crystal ball.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What...what was that?\" Minerva gasped, putting one hand over her heart and the other hand over her mouth.  \"Is that...really going to be my future?  Who WAS that man?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUrsula shook her head and pulled a black square of cloth from her pocket, laid it on top of the crystal ball, and then snatched the ball up and put it back in its felt-lined box.  \"As I told you before, my dear,\" Ursula said shakily, \"this is only a possible future for you.  It won't necessarily come true.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...But it could!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUrsula locked the box and turned back to her niece, sighing.  \"Yes.  It could.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUrsula took pity on the poor girl and led her over to a comfortable seat.  She held Minerva's hands gently in her own.  \"I can tell you what I do know, though, if that will help, Minnie.  The man you saw was Lord Aurelius Vergallen.  He lives in a large, but lonely castle in the northern-most part of Mountania and on the Vladian border.  Lord Vergallen has always had a reputation for being ruthless and unforgiving.  But I imagine he'd have to be to survive in such a rugged, harsh environment and having to deal with those murdering, nasty Vladians day in and day out.  He is currently in his late thirties, but he's never shown an interest in marrying before.  I suppose he'll eventually decide he needs an heir and therefore look for an appropriate bride.  A young, lovely girl like yourself he would probably consider biddable enough for what he would be looking for in a bride.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUrsula grimaced at her own reasoning and explanation.  She disliked the vision intensely and had no intention of letting Minerva be married off to such a mean, nasty Lord as Aurelius Vergallen, despite his vast wealth and resources!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinerva sat silently for a few minutes, processing everything she had just seen and heard.  She swallowed hard before looking into her aunt's kind, concerned face.  \"How could Fortis allow me to be married to someone like that?  And besides, what about Prince Cas....  Er...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinerva blushed at nearly revealing her crush on the Crown Prince.  She thought for certain the crystal ball would reveal a happy future as Prince Cassius's wife...not the wife of some awful, old Lord who would beat her and practically rape her!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUrsula chuckled and patted her niece's hand.  \"Have a wee bit of a crush on the Crown Prince, do we?  Well, I must say that Prince Cassius is a fine, upstanding young man.  Handsome, too!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinerva giggled.  \"Auntie Ursula!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSobering a bit and putting a hand on Minerva's cheek, Ursula gazed into Minerva's eyes.  \"Don't let what you saw in the ball frighten you, my dear!  The future is not set!  And if I have anything to say about it, I will make sure you are not married off to that awful Lord Vergallen!  The only thing I can figure for how that could even BE a possible future for you is if something happened to Fortis or your brothers, such that the Vanderstorm earldom became destitute and in need of coin.  I could easily see Lord Vergallen paying handsomely for a comely bride like yourself--enough to pull any struggling nobleman from dire straits into coffers overflowing with gold.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinerva shook her head.  \"I still can't see how Fortis, Cannius, or Jupiter would ever SELL me for a brideprice!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, as I said, don't let it worry you anymore!  I will personally speak to Fortis and inform him of what we saw.  I'll make sure that future never happens!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinerva threw her arms around her aunt's neck and gave her a tight hug.  \"Thanks, Auntie,\" she murmured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUrsula hugged her back.  \"My pleasure, my dear.  Now, dry your tears and go write a letter to your prince.  I'm sure that will make you feel better!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinerva drew back with a blush, but smiled at her aunt and nodded before leaving the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUrsula sighed and looked up at the ceiling in exhaustion.  \"Of course, the stupid ball would show her the WORST possible future she might slightly possibly have!  Silly, contrary thing!\"</span></div></div>",

But after three boys the size of you and your brothers...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis smirked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...It was probably to be expected\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis nodded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know you love your sister very much\", said Ursula. \"And you want make sure that she marries someone kind, sweet and loving, who can take care of her\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis nodded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUrsula reached into a pouch and pulled out two gold lockets. She handed them to Fortis. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"These are Attachment Lockets...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis examined them. \"Oh yeah...mother had one of these...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. They're to be shared between loved ones. They glow red hot whenever one of them is in trouble. You might hold onto one, and give one to your sister\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can't you do that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It has to be an exchange between the two parties. I can't interfere\", said Ursula. \"But also, if you want to safeguard Minerva's future, I see another person in her life who would make her extremely happy\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who?\" Fortis asked, suspiciously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well he's young, handsome, attractive, athletic...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean my friend Damascus?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NO! Crown Prince Cassius!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis frowned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If your sister saw more of the prince, they might fall in love. And if they marry, she would be forever bound to someone who would treasure her, and protect her!...to say nothing of giving your own family a big social boost...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis smirked. He liked the sound of that! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know you're very protective of your sister\", said Ursula. \"But don't deny her when she has found someone who can make her truly happy. Especially when preventing happiness could lead to such an uncertain and dangerous future\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis nodded at this advice. \"Alright, she can write to the prince and stuff...\" he said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUrsula smiled and left the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat evening after dinner... </span></div></div>",

You come back here right now!\" Mrs. Tibbs cried out, \"You're NOT to disturb the family during their meals!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Eliza was gone! Lord Vanderstorm was far from pleased about being disturbed during breakfast, but he followed the excitable young serving-wench back into the kitchen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mon, girl, I already did stuff, what else is there?\" he grumbled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But my lord!

Taking his sword, Fortis headed out into the yard. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside of the kitchen door was a large garden. This was where the house-servants could relax on their time off, but it was also the estate's vegetable garden. There were neat rows of carrots, bushes of cucumbers, onion, garlic, and long, green vines with fat, round tomatoes on them. There were bushes of mint, rosemary, basil and and all other manner of herbs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the other end of the garden was a neat patch of lawn, and hedges and bushes. Fortis approached the bushes and stared around. Then, he suddenly bent down...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YEEEK!!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis straightened up! He held some sort of shrieking, wriggling creature in his hands! It took him a couple of minutes to realise that it was a girl! She shrieked and wriggled around! Kicking and flailing her legs! Suddenly, the bushes parted and a filthy-looking boy stuck his head out! He waved something at Fortis! Fortis grabbed the boy's arm and twisted it violently! A small knife fell to the ground! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let go of my sister!\" the boy squeaked! Fortis stared at the two children! They couldn't be any older than about eight or nine years old! Fortis let go of the girl, who landed on the grass with a 'fwump!'. He drew out his sword and swung it around to face them! The two kids gulped! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What're you doing on my land!?\" Fortis barked. \"This is private property!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please sir!\" the boy said, grabbing his sister and pushing her back, so that he stood in front of her, \"We didn't mean anything! We got lost and!...and...It was those men! They captured us!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis could tell by the boy's accent that he was a native. He grunted dismissively. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" Fortis asked. \"And you're Mountanians aren't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes sir!\" said the girl. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then it's MY LORD\", Fortis corrected them. Their hands flew to their mouths! They'd never met a REAL Mountain Lord before! They'd heard stories, of course...but... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy dropped to his knees and the girl curtsied. Behind him, Fortis didn't notice the house-servants all crowding at the windows to see what was going on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I beg your pardon, my lord!\" the boy said, \"My sister and I were kidnapped by the Vladians when they ran away. They made us look after them! We didn't want to come here and we don't know how to go home! We meant thee no harm, my lord!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis sighed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You got any family?\" he asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy stared at the girl. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's my sister...that's it\", the boy said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's your name, boy?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perseus, my lord! And, and this is my sister Katie...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis nodded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose you don't have anywhere to go, huh?\" he asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two children shook their heads. Little Katie looked close to tears! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what are you, orphans?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerseus nodded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, there's an almshouse in the village\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We didn't want to come here!\" Perseus said. \"Those mean men made us! Please don't tell us to go away! We don't have anywhere to live!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis sighed. He turned around and stared across the yard at the castle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mrs. Tibbs!\" he called. \"Come here!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMrs. Tibbs shuffled across the garden, her heart melted when she saw the two waifs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is Percy and this is Katie. They'll be staying with us for a while\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMrs. Tibbs frowned. \"Percy doesn't sound very Mountanian\", she said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's Perseus!\" the boy said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awww!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you sort out some food and a bed or something? And uh...probably a BATH as well...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, Lord Vanderstorm!...Come along now, children!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis turned and headed back inside. Katie and Percy watched him go. He was so BIG! Percy was sure the gigantic Mountain lord could rip his arms off and shove them down his throat if he wanted to!...But he seemed so nice, too! Percy made a mental note that he and his sister would be as good as gold!...It wouldn't do to get on the wrong side of THIS man! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis passed through the kitchen and returned to the dining-room, briefly explaining to his sister, his grandmother and his wife what was going on. Minerva and Eldonia shared looks with each other. Despite his rough exterior, Fortis really was a soft little puppy...Awwwww!! </span></div></div>",

Come along inside and we'll see what we can whip up for you...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe kindly old housekeeper led the children inside and out of the garden. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How on earth did you end up here?\" she asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We ran away from our village when the Vladians came\", Katie said. \"Momma and papa went missing and we didn't know where they were. And then those big scary men found us! And they kidnapped us so that we would be their slaves!\" she said dramatically. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They wanted to hold us forever!\" Perseus added. \"And then they came here and they told us to wait outside. We were too scared to run away. And then when the giant man came, we hid in the bushes!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMrs. Tibbs chuckled and invited the children to sit down. She laid out plates and filled them with leftover sausages, bread, butter, bacon and other breakfast leftovers. The children didn't wait for cutlery, they started eating it all with their hands! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My goodness!\" she said. \"You two must be hungry!\" she said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We haven't eaten in nearly three days...\" Perseus said, blushing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh you poor things!\" said the old housekeeper, sitting down. \"Well you've nothing to fear about! You'll get plenty to eat around here!\" she said proudly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mrs. Tibbs\", Katie said, \"Who's the big scary man?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The big scary man?...Oh you mean his lordship! Why that's Fortis Vanderstorm! He's landlord of the county around here\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought lords were older!\" Katie said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Old Lord Vanderstorm died last year\", Mrs. Tibbs said. \"Master Fortis is his firstborn son! So he inherits the title and the estate!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's scary!\" Katie whispered. Mrs. Tibbs smiled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's not so terrible!\" she said. \"He's a very sweet young man! He's a bit...a bit rough...but he's got a heart of gold!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And a body of rock!\" Eliza said, entering the kitchen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eliza! Don't you be thinking such things of his lordship!\" Mrs. Tibbs chastised. \"And back to your cleaning, my girl!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I bet he's really mean!\" Katie whispered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no he's not!\" said Mrs. Tibbs, \"He's very sweet! You'll like him a lot once you get to know him better\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's got BIG arms!\" said Perseus. Like a lot of Mountanian boys, he dreamed of one day becoming a knight and a great warrior!...Unlikely...but it was a dream, nonetheless. Most Mountanian boys grew impressive musculature of their own from farming, mining, logging and other, labour-intensive industries for which the Mountanians were famous. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh he's very very strong!\" said Mrs. Tibbs. \"He's ten feet tall, you know. He has to be very strong!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ten feet!\" Perseus squeaked, \"Oh wow! Oh boy I wanna be THAT BIG!!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMrs. TIbbs laughed, \"You might be!

The two children recoiled in horror! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLord Vanderstorm was so tall that he had to bend over to enter the kitchen. Fortunately, its high ceilings were sufficient enough for him to stand up straight. He lumbered over to the kitchen table. The two children watched in awe. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBaby Leo sat on the table, suckling his bottle. Then he heard a deep rumbling noise behind him. He turned around and squealed! He dropped the bottle with a 'clunk!' and crawled eagerly towards the giant! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis let out a heavy, rumbling laugh. He scooped up the miniscule baby and hugged it roughly. Leo squeaked! Fortis laughed, patted it heavily on the head and gave it a powerful, loving kiss on the cheek. He chuckled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehehehe...Hey there little fellah!

So you got no place to go...You can stay here until we figure out what we can do with you\", said Fortis. \"Mrs. Tibbs, perhaps you could find them some old clothes? Burn those disgusting rags they're wearing and then give them a bath.

Now, there'll be a hot bath for you soon\", she said. \"You're lucky that the castle has its own piped and sewer-systems. All the water's stored in big copper cisterns on the roof, and there's a boiler right here in the kitchen! The servants bathroom is through here, come along!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two children followed the housekeeper into the bathroom.

I'll go find you some clothes!\" she said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bath was delightful! Hot and soapy and clean-smelling. The brother and sister scrubbed away, trying to clean their hair and their bodies all over. They hadn't had a proper wash in weeks! Ever since they'd been kidnapped from their village. They were drying themselves off with the two enormous, fluffy towels that were folded on a chair, when Mrs. Tibbs entered again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here we are!\" she said, \"These are a bit old and they might not fit, but they'll have to do. You can't go back to wearing what you had previously!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe held up some undershorts, pants and a tunic for Perseus, and a small, white dress for Katie. Perseus stared dubiously at the clothing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a bit...big, isn't it?\" he asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well they DID belong to his lordship...when he was a child...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He must've been a BIG child!!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my yes...Over six feet by the time he was ten! But these should fit you...or at least give you something to wear\", she said. \"I'll wait outside while you try them on\". </span></div></div>",

Katie looked like an absolute angel!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerseus looked like he was playing dress-up with papa's clothing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It doesn't FIT!\" he said, trying to stop the smalls from falling down off his backside! \"And this tunic isn't pretty...um...well..loose!\" he said. He flapped the extra fabric around. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh dear...\" said Mrs. Tibbs. \"It'll have to do, I'm afraid. I'll search the house later to see if I can find something more suitable!

You may explore the house, but be careful where you go, and don't touch anything!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two children left the kitchen and explored the house. The enormous dining-hall had big, flashy glass windows which brought in massive amounts of sunlight. It was so warm and inviting here. Against the far wall was a huge fireplace. The children marveled at the towering doorways. They shot up fifteen feet!...hardly surprising when a monster like Lord Fortis lived here!! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey explored the ballroom, the front parlour, the conservatory, the sun-lounge, and then upstairs, the library, the study and the bedroom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look how big this stuff is!\" said Perseus, staring at the towering mass of steel. Locked in a glass display-case was Fortis's suits of armour. On one stand was his battle-gear. On the other was his dress-armour, glittering steel and brass, polished to a mirror-finish. Nearby in another case were the noble warrior's great daggers, swords and shields, with his coat of arms painted on them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wooooooooooow...\" said Perseus. \"Oh man I want one of those!\" he said, drooling the colossal battle-swords. They must be REALLY expensive! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bed in the master bedroom was the size of a small swimming-pool! A huge, four-poster canopy bed with dark red sheets and bright blue linings, with gold trim. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wonder why he needs a bed THIS big? What do you suppose he does there?\" Perseus asked innocently. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I DON'T want to know!\" said Katie, her mind filling with extremely unsavory visions... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the children headed back down the corridor, they passed one of the bedrooms. Inside were two young women, sitting on a bed talking to each other... </span></div></div>",

It was late afternoon and time was getting on. They'd been travelling for the better part of two days, and they were glad to be near the end of their journey. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe carriage approached an enormous stone defensive wall with a huge, portcullised entrance-way. A burly-looking roya guard dressed in armour peered up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes?\" he asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lord Vanderstorm and his family to see the king\", Fortis said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you invited and expected?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is the nature of your business?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We seek to consult his majesty on a matter of domestic service\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooh...Alright wait here...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guard clanked off. He returned several minutes later. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The king will see you, Lord Vanderstorm...Raise the portcullis!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe huge gate creaked upwards and the carriage rumbled inside. It was parked and the horses were taken to the stables to be fed and watered. Fortis led his sister and his young wife into the palace, up the wide stone steps and into the foyer, and then into the huge throne-room further beyond. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Earl Vanderstorm, your Majesty\", said the guard, who had led them in. The guard stared at Fortis and held out both his hands, palms upwards. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis unbuckled his sword and handed it to the guard. He and the girls approached the royal dais. Fortis bowed and his wife and sister curtsied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your Majesty\", he said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lord Vanderstorm\", said King Leviathan. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe king cast his eyes over the three before him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And this must be your new wife\", he said, gesturing to Lady Eldonia. She blushed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm. And your charming sister\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinerva blushed as well! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What brings you to my palace?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your Majesty, the womenfolk of the house are of the opinion that we require more assistance in the running of Castle Vanderstorm. We have come to make a selection of the available surplus of labour\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aaah...\" the king said. \"Of course you are! Yes. Your grandmother and your new wife, and your son! Of course! Absolutely you may!...Achilles!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe king's personal assistant snapped to attention. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y'maj'\", he said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We DO have a surplus of servants seeking new placements, do we not?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We do\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excellent. You will tell them please, to assemble...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh there's no hurry!\" said Fortis. \"We can take our time...with your majesty's permission...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well...You must be tired from your journey. Achilles. Show Lord Vanderstorm and his family to the guest-wing. Dinner is in...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe king checked his watch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One hour\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are we to be expected, your majesty?\" Fortis asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope that you would not object?\" the king asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No sir!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excellent! Dinner in one hour. You will all be my guests! I insist!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis and the girls followed Achilles out of the throne-room. He called two slim, muscular footmen forward, instructing them to retrieve the luggage from the Vanderstorm coach and bring it upstairs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This way, my lord!\" said Achilles. He led the young nobleman upstairs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There are a number of people at Court presently\", said the king's servant. \"So the selection of rooms is not as great as it might be. But we have this double-bed suite in here, which you and her ladyship might desire...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe servant opened a huge pair of double-doors. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...and through here...\" he said, opening a pair of doors further down the corridor, \"...a single room for the young lady. They all come with private bedchambers for your servants as well\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you\", said Fortis. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinerva entered her suite. Through large, leadlight windows, she could see the sun setting in the distance. Her maid, Penny, lit the candles and then, confessing to sleepiness, headed to her own small room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think I'll need your help with anything\", said Minerva, \"You really didn't have to come, Penny. You could've taken the weekend off!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And miss the chance to come here!?\" the maid snapped back, indignantly, \"I should think NOT, my lady!\" she said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinerva giggled. \"Point taken!\" she said. \"Have a good sleep! And eat in the servants' hall downstairs if you're hungry later on\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPenny said goodnight and closed the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinerva stood in front of the windows, staring at the view of the city below. Lamplighters scurried around, lighting the street-lamps, filling the city with specks of golden light... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good evening...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aaaah!!!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinerva jumped! She whirled around! Something grabbed her! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah!\" the voice said, \"Easy! You'll twist your ankle doing that!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe handsome and charming Crown Prince Cassius held her steady and fixed her with his blue eyes. He stepped back and gave a courtly bow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My lady\", he said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinerva found herself curtsying out of habit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I recognised the coat of arms on the carriage in the courtyard\", Cassius said. \"Are you here alone? I saw someone else...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My brother Fortis is here as well\", Minerva said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah...Does he still want to kill me for thinking you're cute?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinerva giggled. \"Yes!\" she said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinerva laughed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your Royal Highness, what are you doing in my room?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cassius\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Prince Cassius, what are...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Cassius!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just Cassius?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"JUST Cassius\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright...JUST Cassius...what are you doing here?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, a little bird told me that a very pretty young lady of my acquaintance had arrived in the palace. I hope you don't mind me barging in like this...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't mind. Just you see that Fortis doesn't catch you, or he'll rip your head off! He's very...um...protective and...um...well who are we kidding? He's obsessed with the idea that I need to be chaperoned everywhere!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well he's your brother, Minerva. He loves you and he wants to protect you...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Giving me a knife is protecting me!

Minerva nodded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassius held out his arm. \"Might I walk you down?\" he asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinerva bobbed, and hooked her arm into his, and followed him out of the room. </span></div></div>",

Sweet and loving, innocent and kind!\" <br>\r\n\"He's only a year old!\" <br>\r\n\"Just about, yes!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassius filled Minerva's goblet with sweet wine. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Does it speak yet?\" <br>\r\n\"Only a few words...um...'Momma'...'Papa'...'Teena'\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Teena?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Athena! My grandmother!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooooh! Hey I bet she's excited about being a great-grandmother!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Either that, or she's horrified at the prospect of how old she's getting!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're lucky to have someone like your grandmother. She's sweet!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinerva nodded. Yes. Nanny was sweet... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stared around the table. Fortis was talking to King Leviathan while he carved up his steak. Eldonia leaned against her husband, who had a huge arm wrapped around her. The Queen laughed at something and Fortis grinned, and rapped his knuckles on Eldonia's temples. She scowled at him and wriggled away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the far end of the table were the other dinner-guests. Minerva pointed to an older man. He looked to be in his forties. He was tall, heavyset, brooding and dark, with dark brown hair, which was all shaggy. So dark it was almost black. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cassius who is that?\" Minerva asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who?...Triton! Father said no kittens at the table!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But Sundash is thirsty!\" the younger prince complained. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then give him his milk on the floor!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now!...Sorry who?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinerva pointed down the table. Cassius leaned over. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh that. That's Lord VerGallen. Aurelius is his first name, I think...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He looks mean\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's here to speak to father about...somethin'...Confidentially I don't like the man\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is he mean?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's always grumpy about something! Every few weeks he shows up here. If he came any more frequently, you'd think he LIVED here!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinerva looked up to see Lord Vergallen staring at her! She sat back in her chair where he couldn't see her so well. He looked so mean! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You want some dessert, Minerva?\" Cassius asked. \"We've got berry-punch...and we also have mixed-berry tarts with cream, and...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I don't think I'm very hungry\", she said. \"Perhaps we could dance?\" she asked. She gestured towards the open floor. A small string quartet up in the musicians' gallery was playing music for the king's dinner. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...oh yeah!\" said Cassius, \"If you want, sure!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe got up and helped her to her feet. He led her out and he bowed while she curtsied. The quartet up above changed their tune to a steady waltz and Cassius began to dance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One...two...three...one...two...three...ONE...two...three...Turn...and. ..three...one...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not nervous, are you?\" Minerva asked. \"At least you're easier to dance with than Fortis!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is Fortis a bad dancer?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's twice my height! I can never reach up high enough for the turns! I keep tripping over!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassius laughed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't imagine your brother dancing!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh he's quite good, when he puts his mind to it\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I'm about to find out\", said Cassius. He twisted Minerva around so that she could see. She watched as the king and queen, Fortis and Eldonia, and some of the other couples, paired off and wandered into the middle of the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fortis's favourite dance is the Sword Dance\", said Minerva. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I can't do that\", said Cassius. \"You need a lot of upper-body strength. I don't have that yet\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the dance was over, Minerva and Cassius broke off. She backed away from the prince, and felt someone touch her! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I have this next dance?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned to see the lined face of Lord Vergallen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I feel rather faint\", she said, \"I think I need to sit down\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I said, can I have this dance?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinerva felt a slight tension on her wrists and shoulders. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhenever Fortis squeezed her like that, it was a brotherly and playful show of strength. But Minerva felt no sense of play here! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, my lord, but I'd rather not...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I insist!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I desist!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The girl says no...\" came a heavy voice from behind Lord Vergallen. \"Now I suggest you let go of her shoulders...NOW!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinerva felt a slackness and release. The older man lumbered off, grumbling. Minerva stared up at her brother. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, you two ladies don't need a chaperone, huh...\" Fortis snorted. \"You look tired, girl. Go to bed\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not tired!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go...to...BED\", said Fortis. \"Or have you forgotten that tomorrow we're pickin' out your precious servants?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh!\" said Minerva. She'd totally forgotten! \"Yes I...I suppose I should sleep, shouldn't I?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis nodded. Minerva hopped up on her tip-toes and kissed her brother, and hugged Eldonia. Cassius smiled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll take you back to your room\", said Cassius. \"You don't want to get lost this late at night\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPrince Cassius led Minerva through the passageways and stairways. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do your brothers dance?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gladius would like to think he can. But I don't think he's so good\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where is he?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's in Regis City down south! He's bodyguard to the Fat Princes. I don't think he likes the idea very much!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why not?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well he thinks they're nothin' but pigs! I met the princes. They're different as night and day to us! But they're awful nice. Very kind boys...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe prince and his girlfriend turned the corner. They saw Lord Vergallen standing in the hallway. He turned as they approached. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well hey there young thing...\" he said, approaching them. He stood in their way, blocking their path. He stared at the pretty young girl. \"Aren't you cute?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinerva tensed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good night, Lord Vergallen\", she said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I don't think so...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe made to move. Lord Vergallen shifted his weight, blocking her path again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd take it as an insult if you didn't allow me that dance...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good NIGHT, Lord Vergallen!\" she said. She moved again. Lord Vergallen grabbed her hand! A scraping sound echoed down the corridor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassius held his unsheathed sword in his hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In the name of my father, King of Mountanian you will unhand that girl at ONCE!\" Cassius snapped, suddenly sounding a lot older than he was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAurelius Vergallen glared at Cassius, let go of Minerva's arm and trudged off, muttering something under his breath that seemed to rhyme very well with \"witch\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Never mind him\", said Cassius, \"He's been bitter for years. Nobody ever knows why. Grandpa said it was some sort of family thing that happened years and years ago, but even he's not entirely sure\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassius escorted Minerva to her bedroom and then left to allow her to sleep. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinerva climbed into bed and blew out the candles. The room was plunged into a peaceful darkness with only the moonlight shining through the windows. It was so quiet and relaxing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore she knew it, she'd dozed off. She didn't even notice her bedroom door swing open... </span></div></div>",

He turned and walked smack-bang into the king, who was out for his dawn walk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My lord\", he said. Fortis ignored him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lord Vanderstorm!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis stopped. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe king approached him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now listen, I know that you are EXTREMELY angry. And you have every right and justification to be so. But I MUST insist that you call off the duel\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Absolutely NOT! And you know just as well as I do that a duel is not against the laws of our kingdom!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Indeed not\", said Leviathan. Indeed, duelling had been legal in Mountania for as long as the kingdom ever existed! \"But I seriously think that you have caused enough damage alre...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*I*...have caused enough damage?\" Fortis asked softly. \"I...caused...enough...damage?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis exploded! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"IF THAT BASTARD'S GOT MY SISTER PREGNANT I WILL PERSONALLY SLICE OFF HIS BALLS AND MAKE HIM EAT THEM!

Or said! It's good to vent! I don't even blame you for shouting like that. Goodness knows you have more than enough of a reason to! I know how much your sister means to you. How much you treasure her!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No you don't!\" Fortis snarled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes I do, actually. Because Cassius tells me every single day whenever he walks out with Minerva, how much he worries about you\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis snorted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh he does! He wouldn't want you chasing after him if some sort of harm befell your sister. That's how I know\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Prince Cassius is...he's a good...Minerva likes him...\" Fortis choked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes she does. And that's another reason why you should protect her! I think you need to calm down a bit. Relax! Go for a walk, have a nice meal! Spend some time with your wife! Make sure your sister is comfortable...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right\", he said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good!\" said the king, helping Fortis to his feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right after the duel!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe king sighed and shook his head. \"Perhaps you should come with me\", he said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis followed the king inside. He led him to the infirmary. Lying on a bed at the back was Lord Vergallen, although he was hardly recognisable! Bandages covered most of his face from the relentless beating that Fortis had dealt out the night before. One arm was in a sling and his fingers were bandaged. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now do you see why he can't duel with you?\" the king asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis nodded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sat down on the bed with Lord Vergallen and leaned inwards. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If...you...EVER...Touch...speak...LOOK...BREATHE on my sister again...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis reached out with a hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore anyone could stop him, he had opened the front of Lord Vergallen's infirmary-gown! He had an iron grip around his testicles and was crushing them in his hands with a powerful squeeze! The bandaged face contorted with pain! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...I will PERSONALLY...FIND YOU...TAKE YOU...and kill you. Slowly, painfully and without mercy. Over the course of several days and weeks...until you will BEG me to kill you. And I still won't listen. Do I make myself CLEAR!?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLord Vergallen didn't answer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YES!?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis punched the nobleman hard in the scrotum, making him hunch up in pain! A jolting nod was extracted as an answer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright then...\" said Fortis. He held out a hand. \"Let's shake on it\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLord Vergallen held out a feeble hand. Fortis grasped it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore the king could react, Fortis slipped out of Aurelius's grip! He grasped his hand the nurses screamed when they herad a sickening \"CRUNCH!\" Lord Vergallen howled in agony as Fortis twisted his whole wrist around! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good!\" he said. \"Matron, his lordship has injured himself carrying some barrels of wine. Make sure he gets all the treatment that he deserves...\" he added, and left the ward. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My lord!\" said the king, \"I do NOT approve of that\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do\", said Fortis. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now see here!\" said King Leviathan. \"I will allow this. Lord Vergallen has been a thorn in my side for years and because I wish to see him receive his just desserts, I will pretend I did not see what just happened. But in return you will promise me that you will seek no further revenge upon his lordship\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis glowered, but then took a deep breath. Then he bowed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will do as my liege lord commands\", he said softly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe king nodded. \"Now...\" he said more brightly, \"You and your family will join mine, for breakfast! And then we shall look into those servants which you were so anxious about...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis groaned! So much had happened in the last twenty-four hours, that he'd totally forgotten about the whole REASON for their visit! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe nodded. \"Yes sir!\" he said, more like his old self, \"I'll go and see how the girls are\". </span></div></div>",

He was not strong, per-se, but he looked capable. Minerva was lying on the bed with her legs spread. Not something she was very happy with, but Eldonia had insisted on it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So doc, is she um...intact?\" Eldonia whispered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Unfortunately not...\" said the doctor. Minerva wailed! She was saving herself for her husband!...eventually. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wanted the man who was going to make her children and make her happy, have the honour of opening her up for the first time, to give her, her first real dose of pleasure...instead...now it was all gone... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia hugged her sister-in-law and kissed her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks doc\", she said. Minerva sniffled and sobbed, trying hard not to cry, but failing miserably. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bedroom doors swung open just as the doctor was leaving. Fortis entered. Eldonia gulped. He looked furious! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How was it?\" she asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It didn't...happen...\" Fortis glowered. He looked as angry as a five-year-old boy who'd been told that he couldn't go to the county fair! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What!?\" Eldonia fumed, \"Why not!?\" she demanded. \"He RAPED her! And she's my best friend! Now you DO SOMETHING about this!\" she snapped. Eldonia might've been overshadowed by her husband by nearly five feet, but she wasn't about to let him boss her around! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have you actually gone to the infirmary to look at him? I didn't think I did so much to him...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not NEARLY as much as HE did to her!\" Eldonia cried out, pointing to Minerva. \"I DEMAND that you DO SOMETHING!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will you be quiet!?\" Fortis snapped. \"You think I didn't want to!? Hell, even the king wasn't happy about it! But Lord Vergallen can't fight a duel! He can barely stand up!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"GOOD!\" Eldonia fumed. \"I mean...what!?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...what was it again...um...broken jaw, broken nose, broken ribs, broken arm, broken fingers...punctured lung...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia listened to her husband's impressive list of injuries. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are we to be satisfied with that then, without formal revenge!?\" she fumed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For the time-being. Yes\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia let out a low groan of frustration. Fortis hugged her close. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sweetie. You know I'd like to do more, but...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'LL MURDER HIM IN HIS BED!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shhh-shhh-shhh...\" Fortis whispered. \"Don't worry sweetkins...I've had a talk with him and...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"TALK? What did he do? Invite you over for tea and cake!?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have gained his assurances that he will leave our family alone\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh he better!\" said Eldonia. \"Where is that rat!? We'll see how much he likes it when he's got a four-foot fireplace poker shoved up his ass!\" she scowled, snatching up the instrument in question from the rack next to the mantlepiece! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ellie!\" Fortis said. \"Trust me, nothing would give me greater pleasure than to do EXACTLY what you suggest. But we can't. Not right now, alright?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia sighed. \"I'm just SO ANGRY!\" she sobbed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, sweetheart. And I'm angry too...Tell you what. The king's invited us all for breakfast. Now we better hurry or we'll be late!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia sighed again. \"I suppose it would help\", she grumbled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis smiled. He turned to his sister who was still crying. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Girl!\" he said, \"You comin'?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinerva shook her head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis got onto the bed and touched her. She batted his hand away! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Girl!\" Fortis said, \"Listen, I wish I could help you more, but...You sure you don't want breakfast? Prince Cassius will be there. The cute prince...You like him, right? Y'know he's sweet on you...You wouldn't want him to see you all teary-eyed and crying, would you?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OH GO AWAY!!\" Minerva shrieked! Fortis stared at his sister in shock! She'd NEVER snapped at him like this before! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot because she never dared, or never tried...she never wanted to, before now! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...\" Fortis began. Eldonia wrapped her hands around her husband's waist. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Leave her alone...\" she whispered. \"She needs to rest! She's just had a VERY trying experience!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis sighed. \"I guess you're right...come on\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n--- --- --- --- <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh the poor darling!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nQueen Athena shook her head and turned to her husband, \"You had better have done something about this!\" she said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's not much I CAN do\", said King Leviathan. \"Lord Vanderstorm here beat up Lord Vergallen so bad the man can't even walk!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"GOOD!\" the queen said forcefully! \"He's such a toad! I don't even know WHY you put up with him!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose I shouldn't\", said the king. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Queen \"Hurrmph!\"ed in disapproval. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How fairs your sister, my lord?\" she asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's resting\", said Fortis simply. \"She's...Who knows what she is. This isn't the first time it's happened. I don't know what it is about my sister! She seems to attract the people who are the worst for her!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!\" Prince Cassius called out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia laughed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's always been well...delicate and...impressionable\", Fortis said. \"I love her and...well...we'll just have to see\", he said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis suddenly felt arms around his chest. He turned to feel Minerva's face press against his. She kissed him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis wrapped a huge arm securely around his sister. \"Are you okay?\" he whispered. She nodded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I thought I probably should have...something...to eat\", she whispered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come and sit over here, my darling!\" the queen said. She shook her head at the bruises on Minerva's face and wrists. \"Absolutely disgusting!\" she said. \"You poor thing...Cassius!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassius jumped! He was so taken aback by what had happened that he'd forgotten to help Minerva into her seat! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll be alright\", he said. \"We'll look after you\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What if he comes back?\" Minerva whispered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's that?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What if he comes back!?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If he comes back I will personally torture him to death!\" Fortis said, stabbing a sausage with his fork. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Oh...\" said Minerva softly. She turned to Cassius, \"Fortis loves me so very much...\" she said in barely a whisper. The whole table erupted in laughter! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's more like it!\" said King Leviathan. \"Now come along everyone! Eat up! Who wants waffles?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I've already told the Lord Chamberlain to assemble all the servants looking for new positions. You'll take his lordship and his family to the assembly area where they can pick out their servants\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes father!\" said Cassius. He got up and watched as the Vanderstorms gathered. He approached them and made to take Minerva's hand. Fortis stepped forward, blocking his path. Not wanting a confrontation with Lord Vanderstorm, Cassius dropped his hand. Fortis hoisted his sister up in his colossal arms and carried her bodily from the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He sure is protective...\" Cassius whispered to Eldonia. She smiled. \"It's a good quality in a husband\", she whispered back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinerva sighed. \"Forty...\" she whispered, \"You don't have to carry me! I can walk!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ain't lettin' NOBODY touch you\", said Fortis firmly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cassius isn't anybody! He's a prince!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis fixed his sister with a look that actually made her scared of her brother for the first time in her memory. She decided to drop the subject. He was obviously still seething inside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe servants had gathered in the servants' hall and Cassius walked down the line, introducing each of them in turn. Fortis, Eldonia or Minerva all shook their heads as they headed past each two or three boys and girls. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nToo small. <br>\r\nToo weak.<br>\r\nToo old! <br>\r\nToo fat. <br>\r\nToo skinny. <br>\r\nWe can't have THAT thing working in our house! <br>\r\nToo young. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Eldonia and Minerva stopped. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding in front of them was a tall boy. He was slim, handsome, pale, with light blond hair and sky-blue eyes. He did not look very muscular, but he had a slim, athletic build.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is your name?\" Minerva asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Zachariah, my lady\", the boy said. He looked about fifteen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How old are you?\" Eldonia asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thirteen, ma'am\", the boy said. Eldonia smiled. She waved her husband over. She smiled and pointed to Zachariah and smiled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's your name, boy!?\" Fortis barked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZachariah's jaw dropped...he stared up...and...up...and UP at the colossal, hulking, gigantic young Mountain lord...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Z-z-z-z...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ain't no time for sleepin', boy! What's your name!?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Zachariah!\" said Eldonia, seeing that Fortis's presence was clearly terrifying the boy! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's your last name, boy?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Vv-v-va-vandersteen, m-my lord!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm. Good name. You live up to it, boy?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-i-iI I try, my lord!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis snorted. \"You better. We lookin' for a hall-boy, a maid and a footman...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis cast his critical eyes up and down. \"Y'ain't that big, boy!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"F-f-five f-foot fou-four, my lord...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis snorted again. \"Too small\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But...\" Eldonia began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't need a boy who can do backflips under a coffee-table!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But Forty! He could do other things!\" said Eldonia, \"I think he could work out very well!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis turned back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why should I hire you as a footman?\" he asked. \"Can you run?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yessir!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you carry stuff? Trays? Food? Dishes? Clothes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yessir!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you manage trunks? Cases? Luggage?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yessir!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Firewood!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yessir!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know much about the nobility, boy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yessir!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No you don't! You will speak to me as Yes My Lord, and as nothing else! Do you understand!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yess-...uh..m-my lord!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis grunted and shook his head. Cassius stepped in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lord Vanderstorm, Zachariah does have other qualities\", he said. \"He's got a younger brother and sister!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what use are they? We're running an estate here! Not a daycare-center!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-well you wanted a hallboy and page, and you wanted a new undermaid...And if you select Zachariah, by law, they have to go with him!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But what if I don't select Zachariah?\" Fortis asked. \"Then they can stay put!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Zach, go and get your brother and sister!\" Cassius whispered. He could tell that Fortis was still mighty steamed from the incident with Lord Vergallen. His fuse was short and his temper hot. Zach ran off and returned less than a minute later with his brother and sister. Fortis turned to look at them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mere sirrah!\" Fortis barked. The younger boy stepped forward. He had darker blond hair than his older brother and was smaller. He was solidly built and looked like a capable youngster with a bit of spunk in him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know how to light a fire, boy?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes m'lord!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh...Good! How old are you, boy?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eight, sir!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And your sister?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Five, sir!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis stared at the girl. She was TINY! She could probably sleep in a stew-pot! He turned, but was blocked by his sister and his wife, diminutive as they were. He could see that their hearts had melted at the sight of the youngsters. He groaned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright!\" he grumbled. \"Take them! But they better work good or else I'll be back here next week!\" he said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZachariah, his little brother Hermes, and his sister Lucy, followed the intimidating mountain lord out of the servants quarters. </span></div></div>",

Little Lucy was a timid, shy creature, but one of incredible softness and beauty. Hermes was short, stocky and looked well-built for a boy of only eight. Zachariah was muscled, but slim. Not overly tall, but tall enough to be noticed. He looked like a kindly and handsome boy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>WHAM!! WHAM!!</b> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPenny squealed! Lucy ran to her and hugged her!

The other servants, most of them teenagers, stared at them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is Perseus\", said Penny, \"This is his sister Katie...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two little girls waved at each other. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is Eliza, the head housemaid.

And don't touch anything!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three youngsters sat at the table while the others hurried off to their duties. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey watched as servant-girls and boys moved hither and thither, and thither and yon, and within and without. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh damn!\" said one girl, hurrying into the hall, \"Where's the blacking!? And the rags!? Eliza!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I haven't touched them!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But Lord Jupiter wishes to clean his boots!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ask Koviac!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey I haven't seen nothing!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh blast! Out of the way you three! Begone from here!...THERE'S the blacking!...Now where are those rags!?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mattie! Did you take my button-hooks!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Certainly not, Penny! What would I need with them!? I'm not a lady's maid!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then where are they!?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I bet you left them in the scullery!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...Oh gosh you're right! Oh no! I hope they haven't gone and tarnished!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrying not to get run over, the three raw recruits retreated from the bustling servants' hall into the kitchen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"EMILY! Will you hurry up with that water, girl!?\" a fat, middle-aged woman cried out, \"I need it for the chicken!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can we help?\" Zacharia asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh out of my way!\" the woman fumed, \"EMILY!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here we are!\" said a girl, rushing in, carrying two buckets of water from the well, \"The water!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At last! Fill up the big pot and put it on the stove! Not so much!...Careful, girl! Careful! Now go and prepare the dough! DRY YOUR HANDS FIRST YOU SILLY GIRL!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, Penny came back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's going on!? I thought I told you to wait in the hall!?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We were going to! But Cook looked like she needed some help, and...\" Hermes began. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I certainly do not! And it's Mrs. Tibbs, if you please! Not 'cook'! This is a nobleman's household! Not a two-penny inn-house! I'll not be called by what ain't my proper title! Not around here!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course not, Mrs. T.,\" said Penny, \"What are you making there, Missus?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"IF it ever gets DONE, it'll be chicken dumplings with noodles for our dinner this evening!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooh yum!\" said another servant-girl. \"I do like your dumplings, Mrs. Tibbs!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMrs. Tibbs nodded appreciatively, \"It's nice to know, Mattie. Now, who are these!?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh!\" said Penny, \"Sorry...Mrs. Tibbs, this is Zacharia, and his brother Hermes, and their little sister Lucy\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lucy, eh? How old are you, girl?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy held up five fingers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm. I daresay you could make a good companion to that girl Katie. And what are you two supposed to be?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Zacharia's to be the new footman, Mrs. Tibbs. And his brother's to be the hallboy\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A hallboy we have now, do we? Well it took some time, I must say! But perhaps things will get done, now! I hope you're a strong, capable young lad!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yessum!\" said Hermes, standing up straight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is Mrs. Tibbs, everyone\", said Penny, \"She's the housekeeper and cook\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am that!\" said Mrs. Tibbs. \"Although these days, I spend more time as cook than housekeeper, one day Eliza will do that. If she can spend enough time away from his lordship's bedchamber...!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEliza blushed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's nothing, Mrs. T.!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing, is it!? I do wonder! Anyway, enough of that...what time does the Dowager want dinner served?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The usual time, Mrs. Tibbs\", said Mattie, the second housemaid. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very good. Perseus!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerseus hurried forward. He stopped and stared at Hermes. The two boys smiled at each other. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perseus is the pageboy\", Penny explained. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perseus. Tell his lordship and his family that dinner will be at the usual time. Roast beef, bread, sausages, eggs, a rack of lamb cutlets and a fresh salad with cream sauce!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yessum!\" said Perseus. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aaaah! A pageboy does NOT run!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No'um!\" he said, and started a slow walk from the kitchen. </span></div></div>",

It was so beautiful! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was watching a rabbit hopping alongside the road when a whistling noise whipped through the air! Suddenly, something thudded into the carriage wall! Hermes yelped! An arrow stuck through the side of the carriage, just inches from where he was! The horses neighed and whinnied! Fortis hauled on the reins! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! HEY!\" he roared, \"Hold it!\" he shouted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZachariah yelped as more arrows whistled past! The girls screamed when one arrow smashed through one of the carriage windows! Fortis climbed down from the carriage and stared around. He didn't see anything. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe turned, and then out of the bushes came four armed men! Two had bows and arrows and two had swords. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You!\" one of the men shouted, pointing at Fortis, \"Leave your gold! Your weapons! Your valuables and the carriage will pass unheeded!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis glared at the man. He was about seven feet tall. But that was still much shorter than Fortis. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah?\" Fortis asked. \"How about...you fuck off...you leave your swords and bows and arrows...and I'll pretend this never happened\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe archers raised their bows and pulled back on their arrows. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright!\" Fortis said. He unbuckled his scabbard and held out his sword. \"Here\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of the men stepped forward to retrieve it. He grabbed the scabbard, but Fortis pulled the huge battlesword out of the end of it! He stepped back, waved the heavy blade through the air and in one fell swoop, smashed through both men, sliccing their heads off at their necks! The useless corpses dropped the ground, the heads thumping on the dirt like coconuts falling out of a tree. The girls screamed and Zachariah gasped. Fortis turned, blood splattered everywhere and dripping off the sword. He turned to the other two men. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have had a VERY bad weekend...\" he said. \"...and you are not making me any better\", he said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDropping their bows, the men pulled out short-swords! Fortis whirled his huge battle-sword through the air! Zachariah clapped his hands to his ears! Minerva covered little Lucy's eyes! The screeching of steel on steel was deafening! Fortis swung back and forth! Clash! Clang! Smash! REEEK!! The two other men were smaller and could move faster, but the sheer force and power behind connecting with one of the Mountain lord's massive swordstrikes sent vibrations jolting through their entire bodies! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis swung his huge sword down, and one of the men screamed! There was a \"thud!\" as his useless right arm, sword intact, fell to the ground! Fortis grabbed the man and slammed him up against a tree! He started beating him furiously! Slamming his body into the trunk with loud, hollow thudding noises! He dropped him to the ground and turned on the other man. The man let out a wail of fear, dropped his sword and ran! Fortis chased the man down and tackled him on the road, easily pinning him down under his tonnage! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please my lord!\" the man grovelled, \"I beg of your mercy! W-w-w-we d-didn't w-want an-anything b-but -t-the m-m-mmoney! Have mercy, my lord!\" he sobbed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go!\" Fortis grunted, getting up. The man backed away and stared at Fortis. Fortis smiled and returned to the carriage. The man got up and began to stumble and limp away! Before he'd gotten very far, Fortis had kicked one of the bows into his hands and loaded it with a shaft. The girls watched from the carriage as the bow was pulled back and then the arrow was loosed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the distance, they fancied they heard a thudding sound of something hitting the earth... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis wiped down his sword, gathered up the dropped weapons, threw them into a trunk at the back of the carriage and climbed back into the driver's seat. Zachariah stared at him in horror! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What'cha lookin' at!?\" Fortis grunted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-n-no-nothing m-m-my lord!!\" Zachary whimpered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis grunted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YAH!\" he shouted, whipping the horses into motion again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinerva and Eldonia cleaned up the mess of broken glass inside the carriage, throwing the bits out the window and removing the two arrows fired at the carriage. Meanwhile, Hermes was staring out of one of the windows, up at Fortis who was now driving them home. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wooooooooooooowwww!\" he said. \"Lucy did you see that!? He was like...woosh! Woosh! Woosh! SMASH!! That was SO COOL!! Oh wow I wish I could do that! And then I'd be cool! Oh that was Awesome!!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy didn't see what was so incredible about it! But Hermes was rapt! He stared at Fortis like he was some sort of god! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt their first rest-stop, a small village about halfway home, they all hopped out for drinks and a break. The women used the facilities, and Zachariah helped Fortis to fit in a new pane of glass into the broken window, using one taken from the village glazier. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe horses were fed, watered and rested, and then hitched up again for another ride. Fortis had a quick strip-wash, and then got back into the driver's seat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe enormous Mountain lord stared at a tiny figure sitting in the seat next to him. Hermes had usurped his brother's position as the driver's companion, apparently! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hermes...\" said Fortis. \"COME ON GIRLS! I WANNA GET BACK BEFORE THE MIDWINTER FESTIVALS!!\" he shouted. He watched as the girls skittered forwards and climbed into the carriage. Zachariah closed the doors and the carriage was on its way. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That stuff was cool!\" said Hermes, once the carriage was on the way, \"All that...thrusting and...swiping and...Wooow!!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis smirked. It'd been a while since anyone had commented on his combat abilities. He leaned back in the driver's seat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You like that stuff, huh?\" he asked, putting a huge arm around Hermes's back. The awestruck youngster nodded so hard, his head might fall off! He was acting like he'd just met his favourite movie-star! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis chuckled and flexed a powerful forearm. Hermes turned when he felt the monster's huge biceps and triceps expand behind him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I see your sword!?\" Hermes asked. Fortis nodded. The boy grabbed the heavy handle and tried to pull the sword out of the scabbard! It was immensely heavy! He could hardly draw it out, let alone hold it! It was so heavy! And yet he'd seen Fortis wield this monster in ONE HAND! Hermes stared at his reflection in the blade. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wooow!\" he said. \"How many people have you killed with this!?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know...\" said Fortis, casually. \"I didn't really keep track the last time I went on a border-skirmish...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You fought the Vladians!?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure I did! What, you think King Leviathan lets me keep my family estate for nothing!?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-n-no sir!\" said Hermes, \"I only meant...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I did\", said Fortis. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy's jaw dropped. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wooooooooooooooow...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't you ever say anything else than that?\" Fortis asked, chuckling. He could tell that young Hermes was mightily impressed! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd Hermes was! He was gonna be living with a super-huge, giant warrior lord! A bloodthirsty, merciless Mountainian monster! Someone who gave no quarter and showed no mercy! Someone who...who...who....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermes then admitted to himself, he didn't know what else!...But it sounded cool!! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy sunset, Fortis could see lights in the distance. Their village was finally in sight...and beyond the village...the lights of Castle Vanderstorm... </span></div></div>",

I'm too old for that!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nonsense!\" she said, and stroked his hair. \"Goodnight, darling!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLady Athena sat in her rocking-chair by the fire. She yawned. It was such a slow night. She could smell moisture in the air. It felt like a heavy, summer thunderstorm was on its way. She opened the windows to her bedroom, which overlooked the front drive, and sat down, with a candelabrum casting golden light over the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMrs. Tibbs the housekeeper entered. She had a tray with hot chocolate and cookies on it, and she set it down on the table nearby. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your treat, my lady\", she whispered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh thank you, Mrs. Tibbs! Do sit down and join me! I could use the company\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMrs. Tibbs smiled and sat down, producing another cup and saucer from her apron. She filled the two cups with steaming hot chocolate and silced a large sponge-cake with a knife. In the distance, Athena heard a soft wailing noise. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh dear...\" she said. She got out of her rocking chair and shuffled out of the room. \"Yes, yes, yes! Granny's coming! Alright, alright...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLady Athena returned a few minutes later with a bundle wrapped in blue cloth. Baby Leonardo suckled on a little wooden pacifier. Mortimer the plush-cat clutched in his chubby little baby-hands. Athena sat back down and rocked back and forth with the baby in her lap. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There there my darling!\" she said, stroking the baby, \"Hush now...Shhh!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWrapped in his blankie, baby Leo soon dozed off. Lady Athena hugged him with one hand, and supped her hot chocolate and nibbled on cake with the other. Outside, the storm broke. Thunder rumbled through the air and rain scattered down! Lightning flashed! Baby Leo woke up and started crying! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww!!\" said Lady Athena, \"It's alright sweetums!\" she said. She got up and moved to the window. She leaned out to close the windows when she heard a neighing sound in the distance. Mrs. Tibbs moved to the window too, and she squealed and pointed! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDashing down the road at top speed was a black carriage with four blazing carriage-lamps on the sides! It skidded to a halt at the front door where stable-boys came to help offload the passengers and cargo before driving the coach away. The two women upstairs headed down into the foyer. They stood there, nervously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doors flew open! The moist heat of the evening rushed in! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA towering figure entered the foyer, covered in a heavy, dark cloak, followed by six other people! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huuuaarrgghhh!!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis ripped off his travelling-cloak and threw it at a rack in the corner, exposing impressive muscles. Penny pushed the doors shut and everyone else slowly took off their cloaks and capes, caps and hoods. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gran'ma\", said Fortis, roughly, hugging the old woman. \"Boy\", he said, nodding at a wide-eyed and terrified Leo! Fortis acted as if he was learning his words for the first time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is everything alright?\" Lady Athena asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, sure. We got the servants. Girl got raped. Things are fine...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Girl?...OH MINERVA!!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm alright, granny!\" said Minerva, \"Really, I am! Fortis saved me!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I should hope so! What happened!?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll tell you in the morning!\" said Minerva. \"Granny, this is Zachariah. This is his brother Hermes. And this is their sister Lucy!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look Hermes!

After a flurry of activity, the house was silent again... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis groaned as he lumbered upstairs and into the master bedroom.

Mrs. Tibbs showed them where their bedrooms were and how they were expected to sleep. She explained what their daily routines would be and how they would vary throughout the week. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have to wash ALL the dishes\", she said. \"We've got soap for you to do that with. There's cold water on tap, but any hot water you need should be boiled on the stove. There are saucepans and kettles there for you to use. And there are also some oven-mitts to protect your hands. NEVER touch hot metal without them, or you'll burn yourselves VERY badly!\" she said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe showed them where all the cleaning-supplies were and let them organise how they would handle their cleaning-rosters. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll start tomorrow. To save time and water, it's advisable to fill up one BIG tub with hot water and then just place all the things that need washing up, into the tub, along with shaved soap. That way, it can soak in the water all day, and then all you have to do at the end is give it a good scrub, a rinse, and let it drip-dry overnight!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about the rest of the servants quarters?\" Katie asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That'll just be sweeping and dusting!\" said Mrs. Tibbs, \"You can do that easily, I'm sure! I'll show you a few handy tricks about how to do all that. The older girls will handle things like polishing the brass and firing up the stove and cleaning out the ashes and the fireplaces and lighitng fires and candles and so-forth. You don't have to worry about any of that!\" she said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Today, we'll relax. I've made some cakes and cookies if you want!\" she said. \"They're in the pantry!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe kindly old housekeeper cum cook, opened the pantry and brought out sponge-cakes and cookies. She laid them all out on a big trolley and wheeled the whole thing outside. She also had some lemonade in a huge glass jug. She brought out some glasses and let the children sit out in the yard on chairs and tables, eating away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpstairs, Fortis smiled. Mrs. Tibbs was a sentimental, sweet-natured old woman. She would know best how to look after the new servants. And he didn't want to spoil their fun. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What a big house!\" Lucy said. <br>\r\n\"It's a beautiful castle!\" said Katie. \"And we get to live here!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lord Vanderstorm is SO cool!\" said Hermes to Perseus, \"Y'know he killed four guys on the way home!\"<br>\r\n\"He did not!\"<br>\r\n\"He did too!

He kicks ass!\" <br>\r\n\"Hey watch it, or he'll kick our asses!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe children chatted and gossiped away, nibbling and drinking in the morning sun.

Yeah...I wish...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCannius and Jupiter were a bit more receptive to the idea of a rabbit in the house. Cannius even built a nice big rabbit-hutch for it, so that it could sleep out in the yard where it would be safe. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What'll you call it?\" he asked, when the hutch was finished. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hopper!\" Katie said at once. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What a name...\" Cannius said. \"Alright...Hopper...this is your new home\", he said, indicating the rabbit-hutch. \"We hope you like it!\" he said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHopper did like it! He bounced inside and made himself quite at home. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll get some sausages!\" said Hermes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rabbits don't eat meat!\" said Lucy, \"They eat carrots and veggies!...I'll get some carrots!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore long, Hopper had a trough full of fresh garden vegetables in his hutch. He nibbled on them happily, and lapped up at a bowl of water in the corner. The hutch was in a nice, sunny spot in the yard, and the rabbit snuggled down in the straw to enjoy the warmth of the sun. </span></div></div>",

They got big appetites!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do they eat?\" Katie asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Carrots, peas, potatoes, mostly. But apples, lettuce, onions, radishes, herbs...celery...Most things, really. Just a LOT of it! He probably hopped in here because he saw the big vegetable gardens and got hungry! He's probably been here for a while now, judging by how fat he is!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We thought that was fur!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no! Well...Yes it is...fur, that is...but under that, it's all fat! Forest-lopers live in northern Fatlantis where the weather usually gets colder for longer, so they get really fat, especially around the end of the year. But they make great pets! So long as you can feed them...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks Kov...Ko...Kovey...Coffee...Coffee-sack...\" said Lucy, uncertainly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's KO-VI-AC\", said Koviac, chuckling, \"You're welcome. And you better get that bunny downstairs before Lord Vanderstorm sees it, or he's liable to eat it!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two girls stared at Koviac! At once, they grabbed their bunny and ran! </span></div></div>",

Butterscotch hopped away down the corridor. He hopped in and out of rooms, and between doors. He hopped and hopped and hopped! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, he hopped into another room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis room was warm and steamy. He hopped up onto a stool. Then he hopped up and stared into the big pond! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nButterscotch was thirsty... and hungry!...Maybe there was something to eat in this pond? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the same time, Fortis relaxed in his bathroom, oblivious to the escaped woodland pet that was currently loose in his domain. He yawned, his eyes shut...Mmmmmm... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Splash!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh!?\" Fortis grunted, \"What...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen he saw that his block of soap on the bathtub-edge wasn't there anymore. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...\" he mumbled. He fished around, found the soap and put it back. His hand brushed against something fluffy in the water. Stupid washcloth was always floating around. Fortis yawned and closed his eyes again...The water was so hot and wonderful... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Nibble-nibble-nibble...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ow! Hey! What the...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWater rushed everywhere! Fortis rose to his full height and stared at the soapy water! He bent down and ran his hands through the bath! Then, he scooped up something fat, brown, fluffy and soaking wet! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"GAARRGGGHHH! GET THIS STUPID RODENT OUT OF MY ROOM!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment, Minerva, Eldonia and the two new servant-girls rushed into Fortis's bathroom! The two younger girls gasped! They'd never seen a Mountain lord without his clothes on before... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WILL YOU...TAKE...THIS STUPID DAMN...THING!...OUT OF THE HOUSE!?\" he shouted, thrusting the sopping wet rabbit at no-one in particular. Minerva hugged it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Fortis! Don't be so dramatic! It only fell in the bath!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, it did a lot more than that!\" said Fortis. \"It got it into its mind to have a snack!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did it snack on!?\" Eldonia said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Never you mind!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohhhhh...I'm sure it didn't take off too much! After all, it is...very big...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is NOT the time for flattery, girl!\" Fortis grumbled, \"Now take that damn thing OUTSIDE! Or the next tub it jumps into is gonna be filled with chopped veggies and gravy! And that time, it ain't hoppin' out again!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Fortis! It was probably hungry!\" said Minerva, \"And it thought perhaps it found a carrot!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"IT'S NOT A CARROT YOU STUPID WOMAN!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh come now, Fortis!\" said Eldonia. \"After all, it's just a bunny! And they can't tell the difference!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's a hell of a lot of difference between a carrot and my...THINGY!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I don't think so!\" said Eldonia, \"After all, they're both long, hard and juicy...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinerva and Eldonia burst out laughing and they fought to keep serious faces in front of Fortis's glaring expression of indignity! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...and it probably didn't know the difference!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well it BETTER KNOW!\" Fortis shouted. \"Damn rabbit...Now all of you, OUT! And it that stupid rodent comes up here again, the next hutch it's gonna end up in is gonna be made of pastry-dough!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh come along girls!\" said Eldonia, shooing the two younger girls out of the room, \"Leave His Lordship to his bath...YOU...\" she said, looking at the rabbit, \"Are a very naughty bunny!

Her chin was on her hand, and she idly stirred the peas and carrots on her plate, tapping her fork on the fine china plate in boredom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you feeling alright?\" Minerva asked in concern, her brow furrowing.  \"You're not feeling ill or anything, are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have been a bit listless lately,\" added Lady Athena, taking a sip of tea.  A smile crossed her aged face.  \"You're not expecting again, are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia snorted and threw her fork down on her plate, slumping down in her chair and crossing her arms over her chest.  \"One has to have SEX in order to be expecting!\" she muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinerva frowned.  \"Ellie, what's wrong?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia sighed once more and shook her head.  \"Nothing.  I just....  I'm not hungry.  I'm gonna get some fresh air.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, the young lady of the house got huffily to her feet and hurried out of the dining room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was that all about?\" Minerva asked her grandmother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, never you mind, dear,\" said Athena wisely.  \"Eldonia is just now realizing that she's not the sole focus of Fortis's time and attention.  As you know, with Fortis being the Lord of the manor and the surrounding area, he has a lot of responsibilities.  For a while, Fortis was able to give her all the attention she wanted, but he's been awful busy with his other duties the last couple of weeks.  I think she's been missing his company.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, is that all?\"  Minerva laughed.  \"What a silly thing to be upset about!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I agree.  However, she may appreciate someone to commiserate with.\"  Athena looked pointedly at her granddaughter, and Minerva brightened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I gotcha, Granny.  I'll go get Leo, and maybe the both of us can cheer her up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's the spirit!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia stomped through the flower gardens that Athena loved to tend.  Granted, several patches of flowers were noticeably chewed on or missing, courtesy of Butterscotch's appetite, but it was still a lovely and soothing place in the backyard.  Unfortunately, the gardens weren't so soothing right at the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia fumed.  For the past two weeks, she had hardly spent any time with her husband!  If he wasn't in his study tending to accounts and books, he was out chopping wood, or making repairs to the house or stables, or out with the tenant farmers, helping them with their needs.  Jupiter and Cannius were often with him, lending their considerable strength and muscle to building and repairing projects.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia understood that things had gotten into a bit of disrepair while Fortis had been gone fighting the Vladians and that now with his return there was much up-keep that needed to be done, especially since it wouldn't be long before winter would be setting in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Fortis had been so wearing himself out during the day that her normally horny husband had had no desire to do more than share a bed with her and sleep!  They would kiss a few times and snuggle down, but nothing more!  Eldonia's young, ripe body was anxious for a bit more action.  Despite her attempts at seduction--sultry smiles, wearing scraps of lace and linen that left little to the imagination, running her fingers alluringly along his strong biceps and pecs--Fortis would always yawn and push her away or turn his back to her, ignoring her!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia was so...sexually frustrated, she wanted to pull her hair out!  Before Fortis left for the war and right after he got back, he could hardly keep his hands off her.  Now...now it was as if he weren't interested in her anymore!  Eldonia came to a halt as a horrible idea came to her.  Was Fortis getting his pleasure...from someone else??  Was she not enough to satisfy his needs anymore??  Was some young, naive daughter of one their tenant farmers showing her appreciation of all his efforts...leaving him with no energy to bed his wife at night??<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia walked around the side of the manor house and watched as Fortis whacked and sawed and hammered and cursed as he worked on the new rabbit hutch, Butterscotch lolling about at his feet--a big, fluffy, toffee-colored ball that was so fat it could barely hop!  Her heart lurched in her chest as she saw sweat rolling down his naked back and his muscles constricting and flexing with his rough movements.  She sighed wearily.  How much she loved him, loved the sight of him.  And yet, he had been completely ignoring her!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia straightened up to her full height, a stern look washing over her lovely face.  She'd had enough!  As his wife, she deserved a bit more consideration from him than a mere kiss goodnight!  She wanted a full, steamy night of passion--she deserved one after the past two weeks of celibacy!--and she was gonna get it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe squared her shoulders and marched over to Fortis, tapping him smartly on his massive deltoid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?!\" he grumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that any way to speak to your wife?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm busy, girl!  Go bother someone else!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!  I've had enough of your ignoring me, Fortis!  I think I'm due a little more consideration from you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I haven't been ignoring you!  I've been extremely busy lately!  No go on into the house and take care of Leo!  I need to get this new hutch done before that stupid rabbit eats me out of house and home!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh!  So the RABBIT deserves more attention that I DO?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"LOOK!\" he roared, turning around to face her with a hammer held high in his fist.  \"I DON'T HAVE TIME TO ARGUE WITH YOU!  GET IN THE HOUSE AND LEAVE ME ALONE, WOMAN, BEFORE I DO SOMETHING YOU'LL REGRET!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia gasped and backed up a few steps.  She had seen Fortis angry plenty of times, but he'd never been so livid AT HER before!  He looked very scary with his naked chest heaving in anger, his arm raised with the hammer as if ready to strike!  His eyes were narrowed, and he glared with fury--at her!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTears filled Eldonia's eyes.  She only wanted a little time with her husband!  Was that so much to ask?  And Fortis was acting like she was a burden to him!  A sob escaped her throat, and she ran off, stumbling a bit as she went.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis realized what he had done too late.  He lowered his hammer and ran his free hand over his grimy, sweaty face.  He hadn't meant to yell at her like that.  To be honest, he had missed his young wife's company the past couple of weeks.  However, there was much to do to prepare the estate and his tenants for the winter.  Turning back to the half-finished hutch, Fortis took a deep breath and went back to work.  He'd finish this up, clean up a bit, have a good dinner, and then he'd see if he could make it up to his wife.  His body was certainly telling him that he hadn't seen any action for a while.  He was never one for big romantic overtures, but he could certainly put a little effort in showing Eldonia he still loved and cared for her.  Just the thought of making love to her had a smile spreading across his handsome face.  He put a little more muscle into his hammer swings, wanting to get the new hutch done as soon as possible.  His wife needed him!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stupid rabbit,\" he muttered, looking down briefly at the fat ball of fluff lounging by his feet and chewing idly at some dandelions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Didn't even want to SEE HER!! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe ran blindly through the estate, past orchards and trees and hedges and gardens, to the stables and the mews behind the main house. She ran into the stables and sank to her knees in an empty horse-stall, lying among the straw, sobbing! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA handsome young stable-buck was busy brushing down one of His Lordship's horses. He heard the sobbing, and put down the brush to go and investigate. Surely His Lordship hadn't lashed out at his sister!? Lady Minerva was always such a sweet, kind and delicate thing... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy had brown hair and a handsome, tanned body, the result of the hard work, heavy toil and many years spent outdoors. He was the same age as Eldonia, but was not much taller than she was. He peeked in and saw her sobbing. He tiptoed in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I beg your pardon, my lady...\" he whispered, \"Are you alright?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia sobbed! She turned and saw a vision of tan and brown. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh go away!\" she mumbled. But the boy only approached. As he got nearer, Eldonia could see that he was handsome, slim and attractive, youthful and soft...quite unlike the brutish muscularity of her husband... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am Baltus, my lady\", the boy said, when he realised that she did not recognise him, \"I'm the second stable-boy. My father is the groom, my uncle is the coachman. My older brother Vallius is the head stable-boy...Do you remember, madam?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia nodded. She remembered now. Baltus knelt down. He pulled out a handkerchief from his pocket and helped her to clean her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You needn't cry! There's nothing here to hurt you!\" he whispered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia just gulped and took several deep breaths...trying to calm down...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Leave me...\" she said feebly, \"I...I want to be alone\", she said. Baltus nodded and backed away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes, Eldonia got up. She stared outside and saw the stable-yard. She saw Baltus forking out huge amounts of hay from a cart, into the hay-troughs for the horses. He was very athletic and attractive...he would have to be, to chase after horses all day! And to rein them in and to break them, and to have some sort of mastery over them...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A loud voice interrupted Eldonia from her perusal of Baltus the stable-boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Baldy!  You done feeding those horses yet?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia saw Baltus sigh and roll his eyes before turning around and addressing the tall hunk who was quickly trotting up to him on a great steed.  \"I told you not to call me that, Val!  You know I hate that nickname!  And yes, I'm almost done!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good!  'Cuz this horse here needs a good rub-down from his ride!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why can't you do it?\" Baltus asked petulantly as the man easily swung down from the tall, heaving stallion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because I need to wash up!  And because I told you, that's why!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia's eyes widened in shock and delight at the sight of what she could only surmise was Vallius, Baltus's older brother.  Eldonia raked her eyes down the ripped, masculine form.  While Eldonia had seen the stable-hands countless times before, she never paid them much mind.  After all, she always had Fortis to compare any man to, and of course Fortis had always come out on top.  But now, with Fortis not wanting to spend any time with her....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVallius ran a hand through his shaggy, dirty blond hair and grinned at his brother as he threw the reins carelessly at Baltus.  Eldonia took in the bulky muscles rippling on Vallius's arms and legs, his strong pecs and the six-pack abs that were even clearly defined through the tight tunic he was wearing.  He was almost as tall as Fortis, though not near as broad in the shoulder, but strong and sturdy all the same.  He was also very tanned, like his brother.  Eldonia figured he was about eighteen or so--more man than boy but with just enough boy left in him to soften the strong edges away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Baltus led the black, snorting stallion away to rub him down, Vallius swaggered up to the horse's head and gently ran a hand along the tangled, midnight mane.  He whispered a few words into the horse's ear, and Eldonia was mesmerized as the tense stallion noticeably eased and gentled.  Vallius was obviously a master equestrian and knew how to handle the spirited steeds in his lord's stables.  Eldonia watched Vallius continue to stroke gently, almost lovingly, down the horse's long mane....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn Eldonia's mind, she could just imagine that large, tanned, calloused hand running down her own long hair, easing and gentling her...before that hand would venture to her skin.  His hand would be warm, but so gentle as it traced along her arm or her back, leaving goosebumps in its wake.  Eldonia's skin actually did get goosebumps because of her imagination, and she shivered.  It had been so long since she'd lain with her husband, and the need to seek physical relief was pumping wildly through her veins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVallius moved his hand to stroke along the horse's cheek, continuing to murmur soft words to the horse, and Eldonia couldn't help a low moan at the thought of him stroking her <i>own</i> cheek and murmuring in <i>her</i> ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVallius, knowing that any sudden moves would startle the stallion, kept his curiosity at bay when he heard the quiet gasp near the stable entrance.  He slowly pulled away from the horse's neck and smirked at his brother.  \"Go on, then, Baldy.  I think he's calm enough for a rub-down, now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBaltus rolled his eyes again at the ribbing, but clicked at the horse and slowly led him away.  Vallius watched his brother near the stable entrance and noticed a lovely sight lingering there.  When he recognized who the girl was, he was initially surprised, as he had rarely seen Lady Vanderstorm at the stables much, let alone by herself.  However, when their eyes met and hers slowly raked down his impressive physique, a blush suffusing her cheeks, he couldn't help smirking.  Vallius was no lord or knight, though he did know how to raise and use a sword and shield if he needed to.  However, he wrestled with horses all day long and was responsible for taming the unbroken ones Lord Vanderstorm had the tendency to buy.  Vallius knew he was strong and muscled.  Plenty of maids had shown their appreciation of his form before.  However, he'd never had a noblewoman pay him much mind before, especially one so young.  He was pleased...and intrigued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVallius crossed over to the stable doorway, stopping a couple feet in front of Eldonia and bowing genteelly.  \"My lady,\" he said quietly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia's eyes widened.  His voice was low and soft, and she figured it was the same sort of voice he used when taming horses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-hello,\" she stammered.  \"You must be Vallius.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes.  We've never been properly introduced before, but I take it my brother or my father mentioned me to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVallius took in the sight of the girl before him and couldn't help the way his heart began to pound.  She was lovely:  long hair just a bit tangled, tall enough to reach his breastbone, slender but curvy in all the right places.  A blush was still on her cheeks.  She was truly entrancing.  However, his eyes narrowed when he caught sight of the tear tracks on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe dug a handkerchief out of his pocket and offered it to her.  \"Are you alright, my lady?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia was startled at his concern, but took the handkerchief and dabbed at her eyes before blowing her nose.  She sighed and said, \"Not really, but I don't feel like talking about it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, if there's anything I can do....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia looked up and saw the concern and tenderness in Vallius's eyes.  She bit back a sob.  How could a stable-boy--a very handsome stable-boy who was practically a man--show such attention to her when he barely knew her, while her own husband could barely stand the sight of her and ran her away with a hammer in his fist?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout realizing it, she flung herself at Vallius and clung to him tightly as new tears rolled down her cheeks to wet his sweaty tunic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVallius was caught completely off-guard by Eldonia.  He couldn't believe she was hugging him as if her life depended on it!  Her young, soft body was pressed tightly against his, and Vallius closed his eyes against the lust that began to course through his veins.  She was the lady of the house--married to fierce Lord Vanderstorm--and she was completely off-limits to more than looking!  However,...she obviously needed some comfort.  Vallius hesitantly brought his arms up and wrapped them loosely around Eldonia's shaking frame.  He leaned his head down to whisper gentle, soothing words in her ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia lost herself in the boy's strong arms.  They held her so gently, yet she could feel the strength and protection they offered.  She hadn't felt that in so long....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe raised her face to gaze into his.  His eyes were kind and full of compassion.  He lifted a hand to brush the wetness off her cheek, and Eldonia sighed into the caress.  How she missed a man's touch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout thinking, she raised herself up on her tiptoes and began to run a hand along his bulging bicep and the corded muscles on his shoulder and neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVallius's eyes widened, and he gulped audibly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M-my lady!  What...what are you...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia pulled his head down and brought their lips together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVallius was initially in shock!  She was...kissing him!  HIM--the lowly son of the stable master!  He wouldn't...he shouldn't...!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut as Eldonia began moving her lips against his, slowly stroking his bottom lip with her tongue, Vallius was lost!  He moaned and crushed her to him, beginning to move his mouth fiercely against hers!  She opened her lips to him and he plunged his tongue into the warm, sweet cavern.  Her body began moving rhythmically against his own, and Vallius groaned as his body and groin tightened in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVallius was just about to haul her up in his arms and take her to the nearest horse stall so that they could continue what they started, when a fierce voice cut through the blood pounding in his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT IN THE WORLD IS GOING ON HERE?!?!\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Eldonia screamed! She felt herself being pulled back and thrown to the ground! As she tried to fight off the dizziness, she heard a heavy, meaty \"THUD!!\" and a grunting noise! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YOU BASTARD!\" she recognised the voice...who was it...She took a deep breath and her thoughts cleared. She got to her feet, shakily! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fortis! Fortis stop it!\" she squealed! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis had pinned Vallius to the side of the stable-block! He held him easily in one hand while with his other hand he pounded away, beating at his chest, abdomen and face! Eldonia could hear Fortis's heavy breathing and the sweat on his face! He was FURIOUS! She hadn't seen him THIS angry since someone had dared to touch his sister!...And now someone had dared to touch his wife!...How romantic!...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then Eldonia snapped out of it! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fortis!\" she cried out, \"Fortis STOP IT!\" she shouted. She rushed forwards but Fortis shoved her back! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVallius was obviously very strong. He would have to be, to hold back wild stallions!...But before long, Fortis had beat him into an unconscious, bloody pulp! Vallius staggered away, clutching a broken jaw and bleeding nose! Fortis grabbed him by the throat and pulled him in close! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're a good stable-boy, Vallius...\" Fortis whispered softly. \"...which is why you're still alive. But if you touch my wife like that again, I will PERSONALLY slice you open like a pig and strangle you with your own entrails...Hmm?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVallius nodded and quickly backed away, the moment Fortis released him! Eldonia rushed forwards! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fortis! Fortis how DARE YOU!\" she squealed. She cowered under the look that Fortis now gave her! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How dare I?\" he sneered, \"HOW DARE YOU! DISGRACE ME IN FRONT OF A STABLE-BOY!\" he roared! Eldonia was sure the entire county heard it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Eldonia could muster a response, Fortis was carrying her bodily from the stable-block! She kicked and struggled, but Fortis never let her go! As far as he was concerned, this was a private disgrace, and so he took a route upstairs that the servant-girls wouldn't see. He carried her into his bedroom, slammed the doors and locked them! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YOU BITCH!\" he roared! Eldonia screamed as Fortis smacked her in the face! She gasped in pain! Fortis had NEVER hit her before!...In fact he'd never hit ANYONE who he didn't think deserved it! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HOW DARE YOU!\" he shouted. \"YOU ARE MY WIFE! CARRYING ON WITH A STABLE-BOY LIKE A COMMON STREET-SLUT!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"F-f-f-Fortis!\" Eldonia stammered, \"I...I...I only w-wanted -t-t...\" she began. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"DID HE START FUCKING YOU, BITCH!?\" Fortis roared, \"HUH!? IF HIS DICK SO MUCH AS SNIFFED YOU, HE'S GONNA BE VERY LONELY REAL QUICK!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NO!\" Eldonia gasped! She didn't want Vallius to get into even more trouble! \"No! He didn't do anything! He kissed me!...I kissed him! That's all!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YOU...YOU ARE MY WIFE YOU BITCH!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AM I!?\" Eldonia screamed back! She knew Minerva was a tender, soft and meek creature, but that she also had a lot of inner strength! Now, Eldonia knew where, how, and WHY Minerva had such inner strength! She would have to have a lot of moxy to fight back against her older brothers! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I DON'T THINK ANYONE WOULD KNOW!\" she continued, \"YOU HAVEN'T TOUCHED ME IN A MONTH!\" she shrieked! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I HAVE WORK!\" Fortis roared, \"THIS WHOLE FUCKING ESTATE NEEDS WORK! ROOVES FIXED! PUMPS FIXED! AND IF I DON'T FIX THE WATERWHEEL AT THE MILL YOU CAN KISS THOSE LITTLE SUGAR-CAKES OF YOURS GOODBYE!! WHERE THE FUCK DO YOU THINK THE FLOUR FOR THOSE THINGS COMES FROM!?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia gasped!...Gulped!...And burst into tears! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"ALL YOU THINK ABOUT IS YOURSELF YOU SKANKY LITTLE BITCH!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fortis! I love you! I'll always love...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"BULLSHIT! YOUR CUNT'S OPEN WIDER THAN A BARN DOOR! PERHAPS I SHOULD'VE SEEN IT EARLIER! WE HAVE SOMETHING BETWEEN US! OR HAVE YOU FORGOTTEN!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There hasn't been anything between us for four weeks!\" she shrieked! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT THE FUCK DO YOU CALL THAT THING IN THE NEXT ROOM!?\" Fortis bellowed, \"A RAG DOLL!? PERHAPS I SHOULD JUST THROW IT INTO THE FURNACE AND GET RID OF IT!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia suddenly realised what Fortis was talking about!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NO!\" she gaped, \"No you wouldn't! You couldn't! DON'T YOU DARE!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHY NOT!? IT'S NOT LIKE YOU GIVE A SHIT! Fine! Let the heir to the manor, the title, the estate...let his mother be a slut who opens herself up for the likes of stable-boys, farm-hands, blacksmith's sons! AT LEAST KEEP TO YOUR STATION GIRL! You DEGRADE yourself like this and your precious little brat's gonna grow up with a WHORE for a mother! IS THAT WHAT YOU WANT!?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! NO!\" Eldonia said, \"Fortis please stop!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis lashed out again! Eldonia tired to duck but she squealed as a stinging \"SMACK!\" hit her in the face! She burst into tears! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"F-f-fFortis I'-I'm sorry!\" she sobbed, \"I...I only m-meant to...to...I love you! I wanna be with you! But you weren't touching me!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I HAVE WORK YOU BITCH! WHEN WORK IS DONE I'LL FUCK YOUR BRAINS OUT SO HARD YOU WON'T WALK FOR A WEEK!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnder normal circumstances, the very IDEA of that would've made Eldonia tingle with anticipation...but not now... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sank to her knees, \"Fortis please I love you! I don't wanna hurt you like this! I'm sorry!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis was about to raise his hand again, but a \"CLICK!\" made him stop. He turned to see Minerva standing behind him! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe forgot that he'd given her a master-key to the locks around the castle, in case of an emergency! In the break and distraction, Minerva rushed to her friend's side!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eldonia!\" she gasped, she stared at the heavy bruises on her face! She turned at once to her brother! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"FORTIS HOW DARE YOU!\" she shrieked! Both Eldonia AND Fortis jumped at this! Neither of them had heard Minerva scream before! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stay outta this, girl...\" Fortis rumbled softly. \"Now!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will not!\" said Minerva, \"How DARE you strike your wife like this!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How dare I?\" Fortis whispered, \"DO YOU KNOW WHAT THIS SKANK SLUT DID!? CARRYING ON WITH A STABLE-BOY BRINGING SHAME ON OUR ENTIRE HOUSE! The Vanderstorms have stood for strength and honour for generations! That was what gave us this land and our titles and money that you enjoy so much! SHE doesn't GIVE A SHIT!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis raised his hand again! Minerva stepped at once between Fortis and his wife! Fortis swung down!...and stopped an inch from his sister's face! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs furious as he was, Minerva knew that Fortis would NEVER dare to strike his sister. The treasure and angel that he worshipped and adored with every fibre of his being. He would never forgive himself if he'd hurt her! And Minerva knew that Fortis knew that she knew this. He seethed, balling his fists, clenching and unclenching them, flexing his massive arms. Against Fortis's aggressions, Minerva was the most powerful kind of shield in the entire kingdom. Everyone knew that the gigantic, hulking, tempermental mountain lord would never dare to hurt a hair on her head! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The old woman collapsed into it, gasping! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Granny?\" Minerva said, \"Are you alright?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took a deep breath.

Something she hadn't done since he was a toddler, and got tangled up in grandpa's chainmail... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gran! Do you even CARE about this stuff!?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I care!\" she said hotly, \"But don't you DARE lay a finger on your wife like that! You wish to talk of disgrace!? How of a Vanderstorm male showing such disrespect towards his lady!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"DIS...\" Fortis began, but his grandmother cut him off! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes!\" she said with surprising spunk for a woman approaching seventy! \"You ought to be ashamed of yourself!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gran!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am NOT saying that I defend Eldonia or what she has done!\" Lady Athena said. \"Of course you have right to be angry!\" she said, \"But I am APPALLED that you should strike her thus! Fortis I would've expected a lot better from you! You treat your sister with delicacy and grace! I would expect that you treat your wife the same!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I would!\" Fortis scoffed. \"See grandmother, Minerva moves and acts with delicacy and grace, which is why she gets the treatment that she does...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis tried to reach out to his sister, who only stepped back! He shrugged a huge shoulder and went on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But THIS...Carrying on with a stable-boy is hardly delicate or graceful! So you expect me to treat her the same!?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Fortis! It was hardly a carry-on!\" Lady Athena said. \"You neglected your wife's desires! She was frustrated! And Vallius is a handsome young man! She was taken with him! she needed satisfaction! Since you couldn't provide it, she needed someone else! It was a hug and a kiss! That was all! Sometimes you are far too jealous for your own good!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I AM NOT JEALOUS!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eldonia should've known better!\" Athena continued. \"She comes from a noble family like ours. Her father should've taught her how a married woman should act! My darling, you must understand that Fortis has duties! Not only to you, but to the entire estate! That does NOT mean that you are less important! It just means that all his work is to make you happy! If you really wish to be happy, then you must understand this and give him room! You must be patient!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia sighed and nodded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kissing the stable-boy and trying to make your husband jealous so that he'll spend time with you is NOT the way to entice him into your bed!...Believe me, I've tried...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone stared at Lady Athena. She blushed...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh it was a long time ago!\" she said. \"It's not important now. But what IS important, Eldonia, is that you understand this! Now I don't want to hear anymore about all this! Fortis, you and your wife are going to communicate with each other, and be understanding of each other! And if you EVER touch her again, Fortis, I am cutting you out of my will!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you promised me grandpa's ceremonial sword!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I will. But if you touch her like that again, I'll personally see that it's broken up and melted!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis remembered seeing the sword only once. Grandfather had never shown it to him. Ever. But he'd seen it on top of grandpa's coffin when he'd died. He'd begged granny to give it to him and she'd removed it from the coffin before the entombment. She said that when she died, it would go to him as a gift...if he was good. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis gulped. He thought that sword was the coolest thing in the world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAthena knew that she had her grandson cornered. She'd been around enough enormous, proud, egotistical, swaggering Mountain lords in her time, to know that you didn't need weapons or strength to break them down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you say?\" she said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry grandmother...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe cleared her throat loudly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I promise\", he said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's better.

Fortis sighed. \"I'll go get some ointment for that....\" he said, looking at his wife's face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Since when do YOU have ointment!?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What, a man can't keep a few beauty products around?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia stared at her best friend. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you hear that, Minnie?? Our gigantic super-protector keeps moisturizer and salves and ointments around his room! To keep his skin smooooooth and SOFT...Do you shave your legs too, sweetheart?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinerva let out a choking laugh! Fortis scoffed! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know I don't!\" he said. \"Go on, girl!\" he said to his sister. \"I'll see you later. Me and the Lady here have um...business to uh...touch...grope!...HANDLE!...ATTEND TO!...Damn it!...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia laughed and Minerva let out a teary smile. She approached her brother and hugged him. She hugged him hard and gave him a sisterly kiss on the cheek. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's for being nice...\" she whispered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWHACK!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ow! Bitch!!\" Fortis grunted as his sister struck him across the face! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"THAT is for being naughty!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe kissed him again and left the room. </span></div></div>",

She saw them outside, dueling with swords. Her grandmother sat at the table, drinking coffee. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Morning dear!\" she said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinerva smiled. She helped herself to toast, bacon, eggs, sausages, beans, tomatoes, potatoes and mushrooms, from the sideboard, and sat down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you sleep well?\" she asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes grandmother\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm surprised that you did\", she said. \"Fortis was making a lot of noise last night\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I'm sorry gran'ma, did I wake you up?\" a voice said.

She smiled at her handsome young muscle-lord and put down a pot of fresh coffee. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no, Butterscotch! Back inside! Back to the kitchen!\" Mrs. Tibbs said. A fat, toffee-coloured bunny hopped into the dining-room, looking for food-scraps. Two cute girls ran out into the dining-room to catch it! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come back here, Butters!\" Katie cried out. She grabbed the bunny and held it tight. \"I got it, Lucy!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe curtsied to Lord Vanderstorm, \"Sorry, my lord! Butterscotch got away from his hutch...\" she said, and rushed back to the kitchens, holding the bloated furball in her arms. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're very attached to it, my lord\", Mrs. Tibbs said. Fortis nodded understandingly. He'd gotten more used to the rabbit, of late. He still didn't approve of the fact that it succeeded in devouring half his vegetable-crop...but it did make a nice addition to the household. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMrs. Tibbs retreated to the kitchen. Just then, Eldonia entered. Minerva turned in her seat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Morning! Did you...My goodness what happened to you!?\" she gasped. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia looked messy and sleepy. Her hair was all tangled and she had bruises on her wrists and arms! Minerva immediately turned back to her brother! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you...!\" she began. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We had a little um...exercise...last night...\" Fortis said. \"We might've gotten a..a little carried away...\" he blushed. Eldonia giggled. \"Stop it!\" she squealed. She hurried to her husband's side and kissed him. \"But not so rough tonight, sweetums...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tonight, huh?\" Fortis said huskily. \"Well alright...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeuch!\" Minerva retched! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh come on, girl!\" Fortis said, \"I've seen how you look at that cute Prince of yours.

She wasn't sure what was more revolting! When Fortis and Eldonia were at each other's throats, or when they were just AT each other! She stared at her grandmother, who seemed to have gone deaf! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't you have anything to say about this!?\" she asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh darling! I'm much too old to make a fuss!\" she said. \"Besides, when you reach my age, nothing becomes a shock to you, anymore!\" she added. \"Pass the pepper dearest...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinerva sighed and passed the pepper-grinder to her grandmother. Lady Athena made a show of not being strong enough to turn the grinding-knob. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fortis darling, would you mind?\" she asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis got up and lumbered over to his grandmother. He bent over her, grabbed the grinder and began turning. She watched as his huge chest, shoulder and arm-muscles bulged and rippled. Yes, that Eldonia had picked a FINE specimen of Mountanian stock. As Fortis bent over to put the grinder back... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In my day, we used to enjoy doing it outdoors\", she carried on, as if nothing had happened. \"The old barn was a particular favourite of...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Grandma!\" Minerva said, shocked that her grandmother talked like this! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?

Why was papa not playing with her!? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, a monstrous arm lashed out, grabbed her and pulled her under the covers, stifling a shriek of surprise! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe huge arm crushed the toddler against a solid wall of meat, enveloping her in muscles. She felt the huge lump roll over, roll on top of her! And then she found herself on the peaks of a pair of solid chest-muscles. She stared down at the giant who lay under her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Papa...?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"RRRRAWWWWWRRRRR!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEK!!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hahahahaha!! Whatcha want, huh babygirl? Wakin' up your papa like this, huh? Don'tcha know papa likes to sleep in, huh?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wubb you papa...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n*kiss!* <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awww alright...Muah!...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis choked his daughter as he enveloped her in a huge hug. \"Sweet little babygirl...little angel...Little sweetie muffin-pie...Huh? You a sweet little babygirl?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAstil giggled. \"Yaaaah...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good girl! Muah! Papa's little angel...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, the doors burst open as the two boys came bounding in! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey pops!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeonardo and Dynamos Vanderstorm bounded in and jumped onto the bed! Astril squealed! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey girl!\" said Leo, hugging his baby sister. Minerva leaned against the doorway. Apparently her nephews had picked up her brother's bad habit, but she smiled it off. Fortis hugged his three kids and kissed them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehehe...Crazy kids...\" he said. \"Come on, let's go have some breakfast...\" </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis yawned. Oh man what a dream...He rolled over and looked at the clock...Oh he wanted it to be a lazy day. He could go back to sleep and dream about his future kids...He wondered what Astril would be like when she was a little older... </span></div></div>",

You can do better than that!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA young Astril massaged her wrist, where the blunt-edge practice-sword had smacked into it.

She shared her father's blond hair, which had been braided into pigtails. She hugged him and kissed him. She was now 13, but was as petite and adorable as ever. Fortis hugged her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Leo, it's your job and the job of your brother Dynamos to see that babygirl's looked after properly. As her brothers it's your duty to defend her honour and her safety\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, pops! But I still think she should learn how to use a sword!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Grandmother says a true lady never uses a sword!\" Astril said. \"Right granny!?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn ancient noblewoman shuffled forwards on her walkig-stick. \"Eh?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLady Athena sat down carefully. \"What's that?\" she asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I said...You told me...a lady never uses a sword!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?

He held up one of the swords. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh SWORDS!\" the old woman screeched. She laughed. \"Absolutely! A sweet thing shouldn't have to rely on such weapons! She should carry a dagger! And have honourable menfolk to protect her virtues!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hear that, boys?\" Fortis asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes father...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAstril hugged her great-grandmother. \"Love you granny...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"LOVE YOU, GRANNY!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awwwww...Muah! Love you too, sweetums...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis hugged his grandmother. She was nearly ninety now, and had started to lose her hearing, but she was still strong and determined. She clutched something in one hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's that, granny?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh?...Oh...A letter...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh-huh...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis pried it out of his grandmother's hand. He recognised the writing, and unfolded the already opened letter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh...The Crown Princess Minerva...Awww...wishes the company of her brother, the Earl Vanderstorm and his extended family...to attend the birthday of her husband...His Royal Highness...Crown Prince Cassius...Huh...How nice...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's a very nice boy...\" Lady Athena said. \"Very sweet...She's very lucky to marry him...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you saying I wasn't lucky, granny?\" Eldonia said, entering the yard. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wasn't lucky!?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh!...Oh of course you are!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia hugged her husband. The final years of teenage life, and pegnancies, had spurred on her development into womanhood. She was now over six feet tall. Still nowhere near as tall as her husband...but at least now she didn't get a sore neck when she tried to kiss him on the cheek! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</i></span></div></div>",

He opened his eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding over him was a spunky teenaged girl. She had an impressive body, which was scantily clad in a soft, shimmering gown. She was about fifteen, and very attractive. She got on her knees and rubbed her hands over her father's chest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I love you papa...\" she said. She kissed him. \"Papa...will you play with me?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis stared at his daughter. PLAY with her? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe thrust something into his hands, \"Come on, papa!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis stared at the object - a large duelling-sword. He sighed. \"You really want to?\" he asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAstril nodded. \"Yeah!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You REALLY want to?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis grabbed his daughter and hauled her over his lap, hugging her roughly! He tickled her around the waist and she screamed! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You wanna play, huh girl!? Huh!?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAstril screamed and kicked! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop! Stop! Hahahahahaahaha!! Papa! Papa stop!! It hehehehe...it tickles!!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis laughed and hugged his daughter and kissed her on the cheek. He got up and she jumped off him. Fortis picked up the sword and unsheathed it. She rushed to grab her own sword and soon, father and daughter were circling each other in the parlour, taking swipes at each other, back and forth! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAstril's sword was a beautiful, feminine weapon. Light and strong. Not very long, but extremely sharp and well-balanced...much like her own physique and personality. Fortis's sword was enormous, solid, heavy, battle-scarred and dominating...much like his own physique and personality. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Up! Back! Don't forget your other hand, girl! Use both if you need to!...Down! Good! Back...watch your feet, girl! You're gonna fall over!...No...like this!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis grabbed his daughter by the arm! She squealed as she lost balance! Fortis caught her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Careful! Here watch...back...out...feet apart...always have one foot back...never like this. All it takes is one good strike and you'll end up on your ass! Remember: brace yourself well on the ground!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAstril smiled, \"You don't have to teach me, papa! I know how to do it! Besides...Once I'm married, isn't it the husband's job to protect his wife?\" she asked. \"That's what granny used to say\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And your granny was right. But that's providing you find a husband!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis frowned at his daughter. He knew that she liked to...sample the board...but he did wish that she'd settle on one boy, sooner or later. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why didn't you go for that boy with the red hair? The Duke of Pumicia's son?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lord Wolverius? Eugh! He's so up-himself, pa! Oooh look at me, I'm the cute fiery redhead playboy. C'mere girl, let me show you how we do it in Volcanoland...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis laughed. \"What about that other boy? Lord Poseidon?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's cute, but he's...he's so...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tame?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...PERFECT! I dunno! Sometimes, I think he's a fruitcake or something. A boy who acts like a boy does NOT have skin and teeth THAT perfect! I'm sure you didn't when you married mother!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis laughed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And who do you have your sights set on right now?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lord Octavius...\" she said, dreamily, with a sparkle in her eye. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis remembered. He was tall, dashing, young. A bit old for his daughter, but noble and kind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't think he was your type...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You haven't seen him between the sheets...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"ASTRIL! PRESERVE YOURSELF!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAstril giggled, \"I was only joking, papa! I wanna get MARRIED before I have kids! I don't want to be left all on my own!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis nodded. \"Good girl...\" he said. </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis yawned. He'd had enough sleep...He better get up and see what else needed doing around the house. Eldonia was curled up in bed. He gave her a soft kiss, and then slipped out of the room to let her sleep. </span></div></div>",

He shuffled down the corridor towards the nursery. For now, just one baby would do...soon he might have more...but not too soon... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis entered the nursery.

Fortis listened and counted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Clang-clang clang-clang-clang!!!...Clang-clang...clang-clang-clang!!!...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDong!...Dong!...Dong!...Dong!...Dong!...Dong!...Dong!...Dong!...Ding!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe melody bells, the hour-bells, and one half-tone bell. Eight thirty at night. The monks and nuns in the abbey must be preparing for evening chores. Fortis ignored the tolling bells and kept on walking. In the valley between the surrounding hills, with a river running through it, was the sleepy village of Dynamos. It was this village, the buildings around it, and the surrounding countryside and farmland over which the Vanderstorm family had ruled for generations. Fortis strolled through the village, the cobblestone streets, the houses and buildings, built of stone and brick and wood and wattle and daub, with tiled or thatched roofs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA couple of bridges crossed the river in the middle of town. Built along the banks of the river near one bridge, was the village watermill. Here, farmers brought their wheat and other grains to be ground into flour, their olives to be crushed into oil, or their grapes to be turned to wine. Branching off from the mill were the village bakery and wine-merchant's establishments. Some of the windows and doors were still open as villagers did last-minute trading. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good evening Mr. Von Pann\", said Fortis. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA plump baker smiled up at the towering young nobleman who stood at the serving-window of his bakery. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My lord! Good eventide! Could I favour you with um...some of my cheese rolls? Or the ham croissants? We have some leftover flour-loaves if you would like some...excellent with olive-oil and chili-sauce...A very suitable snack for the summertime!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, no\", said Fortis. \"Do you have any of those little cinnamon sugar-rolls that your wife makes?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooooh I'm sorry! All sold out this afternoon! Very popular they are. Never hang around very long!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA short, slim, young, good-looking teenage boy about fourteen approached the window. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Flavius! You should be in bed!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry papa. I couldn't sleep. I'm going out for a walk\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't you wander far now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No papa\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYoung Flavius Von Pann left the village bakery and walked down the main road with Fortis. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes papa, no papa, three bags full, papa...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis chuckled. \"He only wants to show you he loves you\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah! But he doesn't seem to realise that I have OTHER things that I want to do!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis nodded. There seemed to be a lot of that going around. But he said nothing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the end of the street was a large building. Four storeys high, and a cellar beneath. This was the <i>Hammer and Tongs</i>, the local public house. It was the haunt of everyone from farmhands to shopworkers, carpenters, blacksmiths, farriers, coopers, wheelwrights and chandlers. In a scene that might never be seen in Fatlantis, both men and women drank at the Hammer. And it wasn't unknown for men to bring their wives in for a good drink and a quick jaunt in one of the spare bedrooms upstairs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Hammer and Tongs' ground floor was for food and drink. Upstairs on the next two floors were bedrooms for rent. The very top floor was the living-quarters for the publican and his family. The cellar and basement stored supplies and other things that the pub needed. It was combination tavern, restaurant, boarding-house and rest-inn for travellers. Abd as usual around this time of night, business was booming. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You want a drink, boy?\" Fortis asked, looking at Flavius. Flavius shook his head. \"Thank you, m'lud. No thank you!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis shrugged, \"Suit yourself...\" he mumbled. Fortis needed something to take his mind off the stupid fight he had with Eldonia. He headed inside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tavern was orange with the light of candles, lamps and the huge fire in the far end of the room. The windows were all open, letting in a soft breeze. The locals gathered around tables. In the corner, four men sang along to a drunken composition on a secondhand harpsichord which hadn't been tuned since the dawn of time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis approached the bar. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"BACCHUS!\" he shouted over the drunken singing in the back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA large, burly, older man in his forties approached from the kitchen out the back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hurry up with those burgers, Martha! Those watermen are hungry bastards!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It'll be ready when it's ready!\" a woman's voice called from the kitchen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M'lord!\" said Bacchus, walking down the bar towards his chief customer. Bacchus was nine feet tall, solidly built. He had not the male model, chiseled physique that Fortis had, but years of splitting stone and felling trees had grown him a solid, barrel chest and abdomen, with thick, muscly arms. He had a stubbly beard and hair on his arms and chest. He was only wearing a pair of breeches, sandals and a large, leather apron tied around his waist. His hair, messy medium brown, was damp with sweat from the heat of the candles and the fires in the kitchen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good evening Bacchus\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M'lord. What'll be his lordship's pleasure this evenin'?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever's good, whatever's cheap, whatever's strong\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooh...that'll be one of everythin' exceptin' those fine bottles of Lucian brandy...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis groaned, \"I'm in no mood for your jokes tonight, Bacchy...Just fill me up\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Trouble at home, eh?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis groaned. The bartender/landlord smiled. \"The estate's been a bit of a mess since your father died, hmm?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's been a mess BEFORE he died! I'm trying to fix the fucking thing up! And the Missus wants stuff that I can't give her!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can't?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBacchus had known Fortis since he was a child. For a Mountain lord to suggest a lack of...\"ability\"...was rare. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay fine, something that I WON'T give her!\" Fortis grumbled, if the man was going to be picky about phraseology. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Too worn out from work to be worn out by the wife, huh?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You could say that\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm...I'll get you some gin\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis watched as the bartender prepared him a gin and tonic. Fortis gulped it down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gurrghhh! What is that!? You clean sword-wounds with that stuff or something!?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...but it's also my strongest gin\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh! Tastes like something I use to clean my paintbrushes in!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perhaps some beer would be better...\" said the bartender, filling up a huge flagon. Fortis nodded and started gulping it down. He was gonna just sit here...and drink...and drink...and drink... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She had fallen asleep in the parlour, in front of the fire, her great-grandson slumbering in her lap. She smiled and kissed him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello baby Leo!\" she said, stroking him. The chubby-faced infant googled and drooled at his grandmother, who kissed him. She turned to see Eldonia hurrying downstairs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's all this noise about!?\" she asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh granny!\" said Eldonia, hurrying into the parlour, \"Oh Fortis and I had a big fight! And he ran away and left me!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh don't be ridiculous, girl!\" said Lady Athena, \"Sit down and tell me what happened\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I had a big fight with Fortis! He never spends TIME with me anymore! He hasn't touched me or held me or shown...intimacy...in weeks! What's wrong!?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My dear, perhaps you forget your position in this household. My first grandson is lord of this estate and these lands. He has a duty to his people, and to our great king! And his duties must come first! You do not think we live our lives as we do purely out of royal generosity, do you? To retain our land, our money and our position, Fortis must prove himself worthy of the title which the king's ancestors hath bestowed upon our family\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know that! But...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My son, Fortis's father, was not the most attentive of landlords\", Lady Athena said. \"Many buildings on the estate crucial for the sustaining of life in this part of the kingdom were left in a state of disrepair! The sawmill, the watermill, the storehouses and the mines! Fortis MUST have them all attended to, usually personally, if he is to keep his position! They not only keep our land and our people in good footing, they also produce the materials which are required as taxes! if he cannot pay them, we shall lose our land! You don't want that, do you?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia blushed. \"I...I suppose not...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My dear! You have married a FINE young man! He's handsome, he's principled. He's strong, powerfully-built, he's careful and attentive, he's intelligent and he is not a rogue! You should be thankful to have a husband with so many excellent qualities...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I am!...I just wish he'd show them on ME!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He will when he can, my darling! It is the lot of us women to bear. We must be tolerant and understanding of our menfolk. When we give them room, they shall reward us for our patience. Remember the old adage...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Patience is a virtue, possess it if thou can\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLady Athena nodded, and gestured, encouraging Eldonia to continue. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...often found in women, and seldom in a man\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLady Athena laughed. \"Not always true, but generally so\", she said. \"Remember it and keep it, my dear. He acts how he does because he loves you and he cares for you! I know, it's a strange way of showing it, but by getting these tasks done, even at the expense of your relationship, is a way of showing love! He is doing everything he can to see that you continue to enjoy the life you have!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia blushed...and then burst into tears! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh granny Athena you're right!\" she groaned, \"I've been so selfish! Fortis is a wonderful husband! I've been so MEAN to him!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There there...\" said Athena. Eldonia hugged her baby, Leonardo, cradling him in her arms. She passed him back to Athena. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm going to find Fortis! I need to speak to him! Where did he go!?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've no idea! But if I know Fortis, he's probably gone to the Hammer and Tongs Public House to indulge in some...liquid comfort\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm going out to find him!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My dear! You can't go out this late at night! And certainly NOT without an escort! It is not safe for a woman!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't care! I need to find him! I feel so terrible! You made me see how hard he works to do the things that make me love him in the first place!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia snatched up her cloak and a lantern, and rushed out of the castle into the night... </span></div></div>",

Although she had spent most of her time with Fortis living at his family estate of Castle Vanderstorm, she was sure that she would know the way to the nearby village of Dynamos! It was only a mile or so down the road. But as she headed along and through the woods that grew along the banks of the river nearby, she lost her way in the dark. She stopped and looked around. Which way to the village? The gaps in the trees were all wide enough that any one of them might lead back to the road which she had unconsciously wandered off of. Which gap did she go through to find the road again? And if she did, which way did she go thereafter? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia fumbled through the woods, alone and scared! Fortis had gifted her a dagger as a wedding-present. In her haste and foolishness, she hadn't brought it with her! Without her knife, she began to feel incredibly vulnerable. Woods had scary creatures in them at night! Foxes, wolves, and terrors which had no name at all! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia rushed through the woods, completely disoriented! She tripped and fell! Her lantern smashed on the ground and the candles within were snuffed out! She swore, using extremely choice language for a lady of fine breeding, and sat on a stone in the pitch black! What on EARTH was she going to do now!? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she sat there, feeling sorry for herself and wondering what she had gotten herself in for, she noticed lights in the distance.

She stopped and leaned against a tree, panting and groaning! She watched the lamp-bearer get closer and closer, weaving drunkenly from side to side. Coming through the air like ripples on a pond, she could hear heavy-sounding, drunken singing. It was some old Mountanian ballard that her grandfather used to sing for her when she was a little girl. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Mountania, Mountania, thou harsh land of stone and snow, <br>\r\nOf wilderness and loveliness, of trees and gold and woe,<br>\r\nOf treachery and wonderment, of grace and beauty fair, <br>\r\nIt's where I stand, here hand, in hand, with my dear maiden fair...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mountania, Mountania, our kingdom strong and braaaaaav--*hiccup!*...e...<br>\r\nOf knights and shields and open fields, of wheat and barley there...BURRRP!!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia gasped! She recognised that voice! It was Fortis!...But so different! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia had never known that her husband could SING before...and so beautifully! Usually Fortis's voice was tough, soft, and grumbly, always slightly sarcastic and mocking in tone. But here...it was rich and deep and heavy...a soothing bass or baritone sound that echoed through the trees. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt echoed somewhat worse than it might, after several pints of strong Mountanian ale, but to Eldonia it sounded beautiful! She sat on a stone as her husband weaved his way closer and closer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...We mine thy hills for gold and gems, diamonds bright, <br>\r\nAnd large as hen's...*hic!*...eggsssszzz...We fish thy streams, <br>\r\nIn go-gold-gollllden b-beams from s-sunlight up above! <br>\r\nOur lives, forsooth, with thee, in truth, are...are...aaah fuck...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia giggled as her husband forgot the rest of the words. She took a deep breath. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Our lives, forsooth, with thee, in truth, are filled with gladsome joy, <br>\r\nMountania, Mountania, fine land, for girl, and boy...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis giggled drunkenly and staggered into view. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He...he...Hick!!...h-hey-hey gw-...w-wo-wom...wummun...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWHUNK!! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia squealed as her husband collapsed on the road! She hurried over to him! She sniffed his mouth. Eugh!! He must've been drinking for hours! No wonder he passed out! She knelt down over his body and slapped his face! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Forty! Forty wake up!\" she cried out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uuurrgghhhmmm...Pretty baby girl...\" he mumbled drunkenly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Foooorty...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis reached out groping at the mirage before him...but then his hand hit something solid! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WAAARRGGHHH!! whw-what...wwhere...wh-w-who...why...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Forty it's alright!

Well,...at least in his drunken state, he wanted her.  Eldonia knew that Fortis often became horny when he'd had a bit too much to drink, and this time was no different.  But should she really take advantage of her husband's \"incapacitation\" and get what she needed, what she wanted, from him?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis moaned and ran his hands roughly up and down her sides before hauling her close to his hard, muscled form.  He cursed at feeling her lovely soft body against his firm, angled planes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woman...y-you feel...sho good agains' me.  Mmmmm...been wantin' you fer...a looooong time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia giggled and threw her arms around Fortis's neck.  While she didn't care for his beer-breath, she wasn't going to pass up this long-awaited opportunity!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've been wanting you for an even longer time, my lord!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis, holding her near, staggered over to the nearest tree and pressed her back against it.  He in turn pressed his own body tightly against hers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia moaned at feeling the evidence of her husband's arousal press firmly into her stomach.  It made heat bloom in her belly.  She had gone for so long without her husband's attentions, she wondered how long both of them would last in this naughty tryst out in the woods.  Despite the chill of the winter night, Eldonia felt sweat begin to bead on her forehead.  Between her body heating up with lust and Fortis's naturally high body temperature surrounding her, she felt as if she were near an inferno.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis left sloppy kisses along her cheek and jaw and then down her neck.  His hands meanwhile fumbled with her bodice, clumsily molding and plumping her generous breasts and roughly tweaking her nipples through her dress.  Eldonia gasped at his rough treatment, but she relished it after her month-long celibacy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis's hands suddenly left her chest to grasp her buttocks.  He hauled her up the tree, making her yelp as her back scraped along the tough bark of the tree behind her.  But, he soon was pressing his aching manhood against the cleft of her womanhood, making both of them moan with want, despite the layers of clothing between them.  Eldonia wrapped her legs around his trim waist, hooking her ankles together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis swore and spat.  Lust was clawing through his veins along with the pleasant fog of alcohol, and he was practically mindless with need as he roughly tore her skirts up her legs, baring her thighs to the cold, but also to his rough, warm hands.  He cursed again as he thrust against her, as there was still the barrier of his own pants between them!  Holding Eldonia easily up with one hand, he used his other hand to fumble with the ties of his pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stupid...blasted...ties...need...arrrg!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia giggled and pressed her lips against his hot and sweaty face and neck.  She dipped her hands under his shirt to stroke the firm, quivering muscles of his shoulders, back, and chest.  She loved her husband's strong form and how easily he held her pressed up against the tree.  If he weren't drunk, he'd probably be able to take her standing up without the support of anything else behind either of them!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, Fortis ripped open his trousers, drew out his long, hard cock, and drove into her with one rough thrust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia shrieked!  She felt practically ripped open!  It had been so long, she had forgotten how long and thick her husband was.  But...oh!  It felt so good to be so full and claimed by him again!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis panted and clenched his jaw.  He had forgotten how good his wife's tight, hot, wet sheath felt around him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Forty!\" Eldonia murmured, licking and kissing his ear.  \"You feel soooo good inside me!  Now, move!  Show me how much you want me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a roar, Fortis flexed his buttocks and began pumping hard and fast into his delicious, hot wife.  Eldonia screamed with every thrust, her pleasure building and building until she screamed out one last time, her body quivering helplessly as her senses exploded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis yelled as Eldonia clamped down around him tightly with her release, drawing his own orgasm from him.  He continued his harsh thrusts as he pumped his seed inside her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the cool winter air began to dry the sweat on their exposed skin, making them both shiver, Fortis slumped against Eldonia.  Eldonia groaned at feeling crushed between Fortis's well-muscled weight and the hard tree.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Forty?  Forty!  Don't you fall asleep on me!  We need to get home!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis moaned sleepily.  He felt sated and relaxed and tired and wanted nothing more than to fall asleep where he stood.  However, the cold was beginning to filter through his conscious now and cut through the haze of alcohol, sobering him up a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you...cold?\" he asked softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia nodded, shivering a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Keep your legs around me.  I'll car-carry you home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure you can manage?\"  She was skeptical of how stable he was on his own, let alone if he tried to balance her weight, too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis sighed, feeling a bit of a headache coming on.  How he wished for the oblivion of being drunk still.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll be fine.  The cold is waking me up a bit.  Besides....\"  He leered at her as he pushed them away from the tree, lowered her skirts around her legs as much as they could, and firmly wrapped his arms around her shapely back.  \"Walking home with you like this might give me an excuse to make love to you again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia gasped.  Fortis was still inside her, and she could feel him twitch and begin to harden again.  She smirked at him and pressed a sweet kiss to his lips, despite the lingering taste of spirits on his mouth.  No one could say her husband didn't have stamina!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, when you put it that way....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We have a lot of lost time to make up for, woman,\" he said, beginning the long, slow trek back home, enjoying the feel of his wife's heat still surrounding his tool.  \"I'm gonna show you how much I want you over and over and over again.  By the time we get home, you won't be able to stand because you'll have come so many times on my cock.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia shivered--this time not from the cold but from Fortis's words.  \"Yes!\" she moaned.  \"Please!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis chuckled.  \"As my lady wishes!\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The night was still dark and although he was revived by the cold, Fortis and Eldonia were still lost. In his drunken state, Fortis hadn't noticed where he was going, and Eldonia...well she was lost already. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nReluctantly removing his engorged edifice from its natural habitat, Fortis lowered his quivering queen to her feet, and gathered up his clothes. He wrapped an arm protectively around her shoulders and, picking up his lantern, they headed off down the road. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where ARE we?\" Eldonia whispered. Fortis frowned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dunno...this place looks so different at night\", he said. \"I THINK we're somewhere west of the Castle, but I can't tell without the sun-shadows...Fuck it's getting cold!\" he said. \"I don't really wanna try trekking any further tonight. It's so late and COLD!\" he said. Eldonia shivered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis kept on walking. Eventually, they reached a clearing in the road. Against one side was a small, wood and stone shack. It was a sort of run-down cabin. They strode up to it and Eldonia peeked through the windows. They were all shuttered up. Fortis rapped on the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello?\" he said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe rapped again. \"Hello!? Anyone home!?\" he shouted. \"This is your lord and master and I demand that you open this door at once!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill no answer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis looked to Eldonia, who shrugged. Fortis knew that the door was old. One good kick would blast it off its hinges. Fortis braced his shoulder and threw his weight against the door! The rusty old bolts cracked and split! The door swung inwards! Eldonia and her husband headed inside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cabin was dark and deserted, by the looks of it. There appeared to be a small kitchen, a hearth, a dining-area and a small living-area. And one separate room that appeared to be a bedchamber of some sort. Fortis shivered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was not yet properly winter, but the weather was getting colder and colder at nights these days. Fortis lit some of the candles that he found stuck in nails and bottles and in crude candleholders around the cabin, either side of the bed, the mantelpiece, and on the two small tables inside. Everything looked very rough and handmade. It must've been something like a woodcutter's cabin or something. By the look of it, nobody had lived here for years. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Forty I'm scared...\" said Eldonia. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry woman\", he said. \"It's just a cabin. And look, there's a fireplace. We could have a fire\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yes! Make a fire, Forty! I'm cold!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis headed outside. There was an old stack of firewood stored in a sort of lean-to firewood shelter next to the cabin. Fortis picked up some the logs and carried them inside. Fortis took out his dagger and, using another log as a mallet, he split one of the smaller logs into kindling-pieces and began to build a fire. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe frowned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong?\" Eldonia asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis had built the fire in the fireplace, and had opened the flue. He sighed, \"I can't light the fire without some sort of tinder\", he said. \"It won't burn if I just put a candle straight to the wood. I don't know how wet it is or how dry it is or how long it's been out there...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you need?\" Eldonia said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Something that burns real easily, gives off heat, and which will start the rest of the wood burning\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia frowned. Suddenly, she felt Fortis's hands on her! She gasped as he ripped off the lower part of her dress! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fortis!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey I already tore it open earlier\", he said, \"A bit more ain't gonna hurt it none\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you want to freeze to death!?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well no, but...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis stuffed the fabric into the fireplace, and lit the rags of cloth with the flame of his lantern. Before long, the kindling had caught fire. Fortis kept splitting small logs with his dagger and building up the blaze more, and more, and more. Soon, a huge, bright, hot fire filled the entire cabin. At least now they would be warm and safe. Or they hoped so. The two young lovers sat on the old couch in front of the fireplace, their arms around each other, both wrapped in blankets taken from the single bedroom next door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nInitially consumed by fear, they began to relax in the light and heat, and soon began to feel more and more comfortable. Comfortable enough in each others' arms...to...enjoy each other...again...and again...and again...And again. Until the old, wooden couch could no longer handle Fortis's weight, and the heavy vibrations of his violent, merciless penetrations. Eldonia was glad that they were in the middle of the woods...or someone else migiht've heard their...enjoyment. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After several very satisfying rounds of lovemaking, Fortis and Eldonia eventually fell into a relaxing and sated sleep.  The warmth of the fire in the little cabin and their combined body heat wrapped up in the old blanket, despite the lumpy, thin cushions on the couch, made for a cozy and relaxing atmosphere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, several hours later, something roused Fortis from a delightful dream.  He smirked to himself when he began to realize it wasn't just a dream.  His hard length was pressed intimately between the cheeks of his wife's bottom, and she was making soft whimpers in her sleep as he ground himself into her soft flesh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stilled in a flash, though, when the snap of a branch a ways off from the cabin caught his attention.  He held Eldonia tightly in his arms and lay absolutely motionless as his ears strained to hear anything else.  Eventually, he heard distant voices.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Haha!  What a night!  What a haul!\"<br>\r\n\"Well, you scoped out the place, Yuri!\"<br>\r\n\"'Course I did!  But we have them dumb Mountanians to thank for that!\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah!  They're too arrogant to protect their stuff from us!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis's eyebrows drew together.  He easily placed the accent of the men as Vladians.  What in the world would those nasty cretins be doing this far into Mountania?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man, Viktor, whoda thunk we'd fool them Mountanians so easily, eh?\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah, Loki!  I can't believe we've been able ta loot 'em so many times!\"<br>\r\n\"And so far inside the border!\"<br>\r\n\"How much gold and goods we got stored here, now?\"<br>\r\n\"Gee, Sven.  I dunno.  Uh, how many places we broke inta?\"<br>\r\n\"If I remember right, we're at seven, Hans, including tonight's raid.  Right, Yuri?\"<br>\r\n\"Yup!  Seven always was my lucky number!\"<br>\r\n\"Nah, that's only because I'm Sven, and of course, seven's MY lucky number!\"<br>\r\n<i>*loud laughter*</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis couldn't believe his ears!  A band of Vladians were going about the Mountanian countryside, breaking in and looting!  Fortis had heard a few stories over the past couple of weeks of nearby, fellow noblemen finding a multitude of valuables missing from their estates.  However, Fortis hadn't paid much mind.  Between him and his brothers, he knew they could defend Castle Vanderstorm against any unsavory characters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Quiet, you fools!  This area may look deserted, but you know as well as I do that those blasted Mountanians can come outta the woodwork when least expected!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis last harsh voice commanded respect, and Fortis figured this man must be the leader of this group of invaders.  Fortis quickly counted in his head the number of names and different voices he'd heard so far.  At least six men were advancing toward the cabin where he and Eldonia were sheltering.  Fortis figured they'd see the smoke from the chimney before too much longer and know that the cabin was occupied.  Taking no chances, Fortis gently eased away from Eldonia's lush, inviting body and pulled on his pants.  He then grabbed his sword-belt and scabbard and withdrew his long broadsword.  He crept over to a grimy window and peered out into the night.  The clouds had moved on, and the moon was bright and full, now, clearly illuminating six figures steadily walking towards the cabin--DIRECTLY towards the cabin.  They were each carrying burlap sacks over their shoulders that were full and lumpy with their night's plunder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis clenched his jaw.  He HATED Vladians with a passion!  And to learn that Mountania's mortal enemy was responsible for all the recent theft of his fellow noblemen made fury burn and roil in his gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a moment of silence, the men began to mumble to the leader.<br>\r\n\"Right, boss!\"<br>\r\n\"Sorry, Vilnius!  We'll be quiet!\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah, Vil's right, guys!  Sssshhh!\"<br>\r\n\"I SAID SILENCE!  THAT INCLUDES YOU, VIKTOR!\"<br>\r\n\"S-sorry, boss,\" came the hushed response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA rugged, firm face whipped around to stare down his comrades, who shrank visibly.  Vilnius was easily in his mid-forties, as evidenced by his cracked, lined face and graying brown hair.  But he had a warrior's height and build.  As Fortis got a good look at the half dozen men not twenty feet from the cabin, he could tell that none of them had bodies to sneeze at.  They were all muscular and hard, though not near to the levels of Vilnius, and of course were a far cry from his own magnificent form.  They were all armed, too.  Each man had a sword strapped to his waist and a brace of pistols.  Fortis figured they would each have several daggers stashed away on their bodies.  A couple men had bows and quivers full of arrows slung over their shoulders, too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf those men came upon Fortis and Eldonia, Fortis knew he'd be outnumbered.  Not that Fortis wouldn't be able to do a lot of damage on his own, but six against one weren't that good of odds.  Besides that....  Fortis turned to look across the small room where his wife still slumbered.  He had Eldonia to protect.  If those Vladians did anything to her....  Just the thought of what those uncivilized heathens could do to his beautiful, young wife had his knuckles go white as he tightened his grip on his sword.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Think our loot's still safe here?\" came a hesitant voice.<br>\r\n\"We chose this here place 'cuz it had been abandoned and empty fer a long time, Sven.\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but what if someone found it, Yuri?\"<br>\r\n\"Nah!  It's out here in the middle o' nowhere!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis frowned.  The looters had been keeping their stolen goods somewhere in this cabin?  Where?!  There was almost nothing here!  Fortis looked wildly around him.  No chests, no cupboards, no wardrobes!  Fortis's eyes lit upon a large, threadbare rug laid out on the kitchen floor.  There was an odd ring-shape under it.  Fortis dashed to the rug, whipped it away, and revealed a two foot square door in the floor with a large, tarnished brass ring.  Fortis tapped on the door with his foot, and the hollow thumping sound proved to him there was a decent-sized basement underneath.  That must be where the Vladians were keeping their stolen valuables!  He crept back to the window.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, normally, I'd agree with you all, except there's smoke.\"<br>\r\n\"Smoke?  What do you mean smoke, Loki?\"<br>\r\n\"There, Hans!  There's smoke comin' up from the chimney!\"<br>\r\n\"WHAT?!\" bellowed Vilnius.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis swore under his breath.  They'd been found out!  He dragged on his shirt and scooped up Eldonia, who was merely covered in the blanket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm?  Forty?  *yaaaaaaaawwwwn*  What...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Quiet, woman!  We have company!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, really?  Well, ask them for directions!  Maybe they can show us the way home!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not that kind of company!  There's Vladians outside the cabin!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia's eyes widened on a gasp!  \"V-v-vladians?  Oh, Forty!  What're we gonna do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis jogged through the tiny cabin with Eldonia shivering from fright in his arms, trying to find another means of escape besides the front door.  Fortis cursed when he realized there was just the one door to the place--and the Vladians had been heading directly for it!  And it was no longer locked as Fortis had forced it in when he and Eldonia were seeking shelter from the cold!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only means of escape was a small window in the tiny bedroom.  Fortis grit his teeth as the sound of footsteps and men's yells came closer and closer.  He could surely fit Eldonia through the window, but he doubted his large, burly form would fit through.  Fortis had no problems in fighting to his death, as long as Eldonia was safe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis quickly set his wife on her feet, then forced the window up and open.  Eldonia shivered from the sudden influx of cold, night air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis gathered her up in a tight hug and kissed her with all he was worth.  \"I love you, woman.  Take care of Leo for me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Forty.  Forty, what are you saying?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis hauled her up and practically threw her out the window, making her scream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis slammed the window down just as the front door burst open!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis slashed his sword a few times in front of his body, crouching down into a fighting stance.  His handsome face morphed into a rabid snarl.  Time to take down some Vladians!</span></div></div>",

Why would someone stack firewood, and leave something as important as candles, all over a cabin if it was abandoned!? Fortis unsheathed his sword. He had never expected to take on so many people on a night out to the bar, so he hadn't bothered to bring anything else along! His muskets, pistols, daggers, even his...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis groped around in his pockets. No wait...here it was...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis pulled two shiny objects from inside his pockets. He must've put these in here ages ago, and completely forgotten about them! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nhanging his sword from a crook in his arm, Fortis slipped his pair of viciously-spiked brass knuckles onto his hands. They'd been custom-made for him by his friend Thor, the blacksmith, since none of the regular ones that Thor had for sale, would fit Fortis's large hands and fingers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis wondered what to do. He wasn't about to go out there and announce his presence...he would wait...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHold on! He did have his dagger! He used it to split the firewood! Where was it!? Shit! He'd left it in the cabin! He hoped none of the Vladians would notice it... He peered through the crack in the bedroom door. The dagger in question was underneath a low table in front of the fireplace. They probably wouldn't see it unless they were standing in front of the fire keeping warm, with their backs to the flames. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dur, whoever's here, bawss, dey's long gawn by now...\" said Hans. <br>\r\n\"Yeah\", said Viktor, \"And they's left us a fire! Wasn't that nice?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up you egg-heads!\" Vilnius hissed, \"They might still be here. You, Sven! Search the bedroom\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSven entered the bedroom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe never saw it coming. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis stunned him! He smacked him hard on the head with his brass knuckles, knocking him out instantly, and slicing his throat with his sword! Fortis knew from his war with the Vladians not to waste time. It happened so fast that nobody noticed anything! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sven?\" another one of the goons asked, \"Sven what's up?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis cleared his throat, and spoke, in a passable Vladian accent. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is nothing!\" he said, \"I stubbed my toe on the bed! I wanna sit down for a bit, it hurts!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Blockhead!\" Vilnius said, \"Yancy! Go and see what's going on! And get his sack of gold while you're in there!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother goon who hadn't spoken yet, entered the room. Fortis grabbed him around the throat! Yancy let out a gurgle! Fortis plunged Sven's dagger into his chest and dropped him on the ground. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yancy?...Yancy!?...Stupid...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVilnius approached the door. He pushed it open and entered. Then he saw the bodies. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWHAM!! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis kicked the bedroom door! It flew back, smashing Vilnius in the shoulder! The Vladian warlord growled in pain! The remaining three goons rushed forwards! With Vilnius momentarily blinded by the throbbing bruise on his shouulder, Fortis drew out his sword and whirled it menacingly over his head! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the confined space of the cabin, there was nowhere to run! Fortis had no shield with him, but he had picked up the pistols from the two dead Vladians. He fired shots that echoed through the tiny structure! He rounded on the last goon, Yuri, and despatched him with a swift thrust through the abdomen! Fortis stood there, panting... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWHAM!! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething heavy and metallic struck Fortis on the head! He grunted and staggered forwards! He fell on the table in front of the fireplace! The rickety old piece of furniture collapsed under the sudden impact! Fortis rolled over and saw his attacker! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVilnius was tall, at least as tall as Fortis, and much older, probably double his age. He was old, but still powerfully-built. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVilnius swung his sword down! Fortis rolled! He grabbed his sword and got to his feet! He swung forwards, deflecting an incoming sword-swing! Vilnius disengaged and swung again, aiming for Fortis's head! Fortis ducked and thrust his dagger upwards, aiming for Vilnius's abdomen, but the older man backed away! The fight spilled out into the road and soon, the two men were dueling out in the middle of the forest! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHO ARE YOU!?\" Fortis roared. \"COMING ON MY LAND!?\" <br>\r\n\"YOUR LAND!? WHO THE HELL DO YOU THINK YOU ARE, BOY!?\" <br>\r\n\"FORTIS VANDERSTORM! LORD OF THESE LANDS!\"<br>\r\n\"LORD!? YOU AIN'T OLD ENOUGH!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two men circled, swiped, stabbed and swung. Fortis usually had a lot of stamina, but his earlier drinking, and later activities had rather drained his strength and concentration.

He turned around! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Crack!...Crack!!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom behind a tree, Fortis saw a figure emerge. Vilnius stared down and spotted four bleeding wounds in his chest, he gasped in shock, and collapsed on the ground. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLady Athena approached. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Grandma!...I had him! Why'd you have to interfere!?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh it's alright darling! I know the way home, you won't be lost, and you're welcome for me giving you a hand...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis blushed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry grandma...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLady Athena held up two double-barreled muff-pistols. Diminutive, shiny brass firearms with flashy pearl grips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They were a present from your grandfather when we were married\", she said. \"When you didn't emerge home after so long, I thought I should go looking for you! You know there's a gang out in the woods! I've heard stories down at the Hammer and Tongs! I went there and Bacchus and his wife said you'd left already! I figured you must've gotten lost and taken the woodland route home, instead of the one that cuts through the valley. You were always scared of this road as a boy, you never came down here, so I thought you might've gotten lost! And then I was worried about Eldonia! And...where is she, anyway?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis gulped! He was so busy, he'd completely forgotten! He whirled around! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Donie!\" he shouted, \"ELLIE!...ELDONIA!...Damn it...WOMAN WHERE ARE YOU!?\" </span></div></div>",

Grandma's here\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia hurried out to the front of the cabin where Lady Athena stood. She sighed and gasped when she saw Eldonia's body! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My dear! Are you alright!? Oh look at what those BEASTS did to your dress!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I'm alright, granny...\" said Eldonia, \"...My dress is fine!...A um...A different KIND of beast did that...\" she said. She leaned suggestively against Fortis's body as he stepped up behind her, wrapping an arm around his back, just above his hips, giving him a playful squeeze. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLady Athena shook her head, \"You children these days...\" she mumbled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh grandma...\" Fortis said, \"We're fine! Listen, you wait here, I wanna check something\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis headed back into the cabin. He dragged out the corpses, pocketed everything worth taking, and then using a broken plank, dug a hole in the woods to dump the corpses into. Then, he went back into the cabin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Somewhere around here, those guys were hiding treasure\", he said. \"Where would that be?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perhaps it was under the bed?\" Eldonia suggested. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be silly! Why'd they do that? It would have to be...wait...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis turned. He remembered something from earlier. There was a revolting old rug on the floor in front of the fireplace. He whipped it back, rolled it up and threw it into the flames of the dying fire. Set into the floor was a trapdoor! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hah!\" he said. He pulled up the trapdoor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gimme one of the candles!\" he said. Eldonia handed her husband a candle set into the neck of a bottle. Fortis stepped into the hole. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you see?\" Lady Athena asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It looks like some sort of old root-cellar\", Fortis said. \"But these barrels are all loaded with gold!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gold!?\" said Eldonia. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's sacks down here...and barrels...and crates...there must be thousands in here! It's all...like...candlesticks, plates, bowls, cutlery, coinage, jewels...Half the wealth of Mountania must be down here!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I hardly think so!\" said Lady Athena, \"What should we do?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis climbed out of the cellar. \"We need to get it back to the castle.

Across his back were slung a pair of muskets, and at his waist, a brace of pistols, along with extra powder and shot. Cannius and Jupiter were also similarly armed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I really think this is far too much!\" Eldonia said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woman we're handling a LOT of gold around here, and it stands to reason that others might want to take it. So we gotta be armed!\" Fortis said. \"You don't want us gettin' killed, do you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course not! But...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good...C'mon boys!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis headed out into the stable yard.

Kovy, you get in here with me\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes m'lord!\" said Koviac. The younger Mountain male struggled to get on. He too was armed. In the bed of the carts were lengths of rope, shovels, axes and other bits and pieces for hauling out the gold. Loaded up with all the weapons and tools that they would need, the small posse headed off down the western road, into the woods and towards the cabin on the roadside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took them a while to haul the gold and jewels out of the cellar, using ropes and nets, but they were all strong, capable young men. After a couple of hours, the contents of the cellar were loaded into the two carts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kovi, you drive\", Fortis said, \"I'll be in the back keeping an eye out\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKoviac nodded, \"Yes m'lord!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe now loaded carts began rumbling back home towards Castle Vanderstorm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlong the way, however, they met someone on the road... </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The carts rumbled back towards the castle. They were going at a leisurely pace, taking their time. That was, until they heard the distant thumping of horse-hooves. Fortis looked back to see a cloaked figure riding up towards them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Slow down boys, and prepare yourselves...\" he whispered. The young earl and his two brothers, and his servant, Koviac, unsheathed their swords. The rider galloped up and then slowed down. He pulled the hood down from his cloak, to reveal the lined, wrinkled face of a man in his fifties, with a beard and hair that was pepper-and-salt white and grey. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My lord\", said Fortis, keeping his sword raised, \"What is your business here?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man dismounted and came closer, then Fortis recognised who it was, and lowered his blade, indicating for his brothers to do the same. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lord VonGewalt\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe older nobleman nodded. \"Good morning, my lord Vanderstorm. I trust that my daughter is well in your care?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Indeed\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I fear for her safety and security. There are robber-barons from Vladia operating in these parts\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We know\", said Fortis. \"And we are handling the matter\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am grateful\", said Lord VonGewalt, \"But I have been robbed! Last night. I came down this morning to my dining-hall to find my best silverware, and my pewter tankards, the candelabras on the tables, all gone!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis pulled the covers off the crates and barrels on the wagons. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We found these in an old cabin down the road, which was the hideout for the Vladians. Your treasure is probably in here. We are going back to the Castle to sort through it. Then we were going to send out messengers to all the houses in the surrounding area for them to claim their lost treasures. Perhaps you should come home with us?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLord VonGewalt nodded. \"I think I would like that\", he said. \"Drive on!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe older mountain lord mounted his horse and cantered along beside the wagons. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope that Eldonia is satisfied?\" he asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...um...oh she IS...satisfied, that is...\" Fortis said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBehind him, his two younger brothers laughed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I would like to see my grandson when I arrive at the castle\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course! And you shall. How many others have been targeted?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis pointed to the crates and barrels behind him. The older man frowned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Word has gotten around. I think at least a dozen households. Everyone from local merchants and tradesmen, up to great houses and noble families such as our own\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis shook his head. \"We should do something about it. We should try and boost security and safety in our region of the Kingdom\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLord VonGewalt nodded. \"We should. I suppose it's due to our nature, really\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nature?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You would agree, Lord Vanderstorm, that it would be a great insult to any mountanian, especially a man, to suggest that he could not hold his own and defend himself?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well that's just it. People wouldn't be exactly open to a system of riders and watchmen in their villages and towns and along the roads. It would suggest that they couldn't look after themselves!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis nodded. he hadn't considered that! He supposed he would be insulted if someone told him he needed HELP in looking after his own safety! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But there are the womenfolk and the children\", he added. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A Mountain man is responsible for the safety of his family, as well\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And he's responsible for keeping them in food and drink, clothes, and a warm house\", Fortis countered, \"He can't do everything!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLord VonGewalt bowed to the younger hunk's wisdom. \"That is true...We shall hold council on the subject with the other leaders of our land\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I like that\", Fortis said. \"Once we have gathered everyone and their property returned, we can set a date and time\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe carts approached the castle, and they headed into the grounds. Standing at the front doors were Minerva, Eldonia and Athena. Lord VonGewalt hopped down from his horse. Lady Athena smiled, and curtsied. He kissed her hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lady Athena\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My good lord Venatarius. How dost thou fare?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Better in other times, if I'm honest\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh dear! I hope your wife is well?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She is. I'm here to reclaim stolen property which your grandson has in his possession!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did somebody call me?\" Eldonia asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVenatarius and Athena chuckled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My darling...\" said Venatarius, his deep, heavy voice rumbling in affection. He pulled his young daughter close to him and pushed her head back so that he could get a proper look at her face. He smiled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You look more beautiful every day I see you\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Papa!!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe old man laughed and gave his daughter a kiss. \"How are you, my dearest one? How is the baby?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's upstairs! Do you want to see?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do! But not now, I have things I need to do. Lady Minerva\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinerva curtsied, \"My lord\", she said. \"Your daughter is very comfortable here, my lord\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It pleases me that she is. I'm proud that she has married into an old, respectable family of standing, wealth and good favour\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure are that!\" said Jupiter, shuffling past with two huge crates in his arms. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, everyone!\" said Fortis, \"We're taking all this stuff to the drawing-room. We'll open it there and sort through it\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the drawing-room, Fortis and his brothers used crowbars and axes to smash, break and lever the crates and barrels open. Gold coin, plate, cutlery, candlesticks, silverware, brass ornaments and all other manner of jewels and treasures spilled onto the floor. Lady Athena gasped! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The scoundrels! Stealing all these things from hardworking people!\" she said. She bent down and picked up a handsome gold chalice with intricate engraving on the stem. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh it's so elegant!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think that belongs to old Dame Mortius. It was a present from her late husband. I saw it on her sideboard once\", Venatarius said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Must be a VERY late husband. She's almost a hundred!\" said Athena. She frowned, \"I do wonder if she would agree to sell it to me? It is very handsome...\" the old woman held it up to the sunlight streaming in from the windows, \"Oh! Such a beauty!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can...GURGH!...Ask her your..SELF!...gran!\" Fortis grunted, levering open yet another crate, \"We're...INVITING...GURGH!...everyone over to reclaim their lost property!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Rrrawwwrr!!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe baby started to cry. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awww...aww grandpa's sorry...Awwww...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVenatarius chuckled and hugged his grandson, \"Hehehe, You're a feisty little fellah, aren'tcha?

But now you're a baby, and babies should be cute and cuddly...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVenatarius held his grandson his arms, rocking him back and forth. He walked around the castle, holding him and hugging him, with Eldonia following behind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Papa, why didn't you have more children?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I always wanted more. But your mother, bless her darling heart, she never had the capacity for it. She invested so much joy and love and beauty into one little angel, she never had enough left over for another child\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia blushed, \"Papa!!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVenatarius slapped his daughter on the cheek, \"You know that's true!\" he scolded lightly and Eldonia giggled. \"Papa!!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVenatarius chuckled and wrapped an arm around his daughter. \"It's nice to see you happy here\", he said, \"And starting a family. Do you want more children with Fortis?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I do, papa! One day. I think it'd be lovely to have two or three big strong boys! And maybe a girl or two...someone I can spoil and be sweet with...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVenatarius nodded approvingly. \"Girls are the joys that parents are given after doing their duties to provide strong, healthy lads for the betterment of king and country, my dearest\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever happened between you and mother?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well apparently on that particular year, there was a surplus of boys, so we got our reward early, hmm?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Papa!\" Eldonia blushed. Venatarius chuckled and squeezed his daughter. Then, he headed into a room nearby. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lord's study was full of shelves and cabinets and chairs and tables. At the far end, between three massive windows, Fortis sat at his desk, writing with a beautiful, ivory-shafted pen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Papa!\" a voice burbled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis looked up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh hey son!\" he said. He put the pen down, \"C'mere boy! C'mere! Let papa hold you...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis reached out and grabbed his son and pulled him in, tickling him and giving him a powerful squeeze! Venatarius picked up the sheet of paper on the desk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's this?\" he asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh that's what I'm sending to everyone. I figured we could have a sort of function thing. We invite them over to reclaim their lost property. We give them a chance to socialise, we figure out a plan of action against these thugs, and then we'll cap it all off with a feast and banquet in the evening. What do you think?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLord VonGewalt nodded approvingly. \"A very sound idea\", he said. \"Oh yes, you need to know who to send all this to, don't you? I better write down a list of names\", he said. He reached for the pen and a sheet of paper. He flipped open the handsome brass inkwell and dipped the pen into it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, quite a few people...\" Venatarius mumbled as he wrote. \"As lord of the neighbouring county I hear quite a lot of gossip of this nature. Quite unfortunate...I was surprised to hear that you hadn't also been robbed!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd never heard it was happening\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm. I suppose a household with as many people as yours, and in such condition, was not likely to draw the attention of these bandit-gangs. They're attracted to the houses with older occupants, or with fewer residents. Like mine, I suppose...Lady VonGewalt was so upset when those candlesticks were stolen from the foyer. They were a wedding-present from Eldonia's grandmother, you know, when we were married. We had planned to give them to you two one day, as an anniversary present. When they disappeared, she never thought she'd see them again. I'll be glad to bring them home\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis nodded. Venatarius finished writing the list, and Fortis began writing out copies of his letter to each of the recipients. He rang a bell on his desk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatilda, one of the housemaids who was cleaning one of the bedchambers, entered the room and curtsied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My lord Venatarius...\" she said. She curtsied to Fortis, \"My lord Fortis, sir\", she added. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, Mattie...\" said Fortis, \"Where is Koviac?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's in the kitchen, my lord\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Send him up here, please. Tell him I need him to deliver some letters for me\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, my lord\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe curtsied again, and headed downstairs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis began folding and sealing the letters with wax, pressing his gold signet-ring into the moulten wax to create a decorative seal. Baby Leo sat on his father's desk, watching the whole process with great interest. The baby picked up one of the finished letters and stared at the seal. It was so pretty! He crawled over to his father and tugged at his hand, wanting to look at the sparkly golden stamp that made these pretty patterns. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis smiled. \"You'll have one of these rings yourself one day, Leo\", he said, ruffling his blond hair, \"One day when you're Lord Vanderstorm\", he added, and continued to fold and seal the envelopes. Venatarius smiled. \"I'm sure you'll have a very big family one day, Fortis\", he said. \"Sadly, it was something I couldn't provide for my lady\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What you gave her was a gem worthy of any number of children\", Fortis said. Venatarius smiled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's good to know that she has found a stable and secure companion in a young man such as yourself\", he said. He picked up Leonardo. \"Come now, Leo. Let us leave your father to his work...\" </span></div></div>",

Put it all there on the shelves! Keep it cold and fresh. We'll bring them up later! Have you finished setting everything out in the ballroom?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes Mrs. Tibbs\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And the drawing room?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes Mrs. Tibbs\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And the...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Mrs. Tibbs!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I suppose you forgot to get new candles the sconces in the hall?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh dear!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMrs. Tibbs shook her head. Addle-brained servant-girls! Got their heads between the master's thighs and their minds floating in the skies, and never on their work... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smoothed out her housekeeper's uniform and headed upstairs. Lord Fortis stood in the foyer, dressed in ceremonial battle-armor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You look very fine, my lord\", she said. Fortis smiled, \"Thank you, Mrs. Tibbs. We're expecting quite a few people of um...status...so I wanted to look good\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh his lordship could never not do that!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why Tibby...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe housekeeper and cook blushed. \"Everything has been prepared, my lord. The guests will gather in the hall and you'll explain everything to them. They'll reclaim their property, and then they'll move into the ballroom where you may hold your meeting. Then they can retire to the dining-hall for a light dinner and relaxation\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis nodded, \"Excellent. That's just right\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, my lord\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>CLANG!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nA bell in the foyer rang loudly and Mrs. Tibbs went to answer the door. She opened it to a middle-aged lord and lady. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lord and Lady VonGewalt\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis stepped forward. \"My lord, ma'am\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVenatarius smiled. \"Very smart, Fortis\", he said. He ushered his wife forward. Lady VonGewalt was a gorgeous beauty in her late fifties, with whiting blond hair that was done up in curls and bunches. She had a beautiful diamond necklace on around her chest. Fortis bowed and kissed her hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where is my daughter?\" she asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Up here, mama!\" Eldonia said. She glided downstairs, carrying Leo in her arms. The older woman smiled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aaaah! Baby!\" she said, and reached out for the toddler. \"Hello darling! Granny's here! Muah!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLady Athena came downstairs. \"Wanda, my darling!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two women kissed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Isn't our grandson a wonder?\" said Wanda VonGewalt. \"But then of course he would be. He comes from excellent stock\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis and Eldonia blushed! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who else are we expecting?\" Lady Athena asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Quite a few\", said Venatarius. \"Mr. VanClayden, that fellow who runs the jewellery-shop...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh dear!\" said Athena. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh his shop is fine. But his wife's sapphire necklace and earrings were stolen. His son Apollo is coming along as well. For the socialising at the end, more likely, though\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who is that?\" said Minerva, entering the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I think he's a bit old for you, darling!\" said Wanda. \"He's...\" she frowned, \"Eighteen? Twenty? You'll meet him. He's a very talented musician!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perhaps you should have a look through the treasure-piles in the drawing-room and pick out your property before everyone else arrives?\" Fortis asked, \"Or else there's going to be a huge crowd\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yes!\" said Lady VonGewalt, \"Tarrie, let's have a look\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVenatarius blushed. He couldn't stand his wife calling him by his pet-name outside of the house... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nApparently, Lady VonGewalt found what she was after, because a few minutes later, she let out a squeal of delight! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia blushed. \"Mother tends to get very excited...\" she said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, the Von Eisenwald brothers are coming too\", Fortis said. \"Their great-grandfather's toolchest with all his antique woodworking tools was stolen\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hardly count that as treasure!\" said Athena. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Grandma, just because it's not gold doesn't mean it's not valuable!\" Fortis said. \"That chest has been in their family for generations! They use it for furniture-making. And you know how beautiful their furniture is. Who do you think made that rocking-chair in your bedroom?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLady Athena blushed at her rudeness. She guessed Fortis was right. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne by one, guests arrived and went to claim their stolen property. Once all the lost loot was gathered, Fortis herded everyone into the ballroom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsually, the ballroom was reserved for grand parties and dances, cocktails and women's events. But tonight, benches had been set up in a semicircle on the floor. Everyone sat down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My lord, ladies and gentlemen. Now that you have reclaimed what was taken from your homes, I call together this meeting so that we can ensure that this never happens again, and that the people responsible for these atrocities are brought to justice!\" Fortis said to the packed room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Vladian robber-gangs, some under the command of Vladian warlords, have been helping themselves to our precious possessions. We cannot allow this continue. First they invade our homes and steal our silver. Then our gold and our pewter. Those things may be recovered as has been done tonight\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis paused. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But what happens when they've got all our gold and silver and brass? Our tools with which we work? Our ceramics off which we eat? Our clothes? What happens when they've taken everything that isn't nailed down? What would they come back for, after that?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crowd was silent. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My brothers and I are well-capable of taking care of ourselves. But in our house we have servant-girls who keep house for us, in return for bed, board, money and security. We also have our young sister. There is also our grandmother, and the good Lady Vanderstorm, my wife, who has recently given birth to her first child\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis let these details sink in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Once they have taken everything else, they will come for our women and our children!\" Fortis shouted, \"And we WILL NOT LET THAT HAPPEN!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a murmur of agreement from the crowd. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We Mountanians are an industrious and peace-loving people...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA couple of people laughed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...but our reputations for war and savagery are well-known in our neighbouring kingdoms of Fatlantis and Lucia. Which is well. In return for their riches and produce, we protect their citizenry. Many of us employ Fatlantean servants for their excellent cooking, and buy Lucian silks and cottons, wools and glassware\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis paused. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But how can we claim to protect our allies and trading-partners if we can't handle a few smash-and-grab bandits in our own backyard!?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore murmurs of agreement. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is well-known that we have our right to bear arms of sword and shot. We should use those rights to protect our lesser folk and our families who cannot protect themselves. I propose the establishment of a system of watchmen and constables, to be overseen by each main landowner in the surrounding estates and counties, for the protection of all their citizenry. Funds could be raised and salaries set. What say you?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He brushed a rough hand through her soft, silky smooth brown hair, stroking its beautiful sheen. He tugged playfully at her braids which she had woven into the long falls of her hair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinerva blushed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Brother\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you think me a monster?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The best kind of monster, my darling brother\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis chuckled. He patted his sister on the cheek and flexed an arm arrogantly. Minerva sighed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really Fortis...we have guests!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know...come...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis held out a hand and his sister followed him into the dining-room. Lords, ladies and the wealthy merchants and their families moved around the buffet tables, helping themselves to the food, while the house-girls moved around, offering trays of sandwiches, cookies, cakes, or glasses of drinks. Eldonia glided over to her husband. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Darling, keep the guests occupied. I want to go upstairs to check on the baby\", she said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis nodded. \"You got it\", he said. Eldonia made to leave. Fortis grabbed her by the arm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where do you think you're going?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Upstairs!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Without giving me a kiss, first?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia laughed nervously, \"Darling!

Fortis laughed, \"Go on upstairs. See to the baby\", he said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia stared at her sister-in-law with a \"<i>He can be SUCH a bore sometimes</i>\", sort of look, and headed out of the dining-room. Minerva sighed. She moved through the crowd, looking at everyone, shaking hands and curtsying and generally playing the gracious hostess, along with her brother. Her two other brothers were busy chatting up the daughters of a local tailor, and from the sound of it, Cannius was suggesting some rather unorthodox uses for their father's measuring-tape. Not that the girls seemed to mind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Whump!!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aaah!\"<br>\r\n\"Oh no!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinerva stared at her dress! Fortunately, the dress was a dark red colour, and the wine didn't show. But it was still a shock! She stared to see a handsome teenage boy about 16. He had light brown hair and a cute, angelic face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh gosh I'm sorry!\" he said. \"Here let me help you!\" he said. \"I'm such a boulder sometimes. I'm REALLY sorry!' <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy clumbsily picked up a nearby napkin and started dabbling away at Minerva's dress, trying to soak up the excess wine and began wiping down her chest. Not the wisest thing to do when... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And just what do you think you're doing?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy turned and stared right up at Lord Vanderstorm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M-my lord! I'm sorry, I...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You DARE touch her without my permission?\" Fortis asked in a dangerously soft tone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSensing trouble, Lady Athena glided into the conversation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah Fortis! Minerva! You've met young Master Apollo, haven't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, grandmother!\" said Minerva. She gave her brother a dirty look, that said: \"<i>Go away!</i>\", and turned back to her grandmother, \"Who is he, did you say?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is Master Apollo VanClayden, my dear!\" said Lady Athena, \"His father is the jeweler!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yes!\" said Minerva. She blushed, \"I'm sorry, Master Apollo...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Apollo, please\", he said. \"And you must be Lady Minerva?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinerva nodded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're very beautiful\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't say that!\" Minerva said, \"If my brother Fortis hears that, you'll be drinking out of a straw for the rest of your life\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rather um...possessive, isn't he?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He just...loves me...that's all. He has strange ways of showing it\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinerva paused. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"VERY strange\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nApollo laughed. \"I'm sorry about the wine. Let me get you another glass!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no no no! It's alright!\" Minerva said. She noticed a violin-case on the buffet-table. \"Is that yours?\" she asked, trying to create a distraction. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah! Sweet biscuits...if I'd lost this, pops would murder me! Thanks...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nApollo opened the case. Inside was a beautiful violin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh it's stunning!\" said Minerva. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you. It was a birthday present when I was ten. From old King Goliath...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My goodness!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Our shop had been broken into. By pure good fortune, an order for the royal court was not stolen. But the king heard about what happened. He heard how my old violin was stolen. It belonged to my great-grandfather. He had this one specially made for me. My father is hoping to secure his position as Royal Jeweler to the Mountanian Court. One day, I'll follow after him. It's such rewarding work\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nApollo held out a hand to show off a glittering gold ring. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It belonged to my grandfather. It's one of his first creations\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's stunning!\" said Minerva. She looked at the violin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But doesn't it make it hard to play?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It can\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would you play something for me?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh gosh...I'm...I'm not very good...\" he said, blushing. \"And perhaps somewhere not so noisy\", he said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We could go into the parlour. It's empty now\", said Minerva. Apollo nodded. </span></div></div>",

Yah!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis groaned, \"If you move, I'll give you a carrot, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe horse snorted, and began a steady clopping. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good horsey!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKoviac stifled a grin, and headed back inside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis's ride took him all day, and most of the next day. He finally arrived in Ferramount at dusk the next evening. The cart was pulled up to the gate, and a guard approached. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who goes there!?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Earl of Dynamos, to see the King\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you have an audience?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do not\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis leaned back in his seat and stretched his legs while a runner was dispatched to the castle. A few minutes later, the runner came back. The portcullises were raised, and Fortis went on through. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you'll leave your horse and luggage here, we'll have your trunk taken upstairs and your horse to the stables and mews, my lord\", said one of the guards. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you\", said Fortis. He got to his feet, and stretched. What a journey! He would have to do something about the upholstery on that old seat... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe buff young Mountain lord headed into the huge foyer of the castle, with its flaming torches and bowls of blazing oil. Standing in the middle of the chamber was a bookish-looking youth, about fifteen, with long, ear-length blond hair and terracotta coloured robes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Master Vallerius\", said Fortis, addressing the king's page. The youth bowed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My Lord Vanderstorm\", he said. The boy was about five foot nine, but still looked tiny to Fortis's towering ten foot frame. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The king is busy at the moment. He asks that you wait in the drawing-room. He'll be with you as soon as he can\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis nodded. \"Thank you. Please tell him that I need to see him about something important\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will, my lord. Can I get you anything? A sandwich? A drink?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've had a very long drive. I'd like a sandwich-platter and...and some cold sparkling water, please\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes my lord! If you'll wait in the drawing-room, I'll see it brought up at once\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis headed into the drawing-room and sat down on one of the large armchairs, and stretched out his legs. He yawned. He waited about fifteen minutes, before a pretty young chambermaid entered, wheeling a trolley with food on it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My lord...\" she said. She was a very young maid, probably ten. Fortis smiled. She reminded him of Minerva, with her braided, chocolate-brown silky hair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're very pretty\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl blushed, \"My name is Emerald, my lord\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's very nice to meet you, Emerald\", said Fortis. \"Is that for me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes my lord! A sandwich-platter and a jug of water\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe maid curtsied and headed out of the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis started eating. He was ravenously hungry! He'd only reached his second sandwich, when the doors opened... </span></div></div>",

Chicken salad, tuna salad, ham, cheese, egg, cold cuts, beef...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout anyone around, the young nobleman relapsed into bestial greed, and started munching hungrily on his first sandwich. In six huge bites, the sandwich was gone! Fortis then picked up his second sandwich. He took one huge bite and chewed hungrily. He opened his mouth and took another bite! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was when a door opened at the far end of the drawing-room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Triton! I found Peppers for you!...Triton? Triton are you in here!?...I said I found...Why does he keep having to...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis turned and saw a handsome teenage boy in the room. He was about seven feet tall, with handsome, medium-length blond hair and dazzling blue eyes. He had a slim, athletic build and was about fifteen. The Crown Prince. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good evening, your Royal Highness\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe youth jumped! He whirled around and saw the giant Mountain lord get to his feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lord Fortis!\" he said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Arf! Arf-arf-arf-arf-arf!!!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shhh! Quiet, Peppers!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the brown-spottled lap-dog jumped out of the prince's arms and scampered across the floor to inspect this new stranger! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry! This is Peppers. He's one of my brother's pets...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis hoisted the dog up with one hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Peppers\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Arf-arf-arf-arf!!<b> LICK! </b></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Peppers! NO!\" said Cassius. \"Oh forget it! Stupid mongrel dog...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis stared at the Crown Prince. He reminded him of himself at that age. Handsome, tall, slim, and boyish. Before he started bulking up...and out. Before he got his tan, and let his hair grow out. And got his battle-scars. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is your sister here?\" Cassius asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Crown Prince knew that he was treading on thin ice. Lady Minerva was a beautiful, stunning, delicate flower of a girl. Soft, gentle, loving and affectionate. Sharp, witty and brave. She was not the kind of girl who went looking for boys. She didn't have to. Boys were more interested in looking for her! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut first they had to get past her formidable brother Fortis. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassius guessed he could well understand why Fortis was so extremely protective of his sister. Cassius was sure he would be too, if he had a sister like Minerva, who was constantly fighting off every horny nobleman's son that had ever laid eyes on her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n...and one or two princes, as well... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's at the Castle\", said Fortis. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassius knew at once that Fortis meant Castle Vanderstorm, his ancestral estate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...Um...I...I had a letter for her and I was hoping you might let me have it delivered to her\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis frowned. \"What letter?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassius pulled a folded and sealed letter out of his pocket. Fortis guessed that this was no accident. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You just carry this thing around with you?\" the Mountain lord asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Weeeell...um...no...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you want with her!?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-she's nice! I...I mean...Well she is! And I want to spend time with her. She's pretty...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh-huh...\" said Fortis, as if he hadn't noticed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, Fortis had noticed his sister's beauty since the day she was born. He had marvelled at her appearance his whole life. Now on the cusp of womanhood, she was growing more stunning every passing month. It was only that they were brother and sister that stopped Fortis from doing anything more to his sister. Sure, he hugged her, kissed her, slept with her. He even stroked her and...handled her...in a teasing, brotherly way. And she always found it adorable and sweet and cute and funny. But Fortis never dared to do anything more. He loved her far too much. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the thought of someone else doing that to her made him extremely nervous...and jealous, to an extent. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wondered if I could give you the letter to send to her\", Cassius said, breaking into Fortis's little daydream. The mountain lord yawned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah sure...\" he mumbled. \"I guess a letter ain't so bad\", he said, and held his hand out for it. </span></div></div>",

He certainly matched the king in height, that was for sure.

It's jewels and coins and plateware and such!\" he said. \"Stolen, all of it!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stolen!?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis reached into the sack that he had brought up with him. He pulled out a handsome pair of shiny brass candelabra. Eldonia gasped! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Recognise these?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia snatched them up. They had a coat of arms on the central column. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"These belong to my father!...They used to stand in the foyer over the fireplace!...Oh papa!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis handed up the sack, \"You better hold onto these, woman\", he said, \"Give them back to your father when you see him again\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What else is down there?\" Lady Athena called, \"Can we help?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll take one last look and then I'll seal the place up and we'll come back later to look it over in daylight\", Fortis said. He jumped back down the ladder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cellar was large, but small to someone of Fortis's stature and size. Made even smaller by the barrels and crates and sacks everywhere. Fortis thumped and shook the sacks, crates and barrels that he laid his hands on. They all clanked, jangled, clattered or rattled. He finished with one barrel and turned to another. That was when he heard a thumping noise. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What on earth...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis turned back to the barrel he had just touched. It was jolting around! There must be something moving inside! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Doni! Out around the side of the cabin there's an axe!\" Fortis said, \"Go get it for me, would yah?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's it for?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want to butter my toast...JUST GO GET IT!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia jumped! She guessed she had that one coming to her. Ask a silly question... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA minute later, and the axe was passed down into the cellar. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it, Forty?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's something weird in one of these barrels, but I can't get it open. I'll have to smash it open...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis raised the axe and threw it down! The barrel split open and broke into two halves! He dropped the axe, which thudded on the dirt floor. He lowered his lantern. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCowering in a fetal position, his legs drawn up around his chest, his hands over his head, was a mite of a boy. Perhaps ten or twelve years old, with dark blond hair. Long and messy, and cold blue eyes and pale skin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-w-who-who are you!?\" he asked. He had a slight, Vladian accent. Fortis glared at the boy. Suddenly, the Mountain lord grabbed the boy around the throat and hauled him upright! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...\" said Fortis, \"What DO we have here...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"P-please!\" the boy choked. \"I ain't here to...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To WHAT, BOY!? Looks like we've got another Vladian rat which we forgot to deal with...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!\" the boy gasped, \"I didn't steal nothin'! I swear! I promise! It was them others! I didn't do nothin'!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Grandmother! Take Eldonia home!\" Fortis called out from the cellar. \"The little fellah's gonna tell me a bedtime story and I don't wanna be interrupted\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fortis now don't you do anything rash!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Grandma, take her HOME!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLady Athena finished loading her pistols again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come darling\", she said to her granddaughter-in-law, \"Let us return home.

He crouched down and found the ground near the window disturbed:  evidence of where Eldonia had landed.  However, there was no sign of Eldonia anywhere!  He looked around wildly before racing towards the trees nearest this side of the shack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"ELDONIA!  ELLIE!  WHERE ARE YOU?!?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis raced around every tree, looking and searching and getting more and more worried.  Where could she be?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"ELDONIA!!!!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Fifteen minutes earlier...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia grumbled to herself as she got to her feet.  She couldn't believe that Fortis had actually just tossed her out the window!  She pulled the old, ratty blanket tighter around her to protect her naked body from the cold, but hopped a bit on either foot as her bare feet tingled when making too much contact with the cold, hard ground.  She hopped and jumped her way back over to the window to see if her husband was okay, only to gasp in alarm at seeing him take down a couple of thugs!  Oh, how she hoped he would be alright!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, a large, rough hand clamped over her mouth, while a long, muscled arm wrapped around her waist, and she found herself being hauled backwards towards the trees!  She tried to scream and yell and even bite the hand covering her mouth, but the hand stayed stubbornly on her face!  She kicked and squirmed and tried to wriggle her arms loose, but that arm was like a band of steel around her!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe managed to rap her heel firmly against the man's shin, and he groaned aloud in pain.  His arms loosened around her, and she bit viciously into the man's palm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe swore and cursed, letting her go to see to his injured leg and hand, and Eldonia fell to the ground.  She quickly rose up to her knees, the blanket slipping from her body as she scrambled to get to her feet and find a way to flee.  However, she wasn't fast enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You stupid witch!\" the man seethed.  Despite his injuries, he quickly hauled her back up and held her firmly against his body.  He hauled her over to the nearest tree and pressed her roughly against it, holding her still between the tree and his own body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia cried out as her naked front was scratched against the tough, cold bark of the tree.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm...,\" the man said in a husky voice that made Eldonia shiver in fear.  \"Now I wonder what a woman like you was doin' in our cabin without a stitch o' clothing on.\"  He pressed his engorged groin into her behind as he ran his hands roughly over her naked, shapely sides.  One hand rose up to squeeze one of her breasts, while the other drifted down to roughly pet her most intimate place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"St-stop it!\" Eldonia whimpered.  She didn't want the beloved memory of Fortis taking her against a tree earlier this night to be ruined by what this man might do!  \"Please!  Let me go!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I don't think so, my little whore.  It's been a long time since I've had a woman, and I can pay you well.  Just got me a whole lot o' gold just this evening.  I can feel you've already been taken tonight, but that doesn't bother me.  Means you're already loosened up and ready for me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia shuddered as he licked over her ear and left a long, slimy trail of spit down her neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't you touch me!\" she said as firmly as she could, rallying her courage in the face of a possible rape!  \"My husband will kill you if you do <i>anything</i> to me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Husband, eh?\"  The man continued fondling her, making her squirm.  His touch almost made her feel ill!  \"And just who might your husband be?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"L-lord Fortis Vanderstorm!  He's the earl of all the land in this area!  He's young and strong, and he'll snap your neck like a twig!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm...so was it this Lord Vandersteem you were cavortin' with in me and the boys' shack?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's Vander<i>storm</i>!  And Yes!  Let me go, and you might get away with your life!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man chuckled and twirled her around harshly so she could see his face.  The man was young and harsh, perhaps a few years older than Fortis.  Eldonia might have considered him somewhat handsome if he weren't a Vladian scoundrel!  \"I don't think so, lovey,\" the man said, lowering his head slowly.  Eldonia's eyes widened when she realized he intended to kiss her!  \"Ol' Loki has a plan up his sleeves....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLoki held Eldonia's face still, but right before his lips met hers...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA pair of gun shots had him whipping his head up and putting his hand over Eldonia's mouth again.  \"Shut up, if you know what's good for ya,\" he sneered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a couple moments, another <i>Crack! Crack!</i> had him hauling Eldonia with him around the side of the cabin.  Stealthily zig-zagging between trees, the pair reached the front of the cabin and hid behind another large tree.  Loki looked aghast as Vilnius looked down at his bloody, bullet-ridden chest before collapsing to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLoki grit his teeth.  \"Where did those shots come from?\" he whispered.  \"That man there holds merely a sword.  And where are the others?  Don't tell me that man killed them all!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia tried to scream and yell as she caught sight of Fortis and then her grandmother, as the older woman stepped out from behind a tree, holding two smoking pistols.  However, a few muffled groans were all that escaped Loki's hold on her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't believe it!\" Loki seethed.  \"Felled by a feeble old woman?!  Gotten lax in your old age, brother.  Lord Papa Ramius will <i>not</i> be happy to hear about this!  But...you and the others...be at peace with the gods.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLoki bowed his head to his chest for a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stilled when he heard the sword-bearing man begin yelling.  Loki figured this must be Eldonia's Lord Vanderstorm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLoki kept himself and Eldonia clear of line-of-sight as Fortis began running around, searching wildly and yelling out a name over and over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLoki smirked down at the woman in his arms.  \"Eldonia, hmm?  Nice name.  It fits you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia glared at him, which made him merely chuckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLoki waited and hid until Fortis and the old woman went off their separate ways.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She can't have gone far, Fortis,\" Athena said, though she was just as worried about Eldonia as Fortis was.  \"I'll go back down the road to town in case she went there, and you head back to the castle to see if she made her way home.  Don't worry, my dear.  We'll find her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis growled as he cleaned his sword on the brittle grass before putting it away in the scabbard at his hip.  \"If any harm comes to her, if she's hurt in <i>any</i> way, the man who did it will NOT LIVE!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Fortis and Athena were gone, Loki dragged Eldonia over his shoulder and back through the woods.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where are you taking me?\" Eldonia shrieked, hoping that Fortis would be able to hear her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up, woman!\" Loki snarled, spanking her harshly with his hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I will N-NOT!  And I'm F-FREEZING!\"  Her teeth had been chattering for the last ten minutes, and she could practically feel her lips turning blue!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLoki chuckled and ran his hand along her shapely bottom.  \"I'll find you something to wear soon enough.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout a mile through the woods, Loki came to a low building that was filled with stamping, snorting horses.  \"Hello, boys,\" Loki said fondly.  \"I'm afraid I'm all that's left to take you back home to Vladia.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLoki hauled Eldonia and himself up on a large, black stallion that was still saddled from their raid earlier in the night.  Loki released the rest of the horses, and steered the team back to the cabin.  When they arrived, Loki took Eldonia inside and threw her dress at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get dressed.  Don't want you gettin' frostbite.  You wouldn't be very pretty anymore without all your fingers and toes.  Besides, it's a long way back to Vladia.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"V-vladia?!  You...you c-can't take me th-there!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can't I?  Get dressed now,...unless you'd like a little company before we leave.  I guarantee you, it'd warm you up....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia gulped at the randy look Loki got in his eyes and quickly turned around to get dressed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Loki lifted up the door to the basement and began hauling up all the valuables he and his fellow Vladians had stashed there:  gold candlesticks, silverware, brass picture frames, copper pitchers, gold coins, and numerous other valuables.  He took armload after armload from the basement and stashed them in the numerous saddlebags on the horses.  He also rounded up all the bags from tonight's haul and stuffed these last goods into the saddlebags, too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen all the valuables were safely stowed away, Loki got some rope and motioned Eldonia towards him with a grin.  \"Can't have you free and running off on me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please,\" Eldonia tried again, backing away from Loki.  \"Don't!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Loki easily caught her, tied her up, and even gagged her for good measure.  He strapped her to one of the horses so that she was lying over the back of the horse uncomfortably.  He also hauled up Vilnius's dead body and strapped him over a horse, just like Eldonia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Papa would kill me if I didn't take you home, brother,\" he murmured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, he mounted his black horse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, you nags!  Hyah!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the crack of a whip, the herd of horses began the long run towards the Mountanian-Vladian border.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Eldonia never had a more miserable, humiliating, or painful time in her life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer entire body was one big bruise from being tightly tied up as well as being fiercely jarred and jostled as she was strapped down to a fast-running, tawny horse.  Further, she'd never been in a more undignified position:  her body was slung over the back of the horse so that her stomach dug into the rough saddle, her face bobbed up and down against the horse's heaving side, and her legs and skirts dangled and jangled over the opposite side of the horse.  She could barely feel her arms, since they fell asleep a long time ago, being stretched over her head in such an awkward position on the horse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer captor left much to be desired, as well.  He had had no intention of being attentive to her needs.  She was utterly embarrassed at having to relieve herself in her clothes multiple times now while on the back of the horse when her bladder couldn't hold it in any longer.  (The gag in her mouth prevented her from calling out her need to take a necessary, not that he would have listened to her pleas, anyway.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer stomach was constantly rumbling in hunger from the meager amounts of broth and hard bread the nasty Vladian fed her from his own fingers (which he took disgusting delight in)...while she was still strapped to the horse!  Of course, it didn't help that as soon as he was done feeding her, they were taking off through the wild back-country of Mountania, and the constant up-and-down trotting of the horse made her bring back up everything that she had just eaten!  (He had to have realized this, for he left her temporarily un-gagged so that she could expel the contents of her stomach, only to re-gag her when she was done!)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only time he took her off the horse was to lay her down--still all tied up--on the cold, hard ground near his small fire to sleep for a few hours at night.  But she had no pillow, no bedroll, and no blanket.  Despite being exhausted from the back-breaking ride and pace of the horse team, Eldonia could barely sleep a wink because of the uncomfortable ground and the cold...and the unwanted advances from Loki.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite her torn and shredded dress, despite being covered in her own smelly and embarrassing bodily fluids, Loki would snuggle right up behind her every night, wrap her tightly in his arms, and hold her appallingly close to his hard and alarmingly aroused body.  Because of the gag all she could do was moan and groan and whimper her disapproval, but nothing she did stopped Loki from taking advantage of her.  He would run his hands through her lank, tangled mane of hair, run his tongue disgustingly along the back of her neck,...and hike up her soiled skirts to roughly finger her sex before spreading her legs apart and brutally plunging into her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTears make streaks down Eldonia's dirty face as Loki took his pleasure.  He would relish in being as vicious and savage as possible as he plowed the depths of her abused womanhood over and over.  The first couple of times he took her, she tried to thrash and jerk to get him to stop.  However, she eventually just lay as still as she could, praying it would all be over soon.  When he would become still and groan behind her, Eldonia would shudder in humiliation, disgust, and shame as she felt his warm spurts coat and sting her sore insides.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Better 'an any whore,\" he would always slur, before licking her cheek or her ear and slumping down behind her to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Oh, Forty</i>, she thought in her mind, as she silently wept in the night.  <i>Where are you when I need you?  Please, find me soon!</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter three long days and four very long nights of weary travel, Loki finally called the team to a halt in front of a dark, dank, dreary looking, crumbling ruin of a castle made of pitted gray stone that appeared to be several centuries old.  Only one of four towers was still intact to rise above the castle proper, and the wall surrounding it was broken and run down in many places.  However, as Loki's team of horses drew close, an incredible number of archers and sharp-shooters made their presence known along the wall and the remaining battlements of the castle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho goes there?\u201d called the look-out from a sad-looking watchtower along the wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHo, the keep!\u201d Loki shouted.  \u201cIt is I, Loki, Lord Ramius's son, returned from my mission in Mountania!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cState your password!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTyranny or death!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf Eldonia had been awake and aware during this exchange, she would have rolled her eyes at such an obvious password.  As it was, however, she had passed out after Loki had taken her the night before and had remained unconscious since.  Her body could no longer contend with the constant pain, hunger, dizziness, and weakness that she had been subjected to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA large wooden drawbridge, which was missing several lengths of board in its upper left-hand corner, lowered down from the wall, allowing Loki and his team entrance into the castle grounds.  He rode through to the castle's main courtyard before halting his team.  Several teenage boys surged forward to take care of the horses, while burly looking men stared greedily at the saddlebags filled with loot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLoki looked over the enlarging group of men getting closer to his haul and mentally assessed the trustworthiness of each man.  Trust wasn't something that was prized very much in Vladia, as it was  typically every man for himself.  Further, most of the men he and Vilnius had trusted they had taken with them for their recent raid in Mountania and of course were now gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLoki finally spied a couple older teenagers lingering near the back of the crowd and smirked.  He could certainly trust Vilnius's two sons more than the rest of this lot!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRanulf!  Adolf!  Start unloading the saddlebags and take it all down to the plunder rooms.  The rest of you:  stay back, if you know what's good for you!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the two boys began unloading the horses of their Mountanian wares, some of the men eventually noticed the two figures tied down to a couple of the horses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBy Valhalla!  Wha's that?  Looks like a woman!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cMan, I ain't had a woman since we invaded that village a few months back!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cHa!  I ain't had a woman since the war!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWait a minute...ain't that ol' Vilnius strapped to that horse, there?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWha's wrong wit' him?  Hey, Vil?  Ya feelin' ill?\u201d<br>\r\nA couple men laughed at the unintentional rhyming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLoki sighed and got off his horse.  He first went over to Eldonia, glaring at any man that seemed to be on the verge of touching her, and quickly unstrapped her from the horse.  He placed her on the ground, and the men looked their fill.  Despite being exceptionally dirty and unkempt, her beauty and shapely figure were undisguised, and the men either whistled or leered at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow, don't you boys be gettin' any ideas about this here woman,\u201d Loki growled menacingly.  \u201cShe's the wife of a Mountain Lord, and I intend to hold her captive so's we can get even more gold from those war-mongering, gold-hording Mountanians.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLoki didn't bother to add that he would be personally overseeing her imprisonment so that he could continue to enjoy her womanly delights.  The thought made him smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhere are the rest of your men, <i>Loki</i>, and what happened to my oldest son?!\u201d</span></div></div>",

A tall, muscled figure limped out of the castle and over to the gathered men and horses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Thump!...Shiiiiiiirk!...Clomp!<br>\r\nThump!...Shiiiiiiirk!...Clomp!<br>\r\n</i><br>\r\nThe man's awkward gait was pronounced on the ragged stone courtyard and emphasized his fake, metal leg, which he had to drag a bit as he walked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLord Ramius halted in front of his son, put his meaty fists on his hips, and glared.  His white hair fell down to his shoulders, and he had a black eye-patch over his left eye.  Numerous pink and red scars littered his pale skin.  Despite being in his mid-sixties, he was as strong and imposing as a man half his age.  He had impressed his strong personality and military presence on men since he was fifteen years old and had decided he had earned the title of Earl or Lord when he was twenty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRamius had led his Vladians into more battles with the Mountanians than he could count during his \u201cillustrious\u201d career, whether it be all-out war, mere skirmishes along the border, or stealthy raids to gain gold.  He had lost his eye twenty years ago to a stray arrow as he had led his men against King Hercules' father.  His right leg, however, he lost seven years ago.  He had been leading a stealth raid in Mountania and taken his delights in a young virgin.  Her father had caught him asleep and, literally, with his pants down.  A sword had cut through his leg right below the knee before he was even aware of another presence in the room.  Ramius had barely escaped with his life.  He had coerced a captured Mountanian blacksmith to forge him a fake leg; however, he would never be as quick or as agile as he once was.  He relearned how to mount and ride a horse and could still be a fierce presence on the battlefield.  Despite that, now that he was a bit older and not moving around as quickly, he let his two sons Vilnius and Loki carry out most of his war-plans, while he stayed in his castle and strategized.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a narrowed eye, Ramius looked firmly at the sight of his oldest son still strapped to a horse before turning his eye to his youngest son.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell?\u201d he yelled impatiently.  \u201cAnswer my question!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLoki gulped before straightening before his father.  \u201cMy lord, as you can see, we had much success in our raids in Mountania.\u201d  Loki indicated the few still-bulging saddlebags full of gold and valuables.  \u201cHowever, on our last raid, we encountered a man and woman inhabiting the abandoned cabin we had used as a hiding place for our loot.  The man was a fierce noble named Lord Vanderstorm, and he...successfully defended himself against the rest of the men.  Unfortunately, an armed old woman took down Vilnius with four pistol shots!  She was the lord's grandmother.  I alone survived, father, because I remained outside the cabin as look-out.  However, if it is any consolation, I was able to capture the lord's wife and bring her with me.  We can hold her in retribution for the loss of our men and Vilnius.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Loki was finished, he bowed his head to his chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRamius's face reddened in rage and a loud howl erupted from his throat.  He cursed and swore against all Mountanians, but particularly Lord Vanderstorm and his family who dared to kill his oldest and most trusted son!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the gathered men cowered in fear and shrank back from their leader.  They were all too familiar with Ramius's ire and had no desire to have his anger lash out on them.  While Ramius inspired respect, he also ruled by fear...and his men all feared him!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cALL MOUNTANIA WILL PAY FOR THE LOSS OF MY SON!!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRamius grabbed the nearest two men by their shirts and pounded them unconscious with his fists.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen his anger had been mostly spent, he turned back to Loki.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDespite everything, you have done well, Loki,\u201d he said harshly.  \u201cSee to the woman.  The rest of you:  unstrap my son and prepare him for burial.  Meanwhile, I will think of the best strategy for milking those Mountanians for all that they're worth!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRamius turned on his heels and began his awkward limp back into the castle.  He needed a good barrel of ale, an hour or two with his weight-lifting equipment, and a few rounds with his current whore, in no particular order, to cool his head.  Only when his anger was under control could he think about things rationally and determine the best course of action to get revenge for his son's death!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeveral hours later, after having gone several rounds with his ale, weights, and his woman, he was sitting in front of the fireplace in his cold, drafty room, brooding over a glass of whiskey.  While Ramius would love to declare open war against the King of Mountania for the slight against his family, the recent war had left Vladia in a much more disadvantaged position in regards to men, weapons, powder, and shot.  The much better option would be paying back that arrogant Mountain lord for the murder of his son.  Ramius couldn't believe that an old woman actually took down his strong, able, capable Vilnius and so directed his thoughts against the younger, stronger Lord Vanderstorm.  With the lord's wife as collateral, Ramius could pretty much demand anything from the young lord.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn evil smile slowly spread across the old man's scarred face.  He slowly got up with a creak of his metallic ankle joint and hobbled over to his desk.  He penned a long note before whistling to his young squire.  The boy, not more than eight years old, scurried into Lord Ramius's domain, bowing and shaking in fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yes, m' lord.  What can I d-do for you, m'lord?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Summon Ranulf for me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yes, m' lord.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few moments later, Vilnius's oldest son stepped into the room.  Ramius eyed the nineteen-year-old critically.  The young man towered over the rest of his men, was muscled, hard, and tough.  Ramius could clearly see the hurt and anger in the boy's eyes at the loss of his father.  Perfect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSealing the note with a dab of wax and his own personally fashioned metal stamp, Ramius handed the missive to his grandson.  \"Ranulf, you are one of the few I trust now to take on this mission.  I want you to ride hard and give this note to Lord Vanderstorm of Mountania.  While you're there, take and steal what you want, but be sure to return here immediately.  I have plans for that son of stone who dared to murder your father.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRanulf sneered and slid the missive into his pocket.  He bowed before saying, \"Yes, my lord.  And thank you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Make sure to return back here alive!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRanulf smirked.  \"Of course!\"</span></div></div>",

            ],
            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Pain was the first thing that filtered through Eldonia's consciousness as she slowly began to wake up. Every muscle in her body throbbed, making her moan. When she shifted her waist and her bottom and moved her legs minutely, she cried out. She whimpered upon realizing once more the horrors and abuse that her Vladian captor had rendered upon her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, my little Mountanian flower has decided to wake up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia slowly opened one of her eyes. When the blurry image came into focus, she saw Loki leering at her through the bars on a wooden door across the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh--...where...am I?\" she said hoarsely. Her throat was exceptionally dry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're in Vladia, my sweet, in my castle. Specifically, you're in a cell in my dungeon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA rusty, metallic squeak and a click preceded the door opening. Loki strutted into the room and came up to Eldonia's side. He grasped her chin and turned her head from side to side. He was more gentle with her than he had been on the trip to Vladia, but the sudden movement still made Eldonia's neck hurt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you look a bit worse for wear,\" he sneered. \"You'll look better after you're all cleaned up. Now, stand up, wench!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh-wha?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>SMACK!</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia yelped as her head spun on her neck and her cheek exploded with pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I said Get Up! You DO NOT question me, understood?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia bit her lip as her eyes watered. She gave a small nod, then slowly planted her arms on the very thin mattress she was lying on before gently levering her body to a sitting position. Her head spun a bit in dizziness. She couldn't remember the last time she had eaten and been able to keep anything down. She was as weak as a baby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLoki huffed in annoyance at Eldonia's slow pace. He clamped onto her upper arms and hauled her up to a standing position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia screeched at the sudden movement, and her stomach rebelled, though there was nothing in it. She spit up a little bile and dry heaved a few times. Loki merely held her at arms' length until she was done. She sagged, as any strength she had was sapped out of her. Loki easily held her up under her armpits, but then swung her up over his shoulder in a fireman's carry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like you need some food in your belly to build up your strength. We'll see to that after your bath.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia groaned a bit as she was carried out of the dark, dank cell and down a long, stone hallway lit every ten feet or so with torches. She struggled to keep her eyes open, as her pain and exhaustion wanted to pull her under to the blessed peace of unconsciousness again. Eventually, Loki brought her into a large, central room lit with a few more torches. It was just as cold and dreary as the rest of the dungeons, and Eldonia shivered as the cold filtered through her meagerly covered body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLoki plunked her down on her feet in front of him, and Eldonia tried to stay upright, but her legs were so shaky and weak, she fell into him. He caught her easily and held her roughly in his arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe laughed and said, \"Well, if you wanted more of my attentions, <i>my lady</i>,\" he sneered, \"you merely had to say so.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia shivered and meekly squirmed in his arms, turning her head side-to-side to negate his assessment. The absolute LAST thing she wanted right now was to be taken once again by the horrible, rough Vladian.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLoki chuckled and began stripping Eldonia, removing what was left of her dress and underskirts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"P...pl...please, S-sir! D-don't....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe feebly batted at his hands, but he still quickly and efficiently unclothed her. When she was naked and shivering, trying to cover her breasts with her crossed arms, Loki jerked her towards his body and shook her a few times.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your pleas mean <i>nothing</i> to me, do you understand?! I am your lord and master, here, and I will do with you as I desire! The quicker you learn that, the better it will be for you! I have no qualms in beating the willfulness out of you, and I have ways of wearing you down! I enjoy taking you roughly and harshly! However, I can be gentle if you show me due respect and subservience. Now, you stink, and you're ugly with dirt and vomit all over you. Clean yourself up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia squealed again as he hefted her up and dumped her in a crude metal tub filled with cold water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe spluttered as she re-surfaced, her entire body shivering, her arms hugging herself to try and gain some warmth. Goosebumps instantly broke on her skin, and she tried to get her legs under her so she could get out of the freezing cold water. However, Loki's hands clamped down on her shoulders and held her down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think so, <i>Krasivaya</i>*,\" he murmured. He licked his lips as he peered over her head and caught sight of her full breasts bobbing in the water, her nipples peaked from the cold. He had yet to play with her breasts, having taken her quickly and from behind every time so far. The thought of licking and sucking and biting them enflamed his body with lust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're staying in this bath until you're clean,\" he said huskily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe handed her a threadbare washcloth and a bar of basic, harsh lye soap, and she took them with trembling hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn't much want to capitulate to him, but she hated feeling dirty and unkempt. She kept shivering in the cold water, but managed to get a small lather on the cloth and began running it over her shoulders and neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLoki huffed and yanked the cloth from her hand. \"You're taking too long!\" he griped, rolling his sleeves up to his elbows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe grasped an arm, lifted it out of the bath, and roughly ran the cloth along her skin. He practically scraped her raw with his tough rubbing, and Eldonia bit her lip, whimpering. Loki took no heed of her noises and continued to scrub her body clean. He attacked her arms and legs first, then dunked her head under the water again before running the bar of soap over her head and building up a rough lather in her blond curls. However, her hair was such a mess with dirt, vomit, leaves, and twigs, he had to wash it four times before he deemed it clean.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLoki then finally soaped up the cloth again, knelt against the side of the tub, and began running the cloth over Eldonia's chest and stomach. She bit her lip to hold back a whimper when he ran the cloth over her sensitive nipples. She didn't want it to feel good! He was horrible to her and had raped her!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLoki smirked when he saw her reaction. He ran the cloth lower over her abused womanhood, surprising her with how gentle he cleaned her there, though the soap stung horribly, before he lowered his mouth to one of her nipples and suckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia couldn't hold back the groan. She put her hands on either side of his head, intent on pushing him away,...but her hands just...sort of held him there. She didn't know why he was suddenly treating her so differently than before, and while she wanted to be repulsed by him, he was eliciting an unwanted arousal in her body. He kissed and nibbled at her breast with such tenderness, she couldn't help but feel a small warmth begin to blossom in her belly. He soon dispensed with the cloth and began to gently run his fingers over her sore netherlips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat was he doing? What was SHE doing?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-no!\" she gasped, finally succeeding in pushing his head away from her breast and covering as much of her bosom as she could with her hands. She breathed raggedly, her eyes wide. How could she have possibly felt any kind of...arousal...from this awful man? Tears filled her eyes. She couldn't believe she had betrayed her husband this way! What was wrong with her?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I don't think so, <i>Krasivaya</i>*!\" Loki growled, hauling her wet body out of the bath and carrying her out of the large dungeon room. Eldonia squirmed and kicked, wanting to get away from him. She recognized that look in his eyes:  he was going to take her! Despite what he somehow just elicited in her tired, worn body, Eldonia didn't want him to possess her that way again!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right!  Fight me!\" he said into her ear, licking a stripe along the shell. \"I prefer them feisty!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia kept struggling as Loki carried her up several flights of stairs, down a long corridor, and into a large room, where he dumped her on a surprisingly large and comfortable bed. A fire was burning in the fireplace across the room, chasing away most of the chill from the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLoki laid himself on top of her before she had a chance to move, grasping her arms above her head with one hand and holding her legs down with his own. He settled his hips provocatively against hers and ground his hard length against her core.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"P-please, no!\" she gasped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe slapped her again, and she tasted blood. \"I told you that I will do with you as I want! You were enjoying what I was doing to you in the bath. Now, I'm going to give you what you want!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia tried to shake her head, but he clamped his mouth over hers and kissed her fiercely, biting and possessing her mouth savagely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia couldn't give in to him again, she just couldn't! However, he was so much stronger than she was, he easily kept her struggles to a minimum.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe squeezed and pinched her breasts and nipples, roughly palmed her sex, plunging his fingers ruthlessly into her sore sheath, before he tore open his pants and thrust inside her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia screamed and cried! Loki paid her no mind and bit and suckled at her neck as he plunged into her again and again before growling his release.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe collapsed on top of her and kissed her forehead. \"Still better 'an any whore,\" he murmured before he passed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia turned her head to the side miserably. Tears slipped down her face. What did she do to deserve this? How much longer must she endure such treatment? Eventually, her exhausted body succumbed to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*<i>Krasivaya</i> means \"beautiful\" in Russian.</span></div></div>",

She looked up to see three teenagers, about the ages of Jupiter and Cannius. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eeeh, grandpa was right...she's cuuuuute...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You like dick, bitch?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia groaned. Her head was spinning. Before she knew it, two of the boys had grabbed her by the arms while a third tugged down his breeches. Something poked out and was shoved into her face! She gagged on the filthy phallus, taken completely by surprise! Some perverted instinct told her to start sucking. The older boy groaned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huurrrhmmmm...Mmmm...Oooh yeah....Oooooooh!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia gagged! She felt something shoot down her throat! Revolting! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, she had done the same thing with Fortis. But with Fortis it was a playful sign of affection. There was no such affection here. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne by one, the boys started changing places. After about twenty minutes, it was the last boy's turn. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh!\" he said, after he had enjoyed himself at Eldonia's expense, \"Eh, she's good!\" he said, \"She sure handles it well,  huh? Eh!?\" he asked his brothers, who laughed. \"You suck good, bitch!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suck bigger than yours'll ever be!\" she spat back. She knew she had struck a nerve here, and received a stinging smack across the face as a reward! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"STUPID BITCH!\" one of them shouted. \"Ah fuck it! Anyway we didn't come here to get the rocks popped...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia saw one of the boys go to the door. The others followed. The door opened. Something in a sack was thrown in, and the boys slammed the door shut and left. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNervously, Eldonia picked up the one candle in the room and approached the sack. Nervously, she poked it...it was lumpy! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe grabbed the drawstring at the top, and pulled the sack open. Something fell out... </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Eldonia gasped at what rolled out of the sack:  a small loaf of hard, crusty bread, a hunk of smelly cheese, some coarse, rough paper that unrolled to reveal several slices of spicy meat, and a knife.  She was so hungry, her stomach felt like it was literally gnawing on itself!  Without much finesse, she used the knife to cut the roll in half, cut the cheese in slices, and then haphazardly stacked the meat and cheese on the bread.  She bit into it with a moan, closing her eyes in gratefulness.  While it wasn't the best tasting food she'd ever had,...at least it was food!  She was half-expecting to be served some nasty gruel or thin broth, not a meal of substance like meat and cheese!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rough-made sandwich was gone in six large bites.  While Eldonia never considered herself a big eater, because of how little she had eaten the past several days, the small sandwich did not fill her up by far.  Her poor stomach gurgled in discontented hunger, and Eldonia sighed as she placed a hand on her very convex middle.  Plus, the spiciness of the meat and the dryness of the bread made her thirsty.  Those nasty teenagers had merely given her a sack of food, with nothing to quench her thirst!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe HATED this place!  Loki humiliated her and took advantage of her every chance he got!  Then, those teenagers came in and had their own way with her body.  She couldn't stay here anymore!  There had to be some way of leaving, of escape!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia's eyes landed on the knife that she had tossed back down to the dirty, stone floor after she had sliced the roll in two.  It was fairly dull, but it was still a potential weapon that might come in handy.  She had just had a chance to hide it in the pocket of her torn, dirty dress, when she heard movement outside her cell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enjoy our meal, did we?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia looked up from the floor to glare at Loki's face leering at her through the bars of her cell door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"After all, we can't let you starve to death.  Though, you are privileged to be allowed real food.  My father is too tenderhearted at times,\" he snorted.  \"If I had my way, you'd fill up merely on our spunk and nothing else!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia turned her head away in shame at remembering all the disgusting seed she had been forced to swallow by those teenagers that had invaded her cell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLoki chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not quite to your taste, hmm?  Well, you haven't tasted ol' Loki yet.  We'll get to that eventually, but I've been too interested in planting my seed elsewhere for the time being.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia could practically feel his lecherous gaze travel down the length of her body, and it made her shiver in revulsion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm thirsty,\" Eldonia said quietly, trying to distract him away from taking her yet again.  \"Do you have any water in this place?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLoki laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Water?!  This is Vladia, <i>Krasivaya</i>!  Any water we have here is frozen most of the year!  And whatever isn't frozen we make into fine Vladian ales, stouts, and whiskeys.  A strong girl like you would probably love a rich Vladian whiskey!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia sighed as her jailer went away, presumably to fetch her some nasty Vladian spirit to drink.  She wrinkled her nose and went over to sit on her dirty, thin, uncomfortable cot.  She didn't much like beer.  Wine wasn't too bad.  She'd had a sip of her father's Mountanian bourbon once, and it made her gag as it burned a path clear down to her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLoki soon returned and entered her cell carrying two short glasses and an ominous looking jug that had a skull and crossbones on it.  He held out one glass to her, and Eldonia looked at it for a few moments.  Despite being really thirsty, she really didn't think drinking anything with a poison symbol on it would help her!  However, she also didn't want to anger Loki again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia hesitantly took the glass.  Loki smirked at her, then popped the cork out of the top of the jug and poured out a healthy measure of dark liquid into both glasses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bottoms up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLoki chugged down the spirit, then gritted his teeth and hissed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, smooth!\" he said in a hoarse voice.  \"Nothin' like Papa's special brew to cure what ails you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe nodded his head at Eldonia's still full glass of whiskey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Drink up, girl.  Or aren't ya thirsty?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia grimaced and held out the glass back to Loki.  \"No, thank you,\" she said firmly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLoki snarled.  \"You drink that, or I'll give you something else to swallow!  Understand?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia's eyes widened.  The teenagers shoving their cocks down her throat had been bad enough.  But she knew that Loki was much longer and thicker than those boys had been.  She didn't relish the thought of him doing that to her, too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, she then caught sight of the door to her cell across the room--her OPEN cell door!  Maybe now might be her chance to escape this Vladian prison!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Eldonia brought the glass closer to her face, she tried to casually put her other hand in her pocket--where she had stashed the knife.  If she could only catch him by surprise, she might just have a chance of making it out of the cell.  Granted, she had no idea how to escape this place, let alone where exactly where she was in Vladia, or how to get home...but Eldonia would almost rather die trying to escape than staying here and being abused and raped every day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as Eldonia raised the glass to her lips as if to take a sip...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe threw the glass of whiskey into Loki's face!  He hissed and wiped his hands over his face to get the stinging liquid out of his eyes.  But then, Eldonia quickly drew forth the knife and sliced it at him!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLoki howled as the dull knife caught his cheek and drew a bloody line across his face!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia quickly dashed for the open door to her cell!</span></div></div>",

She turned to look and...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWHUMP!! She hit something solid and fell over with a squeak! She felt a hand grab her! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aaah, don't be running away so fast, my sweet...\" said an older man's voice.

Granted, it didn't have near the amenities she was used to in either her father's house or Castle Vanderstorm, but the sitting room she was currently in had a couple nice, stuffed chairs with a low table in between them, with a few bookshelves and a desk against one wall and a large fireplace on the other.  One door led off to a bathing chamber, another door led off to the bedroom, where she could clearly see a very large bed, and one last door was closed.  Perhaps the last room was a guest bedroom or study?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be shy, my dear,\" came the gruff voice of gray-haired Lord Ramius.  \"Please, go in and examine the bedroom.  I'm sure it is more to your tastes than the cot in the dungeon.\"  He said the last with a sneer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia looked at him dubiously.  She hadn't been formally introduced to the man in front of her, though she could surmise from the bits Loki had said that this grizzled, scarred, intimidating man was Lord Ramius:  the overlord of this region of Vladia.  However, despite herself, Eldonia couldn't help needling the man a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Forgive me, <i>Sir</i>,\" she sneered back, crossing her arms over her chest, \"but who are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRamius's scarred face actually smiled.  \"I see now why my son is so taken with you!  We Vladians appreciate strength and spunk in our women, and you have it in spades, don't you, <i>Sladkaya</i>*?  I am Lord Ramius, Earl and Lord of the Transyl region of Vladia.\"  He gave a mocking half-bow.  \"This castle is my stronghold, and for the next foreseeable future, your home, as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I don't much want to be here!  I demand you take me back home!  My husband and my father are both powerful men!  If you free me now, you might not lose another one of your limbs!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRamius snarled and stalked up to her, his metal leg scraping against the wooden floor.  He grabbed her arm and shook her, making her eyes widen in fright.  Despite his looks and his age, he was still clearly a strong and powerful man!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"While I appreciate your spirit,\" he hissed, grabbing her other arm and hauling her closer to him, \"you will curb that tongue of yours in my presence!  I don't suffer insubordination from anyone under my command--not from my men, and especially not from a loose-tongued prisoner of war!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're not at war!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WE ARE!\" he spat.  \"WE'RE ALWAYS AT WAR!  Mountania continually plunders Vladia's resources and trade routes, claiming incorrect boundary lines between our two countries--claiming valuable land that had been part of Vladia for centuries!  We steal back that which is ours, for Mountania stole it from us in the first place!  As for your father and husband, neither is a threat to me and the number of men and weapons I have here in my arsenal!  Further....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRamius hauled her to a desk across the room.  \"Do you see this letter?\"  He pointed to a missive lying on the desktop, and Eldonia nodded.  \"It's the reply from your Lord Vanderstorm concerning the ransom I demanded for your release.  Do you know what his response was?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, my lord,\" she said softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRamius smirked.  \"Apparently you don't mean as much to him as his gold!  He said that he would rather you DIE in captivity than give me any money in exchange for your release!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You lie!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Read it yourself!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRamius flung her towards the desk, and Eldonia hesitantly unfolded and read the letter.  Ramius smirked as her eyes scanned the missive.  He had her right where he wanted her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter several whipping sessions, Ramius's young squire was finally able to suitably forge Lord Vanderstorm's handwriting and compose the letter Ramius had dictated to him\u2014the letter Eldonia was currently reading.  The TRUE letter from the Mountanian earl was locked in his desk drawer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later, tears were falling down Eldonia's face.  Ramius was right:  there would be no rescue coming for her!  But, she could hardly believe it!  She had to read through the letter twice, as the words barely penetrated through her shock the first time.  She thought Fortis had loved her!  Why would he not even <i>try</i> to reason with Ramius?  He didn't even plead with the overlord for her safety!  And indeed, Fortis had actually written:  <i>\"...There is no way in all of Mountania, I would ever hand over any of my gold to the likes of you!  I would rather my wife ROT in your dungeons than bow to your demands!...\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You see, <i>Sladkaya</i>*,\" Ramius murmured, putting an arm around her shoulders, \"you have no one coming to rescue you.  Your family has abandoned you here.  So, why not try to make the most of this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite herself, Eldonia leaned into the man's strong arm--the only comfort she had known for the past couple of weeks.  Ramius brought her close and enfolded his arms around her.  Eldonia couldn't help herself.  She let the sobs come.  All the turmoil, the pain, the humiliation, and the shame of the past several days came to the fore, and she buried her face into Ramius's chest and cried, clenching his shirt with her fists.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's alright, my dear.  I will take care of you now,\" Ramius said huskily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen her sobs had eased a bit, and he had handed her a handkerchief to wipe her face, he said, \"Now, since you will be staying in my castle permanently, you will have free reign of these rooms, but like anything in life....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe raked his lone eye over her possessively, lingering appreciatively on her bosom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...nothing of value is free,\" he finished huskily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*<i>Sladkaya</i> means \u201csweet\u201d in Russian.</span></div></div>",

If only she could get her arm loose so she could get the knife she had stashed in her pocket....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRamius kept walking them into the bedroom, kissing, licking, and sucking at her mouth and neck, letting his hands roam freely over her body, until the backs of Eldonia's knees hit the mattress of his large bed.  They fell onto the bed together, Eldonia still struggling, but Ramius's surprising strength kept her just where he wanted her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Eldonia was puzzled when his kisses gentled, when he began to slowly strip her ratty dress and shift from her body and tenderly caress every inch of skin that was revealed.  She blushed and turned her head to the side.  She couldn't let him see how he was affecting her.  She struggled a bit more in his arms, not wanting to feel the low burn of arousal in her belly.  What was wrong with her?!  How could her body betray her so?  This wasn't Fortis!  ...But did Fortis truly love her anymore?  He was giving her up to these Vladians, with no intention of coming to rescue her!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRamius lowered his head to gently suckle on a perky nipple, eliciting an unwanted sound from Eldonia's throat.  Ramius smirked when he heard her moan.  He knew his son Loki would have merely taken his own pleasure from this lovely girl and not paid any attention to her needs.  However, Ramius knew that was how he would firmly bind her to him.  And Ramius had had plenty of practice over the years learning how to do just that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRamius paid homage to Eldonia's apple-firm breasts, relishing every moan that escaped her lips and the way her struggles slowly ceased, before slowly slipping down her body.  He caressed her shapely sides as he dipped his tongue in her navel.  He smirked at her whimper.  Then, he shifted even lower so that his torso was straddling her legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRamius gently grasped her buttocks in his hands as he leaned close to her womanhood.  He breathed in her musky scent and growled low in his throat.  He'd rarely smelled a woman so intoxicating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia tensed.  What was he going to do to her, now?  \u201cPl-please, S-sir, my lord!\u201d she pleaded.  \u201cPlease, let me go!  Please, don't!  I...I...AAAAHHHHH!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer back bowed off the bed, and her hands instinctively grasped his long, gray hair as his mouth suddenly attacked her nether lips.  He licked and nipped, sucked and gently bit, leaving no part of her womanhood unexplored.  She yelped when he tweaked her clit and shuddered with pleasure when he stuck his tongue as far inside her sheath as it would go.  She tasted as good as she smelled, and Ramius relished the flavor of her cream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeing older, Ramius knew well how to hold off his arousal so that he could pleasure his woman many, many times.  He was surprised, though, at just how much lust was currently running through his sixty-six-year-old body.  He might just have to keep this young thing in his bed for a very, very long time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia struggled against the rising tide of her own arousal, as Ramius applied himself to her quim with all due diligence.  It had been so long since the act of sex had brought her pleasure,...and yet she didn't want to experience this with a disgusting, older Vladian man.  But when Ramius pressed his lips around her clit once more and sucked strongly, her senses exploded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRamius lapped and lapped as his face became drenched with Eldonia's release.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMmmm, sweeter than honey,\u201d he murmured.  \u201cAgain!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia could barely catch her breath, when Ramius's renewed attentions on her body had her climbing once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPl-please!  Not...not again!  I can't...I don't...!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSh, <i>Sladkaya</i>*,\u201d he whispered between licks.  \u201cLet me teach you what your body can do.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia whimpered and moaned, her hands permanently clenched around his hair, her thighs twitching involuntarily, as Ramius dedicated himself to bringing her to the brink and sending her over again and again and again.  Eldonia shrieked and screamed when she came.  She eventually lost count of how many times he brought her to orgasm, but her body became more and more sensitive and languid with each time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd now,\u201d Ramius said huskily, slowly slithering back up her utterly relaxed body and undoing the ties on his pants, \u201cI'll give you myself.\u201d  He would have pleasured her a few more times, but his body was telling him he couldn't wait any longer.  However, he was satisfied with having pleasured her seven times.  His record was ten before the woman passed out.  Maybe, after he'd built up his stamina with her, he'd beat his record.  He always wanted to give a woman twelve orgasms in a row.  He just needed to find the right woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia was so sated and relaxed, she barely felt him slip inside her.  She was barely aware of what was going on around her, and her mind merely recognized the feel of a thick, long man gliding himself in and out of her sheath.  She moaned as her sensitive body sparked with sensation, and heat bloomed in her core yet again.  She wrapped her thighs around his powerful hips and her arms around his wide shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, Fortis,\u201d she sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>SMACK!</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer stinging cheek had her instantly awake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI AM NOT YOUR PATHETIC EXCUSE FOR A HUSBAND!  YOU WILL NEVER CALL ME ANYTHING BUT 'MY LORD' IN MY BED, OR ANYWHERE ELSE, AGAIN!  IS THAT UNDERSTOOD?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cY-yes, m-my lord!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRamius gritted his teeth and began plowing into her at a brutal pace.  Eldonia yelped at his rough movements, but he was soon swearing and cursing as he pumped his seed deep inside her.  He quickly withdrew from her, making her whimper as he slid through her oversensitive vagina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe got up from the bed, tucked himself back in his pants, and redid the ties on his waistband.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGet some rest.  I'll be back later with supper and more...companionship.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe winked at her, but she turned her face away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe heard his awkward gait leave the apartment and the jingle of keys as he locked her in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia shivered from the sweat cooling on her body.  She soon huddled under the covers of the bed.  Once again, tears coursed down her cheeks.  She had just experienced the most amazing pleasure she'd ever had,...and it wasn't with Fortis!  It was with an old, scarred, ugly man with one eye and one leg.  And yet,...he had been more gentle with her than even Fortis ever had!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia missed her home.  She missed her father.  She missed Castle Vanderstorm.  She missed her sweet little boy, Leo.  She missed Minerva and their girl talks.  Most of all, she missed Fortis.  But,...did Fortis even want her anymore?  Apparently, she wasn't even worth rescuing!  Should she just give up and give in to a life as a...Vladian whore?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling alone and lost, Eldonia sobbed miserably, curling up into a ball.  She eventually succumbed to a restless nap, and even in her sleep, tears kept falling from her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*<i>Sladkaya</i> means \"sweet\" in Russian.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Eldonia was awakened by the sound of a key turning in a lock. She opened her eyes and suddenly remembered that Ramius must be returning with food for her to eat! She heard the clink and jingle of crockery and keys. Whoever was opening the door must be balancing the tray of food in one hand, while trying to unlock the door with the other. This would give her a few precious seconds with which to arm herself against this invader! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe got up from the bed and stared around the room. She spotted some swords above the fireplace, but knew that she would not be able to lift them. They were men's swords, far too heavy for someone of her frame and build. But then underneath the swords, she could see the tool-rack for the fireplace! She hurried over and picked up the poker, four feet of solid wrought iron. She hurried over to the door and hid there, waiting for it to open. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door swung open with a soft creak, and a hooded figure entered the room. He did not look much like Ramius. He did not walk with a limp. he was about the same size...perhaps a bit taller and slimmer of build. He moved to a small table and put down a tray of food. Eldonia hurried up behind him, and raised the poker as high as she could, the sharp, pointed barb at the end ready to plunge into the man's back, or skull, whichever she was able to reach more easily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Donnie you better put that thing down. Forty's gonna be mighty sore if he found out you killed his little brother\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia nearly dropped the poker! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man turned around and tugged off his hood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJupiter! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked rough. He hadn't shaved in at least a week, probably two! He looked kinda dirty and grubby, but otherwise okay. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shhhh!! I'm here to get you the hell outta here!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJupiter reached for one of the swords above the fireplace, and threw the other one under the bed. He pointed to a dressing-screen at the far end of the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get behind there with the poker\", he whispered, \"I'll wait over there\", he hissed, pointing to the door. Eldonia nodded and did as she was told. They waited. Eldonia peered through a crack in the screen, and Jupiter stood in the dead-space behind the door, waiting for Ramius to return. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey didn't have to wait long. A distinct clanking, scraping step drew nearer, and nearer. The door opened... </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jupiter put his fingers to his lips. Eldonia peered at him through a gap in the dressing-screen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJupiter stood about nine foot, six inches tall. He had dark brown hair, along the same hue as his little sister Minerva. He was not quite as built as Fortis, but still a capable fighter. As son of a Mountain lord, he was expected to be the best of the best fighters. Fortis, as the new lord was expected to be better, of course. But Jupiter was at least expected to hold his own against an enemy the same as he was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd that enemy entered the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRamius hobbled into the room on his unsteady metallic prosthetic leg. It clunked on the floor, step...clunk...step...clunk...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe spotted the tray of food on the table. He turned... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJupiter got there first. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young mountain knight swung his sword down! It struck Ramius in the throat! Jupiter drew back his sword and plunged it into Ramius's abdomen! Eldonia clapped her hands over her mouth as she saw the blade explode out the back of Ramius's now lifeless body, blood going everywhere! Jupiter drew the sword out, twisting it viciously as he did so! Ramius let out one startled gasp...and collapsed to the floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJupiter hissed and snapped his fingers. Eldonia rushed up to him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-what do we do?\" she whispered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We gotta get the hell outta here!\" Jupiter whispered. \"Let's raid this place for whatever we can find, and then beat it!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia nodded. She stared around. Knives, plates, gold, clothes, cloth...she stuffed whatever she could find into sacks and bags and a trunk in the corner. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gimme all that!\" Jupiter said, pointing to the growing pile of sacks. Eldonia tied them all together with rope and put them on the end of the fireplace poker. Jupiter hoisted the whole thing onto his shoulder while Eldonia picked up the trunk. It was not especially large, about the size of a small travelling trunk. She put another sack over her back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do we get out of here?\" she whispered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We take the servants routes out\", said Jupiter, \"The guards only bother watching the main entrances. Come on!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaking as little noise as possible, the two Mountanians rushed out of the dead warlord's chambers, and down a back staircase, through some corridors, down more stairs, through an empty kitchen, past what looked like a servants' hall, up some stairs, past some doors, up more stairs, and finally out into what looked like a sort of kitchen garden, with rows of vegetable-crops everywhere. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do we do?\" Eldonia whispered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We need to get the hell outta here!\" Jupiter whispered back. \"We'll go down the back roads, cut through the woods, then just head south! As far as we can go. Find help, find directions, get food, then get the hell home!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia nodded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, a cry came out from somewhere deep inside the castle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nApparently, someone had found the body. To Jupiter's amazement, it was probably a blessing in disguise. Everyone - guards, servants and even members of Ramius's family, rushed to see this amazing thing for themselves! It gave Jupiter and Eldonia the chance to escape! With gates, doors and guardposts abandoned, they rushed out of the garden and out the back gates and down a road towards the woods at the bottom of the hill on which the castle stood. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSafe in the trees, Eldonia looked up at her brother-in-law. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where's Fortis?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's at home\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why didn't he come?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not safe for him to come\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did you find me?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ramius was holding you to ransom\", Jupiter said. \"Fortis was busy trying to find a way out of this. I decided I was gonna go off and find you. It wasn't easy, trust me. Forty wasn't too happy about it, but...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJupiter shrugged. \"He kinda gave up. He knew I wasn't gonna say no\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia hugged him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're very sweet!\" she said. \"You all are! How's Minnie?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJupiter sniffed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's...She sleeps with Fortis at night\", he said. \"After she found out what happened, she won't leave him alone. She's terrified of what might happen to her. Minnie's a wonderful girl and she's strong, but...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJupiter swallowed, \"Well...We all love each other but Fortis just gets along better with Minnie than me and Cannius. I dunno why that is. I guess Fortis has more of that 'fatherly' stuff in him, even if it don't always look like it\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooooh Minnie...\" Eldonia gasped, \"She must be so scared thinking about what I'm going through!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She is. She's also scared for the baby\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia sniffed! Her baby! They absolutely had to get home, now! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After several hours of walking west, the two Mountanians started heading south. Keeping to the forests and woods and away from the main roads as much as possible, Jupiter and Eldonia trekked south. Jupiter hunted and trapped animals, mostly rabbits, for food. Eldonia had not eaten in nearly two days, and that crude meat-and-cheese sandwich which she'd had seemed ages ago...because it was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they headed south along a dirt road, not talking but concentrating on getting home, Jupiter suddenly stopped. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's the matter?\" Eldonia whispered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up!\" Jupiter hissed, \"I hear something!...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, without warning, Jupiter grabbed Eldonia around the waist and put a hand over her mouth. He dragged her into the woods, off the simple dirt track that they had been walking along, and dumped her behind a copse of trees and bushes. He crouched down next to her and motioned for her not to say a word. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they sat there, crouched and hiding, Eldonia could hear what she could not before. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the distance, but getting closer and closer, the rumbling of wheels, the creaking of wood, and the clopping of horse-hooves. Someone was coming their way from the north. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeering out from the branches in the bushes, the two Mountanian travelers could see that the sounds came from a brightly painted gypsy caravan. It was all yellow and red, with blue and green trim. It was being pulled by two horses, and three people, two men and a woman, sat on the broad front seat. The caravan drew closer and closer. It was about twelve feet away from where Jupiter and Eldonia had left the road, when it stopped. The man holding the reins hopped down from the driver's seat and unsheathed his sword. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What ills dost thou spy, brother?\" the woman asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hush, woman!\" the man whispered. \"There be strangers hereabouts\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man was not tall. Maybe five foot four? And certainly not muscular. But he looked like a capable enough individual. He stepped closer and closer to the bushes where Eldonia and her brother-in-law lay hiding. Nervously, Jupiter unsheathed his sword. He didn't really want to fight such a small guy, but he would, if he had to. The man drew closer, and closer... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aaah!\" he said, pushing the branches of the bush aside. He stared at Eldonia, who gasped! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Jupiter swung down his sword! The man whipped his own blade over his head, blocking the swing and deflecting the strike! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Away from her, you Vladian scoundrel!\" he shouted! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man skipped back and swung his sword around! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold thy blade!\" the man shouted. \"How dar'st thou accuseth so!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia recognised the antiquated speech, even though she'd only heard it spoken of, and not spoken directly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jupiter stop!\" she said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who are you!?\" Jupiter shouted! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thou Vladian scum!\" the man shouted back. Jupiter paused in his assault and lowered his sword. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold on...\" he said, \"If I'm not a Vladian and you're not a Vladian, then who are we?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man cautiously lowered his blade. He looked the towering youth up and down. \"Thou art of the Mountain people\", he said. \"Thy stature and frame doth proclaim such\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...Yes!\" said Jupiter, \"And you are...?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Valleyweren\", said the man. Jupiter remembered some old scraps of language. \"Valley\", and \"Were\", as in 'werewolf'...Valley man...these people must be Valleyan wizard gypsies! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm...I'm sorry\", he said, and quickly sheathed his sword. The other two on the caravan hopped down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He is Ulrich. This is my lady, Constance. I am Josiah\", the speaker said. \"How art thou called, Mountains?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am Jupiter, brother of Fortis, Earl of Dynamos. This is his wife and my sister-in-law, Lady Eldonia. We were Vladian prisoners and are heading south to our homeland\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nConstance, a plump, cheerful-looking woman in her forties, hurried forward. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My darling! Tired must thou be! Josiah, these menschen shall travel with us into their land\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosiah nodded. \"Thou hath most infernal luck, Mountain man, to be captured by Vladian warlords. Methought thou'st fight against them, as thy sworn enemies\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Surely Vladians are your sworn enemies as well?\" Eldonia asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, 'tis true, madam. But Valleyans be not accustomed to capture. Vladians be slow-witted and...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosiah paused, trying to find the right word. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...STUPID!\" he said. Eldonia giggled. There was little argument there! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We travel to Fatlantis and through Mountania. Ride with us and we shall deliver you where you wish\", said Ulrich. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you\", said Eldonia. \"We live at Castle Vanderstorm where my husband holds squiredom\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Valleyans nodded. Valleyans knew already. Valleyans always knew. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough often seen as nomadic gypsies, Valleyans were possessed of their own mystical magical powers, inherited from their distant Fantasmian cousins and ancestors, when they migrated north. Because of their constant travel and preference to living in the lowlands, most people called them valley-people or valleyans...and the name just stuck. They were not a people of their own land, and were not strictly speaking, Mountanian citizens and subjects. But for centuries, Mountain kings had granted them free-roam of their lands, in return for certain favours in times of war, favours which the Valleyans were more than happy to grant, in return for free roam over Mountain lowlands. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thou shalt ride with us!\" said Constance, \"Come, my dear! Into the caravan with thee. Rest on thy journey. Prithee enjoy some of our victuals to your own delight\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you!\" said Eldonia. Constance smiled and led Eldonia up the back steps of the caravan and inside. Ulrich and his brother-in-law, Josiah, climbed up onto the front seat again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosiah frowned. \"Our crafts are not suited to Mountain men of this size...you may ride on the roof, if thou wish\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJupiter blushed. Ulrich chuckled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mine brother-in-law doth jest with thee, good Lord Jupiter. Ride in front with us. 'Tis more comforting. We shall deposit thee at thy brother's estate when we arrive there\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks!\" said Jupiter, and climbed up into the driver's seat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUlrich flicked the reins on the backs of the two horses pulling the caravan. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Walk on!\" he cried out, and the horses trotted off. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Waaaaaaah!!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AAAH SHUDDUP!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinerva hurried upstairs from the drawing-room to see her brother Fortis pacing back and forth in his bedroom. The doors were opened. In the nursery down the corridor, Leo wailed and sobbed! The scary noise woke him up and he was scared by it! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinerva scooped up her nephew and shook him, and bounced him up and down in her arms. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awww there there!\" she said, and kissed him, \"Aunty's here...Fortis you're waking up the baby!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh shut up!\" Fortis growled. Minerva entered her brother's room to see him smashing his huge fists into a solid, wooden dummy on a stand. He seemed to be taking out his fury on the mannequin that held his old suit of armour, the one which didn't fit him anymore. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fortis! Stop it!...Granny why is he so angry!?\" Minerva said, as her grandmother came up behind her to take the baby. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooh come darling!\" said Lady Athena, \"He's just...questioning things, that's all\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It SOUNDS like he's trying to beat that mannequin into toothpicks!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's say he's trying to reaffirm his masculinity, darling\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinerva blushed. She never thought her oldest brother ever had to do that! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" she said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well his favourite girl and his wife was just kidnapped and snatched up away from right under his nose! He feels like he's failed Eldonia as a husband and a protector! He's feeling very depressed right about now\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinerva nodded. She supposed that she could understand that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He could do with some company, dear\", said Lady Athena, \"Go to him! You always make him feel better. I'll look after the baby...Come along, Leonardo! Let's go play with the bunnies!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeo perked up. <i>The bunnies! Ooooh... </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinerva cautiously entered her brother's bedchamber. She knew that her brother, despite his phenomenal strength, would never dare lay a finger upon her, but in his highly agitated state, she didn't want to take any chances. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Forty?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT!?...Oh...uh...w-what is it, girl?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Forty, please! I'm sure Jupiter will bring Eldonia back safe! You know he's very good with stuff like that. Snooping and poking around. Remember how much trouble he got into with papa that time on granny's birthday, when I was ten?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis snorted. \"He wasn't so good then\", he said. He let out a weak smile, and sat down on the bed. His sister sat on his lap. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See? He'll be fine, and Donnie'll be okay! They'll both come back safe!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis groaned, \"Whatever...I dunno, girl! I'm just worried! I want to have a big happy family with Donnie. She could give us lots of kids and we could have boys and girls to bring us all happiness and joy...and...and...well she's sweet!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course she is! She wouldn't be my best friend if she wasn't! Oh Forty, do stop worrying!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinerva snuggled up against her brother. Fortis wrapped a gigantic arm around her and squeezed her close to his solid, bare chest. She rubbed her cheek against him and gave him a sisterly kiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis sighed. \"Alright...\" he said. \"Tell you what, how about...\" </span></div></div>",

Maybe a snack might take her mind off of how uncertain things were. Fortis smiled. He got up and headed downstairs. Minerva followed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe house-girls were out. They either had their days off, or were in the gardens. There was no real problem with this. Fortis never really relied on them. He kept them on mostly because of tradition. And he could afford to pay their wages, so he didn't see why he shouldn't continue to do so. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mountain lord entered the kitchen of his castle. The kitchen was not huge, but not tiny, either. After all, it had to produce food for the lord, his friends, his family, and the household staff. Fortis reached for a frying-pan, a spatula, some bowls, plates, and other things. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll make us up some steak sandwiches, huh girl?\" Fortis asked. He started sawing at a loaf of bread, producing thick, fluffy slices of bread. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Aaaaah!\"</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinerva squealed! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Forty! Granny left Leo in the kitchen!\" she said. The year-old toddler sat on the kitchen table, sucking his thumb, looking googly-eyed at Aunty and Papa. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She did not!\" said Lady Athena, \"I went to get him his bottle from the larder!\" she added, coming into the kitchen from a corridor nearby, \"Here you are, my sweet treasure!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I'll do it, granny\", said Minerva. She hefted her nephew in her arms and sat down in a chair, slowly feeding the baby his milk-bottle. The baby suckled on the wooden teat with a steady <i>'smuk-smuk-smuk!!'</i> suckling sound. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLady Athena left the kitchen, and Minerva stroked her nephew. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww he's cute...Forty when Eldonia comes back, will you have more children?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Probably\", Fortis said. He started stoking up the range, getting the stove nice and hot, before drizzling oil onto the pan and cracking eggs onto it. The eggs sizzled in the hot olive oil. He beat them up with the spatula and stirred them around the pan. Minerva noticed that her brother's body was slick with sweat from the heat of the stove. She smiled. She bet Eldonia would be all over that. Her big, brave, bronzed beast... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis tossed on a few steaks and began frying them, too. Eventually, he transferred everything to plates. He carried the food out into the dining-hall and put it onto the table. Leo crawled along the dining-table. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mere, sonny!\" said Fortis. He grabbed his son and sat him in his lap, \"You want some steak, boy?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis tugged a small piece of meat out of his sandwich, \"Say 'Aaah'!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fortis! He's only a year old! He can't eat steak!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's got teeth, ain't he?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're MILK teeth!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Girl, when I was his age, I was eatin' a cow a week!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh rubbish!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ain't hardly! How you think I got so big, huh? Suckin' down moo-juice?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well of course you did! Milk builds bones!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. And eatin' what makes that milk makes them bones even bigger!\" he said, and flexed an arm, \"Now c'mon boy! Just a little bite...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinerva sighed. She watched as Leo munched on a particularly juicy bit of meat. He giggled! He liked it! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh if you MUST feed him that stuff, then at least mince it up!\" Minerva said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good idea, girl. I think I will...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I WAS JOKING!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not! I'll mince him some later...right now, I'm hungry...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After enjoying his meal with Minerva and his son (and eventually feeding Leo numerous small bites of steak, which the baby absolutely adored), Fortis sent Leo off with his sister to play.  He thought he would go to his study to get some work done, hoping that would distract him from thinking and worrying more about his missing wife and his brother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeated at his large desk, Fortis frowned down at the figures in his ledger, making several notations and doing some minor addition and subtraction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm...Tenant Weitboer has been skimping on his rations he pays for rent for the past three months!  How could I have overlooked this?!  And...wait a minute...he's not the only one!  Gerstboer, Vanderlanden, Geitherder....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis ran an irritated hand through his hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll have to address this issue with my tenants immediately, or they'll get even more stingy!  Plus, I need to collect the amount they've shorted me, or the king will have MY hide!  Blasted farmers!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA knock on the door interrupted his thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis threw his quill down on the blotter on the desk and barked out, \"Yes?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pardon me, my lord,\" his squire Koviac said upon opening the door a ways and bowing.  \"However, there is a...gentleman...here bearing a letter for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A letter?  Well, come on in and give it to me, then!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, er, the man said he was to deliver the letter to you personally, my lord.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, then, send him in!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Sir!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis shook his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA minute later, a middle-aged man entered the study and bowed before the young earl.  Fortis raised an eyebrow at the man's dress, for the stranger was wearing very simple clothing in very bright colors and patterns.  Fortis even caught a sparkle of light glinting off the man's ears, and Fortis was surprised to realize the man's ears were pierced!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have a letter for me?\" Fortis said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If thou art Lord Fortis Vanderstorm, aye, I bear a missive for thou,\" said the man in a distinct accent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis rose from his desk and approached the odd man.  \"I am Lord Vanderstorm, Sir, but WHO might you be?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I be Joaquim, my lord, and I have ridden hard all day and night to deliver this letter unto thy hands, and thine alone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoaquim presented a folded piece of parchment to Fortis, who took the note with a small amount of skepticism...until he unfolded it and read the signature at the bottom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's from Jupiter!\" he exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aye, the young man Jupiter and a young maedchen with him came and joined our caravan a couple days ago, my lord,\" Joaquim said with a nod of his head.  \"They be heading here with the rest of my kin.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis finally placed the odd dress and manner of speech.  \"You're a Valleyan, aren't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aye, my lord.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You say my brother Jupiter met up with you a few days ago, and he had a young woman with him?  Do you know the name of the woman?  And where did he join you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoaquim smiled at the anxious earl.  \"Perhaps your brother has addressed thy miriad questions in yon missive, my lord.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh!  Of course!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis then began quickly scanning the letter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"My dearest older brother,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI knew you would be worried sick still for Eldonia's (and perhaps even my own) safety, so I thought it best to send you a letter before we arrive back home to Castle Vanderstorm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou will be happy to know that I successfully made it into Vladia, infiltrated the enemy keep, found Eldonia, and killed her captor (some old man named Lord Ramius).  I was then able to lead her out of the keep and into the wilds of Vladia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA day or two after we fled her captors, we encountered a troupe of Valleyans along a Vladian road, and they were kind enough to allow us to travel with them in their caravan.  Steadily more Valleyans have been joining up with us, and we are now in a rather sizeable entourage heading into Mountania.  Joaquim, whom we quickly befriended, graciously agreed to carry and deliver this letter into your hands.  Please, treat him well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI know that your main concern is for Donnie, and while she is now safely out of the hands of those nasty Vladians...she unfortunately didn't escape from her kidnapping unscathed.  She has been unwilling to confide in me everything the Vladians did to her, but I know they treated her abysmally, brother.  She won't fall asleep unless I am there holding her (I can see your frown of jealousy, Fortis, and it was purely platonic, I swear!), and every night I am awoken by her cries as she relives her torture in her nightmares.  I am hoping that when we get home, she may find some comfort or some measure of peace with either you or Minnie, because she seems rather broken.  She is also anxious to see Leo again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I write this, the caravan is perhaps two days' journey out from Castle Vanderstorm, and assuming Joaquim makes it to you in good time, we should be seeing you in a day or so upon your receipt of this letter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing you soon,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour brother, Jupiter\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis grit his teeth and couldn't help himself from crushing the letter in his fists as he read it.  How dare those Vladian scoundrels torture his beloved, sweet, spunky wife?!  If it didn't mean going into Vladia, Fortis would teach those awful, foul, cretinous excuses for human beings to never kidnap or torture a Mountanian woman ever again!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you alright, my lord?\" Koviac asked, fidgeting nervously at the sight of the earl's obvious ire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"DO I LOOK ALRIGHT TO YOU?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis closed his eyes and took a deep breath.  \"Koviac, leave me.  Joaquim, thank you for delivering this letter.  If you're hungry, I'm sure Mrs. Tibbs has something to feed you in the kitchens.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I understand thy wife has been through a most heinous experience, my lord,\" Joaquim said sadly.  \"And I appreciate thy hospitality.  However, I needs must get back to my caravan.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis nodded his head.  \"Thank you.  Safe travels.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoaquim bowed, and both he and Koviac left the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis stomped over to the nearest window and seethed.  He needed to hit something...break something...yell out his anger.  Eldonia was tortured!  And his mind kept filling with all different kinds of horrible scenarios of how those disgusting Vladians treated his spunky, joyous wife.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis caught sight of Cannius wandering past his window, hauling his sword and shield, and a feral grin sprouted on Fortis's face.  Perfect!</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Fortis took several deep breaths. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinerva was soft. Tender. Gentle. Sweet. Loving. Trusting. Affectionate. She had an inner strength and determination, confidence and firmness. And Fortis adored all of her excellent qualities...even if she could be rather clingy at times. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia was fiery, excitable, loving, caring, darling, sweet, spunky, athletic and daring! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a wonderful balance between the two girls. No wonder they got along so well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis wondered how many of those qualities Eldonia would have left when she had returned after her ordeal? Fortis groaned. He slammed a fist into the stone walls of his study, letting out a loud growl of frustration! It was then that he saw Cannius swinging his sword around outside, practicing his moves. Overcome with fury, Fortis lumbered out of his study and into his bedroom. He changed his clothes and drew out his sword. He had to blow off steam, and this was probably the best way to do it... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took a great deal of upper-body strength to wield a sword effectively. Strong arm, back and chest-muscles were essential for handling the solid length of steel in anything approaching skill. It was because of this constant training that Fortis boasted impressive pecs, a broad chest, huge shoulders and massive arms. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs a knight, he had been forced by tradition to train since the age of five. He remembered his father training him when he was younger. Old lord Vanderstorm had been a knight, and although he had long retired from active military duty, he still knew all the skills for combat, and had rigorously trained his three sons in combat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe birth of their little sister had only given the three boys greater cause to make themselves the best that they could be. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis headed downstairs and into the garden. He could see Cannius swinging, swiping, stabbing and twisting, practicing his moves against invisible enemies. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell one of those enemies was about to become very visible indeed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>\"YAAAAARRGGGHHH!!\" </b></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nCRASH!! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteel screeched and sparks flew! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the dining-hall, housemaids cleaning up the luncheon things stopped in their work. They hurried to the windows. They unlocked them and pushed them open to watch the spectacle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsually, this would cause a change, and Fortis would become more of a showman. But today it was strictly business. He was there to burn off his anger and he was going to do it no matter who was watching! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarsh scraping, clashing sounds echoed around, as the two brothers fought. Lady Athena entered the dining-room when she heard the ruckus, and hurried to the windows. She was about to ask the boys to please keep it DOWN, as the baby was sleeping upstairs, but she was too impressed by the spectacle to stop watching. One of the maids pushed up some chairs and everyone sat down to watch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Quit-cher whining!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't ASK for you to come out and spar with me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you didn't say I COULDN'T, either!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You didn't give me time to object!

What else could I do but defend myself!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you're gonna keep on defending yourself, you lazy cur!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis swung and stabbed, and Cannius blocked and parried.  Fortis let everything he was feeling, all his pent-up emotions of anger and worry and fear, bubble up inside him, fueling his sword arm.  He took out everything he'd been feeling since Eldonia had been kidnapped on his younger brother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCannius, meanwhile, was seething himself.  He had merely wanted to practice a few sword moves, get in a little bit of training during the cool of the evening.  And then Fortis comes up and attacks him!  Well, two could play this game!  He was tired of constantly being on the defense around his surly brother these days.  Fortis seemed to have been taking out his anger on nearly every male in Castle Vanderstorm lately, with the exception of little Leo.  Well, Cannius had also been worried about Eldonia, and now Jupiter.  He'd show Fortis a thing or two!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YAAAAHHH!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a flurry of sword strikes, Cannius went on the offensive, making Fortis stagger back in surprise.  Despite his obvious advantage in height and weight and muscle, Fortis found himself now scrambling to block Cannius's sudden moves!  Cannius was more nimble and agile than Fortis was and kept moving in circles around Fortis.  Fortis began to pant and tire as he found himself now trying to keep from being sliced apart by Cannius's swings!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack in the house, the gathered maids began to titter in excitement when they saw the tide turn in the sword-fight.  While they all rooted for their lord and master to win, the quick turn-around with Cannius gaining momentum and the upper hand just built their excitement.  They relished the thought of the earl pulling ahead in the end and throwing Cannius down into the dust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLady Athena, though, frowned.  It was unusual for Fortis to make a mistake in a sword-fight.  Athena was all too aware of how over-confidence, arrogance, or emotional upheaval could affect how one performed in battle.  Her late husband had been known for his hot-headedness, and Athena remembered far too many times when she had to patch him up after he had severely lost a fight--be it with swords or fists.  She didn't relish having to do the same to either of her grandsons, but she rarely had to patch up Fortis.  She wondered if today might be different.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis's legs began to feel shaky as his adrenaline and anger began to wear off.  He grit his teeth and sliced his sword, but it merely swished through the air.  However, it temporarily left him open and vulnerable.  A brutal swing from Cannius at an unexpected angle made him stagger backwards in shock...and pain!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"ARRRRRGGGGGGHH!\" Fortis howled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe involuntarily dropped his sword and clenched his bloody arm with his free hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That would be first blood, Forty,\" Cannius said haughtily, though his chest was heaving for breath.  \"I win!  Finally!\"  He pumped his sword into the air, then spun on his heel and swaggered back into the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis stood there in shock!  Neither of his brothers had ever beaten in him a fight before!  NEVER!  Fortis glanced down at his stinging arm, not able to believe the sight of blood running down from the long cut across his bicep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe maids as one all gasped!  The earl had...LOST?!  Such a thing had never occurred before!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I don't know about you girls,\" one of them said after a long moment, \"but I think Lord Cannius deserves a little...attention...after winning his fight!\"  She primped her hair, pinched her cheeks, and gave the other maids a seductive waggle of her eyebrows before leaving the dining room, adding a little swing to her hips as she walked away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLady Athena rolled her eyes and clapped her hands to get the other maids' attention.  \"Lord Fortis obviously needs medical attention.  Susan, go get a dish of hot water.  Rachel, some thread and a needle.  Cynthia, tear an old sheet into rags, and make sure it's a clean one.  We don't want his wound going septic.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls scurried off to get the ordered items just as Fortis wandered into the dining room.  He slumped down into a chair and simply stared straight ahead...as if he were still in shock.  Athena tsked at her oldest grandson and went over to inspect his wound.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I've seen worse,\" she said, grabbing a chair and hauling it over so she could stitch it back up.  \"It's a nice clean slice and should heal readily.  The jagged lacerations are the ones you have to worry about.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis turned blank eyes to his grandmother as if not really seeing her.  \"I...I lost,\" he said in disbelief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAthena frowned.  \"So you did.  But you let your temper get the best of you, boy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis snorted.  \"Twas my temper what led me to fight Cannius in the first place.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aye.  And look what that taught you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAthena just sighed as Fortis frowned and looked off into space.  When the maids brought all the supplies Athena had asked for, she went about the task of cleaning, sewing up, and bandaging Fortis's wound.  Fortis didn't wince or show any sign of pain even once through the whole process.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come now, son, go take a bath and relax for a bit,\" Athena said softly, laying a hand on Fortis's enormous shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis sighed and ran his good hand over his face.  \"Yeah.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter several strong lads had dumped the hot water in his own personal brass tub, Fortis sank wearily into his bath.  His arm was beginning to really sting, but he kept it up out of the water so that the bandaging wouldn't get wet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe couldn't believe his brother had actually got first blood in a sword fight!  Fortis had always won before...ALWAYS!  It didn't seem right that he somehow lost this time!  He was the tallest, the oldest, the strongest!  He still was!  But then, how did Cannius manage to get the better of him?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis had worked off a mad plenty of times before in a sword fight!  He'd also sparred with his brothers countless times before!  What made this one fight different from all the rest?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I've never been afraid for Eldonia's life before</i>, he admitted to himself.  <i>Or worried about her state of being when she returns to me.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis sank lower in the water, slumping his shoulders.  The fight hadn't made him feel any better.  If anything, it only made him feel worse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis was so absorbed in his despondent thoughts, he didn't see the door to his bathing chamber slowly open or hear the soft noise of fabric moving along the wooden floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Clang!  Clang!  Clang!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis suddenly shot up his bath!  A giggle sounded from the floor, and Fortis leaned over the tub.  Leo sat on his bottom, banging his fist merrily against the brass tub.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Clang!  Clang!  Clang!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis couldn't help a small smile.  His son never ceased to cheer him up when he was feeling down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come here, you little noisemaker!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeo giggled as Papa lifted him high in the air and then settled him on his chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Papa!  Baff!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeo leaned over and batted his hand on the surface of the water, splashing his father's face and chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right, you little scamp!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis splashed the water himself, and ended up dousing his fully clothed son so that the boy was completely drenched!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis laughed at the surprised look on Leo's face, and then removed the sopping clothes and nappy from the boy's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yea!  Baff wiff Papa!\"  Leo clapped his little hands, then his father's cheeks, and then the bathwater again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, the two were happily playing in the water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis reveled in spending some quality time with his son...until Leo tired out a bit and lay sleepily on his father's broad chest and asked innocently, \"Papa?  Where Momma, Papa?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the baby rubbed his fist in his eye, Fortis inwardly cursed at being reminded once more of Eldonia's absence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis cleared his throat and gently rubbed the boy's back.  \"Momma's been...um...travelling, Leo.  She'll be back in a day or two.  I'm sure she's missed you a lot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeo sniffed.  \"Want Momma.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, boy.  I want her, too.\"</span></div></div>",

Please, come in.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia let the flap of the tent fall down behind her as she entered the bright, airy space.  A large cauldron was bubbling furiously on a fire in the far corner.  A round table with two chairs was set up in the middle.  A crystal ball that had a white mist swirling in its midst was sitting in the middle of the table.  An old woman with long white hair was sitting hunched over in the far chair.  A fuchsia scarf was wrapped around her head, numerous golden necklaces hung from her neck, and bangles covered her wrists.  She had a smile on her face as she raised a gnarled hand at Eldonia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTake a seat, meine Teure**.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia sat in the closest chair and put her hands primly in her lap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI understand that thou hast had a rather trying time recently,\u201d Madam Matilda said kindly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes,\u201d Eldonia said simply, not really wishing to talk about what she had gone through at the hands of her Vladian captors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI am most sorry for all that happened to thee.  Most unpleasant business those Vladians engage in.  However, I have <i>seen</i> some things recently in mein crystal ball about thee that I felt I should share with thee.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHast thou been feeling poorly lately?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPoorly?  Well, um,...I suppose I haven't felt completely healthy since I was kidnapped several weeks ago.  It's only been in the past couple of days when Jupiter and I came into your caravan that I've had a decent amount of food to eat.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia paused and swallowed hard as the old gypsy woman just stared at her...seemingly stared <i>through</i> her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c...Well, I suppose despite all the food available, I...haven't had much of an appetite over the past couple of days.  But I just figured that was because the first meal I had with you, I ate too much and ended up getting sick.  A-and the smell of cooked rabbit still makes me queasy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatilda nodded at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia's eyes widened in fright, and she splayed her hands on the table in front of her.  \u201cOh, no!  Am I ill with something?  Did one of those Vladians...*gulp*...g-g-give me...something...?  Something...horrible?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia had heard horror stories from some of the maids in her father's house and in Castle Vanderstorm about some of the diseases uncultured men could give to women through...sexual contact.  What if she had caught something from one of her captors?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, no, mein Kind.  Nothing like that.  But hast thou been lethargic, as well?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI...suppose so.  I feel as if I can't get enough sleep these days, but I felt that way the entire time I was in Vladia, too.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatilda smiled at Eldonia.  \u201cHast thou not figured it out for thyself, yet?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia racked her brain over her symptoms, but her mind was a bit foggy and unfocussed.  She shook her head sadly at the old gypsy.  \u201cI...I don't know.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatilda waved her hand over the crystal ball, and the swirling mist inside began swirling faster.  Soon, a picture appeared in the middle of the mist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTake a look at thy future, meine Teure,\u201d Matilda murmured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia leaned forward and watched with wonder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Fortis was holding a slightly older Leo's hands as the little boy was taking several toddling steps forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere's my big boy!\u201d she heard herself say.  She saw her own hands stretched out toward Leo and Leo's big smile as Fortis let go.  Leo continued walking by himself until he fell into her arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWook, Momma!  I big boy!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia held Leo tightly, laughing all the while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, you are, Leo,\u201d Fortis said, sinking down on his haunches to engulf his family in his big, strong arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLeo make good big bwuver?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis laughed.  \u201cI'm sure you will!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia saw herself look down.  Leo was patting her belly.  But, her belly wasn't flat.  It was large and round.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis placed his hand on top of Leo's on her belly and smiled at Eldonia before leaning close and giving her an intense kiss.  \u201cI can't wait to meet this little one, Donnie.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeo giggled.  \u201cBaby kick me, Momma!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia looked down and smiled.  \u201cThat's his way of saying 'hello'!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHewwo, baby!\u201d</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the image in the glass ball faded, Eldonia sat back in shock.  She put a hand to her very flat belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI'm...I'm....\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked up at Matilda uncertainly.  The old woman nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThou art.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInitially, Eldonia felt excitement.  She was giving Fortis another baby!  She remembered him saying how he wanted a large family, and she was glad she could give it to him!  Maybe another son....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then, reality intruded.  For the last month before her kidnapping, she hadn't slept with Fortis at all...until that last night they were together, and then they had shagged like rabbits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, after that one wonderful night with Fortis....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTears sprang to Eldonia's eyes, and she quickly removed her hand from her belly.  She clenched the arms of her chair tightly.  What if...it wasn't Fortis's baby?  She had been r-r-...<i>taken</i>...countless times by that awful Loki, not to mention Lord Ramius, and who knows who did what to her when she was passed out or asleep!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMadam Matilda,\u201d Eldonia gasped, trying to keep from sobbing.  \u201cCan you...t-tell me if my husband, Fortis,...is the father of my baby?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatilda got up and placed a gentle hand on Eldonia's shoulder.  \u201cI am afraid the spirits have not revealed that to me.  I am very sorry, mein Kind.  The only thing I canst do for thee is give thee a potion.  Thou canst give it to thy Kind upon birth, and it shalt reveal the Pater of thy Kind.  However, if thy experience is too much for thee....\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe old woman went over to a trunk near the wall of the tent and rummaged through a few drawstring sacks and herbs.  She eventually found what she was looking for and presented a sealed bag to Eldonia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis herb canst...relieve...thee of thy burden.  Merely steep it as tea for three minutes and drink down the liquid.  Thou willt bleed for several hours, but thy burden willt be gone.  However, the herb must be used within the next four weeks; otherwise, thy Kind willt be too large to remove and cause thy own death.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia stared at the drawstring bag with wide eyes.  She had never considered the possibility of...abortion...before.  She didn't want to kill Fortis's baby.  But, if it were Loki's baby....  Eldonia shuddered at the thought.  She didn't know if she could raise the child of her repeated rapes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHesitantly, she took the bag from the old woman.  Matilda smiled at her kindly.  The gypsy then retrieved a vial that contained an opalescent liquid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis potion will reveal the Pater of thy Kind...should thou choose to bear the Kind to term.  The face of the Pater will briefly insinuate itself over the face of thy Kind.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia took the vial, too, then stood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you, Madam Matilda.  I...appreciate you telling me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMein Teure,\u201d the old woman murmured, taking the discomfited girl in her bony arms for a comforting hug.  \u201cThou shalt be alright.  May the spirits guide thee in thy decisions.  Trust in thy husband...and in thyself.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI...I will, Madam Matilda.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia let a few tears fall at the kind woman's words and then left the tent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDonnie!\u201d Jupiter yelled as he ran up to her.  \u201cHey, we're only a few hours away from Castle Vanderstorm!  We'll be there by supper time!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh!  Great!\u201d Eldonia said with a forced smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the caravan packed up to head on down the road, Eldonia's thoughts were in a whirl.  While she was grateful she would soon be home, what and how could she, should she, share what she had gone through in Vladia...let alone the knowledge she had just received?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia placed one hand on her belly, while she put the other in her pocket where she stashed the abortion herb and the paternity potion.  What would Fortis or Minerva or Grandma Athena think she should do?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*mein Kind = my child<br>\r\n**meine Teure = my dear</span></div></div>",

The man pointed south, \"Thy home be southwards from here. We travel onwards to the White Castle, to meet the great wizard, the aged Draxon the White. Here we shall part our ways\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you\", said Jupiter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTogether, with some provisions, the two Mountanians started walking home. The sun began to rise as they got closer and closer. They found the intersection in the road and turned left, now heading eastwards. The sun was warm on her face and Eldonia was eager to be home. They went through the woods and out the other side. The same horrible woods where she had been captured! They went up a hill...and then in the distance...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jupiter look! I see it!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJupiter looked up. In the distance, the towering form of a fortified manor-house. The castle! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mon! We're nearly home!\" he said. \"Just a couple more miles!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Jupiter, thank you for coming to find me and to bring me home!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey it's okay. Think how happy everyone will be to see you?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia gulped. Yeah. But what would they say when they found out she was with-child?? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey approached the walls around the castle and entered through the gates. They headed inside, quietly, trying not to make any noise. It was still early and the household was still asleep. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia felt her feet press on the cold stone floor of the entrance hall. She was home! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuietly, she tiptoed upstairs and into a bedroom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLying in bed, Minerva cuddled a pillow...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinerva jerked awake when she felt hands on her! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"El!...Mmuuufffffffh!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia muffled Minerva's mouth, covering it with her hands!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shhhhhh!!! Not so LOUD!\" she hissed, \"I don't want to wake everyone up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When did you get home!?\" Minerva whispered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just now. Jupiter's downstairs!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Donnie! You're safe!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...yeah!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two girls hugged each other. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you alright? You must be exhausted! And hungry! You must be hungry, right? You must be...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Expecting\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh of course! Abso...WHAT!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NOT SO LOUD!!\" Eldonia hissed! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're pregnant!? Again!?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Minnie, I'm scared!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you're having a baby!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean...Well...things happened when I was in Vladia and...I don't know if it's Forty's baby...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took a minute for Minerva to understand this. But then a look of dawning horror crept over her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't mean...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It MIGHT be. I can't possibly know for sure until it's born...can I?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinerva frowned. \"I don't know. How did you find out?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A valleyan gypsy woman told me\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinerva nodded, \"Well they do have a magic of their own. But then, their magic is not as strong as those of Fantasmian blood...Perhaps we should consult Ursula? You know, Merlin's grandmother?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMerlin was the young wizard lord who lived with his grandparents at the White Castle. A cheeky, handsome youth, usually kept in strict line by his grandmother. Eldonia frowned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, that's not a bad idea...But we'll not do it now. I want to relax...Where's Forty?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Asleep!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooh good. I think I'll go um...surprise him...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinerva giggled.

She opened the double-doors and crept inside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLying on his side, Fortis was fast asleep. Wrapped in his powerful arms, was a little, blond-tufted creature, suckling on a pacifier. Eldonia gasped and put a hand to her heart. He was cuddling him! <i>Awwwww!!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia drew closer to the bed and the full immensity of her husband, her lord and master, swept over her. Seeing this display of strength and power before her made her loins tremble...she so much wanted to be a part of it... to be in that strong, powerful, teasing embrace of his arms... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe slipped between the sheets and shuffled over. The baby woke up! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Suck-suck-suck!!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shhhh!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Pop!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mama!\" Leo squeaked, spitting the pacifier out of his mouth! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shhh...It's okay sweetie...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia took her baby boy and cuddled him. And then slowly replaced him with herself, in her husband's arms. She felt the warm, firm flesh wrap around her. And a deep, grumbling grunt as Fortis continued to sleep. Eldonia wrapped one arm around the baby, while the other went exploring the um...<i>Mountanian Highlands</i>. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis chuckled in his sleep...such a gentle touch...He grunted and drew the figure closer to him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pretty girl...hehehehe...Mmmm...sweetie girl...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia moved closer, and drew her lips up to her husband's face. She kissed him on the cheek...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WAAAUUURRGGGHHH!!!!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Waaaah! waaaaaah!!! Hu-h-h-huuuwaaaaaaaahh!!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith stupendous force, Fortis pushed the bedroom invader away from him and sat upright! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What on earth!? Wh...W-w-what are you doing here!?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia grinned, \"Hi Sweetie!...Oooh there, there, Leo! Papa didn't mean to scare you...Awww...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis let out a slow exhale of breath. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When in the name of Thor's Hammer did you get here!?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"About an hour ago! Jupiter's downstairs!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis stared at his wife as if she was a mirage. Then, he gave her a hug and two big kisses! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have NO idea how much I MISSED YOU!...DON'T EVER GO AWAY AGAIN!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia laughed, and then squeaked when Fortis enveloped her in a rib-crushing hug! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I love you too, sweetie...\" she said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doors opened. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What on earth...Eldonia you're home!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi granny!\" said Eldonia, smiling at Lady Athena. Leo giggled! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gwamma! Mama home-home!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes I can see that! My darling! Are you alright??\" </span></div></div>",

He watched as she left the room and headed to her own bedroom, the room which had once been Fortis's, when his father had still been alive. She headed inside and laid on the bed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Suck-suck-suck!!!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeo toddle-crawled across the bed to momma's chest. He popped out his pacifier and fiddled with the cloth barricade that barred him from his prize. The round, warm, shapely fun-bags that held the nectar that he so desired... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia laid listless in bed, not thinking of very much at all, except of what might be going on inside her belly. Without really thinking about it, she unbuttoned her bodice and Leo began suckling hungrily on momma's round, generous chest. The same chest that Fortis used to squeeze and play with, and which she would pretend to be offended and shocked over...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Eldonia had no mind for her husband's scandalous hijinks, or her baby son's affectionate attentions. She was too preoccupied with the news...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was expecting another baby!...Perhaps two? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia frowned. Twins?? What if she had THREE boys!?...Or maybe...two girls? Or a boy and a girl? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer mind exploded with all the possibilities...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--- --- --- --- <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Mama! Mama!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo beautiful blond-haired girls skittered into the drawing-room, \"Momma! Leo won't help us build our doll-house!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn older Eldonia looked up at two sweet-looking girls, about the age of eight. Behind them followed a tall, solid-looking youth. He was ten years old, but already six feet tall, with a tan and dark blond hair. This must be Leo as a pre-teen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I said I MIGHT help! I'm busy helping papa fix the stove in the kitchen! Why can't Uncle Jupiter make the house for them?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you're so good making things with wood, Lee-Lee!\" one of the girls said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sapphire! You know your brother doesn't like you calling him that!\" Eldonia scolded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But we always call him Lee-Lee!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rosalind! His name is Leonardo!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Yes mother...Leo why won't you help us?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mother!!!...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, what's going on here?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA deep voice filled the air and the three children turned to face their lord and father. Fortis entered. Gosh he looked handsome, Eldonia thought. He was by now in his early thirties, nicely matured. No taller, but he looked stronger and larger in other ways. His once golden-blond hair had darkened slightly and he had a permanent rash of stubble on his face that Eldonia loved to stroke in bed...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Papa! Leo won't help us build our dollhouse!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pops I already TOLD them I was busy! I gotta help you fix the...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've finished the stove. Now go help your sisters make their house!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What!? No way!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yaaaaay! We love you, papa!\" the girls said in a sing-song voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooooh brother...\" Leo groaned. \"Pops please!? Cousin Champion's coming over later! He's taking me out hunting!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAFTER you help them with the doll's house\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Son of...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT WAS THAT!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I could help!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia turned to see a beautiful young lady in her early twenties, with long, red-brown hair done up in braids, wearing a beautiful wine-red dress. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Girl! I thought you were spending the day with the prince?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We did. Court business drew him back to Ferramount unexpectedly. The pressures of being royalty, I suppose...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis smiled and put an arm around his sister. She was slightly taller now, but nowhere near as big as her brother. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Papa, why do you treat Aunty Minnie like that?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"'Cause she's pretty. Don'tcha think your aunt's pretty?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well yeah, but...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't take that tone with your aunt, Leo!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry pops...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll help them with the doll's house\", said Minerva. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks Aunty! Love you!\" said Leo, and before Fortis could catch him, the athletic youth bounded up the stairs to get changed! \"When's Uncle Wolfgang and Aunty Vesta coming for dinner!?\" he called from the landing, \"And I wanna see Astrid as well! She said she had some things she wanted me to fix and she'd bring them along!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He helps Astrid fix her broken charm-bracelet, but he won't help US fix our doll's house!\" Sapphire pouted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah! His own sisters!\" Rosalind sneered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis smiled and knelt in front of his treasures. \"Sweeties...Your brother loves you. He's just...occupied, that's all...I tell you what, I'll help you fix the doll's house. Let me just go get my toolbox, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you papa!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia smiled as the two girls squeezed their father around his torso and kissed him...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n--- --- --- --- <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia yawned. What happened!?...What a dream...Leo had stopped sucking on her breast. She buttoned it up and crawled into bed. Leo wriggled and slipped under the covers with his mother. She hugged him and popped his pacifier into his mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Suck-suck-suck-suck....</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n--- --- --- --- <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Hi momma! Bye momma!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Leo wai...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi momma! Bye momma!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thund...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi momma! Bye M--YEOUCH!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA boy yelped as his mother grabbed him by the ear and twisted it, hard! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Leo Vanderstorm! Thunder Bastion Vanderstorm! Maximus! Not a SINGLE ONE OF YOU is going outside until you CLEAN YOUR ROOMS!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awww momma...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"UPSTAIRS NOW!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Grandma! Speak to...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOld Lady Athena pretended not to hear, and returned to her knitting. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awww shit...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT WAS THAT!?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothin' granny. Momma can't we do it afterwards? We wanna play jousting!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't care if you want to carve a giant stone phallus in the garden again!..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah that was cool...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YOU ARE NOT DOING A THING UNTIL YOU CLEAN UP YOUR ROOMS!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...But you liked the stone dick, right mah? Pops thought it was awesome! He said it was kinda small. We should've used a bigger slab of granite instead of...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"UPSTAIRS! NOW!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinerva watched from next to her grandmother as her three nephews were sent back upstairs. Leo, Thunder and Maximus were all handsomely-developed Mountain bucks of the best order. Only 14 and 13 years old each, they were nonetheless tall and handsome, all of them well past seven feet, and promising to be just as vast and towering as their father. Eldonia had learnt to be firm with men, especially those who stood well over the top of her! Eldonia sighed. Those boys!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n--- --- --- --- <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Suck!...Suck-suck-suck...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeo fidgeted in bed. His mother hugged him tighter and stroked his soft blond hair. Such a pretty little boy... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Kiss!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n--- --- --- --- <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"H-h-h-huuwaaaaahhh!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tch!...Awww...Awww it's okay...Awwww....\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Minnie! Minnie c'mere! Look at this!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinerva tiptoed down the corridor and stopped outside the nursery. Eldonia was peeking through a crack in the door. Minerva joined her. The two girls peered through, to see Fortis with his back to them, bent over a baby's crib. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awww...\" Fortis was saying, \"Awww...There there sweetie-pie. Who's a girl? Aaah? You are! Who's a little girl? You are! Who's a pretty girl? You are! Who's a baby girl? You are! And who's girl are you? Mine! And what are you? Huh? Are you a pretty little baby girl!? Are you MY pretty little baby girl? Awww...Shhhh...papa wuuuv!!...Awwww...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yesh yoo arrr! Shuch a pwiddy widdul shapphire babyboodles! Muah!...Awww...Papa's gonna take you to BED with him and he's gonna cuddle and snuggle and tickle and tuckle you in! Yes he is! And he's gonna... WAAARRGGGHHH!!!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis jumped out of his SKIN when he saw his wife and his sister staring at him during this moment of TOTAL lack of msculinity! He looked mortified! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awwww...Widdul Forty iz pwaying wiff da baby!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shaddup, girl!\" Fortis growled. Eldonia and Minerva doubled over laughing at Fortis left the room in a huff, pretending not to notice, and carried his infant-daughter back to his room to sleep...</i></span></div></div>",

Fortis would be so cute with a daughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia sank back down into sleep, holding Leo contentedly in her arms, but her next dreams took a decidedly uncomfortable turn....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--- --- --- ---<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"That can't possibly be right!\" Fortis exclaimed. \"Give him the potion again!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eldonia, are you sure you're following that old gypsy woman's instructions correctly?\" Lady Athena asked gently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith tears in her eyes, Eldonia nodded. \"I think so! She said to give the baby a teaspoon of potion and that the face of the father will appear over the face of the baby within a minute.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, do it again!\" Fortis growled, crossing his strong arms over his chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHolding back a sob, Eldonia shakily poured another dose of the opalescent potion onto a silver teaspoon and carefully dribbled it into the baby boy's mouth. Everyone in the room held their breath over the next minute until the floating visage of the baby's father appeared over the baby's face. For the second time, everyone saw Loki's smirking face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia hugged her arms around herself and sank to the floor sobbing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'LL KILL HIM!\" Fortis roared. \"I'LL KILL THAT STINKING VLADIAN WHO STOLE MY SON FROM ME!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith much more cursing and swearing, Fortis and his brothers left the nursery, plotting revenge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAthena and Minerva, however, stayed to comfort Eldonia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-it's all my...f-f-fault!\" Eldonia wailed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sh, sh, now!\" Athena said gently, taking Eldonia into her arms. \"It's not your fault, Eldonia. None of what happened to you was your fault!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"B-but I was so SURE...the baby would be...*sob!*...would be Fortis's!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Donnie, there was no way anyone could have known,\" Minerva said, patting her friend and sister-in-law on the arm, tears clouding her own eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I should have aborted him! I...don't want...HIS child!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eldonia, are you sure about this?\" Athena asked. \"After all, though he may not be Fortis's, he's still YOUR child, your son! If you should choose to raise him, Fortis will eventually come around and raise him as his own.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know, Granny. I'm not...sure </i>I<i> can raise him, let alone, F-forty!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Take you time, sweetheart!  If you should ultimately choose to let him go, we will make sure he's put in a good home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whuh...whuh...waah! Waaaaahhh! WAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHH!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia looked at the cradle. Her chest ached, and she knew the two-day-old baby was hungry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinerva led her to the rocking chair, while Athena gathered up the crying baby and carried him over to Eldonia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia shook her head wildly. It was one thing to feed the baby when there was still hope he was Fortis's, but now....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAthena looked at her sternly.  \"Until a decision is made regarding this child's fate, I will not have him starve to death! You will feed this child!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAthena shoved him into Eldonia's arms, and Eldonia swallowed hard. She looked down into the red little tear-stained face and felt a smidge of pity. It wasn't the baby's fault, after all, that his father was an awful Vladian who had raped his mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia sighed and slowly undid the buttons on her bodice so that the baby...her son...could feed.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n--- --- --- ---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTears fell down Eldonia's cheeks in her sleep. She snuggled Leo closer to her chest and held him tightly to her, as if he could stave off the negative direction her dreams had taken.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--- --- --- ---<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Odin! Where have you been? I've been looking all over for you! It's dinner time!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was just 'sploring, Momma!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh? And why are your pockets bulging like that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe eight-year-old shrugged his shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia narrowed her eyes and crossed her arms over her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is in your pockets, young man? Have you been stealing from your brothers again?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, Momma!  Honest!\" Odin gave his most innocent smile to his mother, but Eldonia had seen that look on her son's face too many times before to believe it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we'll see about that! Empty your pockets, now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOdin began to look angry and stomped his feet on the wooden floor. \"No, Momma! They're mine! I saw 'em first!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia held out her hand and spoke sternly, \"Give me what you stole from Leo, Thunder, and Dynamo, or I will tell your father!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA quick flash of fear crossed Odin's face. \"Pl-please, don't tell Papa! He'll whip me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, he will! How many times have we punished you for stealing?! This is getting old, Odin! Now, give me what you stole!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOdin slumped his shoulders and slowly emptied his pockets. Eldonia shook her head as her son placed Leo's brand new dragon-hide gloves, Thunder's small collection of geodes, and Dynamo's prized golden arrowhead in her hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia sighed and knelt down in front of her son. She winced when once more all she could see in him was the face of her long-ago rapist. \"Why do you keep doing these things, Odin? You have plenty of toys and items that you collect. Your father and I have always given you everything you asked within reason.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOdin stood there sullenly, his chin to his chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, baby. Talk to me. You know I still love you, don't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOdin slowly nodded his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then, why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOdin shrugged and looked into his mother's eyes. \"I don't know, Momma,\" he said quietly. \"I can't help it. Something inside me, like a voice in my head tells me to do it. It makes me do it, Momma. I'm...I'm sorry! REAL sorry! Please, don't tell Papa! I'll try really hard not to do it again!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia put down the stolen items and gathered her son in her arms. \"I know, Odin,\" she murmured. \"I know, and I won't tell your father.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n--- --- --- ---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia woke to Leo's cries. A foul odor immediately apprised her of why. She scooped him up and carried him down to the nursery to change his nappy. When he was all smiles and giggles again, she sank down into the rocking chair and held him as he shakily stood on her thighs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You look so much like your father,\" she murmured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeo yawned and snuggled down against his mother's chest. Eldonia held him tight as she gently rocked the both of them back to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--- --- --- ---<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Ugly Odin!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Odin the Odd!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Odin the Oaf!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha, that's a good one, Maximus!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I got it! Odin the Odoriferous!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did you call me?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, well, well, if it isn't the smelliest one of all!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean the littlest one of all!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You take that back!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why should I? You can't beat me in a fight, and we all know it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, yeah?! Well, I'll show you! I'll show all of you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fortis, what's going on out here?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, just watching our boys fight is all!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But, Forty! You know it's never fair! Odin has always been smaller and weaker than his brothers! Look at them! Leo and Max are pounding Odin into the ground! You need to stop them!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why? Odin will never build up his strength and his battle-prowess if he can't even handle a fight with his own brothers!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yea! Go, Leo!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, go Maxie!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Girls! Go back in the house!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awww, but Momma! We love watching the boys fight!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, Momma! Brother Leo always wins!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Does not! Brother Maxie sometimes wins!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See, Forty? Even our daughters know that Odin will never come out on top in a fight! And look at him! He's almost beaten to a pulp! Stop this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, all right! BOYS! MOMMA SAYS STOP! GO INSIDE AND WASH UP FOR SUPPER!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Odin, sweetie,\" Eldonia clucks when she comes up to her bruised and bloodied son.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Momma, why can't I ever win? Why am I so short and small? Why does everyone HATE me? And why do I look so different from everyone else?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh-what do you mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Leo and Max look like Papa, Diamond looks like Aunt Minnie, and Lily looks like you. But I don't look like any of you! I'm second oldest! But even Diamond is taller than I am! It's not fair!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia sighed. \"I know, Odin. Come on inside, and I'll clean you up, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't want you coddling me anymore! You've always treated me different! Papa's never played with me or looked at me the same as he has Leo or Max! Tell me what's going on!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Odin, I don't--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"TELL ME!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia took a deep breath. \"You really want to know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YES!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was kidnapped by Vladians about fourteen years ago. They...tortured me and did awful things to me. Your uncle Jupiter found me and brought me back home, but when I got home, I found out I was carrying you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOdin reeled back, his eyes wide. \"You mean...that I'm....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia nodded sadly, a few tears slipping down her cheeks. \"It was the hardest decision I ever made, to carry you to term and keep you. Despite who your father is, Odin, you're still MY son. And I love you very much!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOdin shook his head in disbelief, got shakily to his feet, and ran off into the woods.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n--- --- --- ---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia gasped as she awoke once more. She put a hand to her flat belly and began crying. If her child were indeed Loki's or some other Vladian's, how could she bear to raise it?</span></div></div>",

She had been having so many different dreams and thoughts lately...which one of them was even real? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Vanderstorm family sat down to breakfast. There was a mix of sweet and savoury dishes on the sideboard, and when Minerva got to her feet, she could choose from eggs, bacon, sausages, porridge, pancakes, waffles, potatoes and a staggering array of buns and tarts. She was glad she had only a small appetite or she would soon end up as round and plump as Mrs. Tibbs! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>*Jangle-jangle-jangle!!*</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aaaahh!!\" Eldonia squeaked! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooh there, there!\" said Athena, \"Her nerves are so frayed ever since she got back!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Liza, the door\", Fortis said flatly. The housemaid curtsied and left the dining-room. She headed down the corridor and opened the front doors. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is your master at home?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding on the stoop was a tiny, wrinkled old woman dressed entirely in black. She held a battered old walking-stick and a sack over her shoulder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes ma'am\", said the maid, bobbing in curtsy, \"Who should I say has arrived?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will not require an introduction\", the lady said. Her voice was sort of rough and sharp. She shuffled into the foyer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEliza turned around. Standing outside was a handsome youth with stunning white blond hair. He smiled and came in. Sunlight seemed to radiate from his smooth, pale skin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am Lord Merlin\", he said. he didn't look any older than twelve! \"She's my grandmother\", he added. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"COME ALONG, MERLIN!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...Coming granny!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis sat up in his seat, \"Uh-oh...Granny, you did tell Ursula to come AFTER breakfast, didn't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...um...her eyesight is not what it was...\" Athena said, \"She may have misread the letter. You know how old she is\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Never mind\", Fortis said, \"We're nearly done, anyway\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo figures entered the dining room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Merlin!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe handsome young wizard smiled and rushed to Minerva. The two friends hugged. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Athena\", said Ursula creakiily, \"You are well?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, yes! Here's your patient, doctor!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aaah...the virtuous young maiden...Hmmmm...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ursula, I DID mention that it was a pregnancy through...misadventure, shall we say. it is in no way a reflection on her character!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe old witch nodded. \"We shall see\", she said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you tell me who the baby's father is? I would really want to know!\" Eldonia said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUrsula frowned, \"I can try...\" she said. \"I will need somewhere quiet where I can work\", she said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's go to the parlour\", said Athena. Everyone got up and started towards the parlour. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now\", said Ursula, taking some things out of her bag. A wand, a ball, and some bottles of potions, \"You will forgive me, but I must ask some rather...um...personal...questions. Anyone offended by such things should leave now\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNobody stood up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well...Fortis, you are this woman's lawfully and naturally wedded husband?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...naturally...wed?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She means have you had sex before!?\" Athena hissed. A few people giggled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, Leo toddled in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mama!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...Yeah\", said Fortis, and pointed to the baby. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone laughed. Eldonia put an arm around her toddling son. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course...I had forgot you had another child. That is very good. I may need it later on\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a boy, Ursula. It's not an 'it', it's a 'him'\", Eldonia corrected. The old witch paid no attention. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When is the last time you two um...enjoyed each other's company?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis frowned, \"Um...About a month or two ago, I think? We hadn't been...getting along and well...we found ourselves in special circumstances. And one thing...led to another and...we had fun...huh?\" he said, looking at Eldonia, who blushed red! Cannius and Jupiter grinned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Was it um...a single event?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh gosh...no um...two or three times...\" said Eldonia. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"FORTIS!\" Athena said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, at least I'm healthy gran!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinerva laughed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And these other events...they happened...when?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"About a week after I spent my time with Fortis\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm. As many times as before?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I don't think so...Maybe once or twice...I don't know! It was all so terrible!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good!\" said the witch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"GOOD!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Certainly. I must know your emotions. They are important!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! You're welcome\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you were happy with your husband?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Indescribably so...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eeeewww!\" Cannius yelped! \"T-M-I!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"His big, strong arms and his powerful upper body, pressing down an innocent, weak waif, submitting to his bestial rage!!...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's enough, darling...\" said Athena. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinerva giggled and Fortis smirked. <i>Yeah. You BET that's what happened. </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe witch cleared her throat. \"Very well. Athena, you said something about Vladian gypsies in your letter...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's VALLEYAN, granny!\" Merlin said, \"I don't know why you don't get yourself a new pair of glasses like grandpa does!...HERE'S the letter...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAthena read over her own writing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yes!\" she said, \"Eldonia was given some...medicines...by the Valleyans on her way home. One to tell the paternity of the child, and the other to um...rid her of her burden\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUrsula nodded. \"I would like to see them\", she said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinerva hurried upstairs to the nursery and came back a couple of minutes later. The old witch held one bottle, and then the other, in her hands, and peered at them through a gold-rimmed monocle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm...this one, we may not need\", she put down the abortion drug. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"THIS ONE...may prove useful to my...examination. We have a similar potion in Fantasmia. It does more or less the same thing, but it is of greater strength and capability\", she said. \"I will ask everyone to leave the room\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What for?\" Jupiter asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I must have the lady expose herself, or the next part of my experiment will not work!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I'm not leaving!\" said Fortis, firmly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh very well...\" said Ursula, \"The husband may stay. Everybody else, OUT!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne by one, everyone else filed out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUrsula pointed to the sofa. \"My dear, I'll ask you to remove the top part of your dress and lay down on the couch. Strip all the way down to your waist!...Don't be shy! Come along now!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia slowly tugged off her bodice and top robes, and lay down on the couch. After her recent ordeal, she wasn't exactly happy exposing herself to anyone but immediate family at the moment! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's this got to do with finding out who the father is?\" Fortis said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Valleyans have good magic, but they do not always fully realise their own powers\", Ursula explained. \"My people have found that this paternity potion works in more than just one way\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How's that?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I bet the lady who gave you this...\" the old witch waved the bottle, \"...told you to feed it to the baby?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia nodded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose it never occurred to any of you that it would work even better if you drank it yourself?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia let out a \"Oooooh\", and blushed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought not!\" said Ursula. \"It's very simple. She drinks the potion and I perform a simple revelation charm on her torso. It will show us the insides of her body, and reveal the baby, and the identity of the father\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUrsula measured out a spoonful of the potion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There...drink it!...Down! Good...Now, we must wait...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia gulped the potion down and swallowed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do you feel?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine...I...Ooooh!...I feel all...warm and tingly!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's the potion taking effect!\" said Ursula. \"Now...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe traced a circle on Eldonia's abdomen with her wand, Eldonia giggled! That tickled! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, the layer of skin on Eldonia's midriff vanished and as if they were looking into a window into her body, Fortis and his wife could see inside her body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my!\" said Eldonia. She spotted a tiny, humanoid form inside her womb. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's the baby...\" said Ursula. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello baby!\" Eldonia said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now we just need to wait\", Ursula said, \"While the potion takes its full effect...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, a misty white face began to form over the image of the tiny lifeform inside her. Like a sort of smokescreen image, a face began to emerge. Fuzzy and misty at first, but slowly more and more defined... </span></div></div>",

Who else but a Mountain lord could impregnate his wife on the first try, huh?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia giggled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Intercourse borne of love will always triumph over intercourse of hate\", Ursula said. \"Your bondage was one of affection and caring.

Oh boy! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are they boys or girls?\" she asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wouldn't know!\" said Ursula. \"They are not developed enough yet for me to tell. At this stage, they could be either. When they are more developed, and you wish to know, I could come again. And then I could run another examination for you\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yes please!\" said Eldonia. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe witch smiled, \"We shall see\", she said. She rubbed a cold salve over Eldonia's belly, and the images vanished from her skin, returning it to its ordinary state. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis helped Eldonia put her clothes back on, and everyone hurried back inside to hear the news. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh thank you, Ursula!\" said Athena, \"You've lifted a great weight off of all our minds\", she said, while behind her, her two younger grandsons jibed their older brother at his virility.

Are you okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinerva knocked and stuck her head around the partly open door to Eldonia's room.  She gasped and hurried to her sister-in-law's side when she heard and saw Eldonia being violently sick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Ellie,\" Minerva sighed, holding Eldonia's hair out of her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, the heaves stopped, and Minerva helped Eldonia lie back down on her bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinerva grabbed a soft cloth, dipped it in the water basin near the bed, and helped clear Eldonia's face of her spittle and tears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Th-thank you, Minnie.

I mostly felt queasy during the early months.  But this...!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother knock sounded on the doorway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, how's the expecting momma this morning?\" Fortis asked cheerfully, coming into the room carrying Leo.  However, his bright grin turned to a grimace as the smell of vomit hit his nose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Were you sick again, Donnie?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia rolled her eyes, feeling grumpy.  \"No, Forty, it's someone else puking their guts out every morning because you happened to knock them up--with twins!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite her sarcasm, a wide grin spread across Fortis's face, making Minerva chuckle.  Fortis loved having anyone point out the proof of his virility!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Momma?\" Leo asked hesitantly, his thumb in his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi, sweetie,\" Eldonia said, trying to come up with a smile for her son.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tiss, tiss!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia grimaced as Fortis sat down on the bed next to his sister, Leo's arms reaching out toward his mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think you want a kiss from Momma right now, Leo,\" Fortis said.  \"Momma's not feeling too well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeo frowned, not quite understanding all the words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Momma will kiss you later, alright?\" Eldonia said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tiss, tiss!\" Leo repeated.  Apparently, the only word he really caught onto was 'kiss.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinerva laughed and took the little boy into her arms.  \"I'll give you kisses, Leo!  Muah, muah, muah!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeo giggled as Minerva peppered kisses all over his face before lifting up his little shirt and blowing raspberries on his belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia watched this with sad longing, which Fortis noticed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Girl, why don't you take Leo down to see the bunnies?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yea!  Bun-buns!\" Leo said, clapping his hands together in excitement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Minerva and Leo were gone, Fortis stretched out on the bed and gathered Eldonia into her arms.  Eldonia groaned at how queasy she still felt.  She was tired and weak.  She didn't even have the energy to leave her bed!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wish you didn't feel so sick,\" Fortis said softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It wouldn't be quite so bad if I were only sick in the mornings, but oh no!  I can't have just 'morning sickness'!  I have all day, all night sickness!  Except for those times in the late afternoon when I get super, super hungry and feel like I can't get enough to eat.  But I hate eating, Forty!  I see it all again when I sick it back up after a few hours!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you have to eat, Ellie!  How else are my babies gonna grow and become strong little Mountanian boys?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Boys, hmm?  They could just as easily be girls, you know!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis grinned at her.  \"Nah!  They're definitely both boys!  Twin boys run in the Vanderstorm line, you know?  There's usually at least one set of twins in each generation.  Just look at Jupiter and Cannius.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia just rolled her eyes, but she smiled.  She always loved it when Fortis tried to cheer her up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis leaned down and pressed a gentle kiss to her forehead.  He let one hand slip down to rest on her tummy, and he rubbed in soft, soothing circles.  He didn't quite know what he was doing, nor did he really know what to expect, since he hadn't been around at all when Eldonia was pregnant the last time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia sighed and settled down more comfortably, but wearily, into her mattress.  \"That feels nice, Forty,\" she murmured before slipping off to sleep again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis continued to trace a delicate pattern on her belly for a while, noting that it was still as flat as ever.  However, Ursula had said that Eldonia would start showing soon.  Fortis couldn't wait to see his children begin to make their presence known.  He wanted to place his hand on her rounded tummy and feel his babies kick him.  He wanted to introduce Leo to his siblings in his mother's womb, too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore than anything, though, he wanted his wife to feel better.  She had just gotten back from her trying ordeal in Vladia to now be constantly sick from pregnancy hormones.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSnuggling closer to his wife's curvy side, Fortis hissed in a quick breath as he felt his own hormones race through his body.  He'd missed her very much when she'd been gone, and they haven't truly been intimate since she'd gotten back.  He hoped his babies wouldn't make her feel sick the entire pregnancy, or he wouldn't see some action for many long months to come!</span></div></div>",

She opened her eyes to see Lucy, the pretty young kitchen-maid. She smiled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Morning, my dear\", she mumbled. \"What have we here?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tea, and two slices of toast, and a fried egg\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Buttered toast?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes ma'am!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm...Yes it looks very nice. Thank you, Lucy\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy smiled, and left the room. Athena sat up and had her little morning snack of eggs, toast and tea. She rose and washed her face before putting on her dressing-gown. She would dress later, after her proper breakfast. She selected a walking-stick from a rack by the door, and headed out onto the landing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Hahahahahaha!!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHmmm...The baby was up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAthena strode down the corridor towards the nursery and headed inside. Eldonia sat in the rocking-chair, gently feeding the baby some oatmeal porridge. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooopen...nom! Good boy! Good boy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aaaah!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no!

I'm...I'm feeling better now, so I thought I should spend some time out of bed. And Leo's been missing me!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mama fattyfat!\" Leo burbled, and patted Eldonia's belly! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mommy's not fat!\" said Eldonia, \"Mommy has life growing inside her!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mama eat life?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nooo! Oh Leo, you're too young to understand\", Eldonia said, softly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mother has babies growing inside her! That's why she's growing bigger!\" Athena said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooooh...Weo wanna shee dah babiez...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh they won't come for another few months, honey\", said Eldonia. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeo stood up on his mother's lap and opened her mouth and peeked inside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Leo what are you doing!?\" Athena said, \"Don't poke your fingers in mother's mouth!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello babies!\" Leo burbled. \"Gwamma...Where babies? Weo can't shee dah babies...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia and Athena burst out laughing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The babies are right down inside mama!\" said Athena, \"And they're growing inside her!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had now been several months since Eldonia's return. She had been in bed for so long that getting up and about felt very strange. She had been to see the doctor, and had gone to stay with her father for a while, and she was now back and feeling much better. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeo sat on his mother's lap and touched her belly. He let out a squeal! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's the matter, honey?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mama! Mama!\" Leo burbled, trying to figure out what to say! \"Tummy move!\" he finally managed! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?...Ooooh!!\" Eldonia gasped, \"Oh yes!\" she said. \"Granny the babies are kicking!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAthena knelt in front of the rocking-chair and rested a thin hand on Eldonia's belly. She felt a shift under the skin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my! Oh they are!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, we got a pair of Mountain lords in the oven, huh...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAthena got up to see her oldest grandson enter the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"PAPA!!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah! Hey!\" Fortis said, as his toddler son scrambled towards him! \"You causin' trouble for momma, huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No papa!\" Leo said, wide-eyed and innocent-looking! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come here, young Leonardo! Leave your parents alone!\" said Athena. She hoisted her grandson into her arms. He was now nearly two, and getting heavy! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooofff! Growing up, you are!\" she said, and kissed him. Fortis knelt down and rubbed Eldonia's belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, we got us some Mountain boys!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Fortis!

However, Eldonia, yours has been worse than usual because you're not just carrying twins:  you're going to have TRIPLETS!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT?!  TRIPLETS?!\" Eldonia said, her eyes wide in astonishment.  \"But you said I was having twins when you were here before!  You clearly showed us two sets of hands and feet, just TWO little bodies!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, sometimes babies hide behind one another in the womb.  Besides, when I showed you the babies earlier, they were so small, it would have been easy to miss one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, yeah!  Just goes to show you how potent the ol' Vanderstorm seed is!\" Fortis said proudly, puffing out his chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow!  I can't believe it!\"  Eldonia stroked a hand over her large belly.  \"THREE babies!  No wonder I've gotten so much larger than when I was pregnant with Leo!  That explains why I've felt so much more kicking inside of me, as well!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can attest to that!\" said Fortis in a huff.  \"She hardly sleeps at night because of all the kicking, and the babies sometimes even kick ME when her belly touches me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ursula, can you show me where each of the babies are?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Certainly!\" said Ursula.  She placed her hand at the top of Eldonia's belly.  \"The largest baby is lying lengthwise here at the top.  The other two are on either side below him.\"  Ursula moved her hand to the lower right and then across to the lower left to indicate where the other two babies lay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You said 'him.'  Does that mean that one of them is a boy?  What are the rest of their sexes?\" Fortis asked impatiently, crossing his arms over his chest.  \"That's why you came, is it not?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUrsula chuckled, straightening back up.  \"Yes, yes, my lord!  You're having two boys and a girl.  And I would wager to say the boys are even identical.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Forty,\" Eldonia said, wiping a hand over her eyes as a few tears began to fall.  \"I can't believe it!  Two more sons and a daughter!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would you like to see your children, my lord?\" Ursula asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis nodded and drew closer.  Ursula muttered a few words in Latin and waved her wand over Eldonia's belly to reactivate the spell, and the three babies suddenly became visible.  Fortis was amazed at seeing his tiny children inside his wife.  The baby at the top glowed blue, as did the baby on the lower left.  The baby on the lower right glowed pink.  Ursula pointed to that baby and said, \"That would be your daughter, my lord.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis stroked his hand over the pictures of his children and grinned when he saw and felt one of his sons kick at his hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Haha!  Look at my boy there!  He's displaying himself for the whole world to see!\" Fortis said with a laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia groaned, but Ursula merely smiled.  Indeed, the lower boy spread his legs to show off his goods.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter another minute, the spell ran its course, and the images of the babies inside the womb faded until all anyone could see was Eldonia's very large belly once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're going to have to come up with THREE names now, instead of just two,\" Eldonia said, as Fortis helped her sit up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis groaned.  \"Not names already!  Can't we just wait until they get here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUrsula cleared her throat.  \"Well, my lord, it actually probably won't be much longer before they're born.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" Fortis said with a frown.  \"Donnie's only been pregnant for about six months.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"True.  However, multiples tend to be born earlier.  There is less room for them to grow and develop.  Twins tend to be born two to three weeks early, while triplets are even earlier than that.  I would say that, judging from Eldonia's current size, your little ones will be here in less than two months from now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis's eyes widened.  \"Two months?!  But...we're not ready!  We have lots more furniture needed for the nursery!  And more clothes, and more food, and....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia patted his hand soothingly.  \"Don't worry, Forty!  Between you and your brothers, Grandma Athena, Minerva, and Mrs. Tibbs, I know you'll all make everything we need for the babies!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's the right attitude, my dear,\" said Ursula.  \"In fact, I think it would be best if you are on as much bed-rest as possible from now until you go into labor.  Don't do anything to put undue stress on yourself.  The slightest thing might trigger an early labor, and we need your babies to stay inside you and grow as long as possible.  Understood?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, ma'am.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Take care, my dear.\"  Ursula gathered Eldonia into a hug and kissed her on the cheek.  \"I'll be back to help you deliver your little ones, but feel free to contact me if you have any problems or questions, all right?  This is a special amulet that I want to you always wear around your neck.  If have need of me, just hold the pendant and say my name three times.  I'll be right over.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia looked at the amber pendant Ursula put over her head and felt herself tearing up again.  Everything seemed to make her cry these days!  \"Thank you, so much, Ursula!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUrsula patted her shoulder.  \"You're welcome, my dear.  My lord.\"  She curtsied to Fortis, before yelling, \"Merlin!  Come on, now, boy!  Time to go!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awww, Granny!  Do I have to go?  I'm having fun with Leo!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, young man!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, alright....\"</span></div></div>",

There was a collection of paintings hung on the walls, of woodland scenes, bowls of fruit, and battles of fargone wars. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think so, darling!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong? They'll like it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's NOT appropriate for babies!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis entered the room, carrying something under his arm, his grandmother following after him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fortis are you hearing me!?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's cute, grandma!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It'll SCARE them!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No it won't!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>*tug-tug-tug*</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's the matter, son?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What papa haves?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis turned around the latest painting that he was carrying into the room. It showed a dragon! Leo's mouth dropped open! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See!? Now you take it out of here and put it back in the library where it belongs!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pwitty dwaggon papa!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See!? I told you he'd like it...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Leonardo's used to dragons! The babies will be terrified!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh come on, grandma! When I was Leo's age, grandpa gave me a salamander as a pet, remember?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I remember! And I was against that, too!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh granny. You just never liked Barbeque because he was always playing with your knitting\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be ridiculous! How can food play with my knitting!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...His NAME was Barbeque!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Oh yes so it was...BUT MY POINT REMAINS!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis sighed. \"Would it cheer you up if I put in a picture of flowers instead?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, it would!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine...GIRL! Where's that painting of those fruit-orchards!?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In my room!\" Minerva cried out from down the hall, \"Why!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gran wants it for the nursery!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well she can't have it! It's my favourite!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAthena sighed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about a Memento Mori picture?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"ABSOLUTELY NOT! You want to give them nightmares!?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey they never scared me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You never knew what they meant!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Neither will they, grandma!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NO!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine! I'll hang up the picture of those lowland ponies...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeo toddled out of the nursery and into his mother's bedroom. Eldonia was feeling very weak and sleepy. Holding three expectant and hungry babies within her had drained much of her energy. And she was having trouble moving around with all the unaccustomed weight. She reveled in being pregnant, but couldn't wait to give birth! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mama! Mama cuddle!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come here, sweetheart...\" Eldonia said, reaching out a feeble hand, \"Let mommy cuddle you...Awww...Muah!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Babies come?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooh...Not yet, sweetie. But they'll come soon...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mama, what babies names?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh we don't know yet, sweetie. Your papa's picked out lots of pretty names! We just have to see which names suit them!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Oh...Babies name Leo?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Noooo sweetie! That's your name!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Babies babies babies!!\" Leo squeaked, and slapped his mother's belly excitedly. Eldonia laughed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia's bedroom door opened and Fortis came in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey sweetie, which one? The sunrise, or the painting that granny did of the castle in winter?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis held up two large paintings. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The sunrise\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Leo wike dis wan, papa!\" said Leo, pointing to the snowy castle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah?\" said Fortis, \"You like the snowy castle, son?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yah! Snow fun!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mon, son. Let's go hang them up. Let momma sleep\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia yawned...Yes...sleep...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis and Leonardo left the room and headed back down the corridor towards the nursery. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\"YEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEK!!\"</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gotcha!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hahahahahahahahahha!! Uckle Yupiter! Put down!!! Put Weo down!!! WWAAAAAAAHHH!!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis chuckled as his brother hoisted his son into his arms and tickled him! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aren't you cute, huh? Muah! Hey Forty, how's all that redecorating going?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good. But I need to hang more stuff up\", said Forty. He indicated the two paintings. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww you don't want that! Put the dragon one up! Me and Canny used to love that one when we were babies!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's what I tried to tell grandma, but she refused to put it up there. Leo likes it, too\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh you do, huh?\" said Jupiter, bouncing his nephew in his arms, \"You like the dragon picture, huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rrrawwwwwrr!!\" Leo squeaked, and made a face! Fortis and Jupiter burst out laughing!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I'll go get it...\" said Fortis, \"AFTER I hang these up\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJupiter gave his nephew a kiss and popped him back on the ground, \"I'll give you a hand\", he said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So\", said Fortis as he hung up the final picture, \"Have you found a girl yet?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not really. That Ophelia girl's pretty cute...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's a bit young for you, ain't she?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're three years apart! Besides, you're old enough to be Eldonia's father!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's not that much younger\", Fortis mumbled. \"Besides, she's cute...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...So's Ophelia...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You want to marry the daughter of the public house landlord?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...hey I'm not like you, Forty. I don't have the future of our house in mind. That's not my job!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis shrugged. He guessed his brother was right. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

When we do, then you can sleep in one and have your own room! But until then, you sleep in the nursery with the other babies, when they come!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Noooo!!...Gwamma, Weo sweep with papa! Papa has bed!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Leo, your father is exhausted!

W-w-waaa...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON OUT HERE!?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeo coughed...sniffled...and stopped. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding in the doorway to his bedroom, Fortis looked like a demon from the fires of Hades. The fire in his bedroom was casting golden shadows over his broad, V-shaped silhouette, his dark blond hair glowing in the light of the flames. He towered over his grandmother, and the squirming toddler that she held in her hands! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm trying to sleep! And Eldonia's got enough things to worry about as it is!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Forty! You nearly gave Penny and me a heart-attack!...And I nearly swallowed my bishop!\" Minerva said, waving a chess-piece around, \"DO try and keep it down!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go back to bed, girl! I'll handle it...\" Fortis said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I would LOVE to, if I could!\" Minerva fumed, and slammed her bedroom door behind her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was that?\" Penny asked her mistress, as she tidied up the chess-board and shuffled a pack of cards. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"MEN!\" Minerva fumed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...\" said Penny, pretending to have fully understood the situation from the hardly-complete explanation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gran what's going on here?\" Fortis groaned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Weo no sleep in cwib!\" Leo pouted. \"Weo gonna be big bwudda! Weo can't sweep in CWIB!! Cwibz for babies!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis chuckled. He could tell where this was going. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How would you like to sleep in a big-boy bed with papa, huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeo's eyes lit up like coastline beacons! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yah! Oh pweez gwamma!?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAthena sighed. \"Alright! But you be a GOOD boy for papa!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mere baby...\" said Fortis. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeo glared at his father.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uuh...I mean...boy...son...Leo!...Let's go to bed\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAthena followed her two young relations into the bedroom that she had once shared with her own Mountain lord, more years ago than she cared to remember. Watching Fortis lay down on the bed made her think back to her wedding-day, when a handsome, dashing Excalibur Vanderstorm, Earl of Dynamos, had carried her upstairs, thrown her on the bed and dived on top of her!...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh she was a very young girl back then...and times were very different...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiled. Oh how she missed him. She rubbed a locket on a chain around her neck, which held a lock of the late lord's hair. She watched as Fortis laid down on the bed, his son in his arms, barely the size of a loaf of bread by comparison, and rolled over. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAthena closed the doors and headed to her own room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n--- --- --- --- <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZacharia, Hermes and Koviac sat down in the servants' hall. It was dark now, and almost everyone had gone to bed. Eliza entered the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Couldn't sleep?\" Zacharia asked. Eliza yawned, and nodded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My mattress is so lumpy! It's like sleeping on a rack of bowling-balls!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boys laughed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One day I'll have to rip that thing apart and get it all re-stuffed and sew it back together again properly! But for now, I could do with some hot chocolate\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll get you some\", said Koviac, and headed over to a pot on a side-table. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You youngsters still up and about?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe servants turned to see Mrs. Tibbs shuffling into the room, the fat, middle-aged housekeeper stared at them through her spectacles. Usually homely and sweet, she looked very stern! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why are you still up, Mrs. Tibbs? It's too late for old people!\" Hermes squeaked! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why you...!\" Mrs. Tibbs began, her eyes flashed behind her spectacles! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hermes!\" Zacharia snapped at his little brother. Hermes blushed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry...\" he squeaked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why are you up so late, Mrs. T?\" Eliza asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's her ladyship\", said Mrs. Tibbs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She just went to bed, I heard it\", said Eliza. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not the Dowager! I mean Lord Fortis's wife!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's been in bed all day!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Exactly. She's expecting!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooh...what's she expecting?\" Hermes asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh don't be silly, Hermes! Her babies!\" Zacharia groaned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooooh...Are they coming for a visit?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZacharia groaned and Eliza giggled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do I explain it to him!?\" he mumbled, and stared at Koviac with an \"<i>Oh boy!</i>\" kind of expression. Koviac just smirked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n--- --- --- --- <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who's papa's little boy, huh? Are YOU papa's little boy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aaaah!!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Papa...Weo happy. Gonna be BIG Bwudda! Just wike papa!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right, son!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeo crawled across his father's chest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Papa...you fink Weo be good big bwudda?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you think a big brother does, Leo?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeo frowned. He hadn't realised that being a big brother came with chores! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeo suddenly threw his arms out and hugged his father around the neck! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis laughed, \"That's very good, son. A big brother loves his little brothers and especially his little sister!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeo stared at his father, \"Why?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why Big bwudda wike widdle sisstah even moar?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Boys learn to look after themselves, son! One day you will!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis pointed across the room to his cabinet of swords. Leo drooled...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One day, I'll teach you and your brothers how to use the swords! Just like how me and your uncles use them! But a lot of these swords are really heavy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really really heavy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes son!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really really really heavy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep! And most girls can't carry those really heavy swords! And they're so heavy that they can't wave them around and use them!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why, papa?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because their arms aren't strong enough!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis flexed a massive bicep. Leo giggled and squeezed it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See these, boy? These are the kind of arms you need to haul those things around!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeo flexed his tiny arms...which resulted in nothing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awwww...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis laughed! \"Son you'll grow big arms like papa sooner or later. But because girls can't lift those big heavy swords and use them, it's your job to do that for them, and to make sure they're safe! Especially little sisters!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeo nodded. \"Yeah papa!\" he said. \"I will\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis smiled. He wrapped his son in his huge arms and rolled over in bed. \"Of course you will...G'night kid...\" <br>\r\n\"Night-night papa...\" <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She'd fallen asleep in front of the servants' hall fireplace, over her half-finished cup of chocolate. A bell fixed to a panel by the wall swayed back and forth and jangled loudly. She got to her feet and stared at the panel of bells. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Jangle-jangle-jangle-jangle!!!!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBelow the jangling bell was a paper label. Eliza held her candle up to it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u>\"BEDROOM - Lady Eldonia\"</u><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh gosh!\" said Eliza, and hurried upstairs!

She was sweating up a storm! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I....I...\" she gasped, \"I...Ooooooh!...L-L-Liza! G-G-Go call his lordship! A-And wake up the dowager! And Lady Minerva! The-then fetch Mrs. Ti-t-t-oooooh! Nnnnnggghh!...*pant-pant-pant!* f-fetch M-mrs Ti-Tibbs! HURRY! THEY'RE COMING!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're coming?...THEY'RE COMING!? Oh gosh!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEliza rushed out of the room and threw open the doors to the master bedroom! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M'lord! Wake up! Wake up!\" Eliza cried out! Leo burst into tears! Fortis jerked awake! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-what!?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's happening!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis blinked. \"W-w-what's happening?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"THE BABIES!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The...NOW!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NOW! NOW! Her ladyship's in labour!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Thor's sledgehammer!...I...woah!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis jumped out of bed while Eliza rushed to wake up the household! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you okay, sweetheart?\" Fortis asked. He was on his knees next to his wife's bed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It hurts!\" she groaned. \"I...I...huuuurrrrghhh!\" Eldonia groaned as another sharp, painful, crippling, cramping contraction rippled through her body! She thrashed and writhed around, struggling to make it stop! Athena and Mrs. Tibbs hurried into the room! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh out of the way!\" said Mrs. Tibbs. \"I need hot water, and scissors! And towels! And a ball of string!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice shallow breaths, darling!\" said Lady Athena, \"in, out, in, out, in, out...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'M GIVING BIRTH YOU CRAZY OLD BITCH! NOT GOING FOR A ROWING TRIP DOWN THE STREAM!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis burst out laughing! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right sweetheart! Let it all out! C'mon!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Back up! Against the bed!\" Athena said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like this!? You've got to be insane! I can hardly touch my feet! Let alone draw them up!\" Eldonia shrieked! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lie down flat and lift your legs up!\" Fortis said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'M NOT IN THE MOOD FOR YOUR STUPID GAMES!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's to make it easier for the birth!\" Mrs. Tibbs said, \"Oh for lord's sake!\" she sighed. She picked up a low bench and put it on the bed, \"Rest your feet on that...That's right1 How's that feel?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A...a...a-a-b-b-bi-bit b-b-beeaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhh!!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's alright sweetie, It'll all be over soon...\" said Fortis. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia kept breathing hard and fast! Then, she started a steady pushing...it was taking a lot out of her, and she was sweating like she'd run a thousand miles in a heatwave! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooh! I...i-it's coming!\" she gasped! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAthena knelt down and held out a towel. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Something's coming!\" she cried out, \"Push! Push!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Plop! </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nA wriggling newborn baby landed in the towel! Athena wrapped it up and cleaned it off with warm water! The baby wailed and screamed! Eldonia shifted uneasily in her bed as she prepared herself for the next one! Slowly, it came out, too. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's two boys so far!\" said Mrs. Tibbs. \"There's still a girl in there somewhere!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia felt ready to faint! After this, she was sure she wouldn't be encouraging Fortis to implant his seed within her anytime soon! But then...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uuuuuggghhh!!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Pop!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Somebody get me a knife!\" said Mrs. Tibbs. \"I need to cut the umbilical cords...that's right...careful now...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You sleep, sweetheart\", said Fortis. \"We'll look after the babies...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll do no such thing!\" said Mrs. Tibbs, \"Us women will handle this! It's women's business! Begone with you!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis chuckled, and left the room with his brothers. Minerva stayed on, to comfort her friend. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He was trapped between papa's chest and his huge arms! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeo wriggled and slipped out from under papa's grasp! He squirmed under the sheets, until he popped out the side of the bed. With a sort of ungainly backflip, he flopped off the bed onto the floor! He landed with a 'whunk!', and took a minute to collect himself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsing the bed to steady his little legs, Leo got up and toddled across the floor, stumbling occasionally, until he reached the door. Leo tried to open the door, but the handle was too far up! Leo stared around the room. Then, he saw what he wanted! Papa's clothes valet... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeo pushed the wooden clothing-frame across the room, from where it usually was, by the mirror and dressing-screen, towards the door. Swinging on the bars and shelves like a monkey, he pulled himself up to the top shelf where Fortis kept his rings and chains. He reached out and turned the handle on the bedroom door, and pulled! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door swung slowly inwards. It was very heavy! Suddenly, the stand fell over! Leo squeaked and landed on his bottom on the carpet! But at least the door was open. He toddled off out... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeo toddled down the corridor and saw that a door was open. The nursery door! Leo toddled inside... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n--- --- --- --- <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis yawned. What on earth...? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis eyes opened...Huh!?...Where's Leo!? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis ripped his bedsheets back!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo baby... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis jumped to his feet!...But then his eyes took in the knocked over clothing-stand, and the opened bedroom door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Crafty little bastard...\" Fortis said. He chuckled to himself. That boy'll be a Vanderstorm yet... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis righted his clothing-stand and picked up his scattered jewellery. He opened the door into the hallway and headed down the corridor. He slowly entered the nursery. Slumbering in the three cribs were three little angels. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the middle, a pretty little baby girl with golden hair. And on either side, like infantile bodyguards, her two older brothers, with brown hair like their Aunty Minerva. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehehehe...Forty Vanderstorm strikes again, and leaves his mark...\" Fortis said, and laughed. He bent down to pick up the little girl. The tiny newborn wriggled in his hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awwww...Hello babygirl...You know who I am?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Papa no!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeo popped out from behind the crib, waving a toy sword! \"Papa put down baby!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis laughed, \"Son! I'm not gonna hurt her! But it's nice to know you want to look after her...C'mere...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis walked over to the rocking-chair by the fireplace and sat down. Leo joined him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Baby small...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Babies are always small\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Leo so small?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah you were about this size when you were born\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooooooh...Hewwo baby...!!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis laughed and gave the tiny infant a kiss. \"Hello little Sapphire...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe baby let out the most adorable little yawn and opened her eyes. They were bright, dazzling blue. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awww...\" Fortis said. He hugged the tiny infant as delicately as he knew how, and gave it another kiss. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Leo, this is your little sister Sapphire!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooooh...Wussa saffer?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A sapphire is a pretty blue stone\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awwwww...Wike waht gwamma haz on her fingah?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis frowned. <i>Finger?</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh you mean grandma's ring! Yeah that's right. That's a sapphire\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooh...baby purdy papa!...Weo pway!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooooh nonononoonono! Babies aren't for playing with, sonny! No, no, no! They're VERY delicate and small! You can't play with them\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awww...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can look at them and you can talk to them\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hewwo Shaffer!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeo stared at his littlest baby sister. Awwww...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Papa! Baby cute!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes she is...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the twins began to cry! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awww, what's the matter little fellahs?\" Fortis asked. He put the little girl back into her crib, and smiled at his two newborn sons. He picked them both up, one in each hand, and kissed them. </span></div></div>",

She hissed through her teeth as a sharp pain radiated through her abdomen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lie back down, Eldonia,\" said Minerva, placing her hands on Eldonia's shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No.  I want to go see my babies.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinerva chuckled.  \"You've just been through a long and painful labor, delivering three healthy babies!  Granny told me to make sure that you got plenty of rest!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia sighed.  \"I appreciate Granny's and your concern, but, well,....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia blushed and gestured to her chest, looking uncomfortable.  Her breasts had swollen considerably since she'd given birth, and they ached from being so full of milk.  \"I'm sure the babies need their first meal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if on cue, a sharp wail was heard down the hallway, which was quickly joined by more cries.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, then, let me bring the babies in here to you,\" Minerva said, getting up from her chair by the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, Minnie!  Please!  I'm so much more comfortable nursing in the nursery in the rocking chair!  Please, just help me down the hallway.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about I carry you there instead?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia smiled as her husband entered the room.  She gratefully raised her arms to put them around Fortis's neck as Fortis gently lifted her in his arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How are you doing, love?\" Fortis asked gruffly as he walked her down the hallway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A bit tired.  A bit sore.  But very happy!  I can't believe they're finally here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia rested her head on Fortis's shoulder, smiling.  Fortis chuckled.  \"I know what you mean!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Momma!  Momma!  Babies cwying!  Make babies stop, Momma!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia smiled as Leo came up to them as they entered the nursery and began to tug insistently on Fortis's pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll try to do just that, Leo,\" Eldonia said, \"but you have to understand that crying is the only way babies know how to tell us when something is wrong--if they're hungry, or sleepy, or if their nappy is wet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeo frowned as Fortis settled Eldonia down in the comfortable rocking chair in the nursery near the window before going over to fetch his wailing sons.  Leo crossed his little arms over his chest.  \"No wan' babies cwying!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia chuckled.  \"When you were a baby, you cried whenever you were hungry or needed a nappy change, too!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh-uh!  Weo big boy!  No cwy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia held out her arms, and Leo scrambled up into his mother's lap.  Eldonia placed a kiss on his forehead.  \"I know!  You're growing up so quickly!  You're my big boy, now, aren't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeo smiled and puffed out his little chest.  \"Weo big boy!  Help pwotect babies!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sure you will!  Now, go on and play with your Auntie Minnie while I feed the babies, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeo scrambled down and went with Minerva, who winked at her friend as she left the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, there now,\" Fortis murmured, lifting up first one baby son, then the second, cradling one baby in each arm.  \"Momma's got plenty of milk for both of you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia grimaced as she undid the bodice of her dress, revealing her milk-swollen breasts.  \"That I do!  However, I wonder how I'm going to cope trying to keep up with feeding three babies!  We might have to hire a wet nurse, Forty.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll keep that in mind,\" he said, placing his sons gently in Eldonia's arms.  Fortis grinned as he watched first one son then the other eagerly latch onto their mother's nipples, sucking hungrily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep, they're Vanderstorms alright,\" Fortis said proudly as he knelt down in front of his family.  \"They're as fond of your breasts as I am!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Forty!\" Eldonia laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis got up to fetch his still wailing daughter and shushed at her.  \"It's okay, baby girl, my little Sapphire!  Momma will feed you as soon as she's done feeding your brothers!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, you've decided on the name Sapphire for our little girl, hmm?  I like it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia looked down at her still eagerly suckling sons, patting their little bums fondly as they fed.  \"How about our boys, here?\" she asked.  \"Have you named them, yet?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not yet.  Didn't you come up with some names?\" Fortis asked, beginning a gentle pacing around the nursery as he tried to hush his little girl's sobs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, Granny Athena, Minerva, and I had discussed some names before.  I personally like the name Thunder.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis smiled.  \"I like the name Thunder, too.  Thunder Vanderstorm is a good strong name for the firstborn twin.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Granny also liked the names Gabriel and Maximus.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maximus is my middle name.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia laughed.  \"I know!  However, I think it's so common.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, what else would you suggest for our third son's name?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, maybe something to go along with Thunder?\"  Eldonia chuckled again.  \"Minerva had suggested Lightning!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis laughed and shook his head.  \"Thunder and Lightning!  Haha!  That would be rich!  But I'm not sure about Lightning.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about something like Hail, Rain, Nimbus, Twister, or Vortex?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis sighed.  \"I'm not sure about any of those, but Vortex is the name of my stallion, otherwise I could see that as being a good name for my son.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia's brow frowned as she thought for a few moments.  She brightened when she thought of another name.  \"How about Theseus?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Theseus?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes!  He was a son of Poseidon, one of the founding fathers of Athens, and was a great hero!\"  Eldonia looked down at her boys, whose suckling was gradually slowing.  \"How about it, hmm?  Thunder and Theseus?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll have to think on it a bit,\" Fortis said with a frown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or maybe Thor.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Donnie, we're not Vladians!  The only men I've ever known named Thor came from that cretinous country to the east.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia sighed and rolled her eyes.  \"Well, I don't hear YOU making any suggestions!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not as good with names as you are.  But I'll think on all the names you've said so far and tell everyone what I've decided at dinner tonight.  Okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNoticing that his two sons had fallen asleep at their mother's breasts, Fortis swapped babies with Eldonia so that little Sapphire could have her first meal.  Fortis, however, screwed his face up into a grimace when he realized that both of his sons needed a nappy change!</span></div></div>",

Babies!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia shuffled slowly into the room. Her abdomen and legs were still very sore.

Waiting for me to give you all handjobs!? GET MOVING!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe soldiers hurried around, while their commander shouted out orders. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want bows and quivers set up on the northern, eastern and western walls! I want the southern entrances to be guarded at all times! Make sure those wells are clean and open! Check all the grain-stores! I want that vegetable patch good and green! Shit on it if you have to! I want it growing carrots the size of my dick by next week!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gee, boss! That ain't gonna feed much!\" one of the soldiers shouted out. Laughter rippled around the camp. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of the soldiers rushing around was a strapping, scarred youth. Tall, brutish, with long brown hair. Excalibur Vanderstorm had been drafted into the regular army as a swordsman and archer after his fall from grace from the Vanderstorm Family. Only seventeen, he'd entered the army late. Most boys had joined up by the time they were ten, to become career soldiers, a high aspiration in Mountanian society. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, soldiers were all well and good, but most of them wanted to be knights. Knights always got the biggest sacks of gold, the greatest prizes, the ripest cunts and the best rewards! Excalibur's tearaway youth had disqualified him from becoming a knight, but he knew that his older cousin, the new Lord Vanderstorm, Fortis, was a knight. He wondered if war broke out, whether he might get to fight with him in battle? That could be cool...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"VANDERSTORM! STOP PISSING AT THE WALL AND GET THOSE SWORDS TO THE BLACKSMITH!

Nearby, Eldonia sat in an armchair, with three hungry babies all fighting to get their mouths onto her breasts. Fortis chuckled. He watched his two younger sons both struggling to grab that which came naturally to all Mountain men, while his daughter cried piteously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh there there!\" said Eldonia. She kissed her daughter, \"It's alright, Sapphire! Gabriel! Not so hard, sweetie. Thunder DON'T do that! Bad baby!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEliza the housemaid entered the dining-room as Minerva took Sapphire from Eldonia's lap. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There there. Aunty Minerva will feed you breakfast...what's that, Eliza?\" she asked, pointing to the silver tray that the housemaid carried in her hands. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A letter for his lordship, m'lady\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll take it...\" said Fortis. He broke the seal on the envelope and opened the letter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh...It's from our long-lost cousin Excalibur\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't know you had a cousin called Excalibur\", said Eldonia. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah he wasn't at the wedding. In exchange for getting out of the Castle Ravenwood Prison, he was drafted into the regular army. He's stationed somewhere...Oh here we are...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis unfolded the letter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dear Forty...Hoping that you are well...life here in Lucia can be mighty boring. Nothing but drinking and...Hmmm...received a message yesterday from one of our spies who had left Vladia...Oh gosh!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it?\" Minerva asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He says here that the Vladians are planning a surprise-attack...\" Fortis said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, Eliza returned with a young man wearing an official-looking uniform. The man saluted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lord Vanderstorm?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes\", said Fortis, looking up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have been instructed by His Majesty, King Leviathan, to give you this message, and to await a reply\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man handed an official-looking envelope. Fortis broke the seal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm...Oh alright. You may tell the king that I understand. My men and I will be reporting for duty as soon as we can\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it?\" Minerva asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Apparently, for once in his life, Cousin Excalibur did something right, and sent us some correct information\", Fortis said. \"I need to make preparations. Leo, give pappy a kiss, hmm? He'll bring you back a war-prize once he's back from his holiday...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fortis! I do wish you wouldn't be so blase about war!\" Eldonia scolded her husband. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woman, I am a Mountain lord and I am a knight. I am duty-sworn to the king to come to his side during times of war. You don't think my ancestors won this cushy estate just from sitting on their butts, do you?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis left the dining-room. \"JUPITER! CANNIUS!

And his brothers\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very good of you to come, my lord\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis entered the throne-room of the palace in Ferramount. Standing around were other Mountain lords. Some were young, some older. Some ancient. Some had impressive-looking battle-scars. Lord Van Talon had a wicked-looking sword-slash scar running diagonally across his face. Horribly disfigured, nobody dared tell him otherwise. His claim to Mountanian nobility was harpooning three enemy soldiers with one sword and eviscerating them, all in one firm thrust-and-twist motion! Nobody doubted his combat prowess. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis knelt at the king's throne and kissed his signet-ring. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My liege\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are late, your lordship\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I beg his Majesty's pardon, my lord\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Never mind. None of us could've known that the Vladians would've been as intelligent as this, to take such a completely different route to last time\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKing Leviathan got to his feet. He waved a hand, and his lords and generals, and the various knights of the realms, sat down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My lords, my good sir knights, and my so-capable generals. I have called you here because of important events. The Vladians are lacking common sense...What am I saying...Vladians HAVE no sense to lack...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaughter rumbled through the throne-room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They mean to take on three kingdoms at once! By dividing us all and having us all fighting our own little battles, they mean to disorient us, round us up and destroy our fighting ability! THIS WILL NOT HAPPEN!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA hand at the back went up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why not?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHO SAID THAT!?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hand remained up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah. Lord Wolvenberg\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis turned to see a handsome, bulky Mountain lord with long brown hair at the back. Like Fortis, Lord Wolvenberg had inherited his title early in life. The rogueish mountain lord winked at his friend. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why not...Because we have allies! The Vladians may think themselves smart. But they did not think very far. Our Fantasmian allies are powerful. They are not invincible, and like us are all mortal. But one Fantasmian wizard can wield tremendous power! They have agreed to send their most skilled and powerful wizarding lords to the defence of the Fatlantean kingdom. As always, the Fatlanteans will provide us with food, clothing, weapons, and all other logistical support which we may need. But they are also sending forth regiments of archers!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Archers!?\" someone shouted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fatlanteans are not known for their combative strength or warlike qualities. They are by tradition a people of peace and tranquility. But they are certainly capable hunters when need arises. And out of necessity thereof, also excellent marksmen! Their companies of archers shall join us in battle under Mountanian command. Vladian advances will be shredded to mincemeat by unrelenting volley after volley of arrows!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So the Lucians are...what...they're providing the candy for the after-war party, right?\" someone called out. Everyone laughed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Lucians count on us for their protection. And that is what we are going to provide!\" the king shouted. \"Our treasuries are not full of gold given to us for no reason! We are MOUNTANIANS! We get gold two ways! We mine it, or we kill for it! And right now, the Lucians are expecting us to kill for it! And that is what we damn well are gonna do!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a loud roaring noise as everyone cheered! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What should we do?\" someone asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We must fortify all our front-towns, villages, castles and cities. Gather food, weapons, ammunition. Everything. We do not know how deep the Vladians might attempt to penetrate...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Deep? Penetrate!? Those cocksucking Northern bastards ain't fuckin' in here!\" someone shouted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore laughter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want all lords who have their own country estates and villages, to ensure to the safety of their populations, first. Do this however you see fit, but see that it is done! Everyone else is to report to the nearest border-fort to their home! I want all reserves called up! I want as many new recruits as possible! Some of you have sons! They want to fight like their fathers? Now's the time for them to do it! But I will not have nepotism!

I was gonna pack up and get the hell off to the front lines! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe couldn't believe this! It was common knowledge that the only boys that Mountain girls ever found interesting were those who were distinguished in some way or the other. They were knights, warriors, soldiers of distinction. Below that were the nobility and aristocracy. Below that were great craftsmen and builders and workmen. Below that, were just...muscles!

He lit a candle and got dressed. He peeked outside his bedroom windows and stared down into the yard below. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlong the perimeter walls were guards marching back and forth in pairs. Ever since the commencement of war, security around the royal fortress in Ferramount had been doubled. Cassius might have been Crown Prince, but that didn't give him an excuse to sneak around at night. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe picked up his two, loaded bags and slung them over his shoulders. His shoulder-bag and his enormous rucksack. He then started knotting his bedsheets together. He used the dark, royal red ones instead of the white ones, so that they wouldn't show up so clearly against the stone walls. He tied the sheets securely to a central mullion, looped his swords and daggers to the end of the makeshift rope, and threw the whole thing out the window. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaking sure that there was nothing else that he might have forgotten, the Crown Prince grabbed the windowsill and hoisted himself up. He stood on the sill, one hand on the mullion and one on the wall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe positioned his feet and slowly eased his hands, both around the mullion, slowly down, at the same time leaning out, pressing his feet against the wall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis hands grabbed the bedsheets and he slid down until he hit the first knot! He paused for a breather. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClimb. Slide. Stop. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClimb. Slide. Stop. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClimb. Slide. Stop. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, Cassius slipped further and further down the wall. When he hit the ground, he untied his swords and knives from the bottom of the bedsheets and strapped them on. He hoisted his bags back over his shoulders, and jogged across the grass towards the walls. Keeping in the shadows, he made his way to a small, side door. He tried the lock. The damn thing was bolted tight! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a deep breath, the youthful prince braced himself, and threw his body against the door! Once!...Twice!...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Crack!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassius pushed the door open and slowly slipped out. He was now in the royal woodlands beyond the estate. if he kept away from the light, he could sneak into the forests, and then head to where he was sure there would be Mountanian soldiers massing for war. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassius had been sure to leave all of his identifying marks at home. He brought with him no seals, sashes, coronets, or expensive jewellery. Not even his shield, which was emblazoned with his coat of arms. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe couldn't carry that out the window, anyway! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis only true mark of identity was his signet-ring. Which he kept on his finger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, the prince stole off into the night, and into the depths of the woods... </span></div></div>",

We can't leave Girl in the castle if it comes under attack!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That won't happen!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bullshit! She should be sent somewhere safe! Eldonia too! And grandma!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Grandma's used to that stuff...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fortis the last time the castle came under attack she was twenty-five years old! She's nearly seventy now!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She was married to grandpa! She's used to it!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Grandpa's been dead for...WHAT'S THAT GOT TO DO WITH ANYTHING!?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine! We'll talk to them when we get home! But where do we send them?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Regis City. Or Fantasmia. Grandma's chummy with old Lord Draxon. Maybe he can suggest something...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The White Castle? It's too damn close to the danger...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well not THERE but...somewhere!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis sighed, \"We'll talk about it some other time! When we get home! I need to think! Can we please talk about something else? You like that Ophelia girl, what's she like?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ophelia by name, Oh Feely Yah by nature, huh bro?\" said Jupiter, grinning. Cannius's jaw dropped. Fortis laughed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's...she's nice!\" said Cannius. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Does she have good teeth?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dunno...why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh so she hasn't sucked your dick yet...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"FORTIS!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis and Jupiter burst out laughing. Cannius groaned. \"Will you two shut up!?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

And his lordship looked very dark, stressed and moody. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd Eliza liked that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good evening, my lord...\" Eliza said, trying her best not to let her eyes feast on his pulsating muscles as he breathed heavily in and out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"'Liza. Is the boiler full?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes my lord\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm having my bath upstairs.

He let out a rough snort, but at the same time, a small grin flitted across his rough face. She blushed. She couldn't believe she just did that display! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis patted her on the cheek, and lumbered upstairs. Eliza greeted her lordship's brothers, and then returned to her duties. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpstairs, Fortis turned on the tap over his bath. Running hot water, a true Mountanian innovation, with all the pipes and fittings made of copper, nothing was ever going to rust. And it could be polished to look really cool. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe water in the tank upstairs was heated from the fire in the kitchen below, which sent smoke and hot gasses up an array of pipes, through the boiler to heat the water. And the more water that came out of the boiler, the more it was replaced by the huge rainwater cisterns on the roof. Fortis watched as boiling water filled the huge, stone bathtub. He turned off the hot tap and then turned on the cold tap, which pumped cold water from the rooftop cisterns into the tub below at tremendous pressure! Fortis stripped naked, climbed into the massive bathtub, and sank beneath the water. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Ooooooooooooh...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNothing more luxurious!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe water was so hot...and soapy...and warm...Ooooh...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis splashed beneath the water and popped up again, hot water streaming off his godlike physique. He groaned. What a wonderful bath... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nResting his head against the back of the bathtub, Fortis began to doze off... </span></div></div>",

Fortis sighed, and resigned himself to sharing his tub with his toddler son and his pet bunny-rabbit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeo crawled over his father's chest and cuddled him, kissing him on the face. Fortis laughed. He pushed Leo under the water! Leo squeaked and blew bubbles! Fortis shoved him under again! More bubbles! Leo giggled. Leo stuck his own head under the water again and continued to blow bubbles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awww! How cute!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis emerged from the water, a mortified look on his face!

She watched as Fortis came upstairs, peering at him through a crack in her bedroom door. She watched his chest bounce and flex as he moved closer and closer, his huge arms straining as he pulled off a sweat-drenched tunic. She shivered as her eyes feasted on his rippling, glossy chest and abs, and then on the retreating wonders of his broad, muscular shoulders and back. <i>Control yourself, girl!...There'll be plenty of time for that... </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was about to leave her room, when she saw Leo toddle along, with his pet rabbit, Marzipan, following behind. Fortis had allowed the servant-girls to keep a few of the bunnies that had been Butterscotch and Chocolate's first litter. Lucy and Katie had promptly named them 'Cinnamon', 'Nutmeg', and 'Marzipan', after foods that they found in the kitchen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia watched as the boy and bunny hopped and toddled into the bathroom. She waited a few minutes, and then followed them. As she got closer to the bedroom of her lord and master, Eldonia heard splashing and giggling and laughing. The shrill, squeaky giggle of a toddling child, and the deep, heavy chortles of her husband! She grinned to herself and tiptoed into the master bedroom and into the bathroom next door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia peeked into the bathroom. There was a wash-basin, a huge mirror, a jug, a handpump, and two faucets, one of them connected to a large copper boiler. At the very back was an enormous bathtub. Hanging over it was a large oil-lamp which was casting soft yellow light everywhere. She could see three figures in the bathtub. Fortis, with his son sitting on his lap, and bobbing around in the water was Marzipan the bunny-rabbit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, she tugged off most of her clothes, and left them in a heap by the door. She slipped on her nightgown and tiptoed into the bathroom. The floor was wonderfully warm, heated by the smoke and steam from the kitchen below. She moved towards the bath and smiled. \"Aww how sweet!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis's jaw dropped! Leo let out a squeak of surprise! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Son, your mother wants to spend some time with your father\", said Fortis. He hoisted his son out of the bathtub and popped him onto the bath-mat, \"Now you and bunny go off and play somewhere, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okah papa! Come on bunbunz...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia dried down her son and his bunny, and dressed Leo up before sending him out to play. She smiled at her husband. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good afternoon, my lord\", she said huskily. She knelt down next to the tub and reached across to feel her husband's chest. Fortis reached out with a wet, soapy hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...Good afternoon, my lady...\" he put his hand to her chin and turned her head left and right. He smiled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia squealed! \"Forty no! No! NO!!!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore she could rid herself of her nightgown, Fortis had dragged her into the tub! She squealed and shrieked as her nightgown was soaked through! Fortis pulled it roughly off her and threw the sodden garment across the room to the clothes-horse nearby. She giggled! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Forty!\" she gasped. Fortis kissed her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How's my sexy lady, huh?\" he whispered. He pushed her back, up against the side of the bathtub, wrapping his colossal arms around her! Eldonia moaned and wrapped her legs around his waist! She gasped as she felt his mouth on her breasts! She shivered and let out a groan! She heard her husband chuckle and then nibble on her bosom! She wrapped herself even MORE tightly around him! Her hands explored his bestial musculature! Such a MAN! She groaned! Suddenly, she felt herself being hoisted out of the tub! What was going on!? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer legs, still wrapped around his hips, suddenly lost their grip! She slipped down and gasped when she felt his heavy, blood-bloated member press against her entrance! She tried desperately to squirm up his slick, smooth body, but her struggling only impaled her deeper onto his pulsating penis! She screamed as the monster invaded her innards, forcing her open and stretching her to extremes she thought impossible! Her husband did nothing! Her own desperate writhing and wriggling were forcing her to slide slowly and surely to her doom! Her husband's tremendous phallus was being forced into her by her own body-weight! She screamed and groaned, gasping from the blinding pain! It was so THICK! A Priapusian monster, the likes of which she had never fully encountered! The mark of a true Mountain Lord! She continued to pant and catch her breath as it was forced deeper and deeper! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen was it ever this huge!? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tried to think back, over the blistering, tingling sensations, to the last time she had been with her lord and master. No...it had never gone in this far before! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn it!\" she heard her husband growl! She felt large, rough hands on her backside. She felt herself being lifted up, and then being allowed to slide back down on his monster rod, being impaled even deeper and wider than ever before! Her head was exploding! Her cunt was rubbed raw from the impossible invasion! The lifting and sliding continued! Then the pushing! And the pulling! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia was blind to the fact that Fortis was literally shoving her up and down on his aching ramrod! It had been so long since they had done this properly! Eldonia was clearly experiencing something far beyond what she was used to!...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAND HE WAS MAKING IT HAPPEN! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPinned against the wall, Eldonia subjected herself to a brutal Mountanian power-fuck. She screamed and moaned! Fortis was thankful for the thick, stone walls and the heavy, wooden doors. But even if the whole castle heard her screams of delirium, he didn't care! He wanted the whole KINGDOM to know that the Earl Vanderstorm was a sex-beast, well-capable of satisfying his wife's base desires to whatever level she could imagine! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, after a long run, both of them sank into the water of the bathtub. Eldonia was barely conscious! As the gradually deflating serpent was unsheathed from her innards, she was vaguely aware of seed slopping out of her worn out vagina. She flopped into the water and groaned. What a hunk! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis chuckled. Although now, he had to wash himself all over again, to wipe off the sweat built up from his latest, mind-numbing performance... </span></div></div>",

In the dining-room, the housemaids were laying the enormous table for that night's dinner...even though it was not even noon! In the kitchen, the kitchen-maids were busy preparing ingredients for dinner. In the basements, Fortis and his brothers were busy sharpening their swords. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You hold the damn thing on an ANGLE, you idiot!

He hoisted up his own swords and daggers and headed upstairs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn his bedroom, Fortis started polishing his armour. Polishing his armour didn't just make it look shiny and make him look even sexier than he already was...it also prevented rusting. Fortis picked up a bucket of sand and poured vinegar into it. Then, he opened the fly on his hose and his enormous phallus flopped out. He groaned as a powerful stream of urine shot into the bucket. It was revolting, no doubt, but piss, sand and vinegar was excellent at buffing up plate-armour. Although he was sure not to do this when there were any women around. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDownstairs, the doorbell rang. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who on earth could that be?\" Eldonia said to Minerva, who shrugged. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you expecting anyone else?\" Minerva asked. Eldonia shook her head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. Just my father. But he's not expected until this evening!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJupiter answered the door. There was a lot of loud shouting, followed by even more noises which the two girls couldn't identify. Just then, a blond whirl exploded into the drawing room!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi Aunty Minnie!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYoung Lord Champion threw himself on his aunt's lap and gave her a kiss. Minerva giggled! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't know you were coming!\" she said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLord Wolfgang and his wife Vesta entered. Wrapped in her arms was her little girl, Astrid. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wolfgang's been called up. We didn't have time to send you a letter, but we hoped we could stay here\", said Vesta, blushing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We?\" Eldonia asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, the children and I\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh sure!\" said Eldonia. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh boy!\" said Champion, and dashed off upstairs. \"HEY LEO! IT'S YOUR COUSIN CHAMPION HERE! WHERE ARE YOU!?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not so loud, son!\" Wolfgang shouted. \"You'll wake the babies!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAthena came downstairs, \"What on earth is this...Wolfgang! Vesta how nice to see you! Hello Astrid!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Astrid, say hello to granny!\" Vesta coaxed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hawwo gwamma!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awwww! Sweet pudding! Hello darling!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChampion came running downstairs, holding his cousin in his arms. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look! I found him!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hai Uckle Woofy!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello Leo! Wow you're growing up fast, aren't you? How old are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uuuuuh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's nearly three\", Eldonia said, \"Aren't you, son?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yah?\" Leonardo murbled. He had no idea! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis came downstairs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cousin\", he said. Wolfgang smiled, and the two alpha males hugged each other. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, I hear you added more kids to the Vanderstorm brood, huh...\" said Wolfgang. \"I also hear Cousin Excalibur's been called up in the regular army\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis nodded. \"Yes. You're up too, huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWolfgang nodded. \"As father always said, we didn't earn our titles sitting on our butts\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're expecting Eldonia's father for dinner, you're all welcome to join us!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh that would be wonderful!\" said Vesta. \"I'm going upstairs to meet the babies. Come along, darling!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright...\" said Wolfgang. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose that Vesta and her kids are staying here while we're off fighting, huh?\" Fortis asked Eldonia. She nodded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did you guess?\" she asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis pointed to the pile of trunks and cases in the front hall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HERMES! ZACHARY! PERSEUS! KOVIAC! GET IN HERE AND EARN YOUR KEEP!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three servant-boys and the lord's squire hurried into the hall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes m'lord!\" said Zacharia, the oldest of the three boys. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"MOVE this crap! Take it upstairs! The first and second guestrooms, and the nursery!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes sir!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis watched as Zacharia hoisted one of the massive trunks onto his back with one arm, then grabbed another trunk and hoisted that onto his back! He squatted down and then slowly got to his feet. He grunted and started slowly up the stairs. He leaned against the wall as he moved up, step by slow step, careful not to lose his balance! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomeone knocked on the door. Fortis opened it. Lord VonGewalt stood on the threshold. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, good afternoon, my lad\", said the older man. Fortis nodded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My lord\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come in, may I?\" said Venatarius. Fortis nodded and gestured. The old man came in, carrying large bags with him. Clutched in one hand was a handsome, old-fashioned walking-stick. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My old war-wound has been playing up. It's why I was retired. Can't stand up right on this damn leg and hold a sword at the same time...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Papa!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia hurried into the foyer. She smiled at her father. Tall, battered, worn out and old, with white hair and a grizzly beard. He chuckled deeply. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My darling. Look at you! Turn around...Just like your mother, may she rest in peace...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVenatarius stared at all the trunks. \"Expecting company?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My cousin and his family are here as well\", Fortis said. Just then, Champion came downstairs carrying the twins, and Sapphire. Leo toddled behind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look Aunty Eldonia! I can hold all three of them!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Champion don't!\" Eldonia cried out, and snatched the girl out of his arms. Venatarius chuckled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who is this obliging youth, hmm?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is my nephew, Champion. Champion, this is Lord VonGewalt\", Fortis said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh he can call me Uncle Venatarius\", said the old man. \"We need not have such formalities. So! These are my grandchildren, are they?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gwanpa! Gwanpa!!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aaah!\" Venatarius said. He scooped up his grandson and gave him a whiskery kiss. \"Hello Leonardo my lad! And here we have Gabriel...and this is Thunder...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"THIS is Gabriel, papa\", said Eldonia, pointing to the opposite baby. \"And this is Sapphire!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooogah!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello! Awww...She looks like her mother!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Papa!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce all the introductions were made, everyone filed into the dining-room. Fortis sat in the middle of the table, with his wife opposite him. Either side of Eldonia were Minerva and Vesta. Athena sat at one end, and Champion, Wolfgang, Cannius, Jupiter and Venatarius filled in the other gaps according to seniority. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's absolutely appalling!\" Athena grumbled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is, grandma?\" Minerva asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The nerve of the Vladians! To attack Lucia! Typical of them to strike at the weakest first! No courage at all! Not a fragment of backbone in the entire kingdom! If you can call that backwards wasteland a 'kingdom'!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where is Vladia, grandma?\" Champion asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't you know anything about geography, boy?\" Wolfgang said, \"It's to our direct east!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooh...Why did they go there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have no idea!\" said Athena. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's part of their divide and conquer thing\", Venatarius said. \"But it won't succeed\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why not, my lord?\" Athena asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Lucians might be a people of candyfloss-makers and ice-cream sellers, but they're not stupid! They have rather impressive northern defenses. I went there a few times in my youth. They have capable foot soldiers. Not on a level with our own, of course, but decent chaps on a whole...But they won't last for very long if we don't go in and help them\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But they've already invaded our northern border\", said Jupiter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Mountanian Border Guard will hold them\", said Wolfgang, \"long enough for us to report to duty. When do we leave?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tomorrow night\", Fortis said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who stays here?\" Eldonia asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You, grandma...Girl...your father...Vesta...the servants...Well...the servants except for Koviac. He's coming too...the children of course...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wanna go fight!\" said Champion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Son you're TEN\", said Wolfgang, \"You're not old enough!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww rats!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not old enough! You're not tall enough, you're not strong enough!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am SO strong!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you now?\" said Fortis. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am! Really I am, Uncle Forty!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The last time he tried to lift my sword, he nearly chopped off his right leg!\" Wolfgang said, conversationally. Fortis chuckled. </span></div></div>",

The locket was too small to fit around Fortis's thick neck and mighty chest, so he wore it on his wrist, instead.

Leaving her extended family downstairs in the foyer, she headed up to where the bedrooms were located, to try and seek him out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Fortis as head of the household was away, Venatarius had agreed to look after the estate. He had even moved himself into the master bedroom. Eldonia smiled! That was probably where he was! She shuffled down the corridor that led to the master's chamber, a route she had often taken when she required 'comfort', expecting to find her father. But when she passed the nursery, she noticed that the door was open, and that she could hear noises coming from inside! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she got closer to the door, she heard sounds of movement, followed by giggling and squealing! A man's laugh echoed from the chamber and Eldonia hurried forwards to see what was going on! She stuck her head around the door-frame and smiled. Lying on the floor was her father, playing with his four grandchildren! Thunder and Gabriel were crawling around and play-wrestling on the rug in the middle of the room. Nearby, Sapphire was playing with her dolly. Leo was riding on grandpa's back, playing horsey! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gwan'pa Vennus! Yippy-yay!\" Leonardo squeaked. The old man laughed and started crawling around on the floor while his grandson sat on his shoulders, bouncing around and giggling with glee! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Leo! Leo don't bounce around on grandpa's back like that!\" Eldonia scolded. Leo just giggled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is fun, mama! Gwan'pa pway horsey!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVenatarius chuckled and reared up! Leo fell off with a squeak! Eldonia laughed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh papa! You're encouraging him to be a very bad, bad little boy!\" she said. Venatarius ignored her and started giving Leo tickle-torture! The toddler squeaked and squealed, kicking furiously with his little legs, trying to get away! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia knelt down next to her father and he smiled at her. She was so young, and yet had already accomplished so much for herself! She had married <b><i>exceptionally</i></b> well, she had given birth to four lively, beautiful children, and had all the signs of growing into a fine, beautiful woman, just like her late mother! Venatarius smiled proudly at his pretty little daughter. She was nearly twenty, but he still saw her as his little baby darling!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, do you plan to have any more children, my dear?\" he asked her. Eldonia blushed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Papa!\" she said. Venatarius gave her a <i>'I want an answer, young lady!'</i>, sort of look. She smiled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I don't know yet, papa. It all depends. I mean, Forty never said that he didn't want more children, but then, we haven't really been trying for more. So I suppose that anything is possible\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVenatarius smiled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My darling\", he said, \"You have married an excellent young man. You should do everything you can to make him happy! It is your duty to him as his wife to make him comfortable and relaxed! To make sure that he comes home to a quiet, happy, loving home, and...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You make it sound like I have to do everything! What does HE do!?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Absolutely not!\" said Venatarius, his tone rising. \"I wouldn't dare say such a thing! It is YOUR duty to love him, to be loyal to him, to be faithful to him. It is your duty as his wife to obey him and to respect him as your husband! To ensure that he is happy, comfortable, relaxed and satisfied!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what does HE do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A husband is expected to love his wife, and to cherish her at all times. To show affection, to help her, and above all, to provide her protection!...He does provide you with protection, doesn't he?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia blushed. \"Yes!\" she said. He provided her with PLENTY of protection when he invited her into his bedchamber of an evening...<i>lots</i> of protection! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I expect him to treat you as nothing less than the fine young lady that you are, my dear. And I expect YOU to treat him as nothing less than the nobleman and knight that he is!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes papa!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"However, there is one other duty, which can only be carried out by both together in a harmonious marriage\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVenatarius cleared his throat, and stared around the nursery. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"PAPA!!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He DOES ensure that you are fully satisfied, doesn't he?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well!...I...I...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"DOES he?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes papa!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia couldn't believe that she was discussing her most intimate encounters with her FATHER! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No husband who cannot satisfy his lady in his own bedchamber can be called a decent one. It is the most intimate and private of enjoyments, and one of the most important duties. Your duty is to bear the child and care for it. Not an easy task, my dear. I know, because I had to do it to you after your mother died! The very least that the husband can do is to ensure that while the end might be painful...the journey will be long-remembered...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia turned RED as wine! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And it is memorable, isn't it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes!\" Eldonia squeaked. She wasn't going to say more. She wasn't about to reveal how Fortis would ravage her like a beast in heat...how he treated her...how he plundered her innards and drove her to hysterics of...well...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerhaps she WOULD tell..Forty. Get him in the mood, and all...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut not papa! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, she smiled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...He's...He's very...He's a GOOD husband, papa!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you are satisfied?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...we don't do it very often, papa. He's always so busy. But...Well when we get the time...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe blushed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVenatarius chortled. \"Good girl!\" he said. \"You should always spend time with your husband, one-on-one\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Oh yes. They certainly did... </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeo tugged on his mother's dress. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes darling?\" Eldonia said, shaking herself out of her remembrances. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mama! You not yet Weo an' gwan'pa pway knights!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Knights!? Oh honey you're a BIT young!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nooooooooooo!!!\" Leo wailed, \"Weo wanna pway knights wiff gwan'pa! Pway knights! Pway knights!\" he wailed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One little swordplay, young man, then it's time for your nap!\" said Venatarius, firmly. He went to find the wooden toy swords. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Papa you shouldn't encourage him like that! He's going to develop bad habits!\" Eldonia said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My dear, I AM a bad habit!\" Venatarius snorted. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Fortis, Jupiter, Cannius, their older cousin Wolfgang and Fortis's squire Koviac kept on riding. They had left early and covered many miles. Fortis felt his shield clank against the studs on his belt. The shield had a crossed sword and scythe and blue and black quartering. A knight's helmet and plumage, and white bordering. The coat of arms of the Earls of Dynamos, a position the Vanderstorm family had held for centuries. A position which they had kept, held, earned and had defended ruthlessly against all comers, pretenders and masqueraders. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis awaited the day the shield would be held by his own son. He smiled to himself as he imagined Leo toddling around the castle, or playing with his Aunt Minnie, or his comely mother, Eldonia, or his great-grandmother, the dowager countess. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Forty!\" Jupiter shouted, \"There's a crossroads up ahead! There's people coming!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis blinked and stared. Sure enough, two men on horseback were coming towards a crossroads. As they all converged, they drew swords, and held them until they were close enough to see each other clearly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lord Vanderstorm!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis smirked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lord Wolvenberg\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucius Wolvenberg lowered his sword. He smiled at his friend. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jupiter, Cannius\", he said. They nodded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lucius\", they said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe frowned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, this is my cousin Lord Wolfgang\", Fortis said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My lord\", said Lucius. \"My brother, I think you know\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis nodded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBehind Lucius was a slightly shorter, younger man with blond hair, light skin and blue eyes. Atlas Wolvenberg was not nearly as solidly built as his older brother, but still an impressive catch for a lady, if she had a mind to it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where are you going?\" Fortis asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To the main base-camp on our border with Lucia\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So are we\", said Wolfgang. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then we may as well ride together\", said Lucius. \"It's a long way and I'm getting bored talking to Apples here...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"ATLAS!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis and his brothers burst out laughing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they kept riding, they continued to gather more knights of the realm. Before long, they were a dozen strong. Twelve towering, powerfully-built young men, all of noble blood. Fearsome, fearless, brutally strong and ready for the warmth of enemy blood. As they rode, they talked of family, of battle, of glory, of weapons, food, friends and sex. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMost of them had already tasted battle. Fortis and Wolfgang were veterans of the last encounter with the Vladians. Younger ones like Atlas had not yet been in combat. They chatted about trophies and prize-money and all other kinds of wondrous rewards from the field of battle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Halt!\" one of the knights shouted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe party came to a standstill in the road. Ahead of them was a clearing with a bridge over a stream. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We shall camp here tonight\", another one said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shouldn't we go on?\" Jupiter asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's several miles to the next village, and it would be too dark by then. We stay put after sundown\", another knight said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWolfgang nodded. \"He's right. We shall split into two groups! Six of us on one side, six on the other. If anything happens, then at least we have the stream and bridge between us and we won't be fully cut off either way\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis, his relations and friends, stayed on one side of the bridge, while the others crossed over and made camp on the other side. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who's got food?\" someone shouted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've got cheese somewhere...\" said Jupiter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I bet you sat on it!\" said Cannius. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do YOU have?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bread...those little rolly things...in a net-bag...oh here they are!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis unwrapped a large leg of smoked ham. A treat from Mrs. Tibbs. He drew out a dagger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll make toasted ham and cheese sandwiches for everyone\", he said. \"But first we need a fire\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile everyone got to gathering wood for two fires, Fortis started slicing up all the bread, cheese and meat. He watched as Wolfgang and Lucius tried to build and light a fire. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No no no! Smaller!...Like this!\" Wolfgang said. He tapped the blade of his dagger over a piece of wood, splitting it down the middle. \"It doesn't burn if it's so big. And we need tinder! Who's got tinder?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've got some in my saddle-pack, somewhere\", Fortis said, \"It's in a little wooden box!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're doing it wrong!\" Atlas said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWolfgang and Lucius looked up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That stuff's no good! You need drier stuff! Shriveled up stuff! Smaller twigs and whatever!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We've got plenty!\" Lucius snapped. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It won't work!\" said Atlas in an annoying, sing-song voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go and play with Jupiter, Atlas\", Wolfgang said, \"We've got this\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm telling you that the fire won't burn like that! It's not built right!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh fine!\" said Lucius, \"Come on Wolfy. Let's go see if we can find something to kill and roast! Atlas knows more about these things!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See? I told you I was right!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He knows ALL about small, dried, shriveled up things! He's had one between his legs for 18 years!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You bet!...HEY!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaughter exploded over the woods and birds flew out of nearby trees. </span></div></div>",

Inside their tents on whatever bedding they could bring with them, they attempted to find slumber in the outdoors. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs ten men slept, on each side of the river, one man was awake, keeping watch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis stood on the bridge with one of the other knights, a slightly older man named Bastion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You married?\" Bastion asked. Fortis nodded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kids?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Four\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Four!? Damn...You got biz-zey!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis shrugged. \"You?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm. Two boys. The lady wants a girl next time 'round\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you want a girl?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dunno...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBastion looked across the river to where everyone slept. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So they're your brothers?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The two over there, yes. That older guy, he's our cousin\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But YOU are the earl\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How's that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My father was the earl. He died...a few years ago. So I inherited the title, the estate, the fortune...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My father was only baron. But I managed to raise our status a bit when I was knighted. The king made me a viscount\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only a viscount?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, it sucks...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis laughed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is it a hereditary title?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're right, it does suck\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth of them chuckled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean what's the point of being called LORD Bastion when your KIDS can't be? I mean it defeats the whole damn purpose of having a title!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis was about to say something else when they heard the rumbling of hooves. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shhh!\" Bastion hissed. They drew their swords. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom the east came the noise. At first far away and indistinct, but every second growing slightly louder, but again not loud enough. Then, Fortis spotted two pricks of light. He frowned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think it's a carriage!\" he said. As the vehicle got closer, Fortis noticed two horses pulling a caravan, with another two horses behind that, pulling a second one. The light came from two lamps hanging above the driver's seat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop!\" Bastion shouted. He held his sword up. \"Who passes this way?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who is it who asks?\" one of the cloaked drivers asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We are knights of the Mountanian Realm. You will answer us!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man lowered his hood and removed his travelling cloak. Fortis chuckled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Relax, Bastion\", he said. \"They're Valleyans!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure enough, as the caravan doors opened and people came out, Fortis and Bastion saw two families of Valleyans. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nValleyan gypsies, a magical offshot of their Fantasmian cousins, were wandering nomads of no fixed address. Although they could often be found in the Mountanian lowlands, they were known to pop up all over the place! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Isaac!\" a short, round woman squawked, \"What happens here!? Why are we not moving!?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Irma! Go back to sleep!\" the man said. He turned back to the towering beasts ahead of him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We ask to pass in safety\", he said. \"We are travelling to the Fatlantean borderlands. The Vladians are acting again like the savages! We will not stay in the north!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is it very bad?\" Bastion asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They do border-raids! Many villages very disturbed! At night you hear things! Not good things! We don't stay! We go!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Valleyans have powers to ward off these things!\" Fortis said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Our powers are not so strong!\" the man Isaac said. \"Diversions, distractions...We cannot face them in open battle! It is a job for the Mountanian armies! And the knights of the realm!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis nodded. \"You can go\", he said. He sheathed his sword. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBastion also sheathed his sword. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't understand why you don't stay and fight! Your powers might not be so strong but if you all banded together.;..\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A few hundred gypsies against a thousand-more savages!? What a fakakte idea! You meshuggah, you!\" the man babbled. \"We go! Now!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man climbed back into his caravan and shook the reins. \"Heeyup! C'mon!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis watched the Valleyan caravans rumble onwards. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gee whiz. They don't normally high-tail it like that. It must be pretty bad...\" he said. </span></div></div>",

Their prolonged period in the saddle meant that they covered a great deal of distance, but were completely exhausted by sundown. As the sun dropped down behind them, they reached a dusky, sleepy Mountanian border-town near a babbling stream. In the village square, children, boys and girls, fought each other with wooden swords and shields. Mothers washed clothes outside and men drew water from the pumps and wells. As the knights rode into town, they made straight for the local inn. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How might I help you, gentlemen?\" said a short, rough-looking innkeeper with a muttonchop beard. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Beds\", Fortis said, \"And hot meals. How much?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Beds are two shillings a night, a bed\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis frowned. \"That's pretty high, isn't it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The beds boys like you are going to be sleeping in, it has to be!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis nodded. \"Fine\", he said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe tossed some silver coins onto the bar-counter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's for me. The two men there, and the older one by the door. And these two over here\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no, Forty!\" said Lucius, \"We can pay for ourselves. Take your silver back...here you are, landlord...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you kindly, m'lord...um...hmmm...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong?\" Fortis asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think we have enough rooms free. Some of you might have to share\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis glared at the man. \"SHARE?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWolfgang took a step back from Fortis. \"Don't be gettin' no ideas, Cousin Forty...\" he said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis snorted. \"Cannius and Jupiter can share! Where can we stable our horses?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The inn has its own stable. You may rest them there. Zeus! Where are you, boy!?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA handsome youngster about 13 entered the inn. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi pops!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stable their horses, and see that they're looked after properly!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes father\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZeus was a tall, thin boy, about five foot ten with dark blond hair and green eyes. He bowed to his superiors and went outside to check on their horses. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We would like something to eat\", said Lucius. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Certainly, gentlemen\", said the innkeeper. He looked at a handsome wooden clock hanging on the wall behind his bar. \"If you can wait for about another half-hour, we shall be having the village dinner-rush. Everything shall be served then. We have mutton, chicken, beef, pork, lamb, we have fresh bread, butter, olive-oil, tomatoes and cucumbers...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds good\", said Fortis. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you are heading east to Lucia?\" the innkeeper asked. They nodded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm. We've had loads of knights and soldiers marching through\", the innkeeper said. \"Your presence is most welcome\", he added. </span></div></div>",

He vaguely remembered breaking something... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe reached up behind him and felt the headboard, which had been cracked in half. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh yeah... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe rolled out of bed, as naked as the day he was born. The baker's daughter rolled out of the bed as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"His lordship is so handsome...\" she whispered, and kissed him. Fortis grunted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will I see you tonight?' she whispered. Fortis shook his head. \"We leave after breakfast\", he said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will not see you again?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Probably not\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At least I will have the memory of my lord's...abilities...\" she whispered.

He saw other doors open, followed by other knights, some with dreamy, worn-out village maidens clinging to their waists. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mon guys. Drop your cocks and grab your socks. It's time we got ready to leave\", he said sleepily. \"We gonna have breakfast downstairs...and then we gonna clear out...\" he said, and yawned. The other knights nodded. The night before had rocked the town, but with day came the responsibilities of the sword. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe average Mountanian knight could challenge any Fatlantean citizen when it came to sheer appetite. Fortis wolfed his way through six slices of bread, four eggs, a pound of bacon and sausages, hash potatoes, tomatoes, mushrooms, steaks, chops, and two pints of beer. Of course, Fortis's gigantic size made such a huge intake of food necessary, unlike the sheer gluttony of the Fatlanteans, who lived for the pleasure of food and cooking. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith their bellies full, their bags packed and their mounts saddled and bridled, the twelve knights bid farewell to the people of the village, and rode off at midday for the border-camp which they knew would not be far away... </span></div></div>",

Candles burned in their holders. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt a large table with several maps and scrolls upon it, King Leviathan sat, deep in thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomeone knocked on the doors. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come!\" he shouted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doors opened. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Knights and Noblemen of the Realm, your Majesty\", said the messenger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeviathan shrugged. \"Hmm...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shall I send them in, sir?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where are they?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're in the foyer, your Majesty\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm...I think I shall come and see them.

Standing above them on the landing, the king could see them all quite clearly. He cleared his throat. Slowly, the babbling died down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good evening, gentlemen. Welcome to Castle Silverblade. This is our main command-post for the time-being. You are all tired and longing for hot meals and a warm bed. I know. And I shan't detain you for very long. But I must tell you what and why you are here...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe king stared out at the crowd. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Vladians have dared to attack our Lucian allies. Lucia is not a country of war. It is a country of peace. Its people are craftsmen, confectioners and farmers. They know nothing of the art of war as we have known for centuries. We pledge our allegiance to the Kingdom of Lucia in its time of need, as I hope you shall pledge yours to your sovereign lord in this time of contest\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe king paused. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are all knights, or else lords and masters, or sons of great wealthy, noble, aristocratic and powerful families. Families which have earned their right to rule the land which they have been granted, through loyal and faithful service in blood to the Crown. But you cannot retain your positions on past glories! To hold your lands and your titles, you are under oath to serve the kingdom and its allies. If you want your children to enjoy the lives that you have and to pass on your lands and titles and fortunes to them, then you must show me that you are deserving of them!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were loud murmurs of agreement. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now I know you are all strong, capable fighting men. I know you will do your best and that you will do our kingdom and your families the greatest of pride. I wish to see a select group of you privately. Your names shall be called out. All those who have not been called may proceed to the dining-hall for their evening meal\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe king left the room. A messenger stood with a scroll and started reading out names. Fortis was one of them. So was Wolfgang. And Lucius. And Bastion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on guys\", said Wolfgang, \"Let's go see what he wants\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe four of them stood outside the king's door, along with the others who had been called up. One by one, they headed inside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fortis and Wolfgang Vanderstorm!\" a voice called out. The two Mountain lords headed into the room. They saluted and stood at attention in front of the huge table. The king nodded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Both of you are heads of one of the oldest and most noble of our ancient aristocratic houses. Your services go back generations and you have often been given great rewards and honours\", said the king. \"Earl Vanderstorm, I have had the great honour of knowing both your father and grandfather. I pained me to hear of your father's early and untimely demise\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis nodded. The king dropped his head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lord Wolfgang. You have served the crown faithfully. Should your service in this conflict be as exemplary as it has been on previous occasions, then you shall be richly and generously rewarded and promoted for your services\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"His Majesty had best save his time, my liege, and grant me whatever rewards he sees fit, before I leave this room\", Wolfgang said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe king frowned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I THINK what my cousin is saying, is that his loyalty and effort on the Crown's behalf would never waver, your Majesty\", Fortis said. The king grinned and laughed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course not, my good Lord Wolfgang. Of course not. And I would love to, but I cannot until I see definite proof. The same for you, young Lord Fortis. I know that both of you are battle-hardened and veterans. You have experience. That is why I have called you here. I wish to offer you something\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis frowned, \"What?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you wish it, I shall be promoting both of you. Hereafter you shall both hold the ranks of Knight-Commander of the Royal Order of the Dragon\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two warrior-lords gawped. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVery few ever received titles and ranks this high up. It would be an incredible honour... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Could we discuss this privately?\" he asked. The king nodded. \"Certainly. Your raised ranks will mean that you are in a position of command. You will still be expected to fight, but you will also be expected to command and lead a squad of men each\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How many men?\" Fortis asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A dozen or more\", said the king, \"It depends on the units available\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis nodded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you HAVE what it takes to be a leader?\" the king asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dunno about that, sir. But he sure has what it takes to be a breeder. He got four kids already and a fifth on the way...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WOLFGANG!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe king burst out laughing and Wolfgang doubled over in grunting chortles. Fortis was so red he looked about ready to burst into flames! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-n-Now th-this...hahahahah!! Th-this is serious, gentlemen!\" the king said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis nodded. \"Yes sir. It would be a great honour, your majesty, and I accept\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe king nodded. \"Lord Wolfgang?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWolfgang nodded, \"Yes sir\", he said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excellent. These promotions are conditional, mind\", he said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sir?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You hold them now on a trial basis. Their confirmation and official promotion occurs only AFTER the conflict and proof of your leadership qualities. Do I make myself clear?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sir, yes sir!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good. Well that shall be all\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes sir\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis and Wolfgang headed towards the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"After you, Commander Vanderstorm\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no, after YOU, Commander Vanderstorm\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No I...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WILL YOU TWO GET OUT!?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two knights burst out laughing and left the king's office, looking for the dining-hall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeviathan sighed. KNIGHTS!! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n--- --- --- --- <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way!\"<br>\r\n\"You lucky bastard!\" <br>\r\n\"I wanna be a commander! Me! Me! Me!\"<br>\r\n\"Well you're NOT! So suck it!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis leaned back, his friends and relatives jealous of his success. The girls were gonna be drooling over this. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Sir Fortis, Lord Vanderstorm, Earl Vanderstorm, Ninth Earl of Dynamos! Knight of the Realm, Knight-Commander of the Royal Order of the Dragon! </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nDamn that sounded good... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis chuckled. Commander...Boy he couldn't wait to pull that one on Eldonia. She would love it! The wife of a commander...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe would have to bring her back something nice from the war. Maybe a skull...She could put flowers in the eye-sockets...Yeah that would look pretty... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs dinner wound down, everyone started going to their beds. Fortis stared at the muster-rolls that were pinned to the notice-board at the entrance of the dormitories. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh. You got Cannius and Jupiter on your roll\", said Fortis. Wolfgang nodded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They's good...I got Lucius's little brother Atlas, too...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wonder who's on my roll...\" said Fortis. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe glanced down the list of names. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh-oh...\" he said, his voice falling short. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"uh-oh what?\" Wolfgang said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis pointed to a name on his list about halfway down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"VANDERSTORM - Excalibur Dominus\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWolfgang chortled and grinned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hoo-hoo!!\" he said and laughed, \"Oooh boy! You got Excalibur! Little Cuzzy Excalibur!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's a NIGHTMARE!\" Fortis groaned. \"I thought there were rules about this stuff!?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is war, cousin. What rules? Boy oh boy, oh boy...you got Excalibur...I feel sorry for you...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up, Wolfgang!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is like a family reunion!\" said Wolfgang. \"You gotta tell me what happens. This is gonna be Fuu-uuun!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"SHUT UP WOLFGANG!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWolfgang laughed. \"G'night, Cousin Forty. Don't let Excalibur poke you too hard...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis groaned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nExcalibur Vanderstorm. The tearaway black sheep of the Vanderstorm family. A couple of years younger than Fortis, he was a holy terror who caused nothing but mayhem and destruction where-ever he went! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTomorrow was going to be a hell of a day... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You must oil it! You must keep it away from water and keep it rust-free!

Fortis and Wolfgang opened a door and tiptoed inside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLying in neatly-arranged cribs and cradles, the babies of the family. Eldonia's latest set of twins, two girls, and a little boy...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...Fortis frowned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA boy? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis didn't have another boy! There was Leo, and Thunder and Gabriel...and their older cousin Champion. Since when was there ANOTHER boy?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis looked at the boy. He had dark blond hair and a cute, happy face. Fortis smiled, and then went to hug his two, three-year-old twin daughters. Grandma had insisted on naming them after precious gems, so Fortis and Eldonia had called them Ruby and Emerald. He kissed them gently on the cheeks and tiptoed out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did Vesta have another kid?\" Fortis hissed at Wolfgang.

An uncharacteristic roundness. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Minnie...are you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe rubbed her slowly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you PREGNANT!?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Yes\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who!?...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinerva laughed. \"Oh Fortis...\" she whispered.

Then you would know that!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis grunted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Besides!...Now that means that you would be related to...royalty...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you really did it. You married the Crown Prince?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are looking at Crown Princess Minerva\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis snorted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fortis!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You sure did it fast...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was the middle of a war!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis sighed. \"Hey girl, I want you to be happy...and safe...and...well...I guess I just love you lots. Hmm? Now, you listen, if he does any funny things...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fortis don't worry! We already have one baby!

He wanted to just relax for a bit and wander around the castle. It was so strange having his father back with him after so many years away. Now that he was back, however, Leo decided to find out more of this strange man who had helped to give him life. Leo admired his father, as any young Mountanian boy wanted to. And there was a lot to admire: 10ft of towering muscle and bulk, massive strength and dashing good looks. But as impressive as all those things were, the one thing that Leo was most impressed by was his father's achievements on the battlefield, and his impressive array of medals, decorations, titles, and of course...weapons! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile most of the Vanderstorm family sat downstairs in the drawing room enjoying a light supper of sandwiches and lemonade, Leo jogged upstairs and headed along the corridor towards the master bedroom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis enormous, and very masculine chamber had been a forbidden area for Leo in his earlier childhood. He was only allowed in here under the strict supervision of his father, and that happened so rarely that Leo had almost no memories of this mysterious and mythical cavern of the castle. Not even grandfather let him in here when he slept in here. And now that grandpa slept in another chamber and Fortis had re-established his place as master of the house, Leo's access to this hallowed and mythical chamber was even more tightly controlled than ever. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs with most Mountanian children, Leo did not take kindly to being told what he could, or could not do. So when he found the bedroom doors were unlocked...he headed right in! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeo took in the woven rugs, the huge fireplace, the leadlight windows, the enormous canopy bed and curtains, the drinks cabinet, the sideboard, the table and chairs, the armchairs and sofa, the coffee-table, the wardrobe, the bathroom, and on the right, two huge walls dedicated solely to the military history of the Vanderstorms. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nInherited swords, shields, maces and suits of armour decorated the entire castle, and this was but a small display of the impressive collection of weaponry that Castle Vanderstorm housed. But it was still droolingly amazing to a nine-year-old boy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHere was Fortis's personal collection of his swords, shields, daggers, suits of armour, and all other things, like medals, letters from the king, and the scrolls bearing the details of the deeds which had earned him his numerous titles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeo stared at the two huge suits of armour - one was a suit of dress-armour. Not designed for combat, it was ceremonial and formal, with gold edging and pretty engraved or embossed patterns on the breastplate, helmet and backplate. The full suit of armour in the display-case next to it, was a set of complete battle-gear. Leo leaned closer, his nose pressed up against the glass...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Please papa?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You wouldn't be interested in them\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I am, papa! Please papa?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis got on his knees. Leo was growing up fast, but not quite fast enough. He put a huge hand on his son's shoulder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, you wanna see my stuff, huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeo nodded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis well remembered his excitement as a child...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh alright...But NO touching! This stuff is heavy and it's dangerous, okay?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis hoisted his son up in his arms. Leo sat on his father's massive triceps and biceps, one arm on his shoulder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what do you want to see?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeo frowned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's THAT, papa?\" he asked. He pointed to the huge scroll that he was looking at earlier. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This? This is the family register of deeds\", Fortis said, \"It lists every Lord Vanderstorm going back to the very first one. It lists their names and all their titles and accomplishments. See? This is me, down here...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeo leaned in to read the fancy writing on the scroll. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lord Sir Fortis Maximus Vanderstorm, Earl of Dinnermoss...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dynamos, son...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Earl of Dynamos, Knight-Commander, Knight of the Royal Order of the Dragon...What's all that mean, papa?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's my title, son\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why is it so long?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's so long because I've done a lot of things which the king thought was very impressive, and he gave me titles as a reward!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooooh...Papa, do I have a title?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're just Lord Leonardo until something else happens, and even then, it's by courtesy\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It means that you only get that title because you're MY son\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...Do Thunder and Gabriel get that too?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes they do\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And Uncle Jutiper and Cannius, and Uncle Wolfgang and Uncle Ex...ex...Excaldibur?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uncle Wolfgang is also Lord Sir Wolfgang Vanderstorm, because he's a knight, too. So are your Uncle Jupiter and Uncle Cannius\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not Uncle Excaldibur?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis laughed. \"No, not Uncle Excalibur\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awww....but Uncle Excaldibur's funny!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis slowly showed his son his weapons, and his armour, and his medals. Leo drooled over the enormous battle-sword. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I have it, papa?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis laughed, \"Have it!? Son you have to be able to CARRY it, first!\" he said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can carry it! Really I can! See? I'm strong!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe flexed his arms. Fortis laughed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Soon, you'll be starting your training as a knight. You'd like that, wouldn't you, boy?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Grandpa's already started that! He got permission from the king!\" Leo said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Grandpa's been teaching you how to shoot a bow and arrow, and he's been teaching you how to ride a horse and swordfight?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeo nodded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis smiled. He hadn't expected that old Lord VonGewalt had that much energy in him! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll have to have a word with grandpa, then\", said Fortis. \"Now come on, son. It's time for bed\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awwwwww...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Son, BED\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awwww...Can I take Bunny with me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis frowned. \"Are you STILL fixated on those stupid bouncing furballs?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...they're cute...\" Leo insisted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh fine! Go find your rabbit...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeo headed downstairs, and came back with his fat, soft Fatlantean Forest Loper, which he simply named 'Bunny'. The rabbit nibbled playfully on his master's ears and Leo giggled and stroked it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, bed!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay papa...\" </span></div></div>",

He saw his father walking up to him, pulling a wagon behind him, and carrying an axe, sledgehammer, saw and iron wedges, obviously off to go and fell some trees. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah papa?\" Leo asked, as his father pulled the wagon over the bridge. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mere...\" Fortis said.

Fortis smiled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Boy! Go get that saw in the wagon. We can start de-limbing this thing and splitting it up for firewood. Sawnin' and wood-splitting's good for buildin' up your arm-muscles for all that bow-bending you're about to be doin'!\" he said. Leo nodded and ran off to find the saw. </span></div></div>",

Not everyone wins, boy. If they did, the world would be incredibly boring. You just go out there and do what you do, okay? There's the entrants' tent over there...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe family entered a huge, fairground-type area in the field, where tents and pavilions had been set up all over the place. Excalibur pulled out his coin-purse. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey cuz, I'm headin' off to the firepits!\" he shouted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Fortis could open his mouth, Excalibur had made a beeline for pillars of smoke in the distance - the location of the huge roasting-pits, where pork and beef sides were spit-roasting over massive bonfires. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That looks good!\" said Jupiter, \"C'mon Canny! Before it's all gone...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Never mind about them!\" said Eldonia, \"Let's have a look around, granny. There's lots of stuff here. Forty, you go get Leo signed in\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright sweets\", said Fortis, \"C'mon boy, this way...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis entered a large tent where people of all ages, most of them men and boys, were gathered. A large table at one end had a man behind it, with a long scroll. Fortis approached the table. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I help you?\" said the man. He was older, past sixty, cleanshaven, with muttonchops. He looked rough and more than likely, could still hold himself in a fight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm here to sign in my boy for the archery tournament\", said Fortis. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah-hah\", said the man. \"This boy?\" he asked, pointing at Leo. Fortis nodded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Name?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Vanderstorm. Leonardo Fortis\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Vanderstorm...We have a Vanderswaard...Oh here we are...Vanderstorm. Leonardo Fortis...Yes indeed. Sign here, my lad!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man turned the scroll around, and Leo bent over to make a tick next to his name, and to write his signature. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very good! I trust you brought your bow? Good. We have plenty of arrows, so you don't need to worry about that. Why don't you hang around here for a while? Meet everyone? If there's anyone else in your family here, we've got all kinds of tents and stalls and marquees set up everywhere\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll buy you some lunch, boy\", said Fortis, \"You hang around here for a bit, huh?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay papa...\" said Leo. He watched his father leave the tent. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay papa!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeo turned. He saw a group of older teens, between fifteen and eighteen. They were all over six feet, some even over seven. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well hey there kid\", said one of the teens. \"What's your name? Been here before?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"L-Leo Vanderstorm, sir\", said Leo, a little intimidated. He didn't know WHY he was intimidated. It wasn't exactly SIZE that intimidated him. His own father would've towered over these boys, so Leo was used to size...perhaps it was the fact that they were so cocky and arrogant? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, SIR! We got a cultured one here, boys\", said what appeared to be the alpha of the pack. Other boys crowded around, now. Leo stared around and started to edge towards the group of contestants who seemed to be closer to his own age. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! Where you goin', meatball!? Come back here!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boys surrounded Leo before he could make a proper getaway. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What'd you say your name was?\" another boy asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Leo Vanderstorm! Leonardo Vanderstorm\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Vander...Huh! Lookee here boys, we got us a spoilt rich kid! Hey Leo, how much'd your papa pay the judges to let you into this thing? Don'tcha know you actually gotta have SKILLS to win here? They don't let NOBODYS compete! This is the local level, but it goes all the way to the Grand Final in Ferramount!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, why don'tcha beat it on home kid before you disgrace the name of your oh-so-noble family, huh?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeo tried not to let this get to him. He was about to say something brave, or smart, or...do...something, when he heard his father returning. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here kid, I got you a bacon sandwich\", said Fortis, handing his boy an enormous sandwich wrapped in paper. \"You boys hangin' around waitin' for the grass to grow or somethin'?\" he asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, sir\", said one of the teens. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"THEN BEAT IT! I know what you're doin', and if I find you back here again I'll have you and your pa's in front of my court faster than you can shit out bricks!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe older teens immediately backed away. Leo stared at his father in admiration. He loved how his size and power meant that he could do what he wanted, and people were compelled to obey. Fortis pushed his son towards the younger crowd. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go on, kid. Hang out with some boys your own age. The rest of us are gonna be wandering around the fairground, but we'll be there to see the tournament when it begins, okay?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeo nodded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who was THAT?\" said a boy, as Leo moved closer to the ten-and-unders. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was...that was my papa!\" said Leo, brightly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wooooaaah...What is he, like...a courtier or something? Or a knight?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's an earl. The Lord Vanderstorm\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woooaah...\" said the boy again. \"I'm Alexei!\" he said. \"Who are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Leonardo Vanderstorm\", said Leo. Alexei bowed. Leo blushed. \"You don't have to...\" he began, but Alexei ignored him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is this your first time here?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlexei was a boy of Leo's age, with freakishly light blond hair, and pale skin. And cold blue eyes. He looked like a ghost. Leo was glad that he had inherited his father's darker, slightly heavier skin-tone and darker, brown-gold hair. Alexei must hate being out in strong sunlight! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy degrees, Alexei introduced Leo to the other boys, and a few girls. But they mostly either ignored him, or made fun of him as the older boys had done. They were convinced that he couldn't possibly have any skills as an archer and that he'd only gotten into the contest so late because of his father's position. This made Leo feel very uneasy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Son, I didn't do ANYTHING to get you in. I wrote a couple of letters, I paid a small fee. That's all anyone does!\" Fortis said, speaking to his son outside the tent. \"Whatever happens, I'm sure you'll make us proud. Now go on! The junior rounds are about to start...\" </span></div></div>",

THE CONTESTS ARE ABOUT TO BEGIN!\"<br>\r\n</i></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe old man from earlier, who had signed Leonardo into the contest, strolled around the fairground shouting out this message through a bullhorn. People started heading towards the stands. Sapphire scrambled onto her Uncle Excalibur's shoulders. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You comfy up there, girl?\" he asked. She giggled and pinched his ears. \"Yaah!\" she squeaked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, hundreds of people had gathered in the large, wooden stands either side of a huge field. Beyond the field was the large tent where all the contestants were waiting in their various age-groups. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This tournament will feature archery from all age-levels! Children from five to ten, teenagers from ten to twenty. Adult divisions are from twenty to forty, forty to sixty, and then sixty over! There are three components to each age-group! First component is stationary target-shooting! The next component is moving targets! The final component is trick-shooting and showmanship!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile all this was going on, Leo sat in the tent with his friend, Alexei. Behind the tent was the practice-range, where everyone had been testing their skills. Most of the younger set were ignoring, or insulting Leonardo and questioning his ability to even pull a bowstring! Most of the older set did not know Leonardo, although they did recognise the name 'Vanderstorm'. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe air filled with the twanging and flicking of bowstrings, and the steady '<i>thrrrrrrump!!</i>' of arrows flying through the air, and burying themselves in various targets. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeo watched everyone. Most of them were pretty good. They shot at playing-cards flung into the air, they hit the bullseyes from several yards away, they could shoot juggled items that were tossed into the air, one after the other...Leo had done some of this stuff, but he'd never thought about trick-shooting before! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Leo and Alexei practiced, outside, they could hear the M.C. babbling on. And then, a younger man entered the tent. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mon everyone! Out! Out! Ages Ten and Under, up to Twenty, onto the field!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Vanderstorm! You still haven't figured out your trick-shot yet!\" said one of the teenagers. \"Good luck! I hope you like LOSING! You're gonna get really good at THAT!\" he shouted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Leo had no intention of losing. True, he'd never gone up against anyone else in competition before, but he did know how to shoot! And he was going to show them that he could! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will our youngest contestants please take to the field!?\" said the M.C. \"The overall winners of these rounds will eventually go to compete against the winners of the rounds in the other divisions. The overall winner will be the county champion who will go on to compete in the national championships in Ferramount!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crowd gasped and applauded before anything had even happened! </span></div></div>",

Can Alexei come home with us and stay over? His father lives near the village!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? I didn't know that there were any other nobility around here...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-he's not, sir...he's a woodsman, sir\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aah. Your father's the firewood merchant!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yessir! Raphael Vanderstaal, sir\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your father runs a good business. You must help him a lot, huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No sir. I have three older brothers! They do all of that stuff. I help around the house, I clean stuff...it's why I have so much time for archery\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm\", said Fortis. \"Well you go and speak to your parents and if it's alright with them, then you can come and stay for a week\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really!? Oh wow! Okay! Thanks! I'll be right back!...Hey papa!!...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What does that kid eat!?\" Fortis whispered to Eldonia, \"He's got more jump than a rabbit on coffee!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do YOU know what a rabbit on coffee acts like?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eeeh...um...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you feed Leo's bunny your leftover espresso?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...I was curious...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No wonder it's been jumping on my bed!

If I can\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two boys wandered through the woods and forests, staring at all the trees and grass, kicking their heels along a dirt road. Eventually, they found a clearing, and set up camp. They'd promised Lord Vanderstorm to be back by Monday evening, so that meant they could have two full nights and three days in the forest alone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two boys gathered rocks to make a fire-pit, and then started pitching a tent between two trees. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey what food did you bring?\" Alexei asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cheese...bread..smoked ham...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You not hunting?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why should I hunt?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're an archer like me!

Let's go look around. We can pick up kindling for the fire\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two boys headed off and walked around the forest, swinging daggers and machetes around. All kinds of wild animals were everywhere. Birds like larks, sparrows, pheasants, and woodland creatures, ranging from squirrels to mice, and rabbits and hares. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mountain hares sure don't have a lot of meat on them\", said Leo. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have a pet rabbit, don't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. It's a Fatlantean Forest-Loper\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell is that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're a Fatlantean breed. Docile, friendly, tame. They make great pets! But they'll eat your whole vegetable-garden if you give them a chance!...I guess that's why papa don't like 'em. They ate up his entire potato-patch last year!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlexei laughed and Leo chuckled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, those over there...\" Leo pointed to a gathering of hares, \"They just eat whatever falls off the fruit trees, and grass and roots and...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Zunk!!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of the hares flopped down dead. The others hopped away. Both boys stopped. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was that?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's an arrow!\" said Alexei. Both boys unshouldered their bows and loaded in arrows, turning around behind them. There, they saw another boy standing between trees. He also held a bow. The boy looked slightly older, maybe ten or eleven. He had brown hair and brown eyes. He strolled forwards. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My kill\", he said, simply. He stared at their bows and arrows and shrugged. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who are you!?\" Leo shouted. He'd never met this boy before! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy moved towards the hare and hoisted it up, removed the arrow and pulled out a hatchet to decapitate the animal. Holding it up by the hindlegs, he turned around. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who are you?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Leo Vanderstorm. My friend Alexei Vanderstaal\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy moved closer. \"Vanderstorm, huh? Hmm\". He sounded slightly impressed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Jaxxon\", he said, holding out a hand. Leo shook it. \"Jaxxon DeJaeger\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that your tent back there?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe pointed to where a tent could just be seen in the distance. The two boys nodded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Camping?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNod. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cool. Can I join?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If we get in on that bunny\", said Alexei. Jaxxon nodded. \"Sure\", he said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mon!\" said Leo, \"We gotta start a fire before we can eat it\". </span></div></div>",

He pulled out a firemaking kit from his haversack and started setting up the drill, tinder and fire-board on the ground. He looped his drill through the bowstring on his bow and started driving it back and forth as hard as he could. The wooden drill-bit spun back and forth over the tinder and fire-board, building up incredible friction and heat! After spinning back and forth several times, the tinder started smoking...and then burst into flames! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaxxon blew on the ball of tinder, before tipping it into the fire-pit, where Leo put straw and small twigs and other things on top of it. Then, he started putting larger twigs and hunks of branches on.

He headed off and returned a few minutes later with a long, thin branch. he pulled out a knife and started chipping and slicing away at one end to make a point. Jaxxon forced the slices of rabbit-meat on while Alexei held it over the fire. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your pa's a blacksmith?\" Jaxxon asked. Alexei nodded. \"Mother's dead. So I do all the cooking.

At least with archery I'm good!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can't survive on the winnings out of archery tournaments, my lad!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah but...I dunno!\" Jaxxon brooded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, the mood in the dining-hall changed dramatically. A bell jangled loudly throughout the castle! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the...\" Fortis began. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Front door!\" said Mrs. Tibbs, hurrying past. The rotund, homely housekeeper waddled down the corridor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is his lordship in?\"<br>\r\n\"Yes sir! He's in the dining-room\". <br>\r\n\"Thank you\".<br>\r\n\"Shall I...\"<br>\r\n\"No\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Lord Bastion DeJaeger, m'lord!\" Mrs. Tibbs panted, as a tall man, older than Fortis and more rugged-looking, entered the dining-room. Fortis stood up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bastion\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fortis...THERE YOU ARE!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaxxon let out a yelp of pain as his father almost ripped his ear off, dragging him to his side! \"WHAT have I told you about running away from home!?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OW!!! GET OFF ME!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You go on home, young man!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NO!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YOU DO AS I TELL YOU!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What on EARTH is all this hollering about!?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAthena entered the dining-room, tapping her walking-stick on the floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lady Vanderstorm! I apologise...I came to find my son, and to bring him HOME\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't WANNA go home!\" Jaxxon shouted. \"You always bully me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you bothered to DO what you were TOLD, I wouldn't HAVE TO!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I WOULD DO IT IF YOU SHOWED ME HOW!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"DON'T YOU TAKE THAT TONE WITH ME, BOY!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"BASTION DEJAEGER!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe room was deadly still. Eldonia retreated from the dining-room, taking her twin boys with her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT is going on here!? I will NOT have you shrieking around my castle like a drowning pig!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, that's Forty's job...\" said Excalibur, who continued to eat his lunch throughout the whole debacle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBastion seemed to be doing a lot of very fast thinking. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Boy. Stay here. Play with Leonardo, go in the garden, whatever. But if you run off again I'll tan you so hard you won't sit for a month! Lord Vanderstorm, a word, if you please\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLord DeJaeger left the room, Fortis followed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bastion I DEMAND an explanation! I won't have you coming in here disrupting my household!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLord DeJaeger headed upstairs and into the library, Fortis following him, and closing the doors behind them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm...I'm sorry, Fortis...But that...BOY!...Has been driving me up the wall for...I don't even KNOW how long!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well what's the MATTER!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want him to be a knight!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As would any right-thinking Mountanian father. What about it!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"THE BOY REFUSES!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is it that bad?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is...Fortis, I sent him to old Lord VonGewalt. You know who he is...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course I know! I married his damn daughter!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good! You know what kind of person he is...he gave up trying to teach the boy after six months! He send him back to me! After that, I tried various members of the royal court in Ferramount, none of them would take him!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Word travels fast at the king's court...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I tried Sir Axelrod, who lives two counties away...he took the boy in and gave up after a year! I sent him to Sir Galico Vandersteen...he stopped after six weeks! I've been trying to train the boy for the past six months, and he shows NO desire to learn! OR any desire to do anything! But shoot that damn bow and arrow of his!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine!...What's that got to do with ME?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your boy's in training to be a knight\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who's teaching him?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want you to teach Jaxxon, too\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What!?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jaxxon and Leonardo are the same age. Perhaps them learning together might motivate them! And when Jaxxon finds out about your military career, he might be impressed enough to actually LEARN!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis frowned, \"You know, that might not be a bad idea. But you KNOW this stuff is expensive! You're my friend, Bastion, and I'll cut prices where I can, but...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll pay all expenses!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Food, lodgings, lessons...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll pay his rent for you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...weapons...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll give you some of my swords!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...mounts...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll send over one of my horses! Two, if you need them!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...armour...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll find something!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...to say nothing of...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll pay for it! Fortis you have to help me!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll cover all expenses?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And the boy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He can live here!...With your permission...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You do realise that both of them are enrolled in the finals of the archery tournament\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well his training can resume when it's over!...And he's won!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That won't work\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why not?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because Leonardo's going to win\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No he won't!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yes he will!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will not!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will too!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will NOT!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WILL TOO!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you train my boy to be a knight, then perhaps I'll tell Jaxx to LET Leo win...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Leo wouldn't need that! He'd do it on his own merits! Because he's a winner like his own father!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBastion laughed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mon Bastion. Let's go downstairs...Besides, we have an archery tournament...\" </span></div></div>",

I'm here to drop the boy off\", said Bastion, indicating his son. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, m'lord!\" said Mrs. Tibbs, \"The Master is upstairs in his study. Perhaps you would go on upstairs?\" she said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you...C'mon boy!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaxxon followed his father upstairs and into a huge, masculine chamber - The lord's study. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis was busy staring at a roll of papers. Taxes, bills, rent...He swept it all aside when he saw Bastion enter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, it starts today, does it?\" said Fortis. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes sir\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right. C'mere boy...Now you listen to me. Starting from today is your progression to become a proper knight. You understand? While you live here you will obey me or I will make you sorry that you didn't! You will be polite! You will be respectful! If I get any sas-mouth and backtalk from you boy, you gonna wish you were born without teeth to talk with! Your father has sent you to every reputable knight and warrior this side of the Mountanian border and if they ain't gonna take you, then you have some serious issues. And I ain't gonna give a shit what they are! You do as you're told or I will MAKE you do as you're told!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaxxon gulped and nodded, wondering just what kind of deal it was that his father had brokered with Lord Vanderstorm! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You understand, boy!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yessir!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good. Good day, Lord DeJaeger. I'll send your boy back in a few years\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sir\", said Bastion. The two men shook hands and Bastion headed downstairs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"LADY! GET IN HERE!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia hurried in, holding onto her twins. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes my lord!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Young Master Jaxxon will be staying with us for the duration of his combat-training. I want you to make sure that he's familiar with the household\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Certainly! Come along, young Jaxxon\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Donnie!...Leave the girls...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe twins rushed to their father who sat them playfully in his lap and stroked their hair, while Eldonia took Jaxxon away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe showed him the bedrooms, the library, the washrooms, dining-room, ballroom, kitchens, gardens, stables, parlour, morning room, living room, dying room, basements, cellars, closets and various other chambers and rooms around the castle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now unfortunately, with such a large family...EXCALIBUR PUT SOME CLOTHES ON!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gotcha!...where's my cap...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...we won't have a spare bedroom for you. You'll have to share a room with Leonardo. I hope that's alright. We have another bed in there and we've set things up as nice as we can. Leo! Leo! C'mere! Show Jaxxon where he'll be sleeping\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes mama!\" said Leo, \"C'mon Jaxx! You're upstairs with me!\" </span></div></div>",

Pride of place on the top shelf, right in the middle, was a huge gold trophy-cup. He chuckled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First Prize for National Archery Championship - Multidivisional Champion - Leonardo Fortis Vanderstorm\", he read. Leo blushed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah\", he said.

A flutter of cloth, a rustling of skirts...but nobody noticed Karenina DeJaeger flit up the stairs, searching for the new man in her life...or in her skirts. Eldonia pretended that she didn't notice.

Soon, Leo and Jaxxon forgot their own playfighting, and stared in awe at the lord of the manor and the young, hunky upstart, both sparring on the castle lawns. They beat each other, back and forth, left, right, all around!

Get outta here before I change my mind!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two boys heaved the bulging sacks onto their backs, almost falling over in the process, and staggered away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Darling that was a VERY naughty trick to play on the boys!\" said Eldonia. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awwww...I thought you liked it...when I was naughty...?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia blushed, \"Sweetheart! Not here!...now!...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright...alright...I'll see you tonight...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe left, his hand trailing over her chest, up her breast, over her shoulder, down her back and hair, and away... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia shivered in excitement. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYes. <i>Tonight</i>...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rrrraawwwrrrr...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shaddup, Excalibur! And don't you go peeking into Fortis's bedroom keyhole again or I'll poke your eye out with a letter-opener!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Behind him, the steadily vanishing outline of a towering castle with twinkling lights at the windows. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was freezing cold! He'd had to do unspeakable things to get out of there! He shuddered at the very thought of it! He ran across the soaking wet grass through the forests and slipping and sliding down riverbanks and splashing through flood-swollen creeks! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe'd been running for weeks, now. And still in the distance he could see it. The castle on the mountain. The castle that had been his only home for as long as he'd known! Perhaps he was delusional? He had no idea. He hadn't eaten in three or four days. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe shivered and coughed and sneezed. He had traveled by barge, by horse and cart, by boat...he'd snuck through the heavily-guarded Mountanian-Vladian border...and now he had no idea where he was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe'd kept away from large population centers. He didn't want to draw attention to himself. He went from farm to farm, quarry and mine to quarry and mine, making sure at all times never to linger in one place too long. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe weather was slowly getting warmer. He must be moving south. Every day, he kept trudging, draped in whatever clothes he could steal from washing-lines, and eating whatever food he could steal from orchards. One day he got really lucky, and pinched a pie from a windowsill. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had no idea where he was going to go, or what he was going to do when he got there, he just knew that he wanted to travel south! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother week had passed, and he was now in the Mountanian lowlands. He made his way through the forests, searching for food, or water, or shelter, or warmth, or clothing, when he decided to stop by a stream and try to wash the grime and muck of weeks of hard travel off of his body. He climbed down some smooth rocks into a stream, pulled off his filthy tunic and hose, and stepped carefully into the sun-warmed waters below. </span></div></div>",

He was desperately trying to pull himself free, but was well and truly trapped! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah! Calm down!\" said Leo as he approached. The escapee looked terrified! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they got closer, they realised that he was a boy! Probably younger than they were! He looked about seven or eight years old, with white blond hair and thin, starving features. He looked absolutely petrified! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Calm down!\" said Leo. \"It's alright...It's okay!...OUCH!\" he yelped when the boy lashed out and scratched him on the arm! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehe.

C'mon! We've got food!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy's stomach rumbled and gurgled uncomfortably. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Food?</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe these boys weren't so bad... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDimitri followed the two boys through the woods. He could tell they were Mountanian by their accents, their manners and the fact that they seemed to be perpetually armed. He'd heard fearsome stories about Mountanian strength and power, from the guards in the castle and dungeon where he grew up. He had no idea if they told the truth, exaggerated it, or played it down out of fear, anger or disgust. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young Vladian boy found that the camp was pitched in a small clearing. It was composed of two logs for seating, a fire-pit, and a large tent. Wrapped up in paper were sausages, cheese, bread and butter. Jaxxon started cooking for three, and Leo sat down, staring at Dimitri. The boy was unlike anybody he'd ever met before! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where do you come from?\" Leonardo asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Vladia\", said the boy. \"Name is Dimitri Valentin Vasily Aleksandrovitzch\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah um...where were you BORN?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy seemed not to understand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where did you live in Vladia?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In...in...Ostrog...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where's Ostrog?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ostrog...castle...um...castle room...below stairs...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! You mean a dungeon?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Da! Dungeon! Dimitri...Dimitri escape dungeon. Run for many days. Dimitri parents dead...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh you're an orphan? No parents?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDimitri frowned, \"No...da. No parents...All dead!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww...Well...um...I suppose you'll be safe with us. You can come back to the castle with us!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDimitri stiffened. Castle!? A look of panic flitted over his bony face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's alright!\" said Leo, \"I live there. It's my home! You'll like it. It's all clean and warm and comfortable! And there's lots of food, and clean beds, and my papa would love to see you!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wouldn't be so sure about that, Leo\", said Jaxxon. \"You know what he's like\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeo shrugged. \"Who cares?!? You're coming home with us! We'll leave tomorrow morning\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright\", said Jaxxon, \"But don't be surprised if...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jaxx, it's winter now. It's getting colder and colder every day. In a couple of weeks it'll probably start snowing! He's gonna freeze to death!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaxxon sighed. Although Lord Vanderstorm was more patient than his own father, Jaxxon was ready to bet his life that the sight of a Vladian runaway was going to send his blood boiling! And he didn't want to be there when the kettle exploded! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrying not to think about it, the young Mountain boy climbed into the tent with his best friend and their new companion, and tried to get some sleep. </span></div></div>",

And perhaps rightly so, when he found out who Leonardo's father was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia sat in her husband's lap, caressing his impressive form. She kissed him and hugged him and Fortis growled at her. She giggled. Someone knocked on the door. Fortis groaned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah!?\" he grumbled, irritated at having his few minutes alone with his wife interrupted. Eldonia got to her feet and stood up behind her husband. The doors to the lord's study opened and Leo peeked in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Papa, can Jaxxon and I speak to you about something?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis frowned. \"Now?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, father\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis sighed.

He leaned back in his chair and waved the two youths in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you have fun, camping?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, father!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, good.

I let your sisters have their bunnies, but that's it!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...we didn't find an ANIMAL...exactly...\" said Leo. \"But um...well...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis frowned. \"What is it?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeo turned to Jaxxon who was standing by the door. Jaxxon entered, leading Dimitri after him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Papa...this is Dimitri\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDimitri Valentin Vasily Aleksandrovitzch gawped at the giant sitting in the chair. Powerfully built and monumentally tall, he was every inch a Mountanian warlord...and he could tell at once, he didn't get his title just from sitting on his ass. This guy had seen SERIOUS combat! He swallowed, his jaw popping open in shock! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dimitri...huh?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes...father\", said Leonardo. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis slowly digested the name. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell me...Dimitri. What brings you to my estate?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Father...\" Leo began, but Fortis cut him off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't ask you!\" he snapped. \"Boy! What is your business here!?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I...I run away from home!\" Dimitri blurted out in a rush. He could tell at once, Lord Vanderstorm was not a person to be crossed! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what are you doing HERE?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I invited him here, papa! He's been on the run for weeks! Please let him day!\" Leo pleaded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Leo, I will not allow a complete stranger to enter the castle and stay here!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Papa...papa please!?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Leo, you're not three years old anymore. That cutesy stuff don't work with me\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...Oooooh Emeraaaaald!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"DON'T get your sister in here to butter me up! The answer is NO!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What on EARTH is all this shouting about!?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAthena shuffled in, and stared at the scene in front of her. \"Leonardo don't you dare talk to your father like that!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But grandma! Papa won't let us keep Dimitri!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who's Dimitri and why do you want to 'keep' him!? You haven't brought back another pet, have you!?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"THIS is Dimitri!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe old woman turned around. \"Oh my goodness! Oh the boy's filthy! And he's so thin! Fortis you can't send him back out again!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Grandma this is MY castle and I'll decide who comes, and who goes!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's as may be, but your father and grandfather raised you better than that! You are a knight! And what is your chivalric pledge!?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's that got to DO WITH ANYTHING!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't you get sharp with me, young man! Recite it from the top!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NOW, Fortis!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis said something extremely rude under his breath, and sighed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As Knight of the Mountanian Kingdom, I solemnly swear this oath, to fight for the good for king and country, and the citizenry that reside therein. To dispatch with swift mercy, enemies of the realm, to aid the distressed, and to show compassion to...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop! What did you just say?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aid OUR distressed, grandma!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The pledge says nothing about 'our' and 'theirs', Fortis!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How would you know!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How...I am your grandmother! My husband was a knight, your father was a knight, and YOU are a knight! I know that pledge a damn sight better than you do! And while I am around, I will see to it that you uphold your chivalric oaths! Now do it!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis had very rarely been dressed down by his grandmother, but he knew from experience that she came from fierce and determined stock. Not easily frightened, swayed, or bullied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, grandmother\", he said. He grimaced as if he'd just drank a whole jug of lemon-juice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh very well! The boy can stay!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks grandma!\" said Leo. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What, don't I get anything!?\" Fortis snorted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YOU didn't do anything!\" said Athena. \"Leonardo, take the boy downstairs!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay grandma! C'mon Dimitri!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't BELIEVE you did that...\" Fortis grumbled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I shall do more than that if you're not careful!\" said Athena, gripping her grandson's ear and twisting it sharply. Fortis grimaced in pain! \"Really! Excalibur could do better!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Grandma do NOT compare me to Excalibur!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I shall do no such thing! There isn't enough to compare!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course not!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because he holds more virtue than you!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He spent half his life in prison!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And that's taught him a lot more than you know!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis groaned.

Girls! Bring out the big tub! And the soap! And the scrubbing-brushes!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay!\" said Matilda. \"Come on Eliza!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm coming!\" said Eliza. \"Lucy! Go and get the soap!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm coming!\" said Lucy, rushing off to find it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eugh, just look at him!\" said Matilda, filling up the bathtub. \"He's all filthy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh hurry up!\" said Mrs. Tibbs. She started ripping off all of Dimitri's old clothes until he was stark naked! Eliza stared at him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's not much downstairs...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's because he's not a Mountanian!\" said Matilda. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do you know!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I heard His Lordship talking about it upstairs!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listnin' at keyholes again!\" Mrs. Tibbs scolded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No I haven't! His Lordship's got a very deep, heavy, POWERFUL voice! It goes through the whole house!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth girls giggled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh get into the tub with you!\" said Mrs. Tibbs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDimitri climbed into the tub of hot water and sat down. At once, the three girls started cleaning, while Mrs. Tibbs supervised. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh forget about washing his hair, Lizzie! Just cut it all off! I daresay the child's SWARMING with lice!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Mrs. Tibbs! I'll ask Lady Athena for her cloth-shears...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll NOT be using her ladyship's tailoring shears on hair as this! Take the clippers out of the knife-box!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yessum!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDimitri felt himself being scrubbed all over with sponges and brushes! And then he felt his wet hair being clipped off with a pair of old shears. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! Careful whith zhe ears!\" he gasped. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh hold still!\" said Eliza. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"His nails are filthy!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah!\" said Zacharia the pageboy when he entered the kitchen, \"What's going on!?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Never you mind, Zachy!\" said Eliza. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You look like you're trying to clean him to death!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We may have to!\" said Matilda. \"Oh just LOOK at how filthy his legs are! Eugh! Lord Vanderstorm let him walk barefoot around the castle like this!?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n--- --- --- --- <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis sighed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA Vladian! In HIS HOUSE! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere HAD to be some sort of law about this... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe paced back and forth in his study. He groaned. He had to relax. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe'd go to his bathroom and have a shave. His stubble was getting kinda hairy, and Eldonia liked her man lookin' rugged...not caveman! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<i>Although</i>... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe laughed and headed into the bathroom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis filled up his shaving-scuttle from the hot-water tank, and lathered up his soap. But then he stopped. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"KOVIAC!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes sir!\" said his squire. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where are my razors!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Razors? I haven't touched them!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis sighed and headed downstairs. The housemaids were always hiding his razors. They said they liked working for a 'rougher master'. He smirked. Well...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eliza!\" he shouted, when he saw one of the housemaids hurrying past with towels. \"C'mere!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes m'lord!\" said Eliza, curtsying. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHERE are my razors?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Matilda borrowed them!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What for?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To shave that boy's head!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To...to...she took my razors...to SHAVE his flea-ridden, lice-infested head!?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Yes m'lord...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no...\" Fortis groaned. \"Well clean them COMPLETELY before you put them back upstairs!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes sir!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEliza hurried into the kitchen, where Dimitri's bath was done. it had taken over two hours to clean, scrub, brush, rub, cut, scrape, shave and trim all the gunk off of him, but he finally looked like a human being! Dimitri dried himself down and stood there, his whole head completely bald, his pale skin clean, his blond hair shaved off entirely! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I feel like baby!\" he said, staring at himself as he wrapped one of the towels around his body. \"What am I going to wear!?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you can't wear those old rags again!\" said Mrs. Tibbs. \"I burnt them! Mattie, go upstairs and find some of Master Leonardo's clothing! Perhaps he can wear that...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright!\" said Matilda. \"Come on Dimitri...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDimitri followed Matilda through the house. He stared at the heavy wood panneling, the suits of armour, the swords, the portraits, the intricately carved furniture, the paintings, and the amazing displays of wealth and power. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe hoped that he'd be allowed to live here... </span></div></div>",

I got an empty flagon! Do somethin' about it!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBacchus groaned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's enough, Xavius! You've had your fill!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I SAID FILL IT UP!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man threw some coins over the counter. They clattered on the floor below. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBacchus sighed. \"Alright! Alright...But this better be your LAST one, Xavius!\", he said, and started filling up the pewter flagon on the counter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bartender's muscular hands and arms flexed. He reached under the counter for a heavy wooden club that he kept for instances like this. Fortis knew from experience that Bacchus was well-capable of dealing with any drunkards in his bar. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That guy's been driving me nuts...\" said Bacchus. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who is he?\" Fortis asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"His name's Xavius. You probably haven't seen him much\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Probably not if he moved here when I was out at war\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, I think he did. During that long stretch when you weren't around...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis groaned. He remembered. Year after year away from home travelling the country on military duties. If not for the fat sacks of gold that the king paid him, he wouldn't have bothered spending so much time away from home and family. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He sounds like a pain in the ass\", said Fortis. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBacchus sighed. \"You could say that...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's he do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do? I have no damn idea! He comes in, he sits at the bar...if he sits there any longer, his ass is gonna grow onto the stool!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis laughed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"BARKEEP!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh for the love of sulphur and brimstone...Xavius I said that's ENOUGH!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck you!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis groaned. He got to his feet and lumbered over. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen buddy, the bartender here's a good buddy of mine. I don't like hearin' him bein' mouthed off to. You gonna apologise and you gonna get the heck out of his bar right now!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You and what army!?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe games of cards, chess, and dice, the conversations and debates, the meals and drinks all stopped when a heavy, meaty thud echoed through the bar. Villagers all looked up from their tables and benches to see the man Romulus, a fat, beer-bellied individual who looked like he hadn't shaved in a month, flat on his back on the ground. Blood dribbled down from a fat lip where Fortis had punched him in the face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"These armies!\" Fortis said. raising up his thick biceps and triceps, balling his fists, shifting back and forth on his feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nXavius grunted and got to his feet, spitting blood. He looked kinda dizzy. He could barely stand up! He held onto the bar and Fortis lowered his fists. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck you too!\" he swore. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Whack!!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt sounded like that noise when Mrs. Tibbs was busy tenderising chicken to make schnitzels for dinner. A heavy, wet, meaty thudding sound. The man doubled over in agony and collapsed on the ground! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time, he didn't get up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You...you!\" Fortis said, pointing to two of Bacchus's sons. \"Get that piece of shit outta here. I don't like havin' my beer interrupted!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two young men eagerly grabbed the unconcious drunk by the arms and legs and carried him out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One...\"<br>\r\n\"...Two...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two brothers looked at each other. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Three!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe passed-out drunk was chucked into the street. </span></div></div>",

He moved into some cottage in the woods between here and the castle, on the Western Road, I think...\" said the village cooper. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That little shit-hole!? That's not a cottage, it's a box with a fireplace!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone laughed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Does he have family?\" Fortis asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We dunno\", said another man. \"He must have something, because he brings it here all the time and blows it on booze!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think he goes hunting!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hunting!? How the heck does he kill anything!? Every time I see him, he can hardly stand up, let alone swing a sword! Hell, he'd probably chop off his own head!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoars of laughter exploded through the tavern. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis sighed. The Vanderstorm family had held the title of Earl of Dynamos for generations. It was a title of extreme privilege and prestige. But one which came with large responsibilities. It wasn't just a matter of swanning around and acting rich and powerful - the king expected certain services in return for his fortunes and favours. And if such services weren't provided, Fortis's family could lose their privileged position... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis's duties were numerous. He was the local judge and magistrate, the local justice and keeper of the King's Peace. He was expected to uphold and enforce all the laws of the land, and punish those who had broken them. He was expected to collect taxes in coin and grain and food or livestock, and was expected to keep an eye on all lesser lords and knights within his realm. His long list of titles was impressive, but they also commanded respect. But respect had to be earned. Earned, in this case, by dealing with troublesome drunks... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose you wish for me to handle him\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WE can handle him!\" said one of the angry villagers. There were shouts of agreement. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then why haven't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...we wanted things to be done...the right way. You're our...representative in these matters, Lord Vanderstorm. It's YOUR job to deal with it...as you see fit. And if how you see fit should result in Xavius...departing this life in a sudden and abrupt manner...I'm sure there would not be anyone here who would say that it was not in self-defense on your part...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, there were murmurs of agreement. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...although, I think the king would be suspicious of you having to legitimately defend yourself against anyone...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not necessarily, Mr. Von Pann!\" said another regular at the bar. \"Xavius is usually drunk! He'd probably take on Lord Vanderstorm anyway!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeople shouted in agreement. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright!\" said Fortis. \"Where's this flea-bag live?\" </span></div></div>",

It was three, maybe four rooms, with a slate roof, stone and wood walls, and a few tiny windows. There was a wood-pile and a rusty axe out on the porch, and that was it. Inside, everyone could hear screaming, shouting and the crashing of something heavy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds like there's at least two people in there...\" said Fortis. \"Come on!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crowd of angry villagers approached porch and front door. Fortis stepped forwards and slammed his fist against the door, beating on it with such force, the simple door-knocker made out of an old horse-shoe rattled loudly! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"XAVIUS! GET YOUR ASS OUT HERE RIGHT NOW!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck you! Who is it that orders me thus!?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YOUR LORD AND MASTER ORDERS THEE THUS, DAMN YOU! IN THE KING'S NAME PRESENT YOURSELF AT ONCE!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen his order was not met with a response, Fortis grabbed the door and ripped it off its hinges, throwing it to the ground! Inside, a woman screamed, huddled in the corner with three children. One of them was holding something in his hand. Broken plates were everywhere. Outside, the villagers waited to see what might happen... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlass shattered! Wood splintered! A man tumbled out of the house and sprawled on the grass, blood running from a fat lip! The crowd stepped back as Fortis exited. His already gigantic frame looking twice as large again. He easily hoisted Xavius into the air, a good twelve feet! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore anyone could stop him, Fortis slammed Xavius into the nearest tree, over, and over, and over again! It took six grown men to force their lord to relinquish his prize. Fortis eventually dropped Xavius onto the ground, an unconscious, bloody heap. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did you find in the house, my lord?\" one of the villagers asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can come out!\" Fortis shouted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmerging from the house were four figures. A woman, young. In her mid-twenties, perhaps. And three children. A boy about eight, another boy about five, and a girl about two or three years old. The oldest boy carried what looked like a broken kitchen-knife in his hands. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay kid, you can put that thing down\", said Fortis. The children huddled around their mother, who stared about herself, fearfully. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go on!\" Fortis shouted. \"Back to the village!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe villagers slowly dispersed, all hissing and talking to each other in half-tones. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...\" said Fortis, staring at the girl. And at the three children. \"What ARE we going to do with you, then?\" </span></div></div>",

She had three children, a girl, about two, a boy, probably a year or two older, and another child, probably seven or eight. The boy seemed to be trying to comfort his mother who appeared to be having some manner of mental breakdown. He sighed, his huge chest rising and falling slowly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you alright?\" he asked as softly as he knew how. He got slowly to his knees. The woman shrieked and batted his hands away when he reached out for her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's alright...\" he said softly. She shrieked and kept crying! Fortis grabbed her forcefully, holding her arms back, then slowly relaxed, and held her. She exploded into tears and started sobbing against his chest and shoulders. Fortis rubbed her back gently, trying to help her calm down. The woman babbled something completely insensible to Fortis, and continued to cry. His grip tightened and he rubbed her slowly, in firm, pressing circles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay, it's okay...\" he said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA horse whinneyed. Fortis turned to see a large, chestnut steed galloping towards him. On top was a buff young man with blond hair of a similar length and shade to his own. The rider approached and then dismounted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, cousin. Keeping the damsel in distress all to yourself, huh!?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh shut up, Cal...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sight of the two tall, handsome strangers seemed to buck the girl up a bit. Perhaps she felt so silly crying in such alluring company. Perhaps she wanted to seem like more of a mother. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-s-s-say t-t-thank-thank you t-to the n-nice man, L-Lucius...\" she sobbed. The oldest boy, with black hair nervously approached Fortis. He held out what Fortis now recognised as a small kitchen-knife, and threw it into the ground, point-down. Fortis smiled and hugged the boy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Lucius\", he said. \"You and your mother alright now, huh? And your brother and sister?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucius nodded. The younger boy toddled forwards <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lucywuss...Wussah gunna happennah pappa?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay, your papa's not gonna do anything anymore\", said Fortis. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah! That's cause he's dead!\" said Excalibur. The woman shrieked! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nExcalibur was bent over the body of Xavius on the ground. He whistled loudly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Daaaamn cuz. You got ANG-GRY! I think you bashed his nose halfway through his head! You nearly chopped the whole fucking tree down beating his teeth into the fucking thing!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cal! Don't swear!\" Fortis hissed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh!? Oh yeah...gotcha...C'mon lady, let's back to the castle...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You take her\", said Fortis. \"I'll handle the kids\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gotcha\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And NO FUNNY BUSINESS on the way!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey cuuuuz! Ain't my fault she gonna find me all tall and dashing and...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...and a failed knight? Yeah that's a real allure\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nExcalibur snorted, lifted the woman up and hauled her onto his horse. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n--- --- --- --- <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my lord!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMrs. Tibbs' hands flew to her mouth when she saw Fortis and Excalibur enter the castle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened!?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn very few words, Fortis explained. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh dear! Oh dear, oh dear, oh dear! And children, as well! Take them upstairs, my lord! I'll come up presently!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright\", said Fortis. \"C'mon Excalibur...Cal?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mon lady, I'll take you up to MY room...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"EXCALIBUR VANDERSTORM!

He's gotta build his coffin, first\", said Excalibur, who was busy looking over the children in the guest-room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"FORTIS!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Things got a bit out of hand...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, he slammed him repeatedly against a tree-trunk...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMrs. Tibbs entered the guest-room with some bottles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here you are, m'lady\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, Mrs. Tibbs!

But already with a seven-year-old boy and two other children. Her story was hardly enviable, but one, she suspected, was hardly rare, either. She groaned and opened her eyes. Where was she...? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sat bolt-upright in bed, panting! She stared around. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was in a large, whitewashed room. The floor was heavy wood, and the walls were paneled and painted. The outer walls were stone. There was a fireplace in the corner, with a fire burning in it. Sleeping in a cot were her two youngest children, and snoozing away in a chair by the window, was her oldest son. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat had happened? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tried to remember. Her husband coming home in a furious rage. Drunk to the gills and reeking of stale beer. Not that he didn't always reek of stale beer...shouting...screaming...then a lot of noise...then a long ride...she had been semi-conscious for so long, she had forgotten almost everything that had happened! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, she got out of bed. She yelped! She hadn't realised she was completely naked! She stared around and saw clothes draped over the back of a chair. She pulled on the various layers of the simple garments left out for her, which fitted her surprisingly well, and then tiptoed out of the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe castle was enormous. Enormous and grand. Dark, heavy stone and oak, and intricate, leadlight windows were everywhere. Tapestries hung off the walls, and suits of towering armour were everywhere. Judging by the coats of arms and swords, she had found herself in the house of someone extremely important! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, she crept downstairs. She heard noises coming from some chamber down the corridor. She stopped at the ground floor and turned right. She headed along the corridor and then peeked around the corner of a huge pair of doors into the chamber beyond. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCandles and torches burned brightly. Several people were seated around an enormous dining-table laden with food. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt one end, a towering giant of a man sat with a woman in his lap, who giggled and blushed. He fondled her roughly and pulled her close. Children nearby made faces of disgust. An older woman chided the hunk, who simply smirked and teased the woman's hair, which made her laugh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFurther down the table, two younger men chatted with each other. And at the chair closest to the doors sat another impressively-sculpted Mountanian specimen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nutmeg! Come back!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSapphire hopped off her chair and jogged after her runaway pet rabbit! She ran to the doors and scooped it up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bad Bunny! You sh-YEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEK!!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis choked! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sapphy! Don't scream!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nExcalibur whirled around in his chair. He smirked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heeeey!\" he said, getting up. \"Look everybody! Someone woke up!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl gasped and backed away into the shadows, but Excalibur grabbed her and pulled her into the room! Sapphire ran back to her father, cradling her pet rabbit for comfort! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay honey, you don't have to be scared\", said Fortis. He got to his feet, disentangled the clamoring hands of his eager wife, and stepped around the side of the table. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good evening, ma'am\", he said. \"Welcome to Castle Vanderstorm\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-Hello...\" she said. Her voice was very soft and meek. It was like audible silk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're cute!\" said Excalibur, shifting her body around to look at her. Fortis grabbed his cousin's arm and with considerable force, twisted his wrist off her shoulders. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll excuse my cousin Excalibur. He's under delusions of grandeur. He thinks he's a famous womaniser...EXCALIBUR SIT DOWN!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awwww...Spoil-sport...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My name is Lord Vanderstorm\", Fortis said. \"And this is my family. You will stay with us until you are better\", he said firmly. The girl nodded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh get away from her!\" said Athena, hurrying forwards, \"Useless men! Come along here, darling! Sit down and have something to eat! What is your name, my dear?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-Harriet!\" she gasped, and sat down, her joints still all stiff and achy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's very nice to meet you\", said Athena. \"Mrs. Tibbs! Bread, meat and cheese for the young lady! And a stiff drink!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes m'lady!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, Harriet. You and your children will stay with us until you are all quite better. And then his lordship will help you set your life in order. Won't you, my darling Fortis?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes grandmother\", said Fortis. Harriet watched as the towering beast knelt beside the old woman and fondled her lovingly, and then kissed her on the cheek. She giggled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Fortis! Not now!\" she said. But Fortis refused to listen. She laughed and kissed him back. Then, Fortis moved away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarriet had never been part of a loving home. So she felt rather overwhelmed seeing all the people here interacting with each other in the way which they did. She thought that big, young hunk who had handled her when she entered the hall was kinda...kinda cute... He certainly had a very playful nature about him, she could tell that. The other big boy seemed more serious. He was older and more battle-worn, and seemed to have settled down more. Harriet slowly started eating what had been placed before her... </span></div></div>",

He felt like he needed some...company. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mountain lord removed his clothes and threw them over the back of a chair, or in the laundry-hamper by the door. He stood in front of an enormous mirror, flexing and posing, admiring his form. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite the fact that his oldest was nearly ten, Fortis was still youthful-looking. He hadn't yet entered the \"rugged, older man\" look that some girls liked. And he could still pass for twenties if he wanted to. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe opened his wardrobe and looked through it. He picked up the gold and maroon dressing-gown that his sister had once made for him. He smiled at it. Maybe another time... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe put it back, and reached in for something else. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe pulled out an enormous, red cloak, trimmed with fox-fur, that swept down to the backs of his thick legs. He put his hands through the sleeves, and then did up the brass, lion's head-clasp and chain which stretched across his powerful chest. He wrapped the cloak around his body and left the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n--- --- --- --- <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia lay in bed, her face buried in a book. The curtains around her bed were drawn. The light came from a lamp on the bedstead, which was burning above her head. She blinked when she thought she heard her bedroom door open and close, the sound muffled by the thick curtains around her bed. She frowned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis would've announced his presence. And the children would've made far more noise...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe went back to her book. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, she heard them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeavy, pounding footsteps. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomeone was in her room. She closed the book, one hand reaching under her pillow for the dagger that she kept there. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe footsteps stopped. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe curtains were whipped aside! The lamp-flame flickered and waved. In the flashing yellow and orange glow, Eldonia saw her husband towering over her, buck-naked apart from the cloak around his broad shoulders. She shivered...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stared him slowly up and down, drinking in every little detail...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis wavy blond hair, long and shaggy. His square, angular face, tanned skin, and deep blue eyes. His broad, sculpted shoulders and heavy, well-developed chest, which strained against the couplings at the front of the cloak. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eyes wavered down to his solid abdomen. He flicked his arms, affording her a view of his biceps and triceps, and his large, powerful hands. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe glanced further down. She swallowed when she saw his immense love-cannon hanging between his muscular thighs, concealing a pair of impressive sex-orbs behind its impressive girth and length. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd he wasn't even properly up yet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe backed up against the wall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My lord...\" she whispered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis removed the cloak in one swift movement, disconnecting the chest coupling, and flinging the whole thing to the floor. He crawled onto the bed, pushing his hands up against her chest and shoulders. Eldonia watched as his bronzed skin shimmered gold in the lamplight, his muscles flexing and shadowing in the dim illumination. He kissed her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She felt his arms wrap around her and cradle her in his bands of steel. The warmth of his breath, the rough, rustling and scratchiness of his stubble. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're so beautiful...\" he said, his voice heavy and deep. She gasped and gritted her teeth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My lord?\" she whispered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis ran his hands through her hair, soft, cool and scented with...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis sniffed her hair roughly. She giggled at the grunting noises! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n...with lilac. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis hands roamed down the back of her nightie. She wrapped her arms under his, and around his back. He rolled on top of her, pinning her down and kissing her over and over! Cheeks, face, forehead...he nibbled on the skin of her neck! She squealed! Fortis chuckled deeply. He gave her another big kiss on the face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awww...\" she said, and hugged him, her hands feeling his firm back...the tight, round orbs of his well-shaped muscle-butt...his sculpted legs...She trembled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And how are you, my lady?\" Fortis rumbled softly in her ears. Eldonia groaned. Fortis chuckled and started nibbling on one of her ears. Eldonia squealed and laughed! Fortis chuckled and pushed her down. He pushed back her nightie, and raised her legs up to his chest! Eldonia gasped! Her hands fumbled wildly for the cabinet next to her bed! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe drunkenly pulled open a drawer and tugged out something wrapped in paper, throwing it vaguely towards her husband. Fortis unfolded the paper to pull out the large, rubbery condom. He sighed. He didn't like having to use this thing. It wasn't as...nice...as when he didn't. But he respected his wife's decision over whether or not she was going to have more babies...Not that he would necessarily have complained...He rolled it on and prepared for entry. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia twitched as she felt something large, rough and warm stretch her open! She gritted her teeth as she felt it slide in...rubbing against her innards...and in...the fat head burrowing deep into her womanly cavern...and in...She squealed when she felt it press further! Her mouth opened in a silent scream! She grabbed her husband by his shoulders, as if his touch would relieve her of her agonising bliss! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe felt it slowly slide out again...the rough rubbing...and then in...and then out....slowly, at first...but steadily faster...and faster...! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, Fortis had a steady rhythm going. Eldonia gasped and squealed with every rough insertion. The bed rocked and creaked with every thrust, which grew progressively more violent and determined! She squirmed in bed, trying to make the pleasure last as long as possible as his cum-truncheon rubbed and massaged and tickled away at her innards! Every movement sending blistering shivers of ecstasy rippling through her body! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf Eldonia had forgotten why she had married Fortis...she soon remembered! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis continued to plunge the symbol of his manhood deep within his wife's increasingly lubricated channel. She was really getting into this! Fortis went faster and faster, feeling the pleasure shoot up his shaft like an electrical bolt! Before long, both of them had exhausted the other. Fortis had impregnated the cock-sock with so much of his essence that it was leaking out the end of it. Eldonia laughed as he peeled the claggy clinger from his dinger, and flicked it into the laundry-hamper by the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoubtless, one of the housemaids would find it interesting when she came to do the laundry. Fortis knew that it could be days before the sheath was returned. He strongly suspected it was because the serving-girls held onto it for...sentimental reasons. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt would be too easy for Fortis to share his...love...with the serving-girls, who would in all likelihood, line up to enjoy it, but for all his bravado and strength and machismo, he liked reserving himself for just the one woman who had proved to him that she deserved his love, and who had so amply provided for the continuation of the Vanderstorm family...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe kissed this one woman on the cheek, before they curled up together in bed, and went to sleep. </span></div></div>",

He doesn't!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis sighed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where is he?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Downstairs in the coach\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, joy...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n--- --- --- --- <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"JAXXON!!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hahahahahahaha!!!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSapphire sprinted across the yard, panting, her dress flapping in the breeze. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cinnamon! Cinnamon come back!\" she squealed. A fat, sand-coloured bunny with white underfur rocketed around the garden like an out-of-control firework rocket. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I told you not to pinch his tail! Now he's all scared! CINNAMON NOT OVER THERE!!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeo sprinted past. He threw himself on the ground! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"GOTCHA!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rabbit squeaked! Leo got up, gripping it tightly in his hands. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay! Calm down! It's aaaalright...Aww poor bunny...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSapphire jogged up and held out her arms. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww poor Cinnamon...BAD JAXXON!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaxxon ran up, laughing and struggling to breathe. Leo comforted his little sister as she stroked the trembling pet rabbit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three children turned around. They were so busy trying to catch the rabbit, they never noticed a huge, black carriage parked in front of the castle. A coachman sat on top, digging into a packed luncheon-hamper, while two horses were tied up nearby, drinking out of a large, stone water-trough. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HEY!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boys and girl spotted someone inside, and moved closer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe carriage window dropped open and a boy who looked about fourteen stuck his head out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HEY!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...hi\", said Leo, his arm around his sister, who had her arms around her rabbit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who are you!?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...I'm...Leo Vanderstorm. And this is my sister Sapphire, and this is Jaxxon. He's a friend of mine\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, the front doors opened. Leo stood aside as his father and Sir Raedex stepped out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Master Leonardo\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeo bowed, \"Sir Raedex, sir\", he said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man nodded, and glanced at his son, in a \"<i>See?</i>\" sort of way. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kannon, get out here!\" said Raedex. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door opened and Kannon climbed out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was now that Leo and his sister and friend could see what he looked like. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKannon was about six and a half feet tall, fifteen years old, and with red and brown hair that looked like it had gone through a tornado. He had piercings in his ears for earrings, and tattoos on his arms and back. He didn't have a particularly muscular build, more slim and trim. His face looked like it was frozen in a permanent scowl. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis sighed and Raedex nodded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Boy, until you learn somethin' about what it means to grow the heck up, you ain't comin' home!\" Raedex snapped. \"You gonna stay here, and live here, and work here, until you learn yourself some respect and some manners! Until you know how to treat other people right! And if you let that smart mouth of yours flap off, Lord Vanderstorm here'll beatcher upside the head so fast, your eyes are gonna spin! Getcher damn trunks off the roof and inside! NOW!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKannon said something that Fortis wished he'd had Sapphire in front of him for...so that he could cover her ears. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sapphie! Take your rabbit upstairs, girl. Go play with your sisters!\" Fortis shouted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Papa! I wanna see the funny boy!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NOW, Sapphire!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awwww...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSapphire headed inside. Leo and Jaxxon remained outside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who IS that guy?\" Jaxxon whispered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dunno!\" Leo hissed. \"I've never seen him before!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought your pops knew everyone!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HE might, I don't! Hey look, they're going inside...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Quick, let's go after him!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boys hurried inside, after the others. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n--- --- --- --- <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Write to me the moment anything goes south\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will, don't worry\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSir Raedex shook Fortis's hand and patted him on the back. \"Good luck, Forty\", he said. Fortis nodded and waved his friend off. Leo watched him leave. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Papa! Who was that boy?\" Leo asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis stared down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was no boy, son. That was Sir Raedex VanStaal. He's been a friend of mine for years\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not HIM papa! The BOY! The one in the carriage with all the trunks!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...That's his son, Kannon VanStaal\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...he's...different\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis nodded. \"He's here because his father wants me to handle him. While he's here, I don't want you or Jaxxon to go anywhere near him, see him, speak to him or do anything at all with him. And be damn sure you keep your little brothers and sisters away, Leo!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...okay. Is he a bad boy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis nodded. \"Yes\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...okay papa...C'mon Jaxxon, let's go to my room...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Mrs. Tibbs whirled around! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My lord!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe servant-girls flocked around their towering master like moths before a flame. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We beg your pardon...my lord...\" said Matilda. She stared longingly up at his huge chest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But we were wondering...who that boy was...\" Eliza whispered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis chuckled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay girls, sit down\", he said softly. \"I came here to speak to Mrs. Tibbs about...the boy\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who is he?\" Emily asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He looks scary!\" said Lucy, one of the other maids. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's very scary\", said Fortis. He leaned against the wall. \"His name is Kannon VanStaal. He's the son of a friend of mine. And he's here for two weeks\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is he on holiday?\" Emily asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No\", said Fortis. \"His father says the boy needs straightening out...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh!...Is he...um...y'know...'<i>Fruity</i>'?\" Eliza asked. The servant-girls burst out laughing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!\" said Fortis. \"Not that sort of straightening!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gosh, if he saw you, he might turn that way, anyhow...\" said Matilda. \"After all...once you show up, all the girls want YOU...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Girls that's ENOUGH!\" said Mrs. Tibbs, who, for reasons that the girls never understood, seemed to be immune to their master's brutish, masculine appeal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I need to talk to Mrs. Tibbs\", said Fortis. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, my lord\", said Mrs. Tibbs, and followed him out of the kitchen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mrs. Tibbs, this boy's here because he's causin' all kinds of hell at home. I told his father I'd straighten out this little punk. He's gonna work, and he's gonna work hard. And if he don't work hard, he ain't gonna eat. He's not supposed to sneak any kinda food unless I say so. So I want to make sure that you keep your kitchen under lock and key\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe usually cheerful housekeeper stared at Fortis. She'd known him since birth, and had seen him grow up. She never knew him to be this serious about anything. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright...\" she said. \"I'll do that\", she said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good. And if he causes any problems, you call me\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMrs. Tibbs' jaw dropped. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If he causes any problems, I shall handle them myself!\" she said firmly, waving a wooden spoon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis chuckled and headed upstairs.

Up!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKannon groaned and opened his eyes. Fortis stood over him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Up. Now. Work\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Work!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Work! Now!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just got here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then you better get moving!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh jeez...gimme another hour...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis didn't move.

Now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huuuurrrrggghhhwwwoooaaahh!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKannon yelped as Fortis grabbed him by the throat and hauled him into the air, damn near slamming his head against the top of the window nearby. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's go downstairs and play...\" said Fortis, carrying the struggling, kicking, writhing teenager out of the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the garden, Jupiter and Cannius had finished hauling in firewood ready for splitting. Eldonia watched her daughters playing on the grass with their pet rabbits, and Athena and Venatarius shared a light luncheon in the shade. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You must be proud of your grandson\". <br>\r\n\"Oh very proud, my lord!\"<br>\r\n\"I think Eldonia was fortunate to marry him. Despite the circumstances under which it occurred\".<br>\r\n\"She's tamed him, I think\".<br>\r\n\"Do you?\"<br>\r\n\"Well don't you?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"GET TO WORK!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAthena choked on her tea and spat it onto the grass! Venatarius laughed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe whole family turned to watch Fortis berate the unfortunate Kannon, who stood before him, holding an axe. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyone else might've considered giving Kannon an axe an unwise move, but Fortis was so tall and powerfully-built, his sheer intimidation-factor made the fact that Kannon was armed completely moot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yes way. There's the wood. I want it split, moved, and stacked in the wood-cellar by sundown!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"By...that's hours away!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then you better get started, or you can forget about dinner tonight!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, dinner needs a stove. Stove needs fire. Fire needs wood. We's all waitin'...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuuuuuuuuuuuck...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mon boy, we're waitin'!\" said Jupiter nearby. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh fuck you!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Boy you gonna learn yourself some MANNERS! If your father didn't teach you none, then damn it, I'm gonna! Now you get that axe up and you start splittin' before I use it crack you on the head like a fresh egg!\" Fortis barked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n--- --- --- --- <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpstairs, Leo and Jaxxon were polishing Fortis's armour, as demonstrated by his squire, Koviac. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"...Now you get that axe up and you start splittin', before I use it to crack you on the head like a fresh egg!...\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jeez! Leo close the window!\" said Jaxxon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The window IS closed!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaxxon blinked. \"Your old man sure has some voice on him...I never heard nobody shout that loud!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's working on that...Coconut boy or whatever his name is. I think he's weird\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, more shouting came from downstairs. The two boys hurried to the windows, opened them and looked into the gardens below. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're far too soft! All bark, no bite! Must I still do everything for you!? You! Boy! Get to work!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaxxon laughed, \"Hey Leo, is that your great-grandmother!?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...uh...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAthena waved her walking-stick at Kannon, \"Get to work!\" she screeched. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh c'mon grandma...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>*WHACK!*</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ow!

Alright, you can go hang out and play until dinner\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, papa!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two boys ran downstairs. They whisked past Eldonia, who entered her husband's bedroom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Granny really worked him over!\" she said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh-huh...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now I can see where you get it from\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get what?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...nothing. Just all that strength and power...that brutish determination...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wrapped her arms around him, moving in close. \"My big brave mountain lord...\" she whispered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDownstairs, Leo and Jaxxon headed into the garden. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wish papa would let me have a dog\", Leo grumbled. \"But he says the girls got their pets and that's enough pets!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You should ask one of your uncles!\" said Jaxxon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah I guess. I'd love a dog!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't you like the rabbits?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're cute and all, but...I mean a rabbit can't play fetch or do anything! It sits there looking cute! That's all they're good at!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two boys watched Kannon wielding the axe. Half his swings missed. The other half didn't connect, and the ones which connected never did anything. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh this is just painful to watch...\" said Leo. \"Hey Kandy!\" he shouted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKannon swung and missed again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck! WHAT!?\" he shouted, throwing the axe on the grass. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Haven't you ever split wood before?\" Leo asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course I have!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It doesn't look like it. I could help if you want...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't need some twerp's help! I can do this!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...right\", said Leo. \"Then why are you trying to cut the log across the grain?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What!?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeo sighed. He picked up the axe, repositioned the log on the splitting-block, and then raised the axe over his head, legs split, arms apart. He swung down, sliding one arm back as the axe dropped. The heavy head smashed into the wood, splitting it halfway. He then lifted the log and the axe, and dropped again. The log split open all the way, the two pieces of wood clunking to the ground. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I knew that!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Didn't look like it...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey fuck you! I can do this!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...sure\", said Leo. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Vaht is he doing?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeo and Jaxxon turned around. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEver since he'd arrived, Dimitri had proven himself a capable stable-boy, and through Leo's persuasion, his father had gradually relaxed.

Emily might've been slow, but at least she was thorough. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright then. I'm going to ring the bell\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMrs. Tibbs entered the dining-room and grabbed a rope. She pulled it hard. The bell swung on its axle, clanging and clanging! One, two, three, four pulls...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRumbling footsteps told her that the family had heard. Jupiter and Cannius exploded into the dining-room, followed by the children and their great-grandmother. Eldonia entered with her arm around her husband's waist. She staggered a bit.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudging by their state of half-dress, Mrs. Tibbs supposed that they would need dinner, to replenish the energy expended during...exercise. Lady Eldonia was walking in that familiar way that indicated that her central channel had endured a particularly aggressive penetration. Although, from the number of times Mrs. Tibbs had seen her walk in that way...she must've liked it. She also had that dreamy, drunk look on her face, that told her she was recovering from a horned up high... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"LEO! JAXXON! DINNER!\" Fortis bellowed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jeez, cuz! Tone it down!\" said Excalibur. He sat down. Eliza the head housemaid picked up a carafe of wine and moved around the table to fill glasses. Her eyes lingered on the built, muscular form of the young Excalibur. She served Old Lady Vanderstorm first, followed by Eldonia, and then Fortis, his brothers, Lord VonGewalt, and then... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tugged the top of her uniform down, her full breasts bulging out of the top. She bent down over Excalibur, leaning in and pouring wine into his glass. She gasped when she felt his hand slide up her skirt, rubbing her buttocks! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you alright, my dear?\" Athena asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yes m'lady! Um...cramps!\" she said quickly. <i>The scoundrel! The horned up, filthy scoundrel!...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust the touch of his hand was making her boil with passion...she tried to compose herself, and continued serving the wine. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the family ate, Eldonia turned to her husband. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fortis, where's the new boy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Boy?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That boy who came this morning\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! He's outside cutting up firewood\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Isn't he eating?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He eats when he's done! He ain't done, he don't eat!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Foooorty...he's a little boy...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He ain't so little, and he ain't so cute. He's driving his parents nuts!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Disgraceful!\" said Athena. \"Why if he was my child I would thrash him good and proper!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think you already did that, grandma...\" said Jupiter. The children giggled. They'd watched the performance from their bedrooms. The adults chuckled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, the dining-room door opened. Kannon stood there, his black hair wet and matted, his whole body streaked and damp with sweat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I finished...s-stacking the firewood!\" he wheezed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good. You can eat, then\", said Fortis. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKannon staggered into the dining-room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't say you could eat HERE. You'll have your food in the kitchen with the servants!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What!?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Until you learn, that is where you eat.

Her aunt had been one of the dairy-maids who worked on a nearby farm, and had procured her a position at the Castle. She grew up in the castle, waiting, cleaning, serving and attending to the members of this ancient and noble family. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she was old enough to appreciate men, her roving eyes lingered on the muscular forms of the three Vanderstorm males. Fortis, the oldest, tallest, strongest and by far the most handsome and muscular, was never going to be interested in...her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat wasn't to say that he did not share himself with her. Mountanian men had a reputation of being remarkably loose with their favours. And old Lord Vanderstorm had preferred if his son had exercised his...abilities...on the girls of the commonfolk, before 'graduating' to more important stock. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut ever since Fortis had courted, wed, seeded, and bred, Eliza knew that Fortis was off-limits to serving-girls. She was a servant...not a whore! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut that didn't mean that she didn't have a sex-life. She could get interested in one of the stable-boys. That Vallius....<i>Rrrrrrrraawwwwrrrr!!</i>...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...And she might have become more interested in Vallius...had someone else not shown up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEliza had heard rumors about Excalibur Vanderstorm. The disgraced black sheep of the Vanderstorm family. He didn't have the stable family life of Wolfgang Vanderstorm, the strength, power, brawn and daring of Fortis Vanderstorm, and he certainly didn't have the sweet, attentive qualities of Lady Minerva Vanderstorm. He'd been kicked out of his knightly training, he'd been arrested for drunken behavior, he'd been arrested for thieving, robbery, and had eventually ended up in one of the toughest fortress prisons in the country. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom such lives are rumors born. Rumors of his recklessness, his daring, and so Eliza heard from girls in the village, his supposed ability...no. Experi...no. His...supposed...<b><i>expertise</i></b>...at deflowering large numbers of the female population... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEliza wondered if the rumors were true? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly one way to find out... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat night, after dinner, she slipped out of bed. As head housemaid, she got a room to herself in the servants' quarters. She was wearing just her nightdress. She pulled on a dressing-gown, and slippers, and tiptoed out of the kitchen, through the dining-room, past the drawing room and up the huge, stone staircase in the foyer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith only a candle to guide her way, she wondered where to go? Strictly speaking, servants were not allowed in the family's quarters after nightfall, unless it was an emergency. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell this WAS an emergency!...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...She was horny! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA door opened. She hid behind a corner. She peeked around to spot three small figures tiptoeing down the corridor. Sapphire, Ruby and Emerald snuck out of their bedrooms and headed towards the two huge doors at the end of the corridor. Behind them hopped two fat, furry bunnies. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls must be sneaking into their father's bedroom to sleep with him... </span></div></div>",

She paused at the first door, and peeked through the keyhole. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bedroom was still lit. Candles burned and in a fireplace in the far wall, a huge blaze crackled. She heard splashing noises somewhere to the right. She continued peeking. She heard a soft scratching, rasping sound. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nExcalibur was having a shave. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe watched him. He was standing naked in front of a porcelain wash-basin, his blond hair golden in the firelight. His body bronzed and shiny. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>What a great ass...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe finished shaving, and his arms flexed as he pulled on a leather strop and started skimming the razor across it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<i>such amazing biceps</i>...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe put the razor away and turned around. She caught a glimpse of something long, heavy and flesh-coloured. She gasped!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...Did he hear that!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe watched him move from one side of the bedroom to the other. And then back again. And then back the other way. Then suddenly, she couldn't see him anymore. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned left...then right...then...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door opened! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nExcalibur had seen Eliza. While he had been shaving, he'd noticed the eyeball in the keyhole, reflected in a huge mirror nearby. He'd given her a few pervy moments, before confronting her head-on...in a manner of speaking. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEliza fell forwards! She gasped and got to her knees. Her jaw dropped when she saw a colossal organ dangling before her. It was as thick as her arm, shiny in the candlelight, with veins running along it, and a fat, smooth head. It curved downwards under its own weight, and hanging behind it were two fat, round orgasmal orbs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looking for something?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEliza staggered to her feet! Excalibur leaned forwards, pushing the door shut behind her! He rested his arm against the door and leered down at her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe continued to look at her, a sneering grin on his handsome face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shivered. He was soooo <i>cute! </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stared up at his handsome, chiseled face and his broad chest and smooth skin. He was young and boyish still, not like Fortis, who was slowly morphing into a rougher, older man. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Yes sir, Mister Excalibur, sir...\" she said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bullshit!\" he snorted. He grabbed her and hoisted her up! She squealed! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't act all innocent with me!\" he grunted. He carried her to his bed. \"I know you want it!\" he said. He dumped her onto the mattress and climbed on top of her! He pinned her down and pushed her nightdress up over her knees and thighs. He leaned in close. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell me, have you had fun servicing other members of the Vanderstorm household?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mister Excalibur!\" she gasped. She began to wonder what she'd gotten herself into! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I bet my nooooble Cousin Fortis has enjoyed your warm and tender favours. But I'm sure he's too valliant and kind-hearted to show you the true abilities of a Vanderstorm boy, huh?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEliza's mouth sagged open. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>True abilities!? </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe those rumors were real! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nExcalibur shifted forwards, bracing Eliza's ankles against his shoulders. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you consent?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes my lord...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEliza's jaw dropped open in a barely concealed scream of pain! She felt the heavy, warm, damp shaft force its way in! She started gasping and whimpering as it stretched her wider than she could remember! But that wasn't all. It was also rubbing in deeper as well! She trembled and moaned! In...out...in...out. Soon, a steady rhythm was built up. She sobbed and squealed with every rubbing, tingling sensation! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had determined to herself that the rumors about the disreputable Excalibur Vanderstorm were indeed very real. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n...and she decided that she liked that! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Her legs and cunt felt stretched, rubbed, numb and tingly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>What a night...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe staggered out of bed, all bow-legged and slightly bruised from the intense cock-ploughing from the night before. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>She wasn't sure if she could stand up straight...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe staggered out of Excalibur's bedroom. She stopped at the door and turned back. The bedsheets were a mess and the beast lay upon them, naked, sweaty and snoring like a hog. She felt a hot, dry, sticky, crusty mess between her thighs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Wooooow...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe weaved drunkenly along the corridor and nearly fell down the stairs. She headed through the castle to the kitchens. She paused halfway, and examined herself in the mirror. Her chestnut hair was a mess. Her shoulders and tits were bruised from aggressive fondling and nibbling. But that was nothing compared to the numbing, throbbing, overstretched feeling between her thighs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wasn't sure if she could walk properly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smoothed down her nightdress as best she could...trying hard to hide the tears...and entered the kitchen, trying hard not to look like the latest conquest of an oversexed Mountanian playboy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>...Hard?...Oh Thor's sledgehammer...soooo hard...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe entered the kitchen in a daze. The sunlight blazing in from the garden sliced in her head like a knife. She groaned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMrs. Tibbs stood in front of the stove, stirring a pot of porridge. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning, Eliza\", she said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Huh!?

But she was in a daze all morning, and barely touched breakfast. She relived the unforgettable night in her mind...what was it that they had done!? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe watched Mrs. Tibbs help herself to a stiff brandy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Oh...right...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sweet, slightly rough, burning taste and texture of Mountanian brandy lingered on her tongue and throat...among other things which had found their way down there that night. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Fucking hell, her jaw ached...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHalf a bottle, at least... it was so delicious... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"ELIZA!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wugh!\" Eliza jerked awake from her horny daydreaming, knocking her half-eaten bowl of porridge onto the floor with a 'Crash!'. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What!? Oh! Um, y-y-yessum, Mrs. Tibbs!\" she gasped, staggering to her feet, tipping her chair over! She bent down to pick up the broken bowl on the ground. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The family is ready for breakfast! Go upstairs and bring them their morning trays while Emily and I sort out the dining-room!...Well be quick about it, girl!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEliza headed upstairs, carrying the breakfast-trays. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBreakfast trays consisted of a cup of tea, or coffee, a couple of slices of buttered toast, and a boiled egg, to wake up the various members of the family while their main breakfast was being served downstairs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last door she had to enter was that of Excalibur Vanderstorm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My lord...\" she whispered, tiptoing in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sniffed the air. The scents of sweat, love and...other things...lingered in the air. Two glasses and an almost empty bottle of brandy stood on the bedside table. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe got on her knees and pushed the tray onto Excalibur's bed. The huge beast lay on his stomach, his broad back and his ass exposed to the world. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Burrrrrrp!!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe woke up and opened his drunken eyes. His hair was a mess. He stared at his companion of the evening. He let out a knowing leer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"B-back for more?\" he slurred. A headache pulsed in his brain like sledgehammers slamming into his skull. He staggered out of bed, tripped on the covers and crashed to the ground! Eliza squealed! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mister Excalibur!\" she said. She squatted down and helped him up. His pulsating morning-wood rubbed up her leg and she let out a gasp... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nExcalibur staggered back and collapsed onto the bed, flopping over, his massive erection pointing straight up. Eliza tried not to laugh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was SO wasted! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEliza stared at the fat, thick, twitching shaft. It seemed to pulsate on its own. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe licked her lips... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Then the children, all six of them, plus Jaxxon. At the ends were Excalibur and old Lady Athena. At the far end was Kannon, seated where Fortis could keep a direct eye on him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEliza smoothed out her dress and strode forwards, carrying a large pot of coffee. She moved around the table, serving everyone. Coffee was always black - the drinker added whatever else he or she wanted, later on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I got a letter from Girl yesterday\", said Fortis. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia giggled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What!?\" he snarled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Forty! She's your SISTER! You could at least call her 'Minerva'!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJupiter and Cannius chortled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What'd she say, bro?\" said Jupiter, helping Sapphire to cut up her breakfast sausages (\"I can do it, I can do it!\" she grumbled). <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She says that...hold on...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis picked up the letter that he'd brought down from his study. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Says here...ah yeah...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis unfolded it and shook it open. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Dear Fortis, <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy love to everyone in Dynamos. The king has decided that since Cassius and I have now been married and produced our first child</i>...\"Oh I do hope they have more!\" said Athena...<i>\"...that it would be advantageous of us to make a Royal Progress and tour the kingdom as husband and wife. Prince and Princess, along with little Ares. We will be visiting all the major cities and towns, but I told Cassius that we simply have to visit Dynamos as well. I hope that you'll welcome us and host our stay in the Castle...\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awww!\" said Athena. \"What else does she say?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...\" Fortis shifted the letter in his hands. \"Um...she says...uh...Oh here we are...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"...Granny tells me that the children are doing wonderfully. Ares is looking forward to playing with his cousins again. She also tells me that Leonardo is in training to be a knight. Cassius is very interested! Please tell everyone that we're coming. It would be wonderful to meet you all again. We will be visiting at the end of the Month.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith much love, <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Princess Minerva.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooh how SWEET!\" said Eldonia, cuddling one of her husband's arms. \"Oh we HAVE to do something special, Forty!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We should use the ballroom\", said Athena, \"We haven't used that chamber for anything decent since...since...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe frowned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't remember the last time we used it for anything!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your Ladyship's thirtieth wedding anniversary\", said Mrs. Tibbs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yes! Goodness that was so long ago...\" Athena sighed. \"We MUST do it there!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright grandma, we'll sort it out\", said Fortis. He got up. \"Jaxxon, Leonardo! Time for your training. Kannon, I want you in the stables mucking out with Dimitri!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not working with some stupid Vladian bastard!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Boy that Vladian bastard has more manners than you do! Maybe while you're there, something more than horseshit might rub off onto you!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe men laughed. Athena scowled. \"Fortis! No language like that in front of the girls!\" she scolded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes ma'am\", said Fortis, apologetically. \"Now hop to it!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm going to have a look at the ballroom...\" said Eldonia. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdmittedly, she'd never given the huge chamber much thought. They never ever used it. Athena followed her, while the children went upstairs to play in the nursery. </span></div></div>",

And very dark. She moved across the floor and drew back curtains and opened shutters, to reveal a huge ballroom, with a polished wood floor, a gallery, staircases, and a towering ceiling, twenty feet high! Eldonia whistled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's the musicians' gallery!\" Athena said, pointing to a balcony at the far end, with a pair of staircases going up. \"The stage here is for tables and chairs. And then there's benches around the sides, a fireplace over here by the doors, and then chandeliers up above...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What an amazing room!\" said Eldonia. She'd never come in here. The family had never had a reason to use the ballroom. Towering windows with leadlight glass let in multicoloured lightbeams that splashed a rainbow across the floor, and cobwebs and dust were everywhere. Furniture was covered by old bedsheets. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Imagine what this must be like at night...\" Eldonia mused. \"Candlelight and a fire burning, music, full of people dancing and drinking and eating...talking...Oh wow it must be beautiful!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We shall have a grand ball here!\" said Athena. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia hurried to the walls. Portraits hung in handsome frames. She recognised one of the three Vanderstorm boys, and another with Minerva on her own. She paused in front of a portrait of a stern-looking older man with grey hair, muttonchops and a beard. He looked like an old soldier. At his side, a tall, slender woman with greying brown hair. They stood arm-in-arm together. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was my husband\", said Athena. \"We had that painted a couple of years before he died\". She blushed, \"Doesn't he look handsome?\" she whispered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He looks rough!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAthena laughed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He might look like a savage, but he was a wonderful husband! 'Athena', he said, 'with you, this grand family will grow and prosper forever'\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awww how sweet!\" said Eldonia. Athena laughed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now bless him, he lies in the great mausoleum in the castle grounds. Along with his firstborn son and his wife. One day, I will join him there\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh not before the ball you won't! This room is perfect! I'll ask Mrs. Tibbs to get the girls to clean it up before Minerva and the prince arrive!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sure that you will!\" Athena said smiling. </span></div></div>",

She smiled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're doing very well, Leonardo!\" she called out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, grandma...I think...\" he said. He dismounted and picked up the lance and climbed back onto his horse. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nArchery, swordplay and wrestling, Leo was excellent. But he had yet to master the art of riding a horse.

Alright, here we go...and around...and keep going...come on!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeo turned and kept riding.

He got up and ran after the horse. He saw Dimitri sprinting behind him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the heck did you do that for you idiot boy!?\" Fortis shouted. He grabbed the hose and soothed it with a stroking hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It wasn't me!\" Dimitri panted, \"That new boy! He hit the horse's hoof with his shovel when he was cleaning the stable-block! It ran out before I could catch it!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis grumbled. \"C'mon Vortex!\" he snapped, taking his horse by the reins and leading it back to the stables. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeo galloped past, even faster, now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi pops! Bye, pops!\" he shouted. \"This is kinda fun!...WOAH! Easy there!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeo yelped and flew off the horse, landing in the pond near the apple-tree in the middle of the garden. Athena laughed and hurried over to help her great-grandson out of the water. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You better come inside and wash up!\" she said. Fortis grabbed the other horse by the reins, and led them both back to the stables... </span></div></div>",

She smiled at him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww look at you! I need your help to get something down from the attic!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure grandma! What is it?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll need to come with you\", she said. Athena headed upstairs, her grandson following him. Jupiter sneezed. It was very dusty up here. He held a lamp in one hand. Athena pointed to a large, old trunk near the head of the stairs. It looked very dusty. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's that?\" he asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Take it downstairs and put it in my bedroom\", Athena said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure grandma...here's the lamp...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAthena held the lamp, and Jupiter got down on his knees. He hoisted the trunk up in his arms. The trunk itself was fairly heavy, but he could tell that whatever was inside didn't seem to be much. He carried it downstairs and into his grandmother's bedroom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's in this thing?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAthena took out a key from a drawer in her dressing-table. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The family jewels!\" she said, approaching the chest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought that's what us boys have, grandma!\" said Fortis, coming in with his wife. \"What's going on?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Boys!\" Athena sighed. Eldonia giggled. \"What's in there, grandma?' she asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAthena lifted the lid on the trunk, and shook off some old linen sheets. Then, she reached in and pulled out beautiful glittering sets of jewellery. Eldonia gasped! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh wow!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAthena held up a glittering white gold and diamond tiara, with matching earrings and necklace, some rings, a brooch, a few pins and other assorted jewellery. They gleamed and sparkled in the candlelight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gran they're so pretty!\" said Eldonia. \"I didn't know you had so much!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So much?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I mean, along with all the other jewels you have...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Other!? Girl! Those aren't jewels!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Aren't they?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Certainly not! They're fake! They're all glass! I'd never wear anything but the best for a really special occasion!\" she chided. \"I wear costume jewellery most of time! But Minerva's coming, and we have a royal visit!...And I expect ALL OF YOU to look your best!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey grandma, can I go naked?\" Excalibur shouted from the hallway. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"CERTAINLY NOT!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You said look my best...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia squealed with laughter and Fortis chuckled. Jupiter sniggered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope you'll let me wear some of that, grandma!\" said Eldonia. She picked up some of the jewellery and examined it. Her heart was set on a beautiful sapphire brooch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Some of this will go to you when I am gone\", said Athena. \"And some will go to Minerva. And some will go to the girls\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh grandma, I was gonna have somethin' special made for the girls...when they're old enough\", said Fortis. \"I was gonna have jewellery made for them!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Forty you're so sweet!\" said Eldonia. \"But they should have something special from their great-grandmother...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia lifted up the glittering diamond tiara. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh it's so beautiful...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was a wedding-present from YOUR great-grandmother, when I was married\", said Athena, staring at Fortis and Jupiter. \"Isn't it stunning?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis picked up the tiara and carefully put it on his wife's head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's too glittery for me!\" Eldonia said. \"But it's very pretty!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can wear the necklace!\" said Athena. \"I'll wear the tiara\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey uh, there's nothin' else in there, is there? You ain't got like a diamond-studded cock-ring or somethin'...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"EXCALIBUR!

He sat down in his chair by the fire and took up a book to read. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomeone knocked on the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMrs. Tibbs entered. She curtsied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah! Mrs. Tibbs. How are the preparations?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're going very well, my lord! I have a visitor!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis frowned and stared at the towering longcase clock standing against the wall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Visitor? NOW?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes sir!

And perhaps bring up some sandwiches and something hot to drink!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes m'lord! Right away...in here!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA man about five feet, nine inches entered, removed a feathered cap, and bowed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eventide to thee, Good Master Vanderstorm!\" said the man, in a quaint, old-fashioned manner of speech. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good evening, Eldred\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am not Eldred. I am Isaiah. Eldred my father is not with us any longer...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He is to the clouds, my lord\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He...Oh! Oh I'm sorry...I liked Eldred...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And he you, my lord. We recieved thy missive as left to us in our usual camping grounds, at the far end of thy estate, my lord\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, yes, quite right...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMrs. Tibbs entered with sandwiches and hot chocolate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks Mrs. Tibbs, just here in front of the fire...Sit down, Isaiah\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man sat down, and helped himself to the hot chocolate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope the rest of your troupe...gang...family...band...whatever! Is um...is alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very much, my lord! And we have considered your message. I come to ask for more information\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah sure...My sister the Crown Princess and her husband will be visiting here in a week. We wondered if you would agree to provide some of the entertainment for the ball and banquet that we have\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Indeed, your lordship?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh you know! Music, fire-breathing, sword-swallowing, knife-throwing! Stuff like that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man blushed. \"Thou thinkst our skills are so high?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well aren't they?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We aim to please his lordship, who hath shown us such kindness. It would be our honour to entertain at thy gathering. But my brethren and I ask what compensation?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, free food and drink. And whatever charity we can provide\", Fortis said. He knew that the Valleyans lived on casual work and charitable donations. They mostly lived off the land. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I shall hold counsel with my brethren and sisters\", said the leader of the troupe. He got up and bowed. Fortis nodded. \"Alright Isaiah. You come back sometime within this week to let me know what you decide on, okay?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsaiah nodded. \"I will, my lord. Good evening!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Goodnight\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Forty! What do you think!?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia entered the library. She wore a glittering, V-shaped diamond necklace, that ended in a beautiful pendant shaped like a star, that nestled between her generous breasts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...oh...oh my...Oh that's very pretty...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You think so!?\" she gasped, and hurried up to him, standing before him and staring up. Fortis stared down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah. Very nice. And the necklace ain't bad, either...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"FORTY!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis laughed and hugged his wife. \"Nah you look pretty, woman! Move back! Go on!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia took a few steps back. Fortis nodded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's pretty...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe moved forwards and lifted her up and into his arms. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're pretty\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe kissed her and she squealed. She hugged him back, her arms wrapping around his neck, chest and shoulders, feeling his hot breath on her cheek. She sniffed and kissed him and squeezed him. Or squeezed him as best as she could...which was nowhere near as best as Fortis could, giving his wife a spine-crushing hug! </span></div></div>",

He pulled on a pair of breeches and then a tunic and doublet. He tied the red and gold sash of his knightly order around his shoulders and torso and then opened a cabinet in the wall, to take out his medals and decorations, which he pinned to his sash and tunic. He wrapped a belt around his waist and buckled it in place, before selecting a gleaming ceremonial sword. He hooked it in place and stared at himself in the mirror. He sighed. Something was missing... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomeone knocked at his door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come in!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia glided in, wearing a sky-blue, floor-length ball-gown, dripping with diamonds and gold and sapphires. She was wearing that moon-and-stars necklace with the pendant at the end that sat so comfortably between her breasts. Fortis cleared his throat. He nodded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You look very nice\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia blushed. She turned around and smiled. \"I tried to wear grandma's tiara, but it doesn't fit\", she said. \"So she'll wear it instead\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I feel all weird!\" said Fortis. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia smiled.

But it's not complete!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia hurried to her husband's wardrobe and peeked inside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about...No...Oooh!...No!...Oooh!

She threw the garment in the air and caught it, wrapping the long cloak around her husband's back, arms and chest. She reached up on tip-toes to do up the gold clasp and chain at the front. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know...It's too red!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh alright fine!\" she said. She turned the cloak inside out, so that the black velvet was on the outside and the red silk was inside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There! Oooh you look <i>adooorable!</i>\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis shuddered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've never been called adorable?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not by you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you <i>are!</i>\" she said. \"Oh I'm gonna go wear my red ballgown instead!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis groaned. <b>WOMEN!! </b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You look fine!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No no no! You're dressed in red and black and gold, and so I'm going to wear that wine-coloured one that I have...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Doesn't that mean you'll have to change your jewellery as well!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh gosh you're right!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"DAMN IT!!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia giggled. \"Don't worry darling! I won't delay you!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis looked at his watch. He hoped not! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the end of the corridor emerged a vision of silver and white. Athena sparkled like a diamond. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis whistled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why Fortis!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You look nice, grandma\", he said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I do hope so! I haven't worn this gown since your parents' wedding! Do I look alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, grandma, just fine...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excellent!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the end of the corridor to the left, another door opened and the two guests of honor emerged. Fortis smiled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Weeeell...Hello, girl...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinerva giggled. \"Foooorty!\" she squealed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis lumbered over and stared down at his sister. \"You are so...damn...cute!\" he kissed her between words. Behind his sister, Cassius emerged. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lord Vanderstorm\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your Royal Highness\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two men shook hands. Fortis noticed his sister's belly, full and pregnant. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Been busy, huh?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...duty calls...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I see...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Foooorty, don't be that way!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi Uckle Forty!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis got down to greet his nephew. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well Ares! Look at you!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooooh! Sword papa! Sword!\" Ares squeaked, trying to pull the heavy ceremonial sword out of the scabbard strapped to Fortis's waist. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Careful son!\" said Cassius. Fortis got up and whipped the sword out! The blade whistled past the tyke's head, whipping off a tuft of hair! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wooooooooooooooooooow!!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Forty! Do be careful!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Relaaaax girly! I wouldn't wanna hurt the next heir to the kingdom, would I?\" he asked. He kissed his nephew on the head. \"Go on, kid! Go play with your cousins...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay...Tunder! Gabbywell! Awez wanna play hideyseek!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis and Minerva giggled as they watched the toddler rush away to find his cousins. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the family assembled, they headed downstairs. Eldonia put her arm around her husband's. Athena went down with Lord VonGewalt, and the three bachelors of the family followed behind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that ALL you're wearing?\" said Jupiter, noticing Excalibur's bare chest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"GO UPSTAIRS AND GET DRESSED AT ONCE!\" Athena snapped. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awwwwww...But grandma...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"UP!\" she barked, striking him on the buttocks with her walking-stick. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alriiiiight...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do I look, papa?\" said Leo, sliding down the railing. He wore black and white, and had a dagger on his side. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very nice, son\", said Fortis. He brushed his son's hair back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Papa! LEAVE IT! I spent...Oh great now I gotta do it again...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Trying to impress a girl?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...Ophelia's gonna be here ain't she?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HAH! She's tooooo old for you, son!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So? She's cute...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh. The boy knows what he likes...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fortis don't encourage him!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMrs. Tibbs opened the front door to the first guests. Lord and Lady DeJaeger and their dasughter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi papa!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBastion DeJaeger smiled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jaxxon. You behaving yourself?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's been a darling\", said Eldonia. She curtsied. \"My lord\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBastion bowed. \"Ma'am. Thank you so much for the invitation. Fortis\", he added. Fortis nodded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKarenina DeJaeger was dressed in a similar, wine-red dress, her dark brown hair flowing down her back, done up in bunches and curls. A gold amulet seemed well-protected in the crevice between her bountiful bosom. Something not lost on the younger members of the Vanderstorm family. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well hello there\", said Excalibur. She blushed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Master Excalibur\", she whispered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You and me, later\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh drop dead!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone laughed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cal, you gonna have a looong way to go before you get her\", said Fortis. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You just wait\", said Excalibur to his cousin. \"I will...I'll get her...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis sighed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"COUSIN FORTIS!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis looked up and smiled at Wolfgang Vanderstorm and his wife Vesta. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eldonia darrrling!\" said Vesta. She hugged her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Grandma\", said Wolfgang, kissing his grandmother on the cheek. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HEY LEO!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChampion Vanderstorm and his little sister Astril raced past everyone and sprinted upstairs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"CHAMPION! ASTRIL!! COME BACK HERE!\" Wolfgang shouted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis son and daughter skulked back downstairs, looking very embarrassed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT DO YOU SAY?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello Uncle Fortis, Aunt Eldonia\", said Champion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good boy. And...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Grandma...Uncle Excalibur, Uncle Jupiter, Uncle Cannius\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AND?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello Aunt Minerva, Uncle Cassius, sir\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And DON'T YOU FORGET IT!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No sir!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, upstairs with you!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two children headed upstairs, looking very embarrassed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They grow up so fast...\" said Vesta, sighing. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Before long, the entire foyer and parlour were crowded with people. Athena moved between the crowds, shaking hands and hugging. She smiled and waved. The old woman knew almost everyone there. At least, everyone worth knowing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe children of old friends had now grown up. What were once toddlers and youngsters were now glamorous daughters of the aristocracy, or steaming muscular hunks who had transformed themselves into guards, warriors, soldiers, knights, sailors, loggers, blacksmiths, masons, miners, professional jousting-challengers... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA gong sounded. Eldonia stood in the corridor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My lords, ladies and gentlemen, guests of honour, dinner is...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They ain't gonna see you down there, lady!\" Fortis grunted. He hoisted his wife up onto his broad shoulders. Everyone laughed. She squealed and giggled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dinner is served in the dining-hall! Forty put me DOWN!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore laughter. Everyone started heading towards the dining-hall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe usual central table had been moved. It was now up against the far wall, closest to the kitchens. Several long tables had been set up, perpendicular to the head table, and everyone took their seats. Close friends and guests of honour sat up on the high table. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When's the baby due?\" Fortis asked his sister, rubbing her pregnant belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not for another three months!\" Minerva said. \"Ares is all excited about another baby brother!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is it going to be a boy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We hope so!\" said Minerva. \"Don't we, Cassie?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassius nodded. \"Absolutely. Ares says once we make him a little brother to play with, we can have all the girls we want!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Champion's growing up fast!\" said Fortis. \"How old is he now, Wolfgang?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He is...fourteen! And his sister's ten. How old is Leo now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nine\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He doesn't LOOK like he's nine!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, he grows up fast!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He sure does. Champion will be my Squire soon. And once he's finished his training there, I'm enrolling him in the next knighting ceremony! And he'll be SIR Champion Vanderstorm!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I'm sure the girls will like that!\" said Minerva. \"Sir CHAMPION...WOLFGANG!...Vanderstorm!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone laughed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey girl, your boy's gonna be the most eligible bachelor on this table!\" said Fortis. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HEY!\" Excalibur shouted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"His Royal Highness, Crown Prince Ares!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Does he have a second name?\" Eldonia asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ares Dominus VanDraconis!\" said Cassius. \"Dominus was one of my ancestors. I like it. It's a good, strong name...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not Cassius?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It sounds too cute!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes it does!\" said Minerva, and gave her husband a kiss. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCourses of food were brought out to great applause. Peacock pie! Roast venison, venison pasties, roast goose, smoked salmon, suckling pig, bread rolls, sausages, steaks, pies and cakes! Mrs. Tibbs stood at the doorway that led down the corridor to the kitchen, as her maids filed past her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mrs. Tibbs, our resident housekeeper and cook!\" Fortis shouted. Everyone applauded. She waved her hands, and the housemaids exited from the kitchen, each one carrying a platter, which they paraded around the room, before putting on the tables. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Boy we had to go huntin' for so damn long to hit those deer!\" said Excalibur. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who hit what deer?\" Fortis said. \"Leo shot it from the North Tower! You didn't kill anything!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Upstart little kid showin' off in front of his uncle...\" Excalibur grumbled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis chuckled. \"Hey, the kid's a good shot, okay?\" he said. \"Relax!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong?\" Eldonia whispered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think Excalibur's getting a little bit of an inferiority complex going...\" Fortis whispered back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I'm sure that'll change once we get out into the ballroom! He'll probably be showing off all night!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dunno about that, lady. I don't ever remember Excalibur being someone who could DANCE\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He knows how to play the horizontal two-step...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah and that's about it!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia giggled. \"Sweetie! Don't be so mean!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, trumpets flourished! Everyone turned to watch as Valleyan performers entered the dining-hall! They tumbled, juggled, threw, tossed, caught, blew fire, and swung through the air on the heavy, oak rafters in the ceiling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooooh!\" said Minerva. \"How wonderful!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne acrobat flew over the head table, sprinkling flowers everywhere! People laughed and applauded loudly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter two hours of feasting and drinking, with everyone fed and watered sufficiently for the rest of the night, and some perhaps a little too sufficiently watered, the guests sauntered, swaggered or staggered into the ballroom at the end of the corridor. Lady Athena opened the huge double doors and everyone filed in. Up in the musicians' gallery, a troupe of minstrels played a flourish as everyone entered. They had violins and trumpets, cellos, double basses, guitars, drums and even a hurdy-gurdy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perhaps we can start with something slow!\" said Athena. \"So we don't have any...digestive incidents on the dance-floor. Perhaps a waltz...\" </span></div></div>",

You should mingle more!\" said Athena as everyone spread out around the ballroom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A woman's place is beside her husband!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not all the time!\" Athena snapped. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Naw gramma. Sometimes, a woman's place is on top of her husband!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia squeaked and giggled. Fortis wrapped an arm around his wife and squeezed her affectionately. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Forty! I don't know half of these people!\" she said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well! You know the other half...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah but...well like...who's that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pointed to a tall, slim, youngish-looking man with short brown hair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's Kovan Van Dien. He's the jousting master of that boarding-school at the edge of the county...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And who's...THAT!?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pointed now to a tall, burly figure with long, dirty blond hair that went down to his shoulders, pulled back into a sort of rough ponytail. The man looked old. Fifty or sixty at least, and his hair was starting to whiten up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh!\" said Fortis. He waved a hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man grunted and turned around. Eldonia flinched! The man had one eye missing, half a leg gone and what she could see of his flesh was swathed in tattoos. He looked like half his mouth was devoid of teeth! He limped over on his peg-leg and crutch. He held a hip-flask in one hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Evening, Cap'n!\" said Fortis. He gave a salute out of habit. The older man grunted and gave a drunken salute in reply. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't know you were coming!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yurr gramma done invited me...*hic!*\" the grizzled old man slurred. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sweetheart, this is Captain Wolfried Maxillian\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe captain frowned. \"Whussatcher sayin', young Forty? Who awn earth is THIS fine lady...!?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Captain, this is my wife. Lady...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WIFE!? Hot damn! Ain't no WIFE! Cute, purdy thing like you! All young an'...Mmmm! Tell me, he your papa ain't he? Big ol' boy like him...you too young for him! Hain'tcha?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why captain!\" said Eldonia, giggling. \"Oh I think I like him!\" she whispered to Fortis. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only because he thinks you're young and cute...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you don't!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure I do!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe captain grasped Eldonia's hand and gave it a kiss. She blushed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why thank you, captain!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ma'am...AH!\" he cried out, when he saw Leonardo and his friends enter the ballroom. Fortis chuckled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be scared, kids!\" he called out, \"He ain't gonna hurtcha! He just acts tough...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia turned when she heard screams and squeals emanating from one of the doorways into the ballroom. Obviously, something very fascinating to the female sex had just made quite an entrance!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehehe weeeell...what's your name, sweetie?...Uh-huh? Yeah? You, me, later. But right now...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia watched as a towering hunk lumbered through the ballroom. He was wearing almost nothing but a pair of breeches, boots and a long cloak, his bare torso, chest and arms open for all to see...and touch, by the look of things. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe minstrel band up in the gallery changed tunes. Partners took up hands. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe average height-difference between a Mountanian man and woman was considerable. But they still found ways to pair off and dance. But Eldonia had never expected to see what she did. This new stranger was dancing a slow tango with two girls at once! One in each arm. She figured when a guy was THAT big...well...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned to her own husband and they moved onto the dance-floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who is that!?\" she hissed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pointed. Fortis swung his wife around to look. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's got a dagger in his teeth!\" she squealed, feeling a little hot and bothered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! Romulus Vandenburg! His grandpa's Lord Vandenburg. They live at Ravensheart Hall. That estate in the next county...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is it that big, black house with the ivy all over it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's the one!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would you LOOK at him!?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia squealed and tripped over! She turned around and stared at Excalibur. He looked incredibly unhappy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just...LOOK AT HIM!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I aaaam...\" said Eldonia. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRomulus Maximilian Vandenburg was a specimen and a half. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEasily Fortis's height, he looked just as, if not even more intimidating. Broad-chested with huge shoulders, sliced abs, huge arms that bulged and flexed, tanned skin, an angular jaw and body, a face that was unshaved for at least two or three days, and longish, almost shoulder-length brown hair. When he moved, his cloak whipped up, revealing tattoos on his back. His name, in huge gothic letters, what looked like a mountain, and a snake or a dragon on top of it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia leaned against her husband. She could feel her legs trembling a bit... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe music stopped. Romulus left the two girls he was dancing with, tottering and swaying on the lingering memory of his presence, before he lumbered across the hall. He stood in front of Fortis and bowed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lord Vanderstorm, sir...\" he said. His voice was deep and heavy. He looked to be in his late twenties. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis nodded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Master Romulus\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My grandfather sends his apologies but he wasn't able to make it. He said I could come in his place, sir\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's quite alright\", said Fortis. \"Romulus, this is my wife...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hiiii!\" said Eldonia, blushing a bit. Romulus bowed, grasped her hand and kissed it. She gasped! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh he is wonderful!\" she said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nExcalibur snorted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think someone's jealous...\" she whispered at her husband. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am NOT!\" said Fortis. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not YOU!...\" she pointed to Excalibur, who looked about ready to punch Romulus in the face! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis chuckled and elbowed his cousin in the ribs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Feeling a bit outclassed, cousin?\" he asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am NOT!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Suuuuuure Cal, sure...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh shut UP Fortis!\" Excalibur grumbled, and went off to find a drink. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinerva squeaked as her cousin shoved her aside and lumbered past! She stared at her brother with a half-angry, half-confused look on her face! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ignore him!\" said Fortis, taking his sister by the arm. \"He's just feeling inadequate!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've never heard that word being used to describe a Vanderstorm boy before...\" said Minerva. Eldonia erupted into giggles. She struggled to stop laughing, and then briefly explained the situation to her sister-in-law, who turned bright red and struggled not to laugh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Eldonia turned around...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Whump!!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe slammed into something fleshy and meaty. She squeaked and backed away! She looked up, brushing her hair out of her face to survey the tall, tanned, muscular form of Romulus Maximilian Vandenburg. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My lord! I'm so sorry!\" she blushed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRomulus snorted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You shouldn't ever be sorry...\" he said softly. He reached out and put a hand on her shoulder. His voice had a heavy, Barry-Whitesque tone to it. She gasped, feeling her innards quiver... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"T-thank you...\" she said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRomulus was...<i>cute</i>...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was so big and brutish...covered in tattoos...He had a sort of caveman appeal... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell...Forty did TOO!...but...Forty had to tone it down a bit...he had kids now...and it didn't do for the youngsters to see their papa acting like an animal...something that Eldonia certainly missed... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would you like to dance?\" Romulus asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...um...y-yeah!\" she said. \"Sure!\" she added. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRomulus put one arm on her shoulder, and then slipped under her armpit to rest on her back. Eldonia held out her other arm and he grabbed it firmly. She reached up and felt his shoulder...man he was tall! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead, her hand slipped down...he had a nice ass... But probably not as nice as Fortis's...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTogether, they moved out onto the dance-floor in a slow waltz. Eldonia felt her body being moved around...side...to side...in a slow, dreamy, spinning circle. Suddenly, she felt something against her forehead...something moist and wet...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, this whole dreamscape thing disappeared! She felt herself being pulled back! This was followed by a heavy, meaty thudding sound! Violins scraped and the music stopped suddenly! Eldonia spun around to see Romulus with a hand to the side of his mouth. His lip was bleeding! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You dare to take advantage of my hospitality in this way?\" Fortis asked, calmly, but loud enough for everyone to hear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fortis!\" said Eldonia. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stay out this, lady!\" Fortis rumbled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crowd watched. But like his sister, the wife of Fortis Vanderstorm had learned toughness. It was something she had to learn when she lived in a household run by big, burly menfolk all the time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Forty! Don't be like this!\" she said, \"Lord Romulus was just being friendly!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Asking for a dance is being friendly. Giving you a kiss in public like that!?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia sighed. Mountain men and their jealousies...they could be a huge turn-on, or they could be a gigantic pain in the ass... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinerva stepped forwards, and put her arms around her brother. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Forty...\" she whispered. \"You don't have to defend everyone...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm NOT defending <i>everyone</i>...\" Fortis rumbled. \"...just trying to keep the hands of that filthy horndog off my WIFE!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaughter rippled through the ballroom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fortis, you're being silly!\" said Minerva. \"And Lord Romulus is a perfectly nice person! But I really think he should keep his attentions reserved to UNmarried women...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMurmurs of agreement rolled around the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...shake hands and can we PLEASE go back to the party?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis sighed and shook Romulus's hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll speak to you later...\" Fortis rumbled. \"Eldonia!\" he snapped. \"Here!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia hurried to her husband's side. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's dance and forget about all this crap...\" </span></div></div>",

She'd been pregnant for nearly her full term, now. She was too full-up to actually dance, but she kept her husband company between rounds, and made conversation with the locals. Many of whom had commented on her current state, and her presumed addition to the royal family which grew therein. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I don't feel so good!\" Minerva gasped. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...well I...\" she gasped. She gritted her teeth. \"Oh gosh!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassius turned around. He saw all the men doing a traditional Mountanian sword-dance, while the women clapped and cheered. Others swarmed around bottles of wine or slices of bread and butter and oil, sweet buns and other desserts and snacks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you feeling unwell?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I think it's coming!\" Minerva gasped. She felt the same tightness, cramping and discomfort that she had when Ares was born. \"Cassius I think it's coming! It's coming now!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Coming now!? Oh gosh...um...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"F-find my grandmother!...And Fortis! And...And...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis edged his way through the dancing crowds. He stared around, standing head-and-shoulders above most of the others there. He frowned when he spotted his sister lying on one of the benches. He strode over and stared down at her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Girl, what are you doin' lyin' down when you should be sitting up entertaining people with your...what's wrong?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinerva gasped and gritted her teeth. \"F-forty! Y-you're about to have another niece or nephew!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh-huh...WHAT!?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis's last word exploded through the room like a bomb going off! The valleyan minstrels stopped their playing and everyone turned to watch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh gosh!\" Fortis spluttered. \"Hold on! C'mere girl!\" he said. He hoisted his sister into his arms. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! I'm her husband! I carry her outta here!\" Cassius started. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is MY damn castle! And I will carry her outta here!\" Fortis shouted back. Some people laughed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Forty, what's going on?\" Eldonia asked. Minerva let out a groan! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooooh...\" said Eldonia. She'd given birth to six...she knew the signs! She hurried away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mrs. Tibbs! We need towels! And hot water! And a knife! And string!...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis carried his sister upstairs and into the guestroom where she was staying with Cassius. He lowered her onto the bed and went to get some pillows. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay, sweetie!\" said Cassius, kneeling by the bed. \"It's just a baby!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinerva gasped as another cramping contraction shot through her body! Her hands clasped onto whatever she could find with surprising strength! Fortis returned and put the pillows around her body and under her back. Mrs. Tibbs came rushing upstairs! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's alright, my lady!\" she said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, it's your...\" Cassius began. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OH SHUT UP CASSIUS THIS ISN'T THE TIME FOR PROTOCOL!\" Minerva shrieked. Fortis burst out laughing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AND YOU SHUT UP TOO!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis and Cassius both collapsed against a wall laughing. Athena and Eldonia hurried in to help! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Easy now!\" said Athena. \"Deep breaths!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinerva squealed and groaned. She gasped as her water broke!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh all you useless men get out of here!\" Athena snapped. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Grandma!\" Fortis began. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OUT!\" Athena snapped. \"You're excellent at starting it, useless when it comes to finishing it off!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mon!\" said Fortis to Cassius, \"let's get outta here before she brains us with her walking stick!\" he said. Cassius laughed and they headed outside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWord about Minerva's rapidly changing condition had spread through the party-guests. And curious folks were now sneaking upstairs to find out the latest news. In Leonardo's bedroom, some of the older boys and girls who had been allowed to stay up late, peeked outside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Papa!\" Leo asked. \"What's happening papa?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shhh!\" Fortis hissed. \"Your Aunt Minnie's having another baby, boy! You keep it quiet!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh boy!\" said Astril, hurrying out with her older brother. \"We gonna have another cousin, Champion!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where's Ares?\" Leo asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I put him to bed already\", Fortis said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA loud groan echoed from the birth chamber. And then, silence. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone started whispering when they heard a loud wailing sound coming from within. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMrs. Tibbs opened the bedroom door. She looked exhausted! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How is it?\" Fortis asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your sister must REST, my lord!\" she said. \"BUT...she is delivered!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank goodness!\" said Cassius. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your Royal Highness, you are the proud father of two healthy, baby boys\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She had another boy!? Oh wow!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMrs. Tibbs nodded. \"What will you call him?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh gosh...I dunno yet. We thought we were going to get a girl this time...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, everyone filed into the bedroom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinerva sat, bolstered up in bed. She looked very tired, but happy. In her arms was a sizable bundle wrapped in white cloth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Forty...come and say hello to your new nephew...\" she whispered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis knelt down and took the little fellow in his arms. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey there you little rascal...Aren't you cute, huh? You're a little prince, aren't you? Yes you are! And you're a cute little rascal ain'tcha?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassius smiled down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Forty, give the baby to Cassius...\" Minerva whispered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, people crowded around the bed and the baby. The wide-eyed youngster stared at everyone, and everyone stared at him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are we going to do with it?\" Mrs. Tibbs asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We can put him in Leonardo's old crib\", said Fortis. \"It's in the nursery...\" </span></div></div>",

Behind Fortis, Athena approached, holding a bottle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Darling, open this for me\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis held the bottle. It was very large and heavy, and made of dark glass. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's this, grandma?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A bottle of champagne! Your great-great-grandfather bought this so long ago, I don't remember when he got it! He told your grandfather, it was to be opened on the day that a future king was born into our family!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're late, grandma, we already have one future king\", said Jupiter, \"We have Ares, remember?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh!\" Athena gasped, and blushed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone laughed and Athena grinned, embarrassed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Never mind, grandma!\" said Fortis. \"We'll open it anyway, and toast to the new prince!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone cheered. Fortis started opening the wire cage around the top of the bottle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Fortis! You don't have any sense of occasion!\" said Athena, angrily. \"Don't pop it open! Do it properly!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I AM doing it properly!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Poppycock!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore anyone could stop her, Athena had drawn out her grandson's dress-sword from the scabbard tied around his waist! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!\" said Fortis, \"Gran, careful with that thing! It's sharp!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Use this!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...for what, a bottle-opener?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAthena stared at Fortis. \"You've never opened a bottle with a sword?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...no\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do they teach you at those stupid military academies...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sheathed her grandson's sword, and pulled out a handsome, jeweled dagger, a present from her husband, more years ago than she wished to admit. She turned the cold bottle of champagne around in her hands, holding it up to the light. She nodded. Everyone watched...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tapped the bottle with the blunt, back edge of the dagger, running it up and down the neck, along the seam that joined the two halves of the bottle when it was made. She held the bottle out, aiming it towards a relatively empty part of the ballroom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Shiiiiiing! <b>BANG!!</b> Pop!! </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe knife-blade slid up the bottle-neck, striking the ridge just below the mouth! The glass exploded, shooting the cork and the bottle-lip across the room like a missile! White foam blasted out of the end, splattering onto the floor! Gasps filled the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woooooow...\" someone said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone burst into applause! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Daaaaamn!\" said Excalibur. \"How come I don't know how to do that!?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not as cool as grandma is\", said Jupiter. He bent down and picked up the cork and broken bottle-neck, which had been split from the rest of the container in a clean break. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was great, grandma!\" said Eldonia. \"Can you teach me how to do that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One day, yes\", said Athena. \"Now! Glasses everyone! Quick, before this all spills out!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone cheered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's the boy's name?\" Venatarius asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...We...haven't thought of one yet...\" said Cassius, blushing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No name!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, no...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I like Olympus!\" said Eldonia. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds...strong...and...sexy...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's a kid!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He won't always be a kid...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone laughed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Prince Olympus Van Draconis...\" Cassius said. \"I dunno...It seems rather long...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh we'll think about that another time!\" said Fortis. \"Everyone, hold out your glasses!\" he said, and started filling them with champagne. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Outside, a storm raged. The wind wailed and shrieked and howled through the trees like a thousand sobbing babies. Rain poured down outside. Wind blasted down the chimney and curled in the smoke-box. The fire in the grate roared and crackled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe heavy red curtains were drawn, the windows were shuttered, bolted and closed. The fire in the grate was roaring and hot. Thick rugs covered the floors and Fortis wore his red and gold nightgown over his old nightshirt, the one that was really tight and starting to rip at the seams. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had ensured that everyone else was settled in for the night. He'd seen personally to it that his grandmother had everything she needed. A hot water bottler, her nightgown, a hot fire, and a huge mug of hot chocolate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis stripped off his nightgown and hung it on a stand. He climbed into bed and drew the curtains around it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bed was enormous. Built from beams that were made up of entire oak-tree trunks, carved and stained and slotted together, it was well-capable of holding his gigantic frame. The Vanderstorm marriage-bed had never moved from its position in the Master Bedroom. But countless moving had been done...<i>within its sheets</i>... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvery single tryst that Fortis had enjoyed with his wife that ever produced a child had happened here. Or, almost every one. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis left one curtain half-open, to let in the heat and some of the light from the fireplace. He felt the two copper hot-water bottles that were in bed with him, wrapped up in neatly-knitted wool cosies. He put one down by his feet, and wrapped a huge arm around another one. He lay there on his back, spread out...and soon fell asleep. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis never shared a bed with his wife. At least, not when they weren't enjoying each other's company. It just wasn't the done thing. Sharing beds was what people in poorer houses did, who couldn't afford beds for each person! Besides, girls needed their privacy. Fortis knew this from his sister. And he had no desire to share the master's chamber with bottles of scent, powder, makeup, and earrings! Eugh... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNevertheless, sometimes he left his bedroom door unlocked at nights. That way if his wife ever decided that she required companionship, she could sneak in and play... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis yawned and was soon asleep. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>A click!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis grunted. <i>Huh?</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door opened. He reached under his pillow, for a large dagger. He heard soft footsteps. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA woman! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe relaxed his hand. His lady must be lonely this night...He'd soon take care of <i>that</i>... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Papa?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis blinked. Huh!? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe curtains rustled, and Fortis rolled over to see three girls standing by his bed. Two small ones, and one slightly older. He sighed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Giiiiiirls...what are you <i>doing</i> here? You should be in bed!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is skawey, papa!!\" Emerald burbled. \"Girlies sleep with papa. Papa not get angried. Papa love girlies!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis chortled. Yeah...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooooh alright...\" he rumbled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls squeaked and crawled into bed! Fortis wrapped his arms around his daughters. Sapphire crawled onto her father's torso and laid down on her belly, smiling at him. Her two little sisters curled up in the shapely crooks of their father's arms, their forms wrapping around his massive biceps, their heads resting on his broad, muscular shoulders.  Fortis was pinned down by pint-sized succubi, who were intent on snuggling their prey into submission. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis yawned and relaxed back into the mattresses. He was about to doze off, when...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Nibble!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Waugh!\" he gasped, jerking upwards. Something was chewing on his ear! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Papa not gonna hurted Cindamon!?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the heck!?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis shifted. In the muted light from the fire, he saw a fat, fawn-coloured bunny curled up on his pillows. It playfully nibbled on his right earlobe. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gaugh! Geddoffame!!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nooo!!\" the girls squeaked. \"Papa not hurted Cindamon!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis felt something else on his other side. He groaned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNutmeg and Cinnamon, his daughters' two pet rabbits. He might've known! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was about to say something like \"No pets in bed!\", but he wasn't in the mood to have a crying-fest on his hands. He stroked the rabbits and tried to get back to sleep. His daughters cuddled up around him... <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She smiled when she watched her husband's huge arms flex and bulge as he carried them out of the castle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe knew that Fortis COULD get the servants to carry the trunks, but then what was the point? It wouldn't be a workout, otherwise. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nParked in the carriage-house behind Castle Vanderstorm was an impressive array of horse-drawn vehicles. Dog-carts for the hunting-dogs, gigs and traps, wagons, folding-top landaus, and, parked apart from the other vehicles... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis entered the carriage-house with a lamp. He used the flame of the lamp to light the two carriage-lamps on the sides of an enormous, red and black coach. The coach towered at least seven or eight feet high, which was still two feet shorter than the Mountanian giant. He grabbed the carriage by the shafts and dragged it physically from the building into the carriage-house yard. The stable-boys approached with horses. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're not taking a full load\", Fortis said. \"Two horses this time. Not four\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, my lord\", said Vallius, the head stable-boy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe carriage was enormous. Of the variety known as a \"Park Drag\", used for private, long-distance travel, or for public transport or the delivery of mail and packages. This particular Park Drag, painted red and black, with coats of arms on the doors, had been in the Vanderstorm family longer than Fortis could remember. The brasswork sparkled in the firelight. Fortis opened the storage-compartments under the seats and lowered the trunks into them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe coach could hold many, many people. There was space for two in the driver's seat. Space for four over the back luggage-compartment, space for another four on the roof, and space for even more people inside. It could probably have transported the entire family. Right now, it was only transporting Fortis, his son, his son's friend, and a few servants. But it was the perfect vehicle for long-haul traveling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeo and Jaxxon appeared, all ready for their journey. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright boys, inside\", Fortis said. He opened the carriage doors and Leo and Jaxx climbed in, one after the other. Koviac, Zacharia and Hermes climbed onto the roof, and sat in the back seats. Fortis stared around, making sure he had not forgotten anything. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lord Vandershtorm!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis froze. He turned. Standing in the yard was the waif, Dimitri. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you want, sirrah?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I heard that you were going on a journey\", said Dimitri, \"I thought perhaps I could come with you\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis frowned. \"Why?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have never seen anything of Fatlantis. I have never seen anything of Mountania until I left Vladia\", he said simply. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis scratched himself thoughtfully. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt would be a way to keep an eye on the boy... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Koviac!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKoviac jumped down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My lord!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll stay back and keep an eye on the womenfolk\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes sir!\" said the knight's squire firmly. He paused. \"Can't your brothers and Master Excalibur do that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I daresay. But I wouldn't trust Excalibur with a butter-knife, let alone a sword. Especially when he drinks\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes sir. I'll get my bag...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright kid, up on the back!\" Fortis said. Dimitri climbed up the back steps of the carriage and sat in the back, between Hermes and Zacharia. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside the carriage, Leo turned up the light on an oil-lamp hanging from a hook in the ceiling. Suddenly, the lamp, and the whole carriage, creaked over to one side! The lamp swung and swayed back and forth, oil sloshing inside the glass reservoir underneath the wick! Leo pulled a leather strap in the door and the window dropped down. He stuck out his head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Papa!?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis had grabbed the handholds on the sides of the carriage and hauled himself into the driver's seat, his huge bulk causing the suspension-springs to creak and flex. He sat down, grabbed the reins and flicked them firmly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yah! C'mon!\" he shouted. </span></div></div>",

Eldonia entered her grandmother-in-law's bedroom and stood by the chair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I said, do you love Fortis?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course I do! He's my grandson! Don't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah but...Sometimes I feel like I married a bull\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAthena frowned. \"A bull?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Big, strong, sexy, huurrrrghhh!...But sometimes...just sometimes...he's dumb as a post!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAthena burst out laughing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm serious!\" Eldonia said. \"I mean, look!\" she said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe opened the bedroom windows. Wind blasted inside and rain poured down outside! She slammed them shut again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHY did he leave for his trip to...where-ever!...In this weather!?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well at least he took the boy Dimitri with him!\" said Athena. \"It'll give him some time to get used to the boy. Fortis has always taken time to warm up to strangers...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh sure, grandma. He warmed up to me real fast. About nine months...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAthena sighed. \"Fortis was different then! Younger!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, and perhaps even smarter. I think all those years splitting rocks have cracked his own head wide open! He's gonna get sick out in that storm!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My dear! Fortis is very resilient! He'll do no such thing! He wouldn't dream of getting sick!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why not?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, because then it would mean lying in bed and having you fawning all over him taking care of him and...hmm...actually he might get sick after all...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia giggled. \"I'm going to check on the babies...\" she sighed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n--- --- --- --- <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermes, Zacharia, Jaxxon and Leo sat inside the carriage as it rumbled along. Fortis sat in the driver's seat, cloak over his broad shoulders, and Dimitri sitting next to him, holding a lantern. Rain poured down over them and both of them were soaked through! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How much further!?\" Dimitri shouted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Over the bridge, and then there's a village a little further on!\" Fortis shouted. \"Now hold that stupid light steady!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside the carriage, the boys and servants grumbled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why'd your pops have to take the cab-light too!? He already has the two front lamps!\" Jaxxon grumbled. \"That lamp was our only source of heat!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sure we'll be fine!\" Leonardo said. He yelped when the carriage hit a stone in the road and bounced hard! As they kept on, Fortis seemed to be urging the horses on faster and faster! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><i>Huuurrreeeeeeeeeeaaaaaaahhhh!!</i></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah!\" Leo yelped as he was thrown across the carriage, almost breaking his nose against the wall! The horses let out loud whinneys and skidded to a halt! The carriage rocked and then crashed down upon its four wheels! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What're we stopping for!?\" Hermes shouted. \"We can't be there yet! And it's freeeezing!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe carriage creaked, leaned heavily to one side, and then sprung back upright again. Leo opened a window and stuck his head out into the rain. He could see his father carrying a lamp, but couldn't see anything else. He opened the door and climbed out. Jaxxon followed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver the pouring rain, Fortis didn't hear a thing. The two boys closed the carriage door and unhooked a lamp from the front. Leonardo hoisted the lamp up into the air and shone it around. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough it was pouring down, he did notice one thing...a set of wheel-marks...what on earth... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Papa!?\" he shouted. Leo rushed forwards, with Jaxxon close behind. Then they saw what had caused Fortis to stop. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAhead of them was the bridge that Fortis had mentioned earlier. On the approach to the bridge were thick, wooden rails wedged into the earth on either side of the road, forming a crude barricade. One of the barricades had been broken through! A mess of tracks vanished beyond the light of the lantern and into the darkness... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis hurried through. The ground was wet and slippery! Down the steep embankment, Fortis could spot something at the bottom. The mangled wreckage of a carriage, half in the river. He slid down, holding onto branches of trees along the way and reached the river. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Papa!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis turned around. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"LEO DON'T YOU MOVE A STEP!\" Fortis yelled. \"It's damn slippery here! Go back to the carriage! Inside, under the back seat, there's some rope! Go and get it! NOW!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, papa!\" said Leo. \"Jaxx! Hold the lamp! I'll be right back!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeo jogged off through the rain. He was now soaked through! He opened the carriage door and lifted up the back seat. He pulled out several yards of rope and then hurried back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think he wants us to tie it to a tree or something!\" Jaxxon shouted over the rushing water. Leo wrapped the rope around the nearest tree of significant girth, and tied it off tight. He then tied the other end of the rope to a stone and threw it into the river! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis had now reached the carriage. He drew out his sword and used the heavy pommel to smash through the glass. Inside, he could see two figures. They looked like a boy, and an older woman who was probably his mother. Fortis grabbed the carriage door and tried to open it. It wouldn't budge! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn it!\" he swore. He grabbed the door in both hands, and with Herculean strength, he ripped it off its hinges and threw it into the water! The sounds of splintering wood seemed to bring the woman 'round. She screamed! Fortis ripped the windows apart and leaned in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah! Hold it, lady!\" Fortis shouted. \"Don't move nowhere!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe reached in and grabbed her. The carriage shifted in the water! She stared at the big hands reaching in for her and she grabbed them! Fortis hauled her out and then reached in for the boy who looked a lot worse for wear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is there anyone else!?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where's my coachman!?\" the woman asked. Fortis stared around. There wasn't anyone else there. Then, he saw a body half in the water. He hurried over, but a large, bleeding wound told him he was too late... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis carried the woman and her son back to his carriage, their bodies draped over his shoulders like the cloak on his back. Leo untied the rope and together with Jaxxon, they followed behind, nervous and unsure. </span></div></div>",

He didn't need some stupid piece of glass to tell him he looked good! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe left his room at the village inn and headed down the corridor. A handsome youth with brown hair sprinted past him, paused at a door and peeked in. Feminine hands snaked out, grabbed him and pulled him inside. Giggles broke out shortly afterwards. Fortis chuckled. Oh yeah. He remembered days like that...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis opened a bedroom door and entered the chamber beyond. Lying in bed was the woman he'd rescued from the carriage. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was now that he realised what a looker she was. She had beautiful, light brown, reddish hair and a rather...shapely body...She was also fast asleep. And in another bed nearby, the boy also slept, his arm in a sling. The boy looked about Leo's age. He looked young and handsome and cute, with thick, dark blond hair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman yawned. She slowly opened her eyes...her jaw dropped when her vision cleared. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTowering over her was a giant of a man, clad in a cloak and breeches...and not much else. He looked delicious. Tall, bronzed, broad, muscular and strong. He had a fine chest and enormous arms and legs, a well-formed torso and a roguish looking face. Her vision was all swimmy and blurry. The hunk bent down closer to her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked all unshaven and brutish...mmmm...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning\", said the man. He had a deep, heavy voice. He must have huge nuts. She wondered if she would be able to find out for sure? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe winced and rubbed her head, and then slowly sat up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hurgh!\" she yelped, when she realised she was naked! She stared around the room, and then spotted her clothes drying by the fire. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You had quite an adventure last night\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Adventure!? What adventure!? Who was this man!?...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn't...do...No!! No way!...But he was so cute...NO!...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDid she? </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she remembered the carriage accident. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Apollo!\" she cried out. She turned and saw the bed across the room. She got out of bed. At once, the huge hunk stopped her! She bumped into his hard chest and stared up at him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your son's had a very bad broken arm. You should let him sleep\", he said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My name is Dame Helena Excelsion. My husband is Baron Sir Zenathor Hercules Excelsion...I am sure he is thankful for your assistance\", she said softly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis glanced at the boy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Our son, Apollo\", she said. Fortis nodded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelena stared at the sexy hunk. Then, she noticed something nestling between his rippling pecs. A large, brightly-polished golden medallion. She reached up for it. She recognised it as the medallion of a knightly order. Her mouth slowly opened... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lord Sir Fortis Vanderstorm, ma'am\", said Fortis, in his usual heavy bass. She gasped! At once, she took a step back and curtsied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My lord!\" she said. Fortis bowed slightly and kissed her hand. She gasped! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHot, sexy and a gentleman...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Damn it! </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nApparently her dreams for a sultry one-night stand weren't gonna happen after all. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M-m-momma?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelena hurried across the room! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Apples! My darling! My little sweetheart!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Momma! Don't call me...OUCH!!! Watch the arm!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I'm so sorry my darling little treasure! Oooh momma's so sorry!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"MOTHER!!! You're embarrassing me in front of the Mountain Lord!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>Wham!! </b></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey pops! Is he awake!? Jaxx and I wanna...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeonardo and his best friend cowered under the gaze of the mountain lord. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...I-i-i...guess not...\" Leo said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Helena, my son, and his friend\", Fortis said. Helena turned around. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my!\" she said, looking at Leonardo. The youth was much taller than most nine-year-olds, an had a cute, boyish look to him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You ARE cute!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeo blushed and Jaxxon and Apollo burst out laughing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're gonna grow up big and strong just like your father!\" she said. \"Who is quite a catch himself...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...thanks!\" said Leo. \"Hi, I'm Leo, and this is Jaxxon\", said Leonardo. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Apollo Excelsion\", said the boy sitting in bed. He held out his left arm, since his right one was in a sling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice to meet you\", said Leo. Jaxxon nodded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where was it that you were headed, Ma'am?\" Fortis asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We were going to Regis City\", said Helena. \"My husband the Baronet operates the Mountanian Consulate in the capital of Fatlantis\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aaah yes...I thought the name sounded familiar...We'll give you a lift!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh boy!\" said Leo. \"Hey pops! Does that mean we're going to Regis City!?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YOU TWO are staying with my friend in Sugarloaf Hill...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooh alright! But both of you watch your manners! And Jaxxon, I'll have to write to your father about this...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT'D I DO!?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To see if he's alright with you coming that far south!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Oh! Sure! Pops is fine!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis nodded. Bastion DeJaeger didn't often complain about things. Fortis merely wanted to write as a matter of formality. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mon boys. Let's leave Dame Helena and her son to freshen up...\" </span></div></div>",

He remembered something about this from his geography classes. Fortis had made sure that his son knew every inch of Mountania. As a knight, it would be embarrassing for him to go on a quest and not know his own country! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two boys wandered around the square. They looked in on the local bakery, butchery, cooper, wheelwright, blacksmith, farrier, chandler, grocer, spinner, and down the road by the stream they had passed the night before, the village miller. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey saw toddlers playing in the streets. Two boys fought each other, waving sticks around, while two girls sat on a pair of wooden stools playing with rag-dolls made by their parents. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man this place is dull...\" said Leo. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You think so?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah! I mean at least back at the Castle things happen!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mostly thanks to your Uncle Excalibur...He's crazy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's NOT crazy! He's just...eccentric!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaxxon laughed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boys reached one end of the village and paused outside a large building with stables and wood-stacks out the back. Judging by all the tools, it must've belonged to a carpenter or a tree-feller or something. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man, look at all these horses!\" said Leo. He pointed to the four large horses inside the stables who were all busy munching on their hay. \"Aren't you all silky smooth!\" he said, stroking one of the horse's manes. The horse flicked its ears and snorted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Leonardo!?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeo stuck his head out of the stable to see Dimitri jogging up to him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There you are!\" the Vladian boy cried out. \"I've been runnink all over the village lookink for you! Your father said you went out for a walk!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah\", said Leo, \"Jaxx and I were bored inside the inn, and we weren't hungry enough for breakfast\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh okay\", said Dimitri. \"Hello Horsey!\" he said. He approached a large, chestnut stallion and rubbed its mane affectionately. The horse snorted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You sure like horses\", said Jaxxon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I love horses...and horses love me!\" said Dimitri. \"They're intelligent creatures...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe horse snorted and whinneyed loudly. It shook its head, flicking its mane around. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah...okay, easy horsey...\" said Dimitri. But the horse snorted loudly! It shifted around in its stall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oookay...back away slowly...\" said Jaxxon. The three boys started backing out of the stall. Leo stepped forwards to close the door in the stall when Dimitri suddenly crashed into a bucket and shovel stacked on top of an empty pile of crates! The crash of metal and wood startled the horse! It kicked violently backwards, throwing the door open! Leo was thrown onto the floor by the shock and the horse wheeled around and charged out of the stable! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no!\" Dimitri cried out. He ran after it and grabbed a set of reins! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Easy!\" he cried out. Holding the reins in one hand, he stood in front of the horse, spreading out his arms and legs, trying to stop the horse from charging! He slowly coaxed it back to the stall, leading it by the reins, when suddenly, the back door of the house opened up. A tall, half-dressed hunk with dark blond hair stepped out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!\" he shouted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh-oh...\" said Leo. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What'cha doin' on mah land!?\" the hunk shouted. He was enormous, but at the same time, he looked to be about eighteen. About seven or eight feet tall with a truly sculpted upper-body. Leo stared around. He noticed all the stacks of wood, and the axes, saws, sledgehammers and thick, iron wedges lying under the veranda outside the back door. This guy obviously did a lot of heavy work. Judging from his build, he was probably the village lumberjack! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, see we came in and  uh...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Takin' mah horses are yah!?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe huge man picked up a heavy axe and hefted it in his massive hands. Leo gulped. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey mister, we just...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don'tcha 'mister' me, you little pipsqueak! I saw that kid tryin' to make off with it! What're you two!? The diversionary squad!?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeo gulped. He stared around. He had his dagger with him, but then he realised that even with his dagger, he wouldn't be able to defeat this guy! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I SAID FUCK OFF!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen! We just wanna...WOAH!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeo ducked as the axe swung over his head! He flipped backwards and snatched up the first thing he could find...a rake. Oh perfect. He could comb the guy's hair... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HUAH!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeo ducked and swung the rake upwards! The metal shaft of the rake clanged against the axe-blade! Leo swung the rake around like a fighting-staff, spinning it around and then held it firmly, tines outwards. The bigger boy lunged forwards! Leo ducked back! He swung the rake around again, the heavy wooden shaft striking the middle of the axe-handle, sending a jolt through it! The older, bigger boy might've had height and body-weight on his side, but Leo was faster and far more agile. Fortis had insisted on teaching his son a lot more than just how to use a sword! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HURUUUGH!\" the older boy shouted, swinging his axe through the air, aiming for Leo's arm! Leo spun out of the way! Using the rake to balance himself, he threw his arm out! The claws spun around, nicking the sides of the beast's torso, drawing blood! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Leo! Let's get outta here!\" said Jaxxon. Leo nodded, but every step back he took, the older boy lunged forwards! Soon, they were out in the street, fighting and heading towards the main square! People started staring and watching, ogling at the absurd spectacle of a youth trying to take on a fully-matured Mountanian lumberjack! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh!...Hugh! Huah!\" Leo grunted, swinging the rake around, blocking each of the bigger boy's swings! Fortis, who was busy gulping down his third beer of the morning, heard the commotion outside and got up to take a closer look... </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Leo was ducking and weaving, spinning, swinging and blocking with the rake. Fortis had taught him combat of this nature in case he ever lost his sword in battle. He would still be able to render some sort of damage using a staff or a spear or...something long and hard. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like your dick?\" Excalibur had snorted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up, Cal! This is serious! No wonder you failed your knighthood...\" Fortis had said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeo continued to circle his larger opponent. Leo's size meant that speed and agility, movement and flexibility were all on his side. And, his challenger had a much heavier weapon, which tended to make it harder for him to balance! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha!...Ha!!...Hugh!!...\" Leo grunted, swinging the rake, and striking blows on the hunk's arms, torso and even his head! This last blow had left the older boy with a throbbing lump on his temple! By now, villagers had spilled into the square to watch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aren't you going to do anything?\" Jaxxon asked Lord Vanderstorm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why should I? It's good watchin'...\" Fortis said. But he spoke too soon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HUUURGGGHH!!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><i>CRACK!!</i></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe villagers gasped as Leo's rake shattered! Split right down the middle, the rake now had neither the weight, nor the length to make it a decent fighting-weapon! The older boy had struck the rake right in the middle of the shaft, the heavy axe-head snapping the rake in half like a dry twig! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone now thought that the duel or impromptu tournament would be over. And Leo dropped his rake to the ground in defeat. He was about to back away when the axe whistled over his head, brushing against his hair! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!\" he said, \"No fair!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who said anything about fair!? You stole my fucking horses! I don't call that fair!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We were just...looking!...at...them!\" Leo yelped, now dodging and weaving out of the way, \"One of them...got...spooked! And we were...just...trying...to put him...back in...the stall!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSwing after swing, Leo skirted, skipped and dodged. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, no fair!\" said Fortis. He stopped leaning against the railing outside the local inn, and started walking into the square. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop movin' around you little shit!\" the older boy shouted. \"Stand still so I can kill you! Your pappy ain't here to save your pathetic little ass! So you may as well give up!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><i>CLANG!! </i></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn axe-swing was cut off halfway through, connecting unexpectedly with something long and hard. But this time, it wasn't made of wood. The crowd hushed as the scraping of steel echoed through the square. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You defeated the kid...\" Fortis said. \"Let's see how well you do against a grown man...Huah!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis stepped in front of his challenger and swung his sword through the air, nearly slicing the man's arm off! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mon! C'mon! Move your lazy ass! This is BORING!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis swung left and right! The teenager swung the axe up and down, but the weight of the axe-head and his prolonged combat had worn away the edge of his strength! Fortis, fresh, strong and ready for a prolonged fight, wielded his sword with military expertise. His enormous arms and their equally impressive muscles well-capable of swinging and maneuvering the heavy steel blade. People watched his biceps and triceps flex and bend with every swift, potentially lethal swing. Unlike his son, Fortis was barely moving. He simply kept his opponent busy, and then blocked whatever attacks he threw back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFurious and getting more and more exhausted, the teenager raised the axe for one last, desperate swing! Fortis ducked as the axe hurtled towards him! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><i>CRACK! </i></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crowd gasped! A few women screamed! The sword broke the axe-handle clean off! The sharp axe-head whistled through the air, hitting Fortis in the face! Leo yelped! Fortis ignored the pain! He swung his sword again, tripping the boy over and, with another flourish, brought the blade to within an inch of his throat. All it would take was one thrust, and the boy's head would be decapitated faster than chopping the head off a carrot. The cocky teen gulped nervously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-okay! Y-you win! I-I'm sorry! I'm sorry I picked on the kid! I'm sorry I...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry...WHAT?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy gulped, thought quickly, and then offered: \"I-I'm sorry, sir! I...I really am! I...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"SIR!? YOU THINK I SPENT ALL THESE YEARS KICKING VLADIAN ASSHOLES AND SCUM LIKE YOU...TO BE CALLED 'SIR'!? You are talking to a military veteran and a professional warrior here, sirrah! That's 'sorry, my LORD'! to you, you little sniveling, snot-licking excuse! Now pick up that pathetic hatchet of yours and get back to your damn horses before I change my mind about not sheathing my sword through your NECK!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crowd broke into applause as the trembling bully, all the fight and bravado sucked out of him, crawled backwards on his elbows, snatched up his once-upon-a-time axe, and hurried away! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Papa! You're bleeding!\" Leo shouted, hurrying up to his father. Fortis touched a hand to his face and felt warm red blood, and a distinct stinging sensation on his cheek. The axe-blade had sliced into him when it had flown off the handle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n--- --- --- --- <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was some fightin'!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That punk gets sore at anyone. You weren't to know that. Your boy does some good fightin'. I suppose you're trainin' him to be like you, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...Aurgh!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Sorry...You oughta be proud of him...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis sat at the bar inside the inn. The bartender, used to patching up the results of tavern brawls, cleaned the wound with salt and water, and was now slowly sewing the gash together. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It'll heal soon enough, so long as you keep it clean and wash it each day with warm, salty water\", said the bartender. \"But I'm sorry, it'll leave a scar at any rate...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Does that mean he'll be disfigured for life?\" Leo gasped. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't get disfigured you little idiot!\" Fortis said. \"I get rugged! Your mother is gonna love seein' this scar once we get home...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eugh!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis chuckled. Women were magnetically attracted to tough, battle-scarred heroes, and Fortis was sure that the little nick on his left cheek was going to have Eldonia's heart going all pitty-patter... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Hermes and Zacharia closed the carriage doors, and then climbed into the back seat, where servants rode. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My lady...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis held out a hand to Helena. She smiled up at him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My lord\", she said, curtsying slightly and grasping his hand. Fortis suddenly whisked her into his arms, and, holding her firmly with one massive bicep, grasped the side of the carriage with his other arm. He hauled himself and Helena easily into the driver's seat and sat them both down. She laughed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooff!! Th-thank you my lord!\" she gasped. She smoothed out her dress and Fortis smiled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yah!\" he shouted, \"C'mon! Walk on boys!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe horses snorted, and, with a rattling of bridles and a creaking of straps, the carriage started rumbling out of, and away from the inn yard. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelena gulped. She felt a bit uneasy riding on this carriage, with this handsome, unknown Mountanian warrior-lord. Everything about him was just so gigantic...and...powerful... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis leaned back in the driver's seat and stretched his legs out. This had the unintended effect of giving Helena an excellent view of his wedding-tackle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n...Or at least, the incredible bulge created by it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You must have a large family, my lord...?\" she asked. Fortis nodded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah\", he said. \"Six kids!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Six!? Oh my! Your poor wife!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis chuckled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sure she was a lovely woman\", said Helena. Fortis looked at her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Was a lovely woman? She is a lovely woman, thank you very much. An exquisite woman, to be precise...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelena hoped the shock didn't register on her face! She stared once more at the colossal cannon resting between Fortis's thighs. Any woman who could handle six enormous, painful, no-doubt, aggressive penetrations from such a monster as that must be a woman of exceptional character...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelena decided at once, that she would very much like to meet Lady Vanderstorm! Any woman who could handle the Truncheon of Doom was well-worth knowing! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is Leonardo your oldest son?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You must be very proud of him!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hah...Yeah...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you have others?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Six. Three boys. Three girls\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my! What are they like?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The girls cling too much...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They like sleeping with their father far too often\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelena giggled. She could imagine ANY girl wanting to sleep with Fortis far too often... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think it's sweet\", she said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Three little girls all cuddled up with their father\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis laughed. \"Yeah I guess\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the journey passed in relative quiet. Inside the carriage, all the boys had fallen asleep. Helena put her arms around Fortis's torso, and he draped one arm over her shoulder, keeping the other on the reins. Up ahead, he saw a looming stone wall. As the carriage drew closer, he noticed it was some manner of fortification. Then he realised it was a border-guard. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuilt across the road was something that amounted to a small castle. It was built on a hill, over which the road passed, with walls extending out on either side. Soldiers patrolled the gates and walls. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Halt!\" a man shouted. Fortis pulled slowly on the reins and the horses stopped. Guards hurried forwards. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is your business here?\" asked a man who looked like he was the one in charge. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good afternoon, Sergeant\", said Fortis. \"My business is my own. I travel to Fatlantis to visit friends\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who are your passengers?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My family and travelers picked up on the way. Let us pass\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will need to see some identification\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Identification, is it?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis pointed with his whip to the coat of arms painted on the carriage door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm afraid that is not enough, sir\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis stared at the sergeant. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You want more identification?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You think a Peer of the Realm needs to provide more identification than his armorial bearings?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis sighed. He dismounted from the carriage and drew out his sword. The sergeant inspected the blade and nodded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well...my lord\", he added. He bowed and stepped back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Open the gates!\" he shouted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis climbed back onto the carriage and flicked the reins. The horses started up again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Imbeciles!\" he grumbled as the carriage rumbled through the gates, through the courtyard of the guard-post, out the other side and into the Kingdom of Fatlantis... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"You took long enough!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. Hello to you, too\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA tall, battle-worn man with an unshaven face limped forwards. From the carriage, Leonardo and Jaxxon stared at the man. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked about Fortis's age and height, but other than that, was almost entirely different. The man had no left leg, and no right arm. Instead, he walked with a crutch and had a sort of metal attachment added to the stump where his right hand used to be. The man was tall, but not as tall as Fortis, muscular, but more solid than Fortis. And he looked dangerous, despite his lack of appendages. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man held out his left hand, and Fortis shook it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damascus\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fortis\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You got a new piece for your arm, I see\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDamascus nodded. \"Yes. It slots in, and when I want to change it, I just slot it out again. I have a whole heap of these things. The blacksmith around here is quite handy with his forge and hammer\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crippled Mountanian stared at the carriage, and the faces looking at him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aren't you going to introduce me?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...Boys, come out and say hello\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaxxon and Leo, with Apollo following behind, climbed out of Fortis's carriage. The carriage was parked in the gardens of a comfortable, but small villa with walls built around the gardens. The boys bowed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is Leonardo. His friend Jaxxon, and our young companion here is Apollo. His mother Helena. They are traveling with us to Regis City\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Traveling companions, eh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Their carriage was wrecked in a storm. I offered to take them the rest of the way\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm. Always were the charitable sort, weren't you, Fortis? Yes well, you can't all stand out here. Come inside...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nArriving in the village of Sugarloaf Hill was, to Leonardo Vanderstorm, as different as night and day. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe village was filled mostly with fat, cheerful Fatlanteans, who mostly walked around with the minimal of clothes, in order to show off their, in some cases, formidable girths. Leo, who had always prided himself on his slim figure, was rather taken aback by everything that he saw. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm amazed that you haven't put on more weight living here in Fatlantis\", Fortis said. His friend Damascus laughed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have put on a bit\", he said. \"It's hard to exercise when half your limbs are missing, but I don't generally eat much, anyway\", he said. \"But I suppose that you fellows are all hungry. Sit down in the dining-room\", he gestured towards the chamber in question, leading off the foyer of his villa, \"And I will inform the cook to serve dinner\", he said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dining-room was warm and comfortable, and the gaggle of travelers shuffled sleepily into the chamber to a cold supper of pie, sandwiches and lemonade. Fortis was glad for it - he was not in the mood for anything too extravagant so late at night. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought that you had a son?\" Fotis said as he tucked into the cold cuts and beer. Damascus nodded. \"I do\", he said. \"You are wondering, perhaps, why he is not here, FOrtis\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis nodded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's simple, I sent him away\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sent him away?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. I know, I know, I'm supposed to train him to be a knight and gentleman d everything, but look at me, Fortis! I can't do that stuff anymore. And the boy is not going to learn if he doesn't see things in action. So I sent him to boarding-school\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Boarding school?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Absolutely. Perhaps you should send your son there? Dragon's Heart Academy is a fine institution\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis nodded. He knew Dragon's Heart Academy. It was an ancient boarding school for Mountanian boys. Part boot-camp, part military academy, part boarding-school. Acceptance into the Academy was extremely hard, but the results were often worth it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"An interesting idea\", said Fortis. \"Leonardo and his friend Jaxxon here might learn a lot more than I can teach them\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I'm sure you teach them fine!\" said Damascus, \"But at the Academy, they'll learn a lot more than what simple home-schooling can provide\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis nodded, That was true. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I shall give you the address and details of the headmaster, after dinner\", Damascus said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Boarding-school!?\" Leo said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis nodded. \"It might be good for you, son\", he said. \"And Jaxxon. I'll write to your father, Bastion, and see what he says\". </span></div></div>",

He wore what looked like winter robes, despite the fact that it was nowhere near wintertime. He looked to be many years older than Leonardo, and appeared to be in his late teens. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excellent, excellent...\" Fortis said, reading over the papers in his hand. \"Very good. I'm surprised...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good news, my lord?\" the youth asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yes...Huh! Skinflint bastard...I knew he had the money! Yes...very nice. Well, thank you for being so swift with your deliveries, young Lord Merlin. My best wishes to your grandparents\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young wizarding lord bowed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So your son and young Master Jaxxon will be going to Dragon's Heart Academy\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It seems so. Sir Bastion has agreed to the change in his son's education and I think he rather enjoys the change. At any rate, it will give the boys a chance to learn more and spend time with people more their own age...And they'll be there with Damascus's son\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And my younger brother, my lord\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your brother?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Absolutely, Lord Vanderstorm. You remember Lazarus?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis groaned. \"Is he that wretched boy who poured ink into my wine when I hosted your grandparent's wedding anniversary two years ago?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...yeah that sounds like him...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis sighed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Clunk...creak...clunk!...creak...clunk!...creak...clunk!...creak...</b><b r></b>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aah! Young Merlin!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lord Adlerseele!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMerlin bowed to Damascus. The crippled warlord smirked. \"So, your brother and my son will have two new companions when term starts in a few weeks, eh?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes sir. I was just finalising all the details, speeding the letters back and forth...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So handy having magical connections, isn't it, Fortis?\" Damascus asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Absolutely\", said Fortis. \"This trip to Fatlantis will give Leonardo and Jaxxon time to relax and get over the shock. Once we return to Mountania, the boys will be sent off to Dragon's Heart Academy. There, they'll get a chance to meet Kannon and Lazarus\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Indeed\", said Damascus, \"I came to tell you that dinner is served\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! Good!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Merlin, you'll stay for dinner\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! Thank you, Lord Adlerseele\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're welcome! This way...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n--- --- --- --- <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dunno papa...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lord Vanderstorm, did YOU ever go there?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Certainly did\", said Fortis. \"I learnt the basics from my father, and then I went off to Dragon's Heart Academy. So did your uncles, Leonardo\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Even Uncle Excalibur?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...no. Uncle Excalibur was too stupid to go to Dragon's Heart...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDamascus laughed. \"That crackpot cousin of yours!? I thought he got in!?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean he snuck in and tried to steal stuff from the potions laboratories. Master Hawkeye caught him and gave him a...Yeah well, better not talk about that here...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awww!\" Leo wailed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Master Hawkeye was the fencing-master\", Damascus explained, \"Or he was when your father and I were at Dragon's Heart. Fearsome guy. He lost one eye once, a long time ago. He wore a leather eye-patch, but you'd never know it. He'd spot anything! Like your uncle trying to jump out of a second-storey window...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis nodded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You never thought about sending your son to school, Lady Excelsion?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelena sipped her wine. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no! Well, not to Dragon's Heart, anyway. But my husband and I are thinking of sending him somewhere. We just haven't decided yet\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Moooother!!\" Apollo fumed. Everyone laughed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh you boys will love it there!\" said Fortis. He stared at Damascus. \"Who's the headmaster there now, anyway?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You probably know who he is\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do I?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. Tacitus VonGewalt...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis frowned. \"Do I know him?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think he's your wife's...something...He was at your wedding, remember!?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's not that old guy with the white hair and the scar, is he?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's the one!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thor's Hammer...I remember now...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Does that mean he's my...great...something?\" Leonardo asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He'll be your great-uncle, yes\", Fortis said. \"Didn't you know that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've never met him!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah that's right, you wouldn't have. Don't worry, I'll introduce you, son!\" </span></div></div>",

She blushed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mrs. Eddys is a master when it comes to packing food for journeys! Probably because I go away so many times\", Damascus said. \"All that food should keep you well-fed until you reach Regis City!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure looks like it!\" said Leo, helping Zacharia to tie the hamper to the roof of the carriage. \"Hey look...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe opened the lid and peered inside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's pies in here!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Leo!

Leo and Jaxxon burst out laughing inside the carriage. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's so funny?\" Damascus demanded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing! Nothing really!\" said Leo, blushing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come along, Helena!\" said Fortis. He helped her up into the box. Apollo climbed into the carriage, the doors were closed and locked, and with a wave, everyone departed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"FORTIS! Don't forget the LETTERS I gave you for Dragon's Heart!\" Damascus shouted. Fortis pulled them out of his cloak and waved them in the air. He hadn't forgotten! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Papa! How far is it to Regis City?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis turned to see his son leaning out of the carriage. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"About a day and a half\", he replied. \"We'll camp overnight, and then we should reach Regis City by about noon tomorrow\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is it safe to camp?\" Helena asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Fatlantis is a very peaceful sort of place\", said Fortis. \"You don't get many highwaymen around here\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have you been to Regis City often?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A few times when I was a boy. My father had to come here on diplomatic duties, so he dragged me along...Great food!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelena giggled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So your husband lives at the Mountanian Embassy in Regis City?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, he's Secretary to the Ambassador\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I see. How nice!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Papa! What will Regis City be like?\" Leonardo called out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I think you'll love it, son\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where will we stay?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis frowned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat...was a very good question. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Vanderstorm name didn't carry much 'weight' in Fatlantis. In his native Mountania, the Vanderstorms had always been treated with respect, obedience, deference, even. They had been known for generations as a powerful, influential, and well-connected aristocratic family - a family of the elite warrior-nobility class, with connections at the Mountanian royal court. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut not much of that counted for anything in Regis City. Fortis wasn't even sure if he'd the king. He knew his name, but that was it. King David, and Queen Isobel... but he knew nothing more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When we meet him tomorrow, I'm sure my husband will be able to help!\" said Helena, smiling. </span></div></div>",

Standing at the enormous gatehouse were six fat, burly-looking guards. Despite their weight, they certainly looked like capable men. Each one carried a halberd, wore a helmet and had a small sword strapped to a leather belt. Fortis pivoted, swung his legs over and landed on the ground, dust rising, his cloak billowing in the wind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good afternoon, gentlemen\", the Mountain lord said. He towered over the guards, most of them only coming up to below his chest. He unbuckled his cloak to show the chain and medallion he wore around his chest. One of the guards nodded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My lord\", he said. \"The Mountanian Order of the Dragon?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis nodded. \"My family and my traveling companions seek entrance into the city.

The guard hurried to his friends and chatted. They nodded and stepped aside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Open the gates!\" someone shouted. Fortis climbed back into his carriage. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yah!\" he shouted, and the carriage rumbled through, the coat of arms on the door sparkling in the strong, afternoon sun. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would you look at that guy...\" said one of the guards as the portcullis slammed shut after them. \"I reckon he would've got into the city even if we didn't let him in!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is why the King ensures we remain on good terms with the Mountanians, Charlie. You wouldn't want them as your enemy, would you?\" said another guard. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharlie nodded. \"Yeah! No wonder their army's never been defeated if it's got those guys leading it! Just looking at him makes me hungry!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Imagine how much a beast like him eats!...Hey are there anymore of those ham and cheese sandwiches left...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woooooow!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeo and Jaxxon and Apollo stared out the windows of the carriage as it rumbled through town towards the Diplomatic Quarter near the palace. The streets were filled with people. On almost every street-corner, there were carts and trolleys parked, with people selling food. Sausages, steak sandwiches, fried eggs, bread rolls, and hard candy treats. Leonardo licked his lips! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gosh I'm hungry!\" he said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe carriage parked outside an imposing stone building. At once, street-children swarmed around like ants! They opened the doors, folded down the mounting-steps, and waited eagerly. Leonardo and his friends climbed out into the warm, inviting sunlight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Give us a shillin'!\" said one of the boys, holding out his cap. \"C'mon guv!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OY!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis leapt from the top of the carriage and landed on his feet, his cloak flapping in the summer breeze. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Beat it, you little scamps!\" he grunted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cooooor! Look at him!\" said one of the boys, \"Hey mistah! Openin' a door's a livin' around here!\" he said, obviously not as intimidated by Fortis's size as the others around him. Fortis stared at the waif, who had to be about eight years old. He reached into his pouch and tossed a few coins on the ground. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mind your horses, guv?\" said another boy, hurrying up. \"Only a shillin'!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis handed the boy two shillings. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I find one thing missing from my carriage when I return, you'll be hanging upside down from a lamppost by your guts, understand, boy?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes sir!\" said the youth. \"OY!\" he shouted to others. \"PISS OFF! I've got this one! Go find another coach to pester! C'mon Albert! Let's look after this thing...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis escorted Helena into the Mountanian embassy. A large red and gold flag fluttered from the roof. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"May I help you?\" said the receptionist, a man sitting behind a desk, fanning himself slightly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm here to see my husband, the Ambassador's secretary\", said Helena. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes ma'am. He'll be in the ambassador's suite. This way...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were led into a huge, grand-looking office, with doors leading off in various directions. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mr. Ambassador, we've got guests!\" said the receptionist. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, Hermes...Why Dame Excelsion! Your husband told me you were coming!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiled. \"It's so nice to see you!\" she said. \"Sir Rubicon, this my traveling companion, Lord Vanderstorm\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aah, the noble Lord Vanderstorm...\" said Sir Rubicon, a tall, tanned man with brown hair, and a full beard. \"How nice to meet you! Wait here, I'll fetch your husband, ma'am...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man turned and entered another room. He returned a couple of minutes later with another man. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Papa!\" said Apollo loudly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucius Excelsion smiled. \"Apollo my boy!...What on EARTH did you do to your arm!? I expected you here two weeks ago!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Our carriage crashed in a storm, papa! And we nearly DROWNED in a river! And then this man saved us, papa!\" said Apollo excitedly. Lucius looked up. He bowed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My lord!\" he said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is the Earl Vanderstorm of Dynamos County, Lucius\", said Rubicon, \"One of the grandest old families in the king's court! I didn't know you were coming!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It wasn't planned\", said Fortis. \"But my boy here's never seen Fatlantis and I thought it might make for an educational trip. Unfortunately we don't have anywhere to stay...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh you can't stay here!\" said Sir Rubicon. \"We don't have the room. This is an embassy, not a hotel! But...I am expected at the palace in...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSir Rubicon looked at a handsome clock standing on a shelf. \"...four hours' time\", he said. \"I think I could pull a FEW strings, and have you stay there!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stay at the palace!?\" said Apollo. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have a rather good relationship with King David, and he is a charitable sort of fellow. I don't see why not. I'll just tell him some friends arrived unexpectedly. I have to go there now anyway, so...Perhaps you should come along?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ambassador held up a thick wad of paper. \"This is our new water-trade agreement that the king has to sign. It's about that canal system that runs from Mountania to Fatlantis. You may as well come with me!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright\", said Fortis. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would you wish me to accompany you, Sir Rubicon?\" Lucius asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Yes you better\", said Rubicon. \"Bring your family, Lucius. It's not every day they get to meet royalty!\" <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He nodded. \"Very well!...Open the gates!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gates were hauled open, and the two carriages rumbled in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce they were beyond, Leo and his friends gasped. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe estate was enormous, with manicured lawns and gardens, and a towering, sprawling grand palace before them. He whistled loudly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow!!...Makes our place look like shit!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaxxon laughed. The carriage parked outside the main entrance and everyone climbed out. They entered a cavernous and bright central foyer, with a towering lemonade-fountain in the middle of the room. Ramps and doors and passages all led off in various directions. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"May I help you?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn enormous man waddled forwards. He had to be four or five hundred pounds, with neat, blond hair and red robes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're here to see the king\", said Sir Rubicon. \"We have business\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Indeed?\" said the man. He held out his hand, and Rubicon handed him the letter. The man glanced at it, and then glanced at the package in Rubicon's hands. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aah yes. The Mountanian trade deal...Yes yes...The King is in the throne-room with his family. I'll see if he will grant you an audience\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man knocked on the throne-room doors, then entered, and closed them behind him. He returned a few minutes later. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You may enter\", he said. \"Sir Rubicon, your Majesty!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, they entered. They walked along a thick, wide, red carpet. As they got closer, Leo and Jaxxon gawped. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting on two thrones were an immensely obese man and woman. Leo assumed they were King David and Queen Isobel. Sitting between them were two colossal boys! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey looked older than Leo and Jaxxon, but not by much. They were perhaps thirteen and fifteen. They both had blond hair, one slightly darker than the other. And they were both equally obese. They had to be at least a thousand pounds each! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeo was so transfixed, that the droning words of Sir Rubicon buzzed in his ears and made no sense at all. Fortis nudged his son. Leo snapped back to attention. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Mountain lord drew out his sword and knelt. Everyone else followed suit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lord Vanderstorm, it is an honour to have you in our court. Your reputation precedes you\", said King David. \"Your tales of bravery in the Vladian Wars are well-known in our court!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are they, my lord?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are related to Lady Athena Vanderstorm? She is a close friend of your king...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She is my grandmother, your Majesty\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aaah! Excellent! Absolutely, it would be our pleasure to host your stay here at the palace, while you visit Regis City! And my sons shall see to the needs of your own sons!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only Leonardo is my son, your Majesty. This is his friend Jaxxon, and this is their friend Apollo, son of the ambassador's secretary\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No matter!\" said the king firmly, \"Jaxxon and Leonardo shall be well taken-care of! And...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey what's goin' on here?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis turned when he thought he heard a familiar accent. Standing in a side-door was a powerfully-built Mountanian teenager. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah!\" he said, coming in, waving a sword casually around like a folded umbrella. He stared up at Lord Vanderstorm. \"Cool!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis sized the youth up. Then he recognised the gold coronet on his head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good afternoon, your Royal Highness\", Fortis said. Fortis nudged his son, who bowed. \"Leonardo, Prince Gladius\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh!\" said Leo, blushing. \"H-hello!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey\", said Gladius. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Young Master Gladius's Mountanian casualness infiltrates all chambers of the palace...even those which he is not permitted entrance to when there are private audiences...\" said Queen Isobel. Everyone laughed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Show Lord Leonardo and young Master Jaxxon to a guest-suite close to the princes, Gladius!\" said the king. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They can sleep in my guest-suite!\" said the fattest boy, heaving himself up from his throne. \"Come on! This way!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!\" said the other boy, \"Wait for me!\" </span></div></div>",

How they were even able to move seemed to defy the laws of physics and nature! Both boys were so staggeringly obese, it seemed impossible that they could even stand! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeither prince could see his feet, and he waddled forwards, leaning heavily on an elegantly-carved walking-stick. Both princes moved at a snail's pace, panting heavily, and plodding one foot laboriously in front of another, as if trying to haul them out of thick, sucking mud! Leonardo turned to Jaxxon, who had also been paralysed into catatonia by their mindblowing girth! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mon you guys!\" said Prince Gladius, \"Move it!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn stunned silence, the two youths wafted out of the room in a trance-like state, like zombies. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeveral times on the way to their rooms, both princes had to stop for breath. Once at the doors of the throne-room, once at the intersection of a passageway, and then at the intersection of another...and another...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeonardo was beginning to understand why there wasn't a single flight of stairs ANYWHERE in the palace! Two such enormously...FAT...princes...couldn't POSSIBLY climb stairs! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're not NORMALLY this slow...\" Gladius whispered. \"But uh...they DID just finish lunch...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeo gulped! Just THINKING about food was beginning to terrify him! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the fattest prince reached the end of a corridor, a pair of gigantic doors opened. Two boys, plump, but not especially fat, and dressed in what looked like white and gold servants' uniforms, bowed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Master Cameron, sir\", the boys said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ryan...E...Ethan...\" Cameron panted. He waddled inside and groaned as he collapsed into a huge armchair and let out a pained wheezing sound, clutching his belly. One of the boys immediately got to his hands and knees, and started working on the prince's belly, gently massaging out the cramping knots of an agonising stitch that was forming in his fat-rolls. Cameron let out  groan like a dying man. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"T-these are...Lord...L-Leonardo and...J-Jaxxon D-DeJaeger...\" Cameron wheezed. \"T-th-they'll HUUURGGHH!\" he grimaced as the stitch tightened up in his belly and he curled up in agony! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Th-they'll be staying with us...for a while!\" Edmund panted, completing his brother's sentence. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe remaining servant-boy bowed. \"Yes Master Cameron, Master Edmund, sir\", he said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"G-g-give th-them my...g-gu-guestroom!\" Cameron whispered, barely able to speak. He let out another horrible groan. \"OOOOOH! I should never have eaten that stupid pizza!...BURRRRRRRP!!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you...you did, anyway!\" Edmund fumed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YEAH! Otherwise you would've...e-eaten it!\" Cameron protested, and coughed loudly. Edmund sighed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My brother is NOT the smartest person around...\" Edmund said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's treason!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not the king yet, you stupid fat blob! So no, it isn't!\" Edmund snapped back. Everyone laughed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe remaining servant-boy, who Leo found out, was named Ryan, led Leo and Jaxxon into a chamber off the main suite. It was surprisingly luxurious, and had an enormous, four-poster bed against the wall, and large windows that gave views onto the gardens and the walls outside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wooow!\" he said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can share the bed if you like. Or we could set up another chamber, if you wish...\" Ryan said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...gosh...\" said Jaxxon. He didn't like the idea of getting LOST in a place THIS huge! \"Uh...We'll stick with the ONE room, for now...\" he said. Leo nodded. He liked that idea!! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here you go, boys!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis entered the princely chambers, carrying two enormous trunks in his massive arms. Edmund and his brother Cameron gawped at the raw, bestial strength, and their servant-boys backed quickly away as the Mountain Lord entered the guest-room and dumped them on the ground. He stood up, straightening his back, loud cracks and pops echoing, his muscles stretching, flexing and rippling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uuuurggghh!! You know, it's lucky these people don't believe in stairs! Otherwise I would've tripped over three times getting here! Anyway, I reckon we can stay here a week, and then we can head home. You boys get comfortable now...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis left the room and a couple of minutes later, a full-figured, buxom-looking maiden entered. She looked like a palace laundry-maid and in her arms, she carried fresh linen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well hey, Tanya...\" said Gladius, \"Maybe I could help you...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen, Baron Von Thunder-Junk, the other laundry-maids might think you're cute, but you're too young for me!\" she said firmly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCameron burst out laughing. \"Gladius, give it up! She's nineteen!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Cameron and Edmund looked mortified! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C-can we sit down?\" Leo asked. Cameron nodded and pointed to the sofa in front of the fireplace, between the two armchairs occupied by the princes. Leo and Jaxxon sat down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...um...Hi!\" said Leo, uncertainly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello\", said Cameron. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You sure are FAT!\" said Jaxxon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was silence. Then Cameron and Edmund burst out laughing. Leonardo giggled and Jaxxon smirked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We wondered when you might notice...\" said Cameron, chortling. \"It's nice to meet you!\" he said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks\", said Leo. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. Gladius has been BORED without any other Mountanians around. Be careful. He might challenge you to a duel\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeo barely heard what Cameron was saying. He was too busy ogling at Cameron's tons of warm, soft, jiggling flesh. The acres of adipose existence that wobbled and jiggled and sloshed hypnotically, as the prince made himself comfortable in his chair...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you want to touch it?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh!?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeo snapped back to reality. \"W-what?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay, you know\", said Cameron. \"Everyone does\". Cameron wobbled his huge belly that sagged to the ground between his legs. \"Our weight is our symbol of authority and power. People rub our bellies to show respect, love, admiration, adoration...and for good luck!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Does that happen often?\" Jaxxon asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Every day!\" said Edmund. \"It's why we almost never wear anything that covers us up. Just our cloaks, most of the time. People EXPECT to us!...As MUCH of us as possible\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your father must know what that's like, huh?\" Cameron asked, looking at Leo, \"With a body like he's got\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh...Oh!\" said Leo, finally making the comparison and connection. Now that he thought it over, he figured it didn't seem so stupid after all... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah!\" he said. \"Gosh I...I never thought of it like that...I...wow...How MUCH do you two weigh!?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh...Oh damn...\" Cameron mumbled. \"Uh...RYAN!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of the servant-boys emerged from a chamber. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My lord!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where's the public registry-book of our weights?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In the king's study, your Royal Highness!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go and find out what they are, would you? I don't remember...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, master!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It must be nice having servants\", said Leonardo. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't YOU have servants?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well yes, but...not...personal servants. Not in Mountania. It's not the...'thing'...really\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah I bet\", said Edmund. \"No, no, no. Here in Fatlantis we're expected to have servants. It's very bad for national morale to see the princes serving themselves.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really, why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It suggests that the king can't afford staff. And if he can't afford to live in luxury, then what hope is there for the rest of the kingdom? It also suggests that we're not fat enough to need servants! And that's even WORSE!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why's that worse?\" Jaxxon asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"BECAUSE it means that the future of the monarchy and the royal inheritence would be in jeopardy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooooh...Wow...I think I've learned more in the past ten minutes than I have all day...\" said Leo. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So we can really touch you?\" Jaxxon asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go ahead!\" said Edmund, proudly. \"Everyone does, anyway! FEEL the WEIGHT OF ROYALTY!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone laughed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two Mountain boys got on their knees before the princes and let their hands sink into the cool, soft, tender, impossibly loose, doughy, melty blubber. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh man...\" said Leo. He'd never touched anything like this before! It was like a living, breathing, growing, feeding feather-bed. It was incredible! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Take as long as you like\", Cameron said.

Papa's training us!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Trying to train you, you mean\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone jumped! Nobody had heard Fortis enter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry about that. The doors were open.

Your Royal Highnesses\", Fortis added. \"We'll be joining you for dinner\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course you are!\" said Crown Prince Cameron. \"And you can use those big muscles of yours to keep Gladius in-check!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis laughed. \"What's wrong with Prince Gladius?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He plays with his cutlery!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sure it's not that bad...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He turned my fork into a cork-screw!!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...oh\". </span></div></div>",

It was a dizzying display of gluttony. Sausages, mashed potatoes, fried potatoes, boiled potatoes, toast, roast pork, roast beef, roast chicken, roast mutton, soups, seafood, dinner-rolls, butter, cream, oil, and a dozen other things besides! Leo stared around him in horror! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo his surprise, his father seemed to be wolfing down food just as fast as the princes! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, I hauled all your damn luggage in, I had to handle the horses and the carriage, and I'm three times your size, boy!\" Fortis grunted at his son. All of which was true. And he packed it away with speed and ease! King David smiled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've got a healthy appetite, my lord!\" he said. \"I expect a Mountain warrior needs a lot of food!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes sir...\" said Fortis, helping himself to another huge steak and slathering it liberally with mustard. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"An appetite not shared by your son, I noticed\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Leo? Oh he'll grow into it!\" Fortis snorted. \"Won'tcha boy!?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yessir!\" said Leonardo.

Knighthood, soldiering, being a warrior, being a craftsman or a scholar, for working in civil service...It's a very very old school\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Papa how am I going to get in!?\" Leo said. \"Or Jaxxon, for that matter!?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your great-uncle is the headmaster. I think I can pull a few strings...\" Fortis said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, so you're related to Sir Tacitus VonGewalt...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes sir\", said Fortis, addressing the king. \"He's my uncle-in-law\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aaah!!

He wasn't sure if Gladius was jealous, or relieved. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You!\" Fortis said. A pair of boys and their father manned a sandwich-stall in the square. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yessir!\" said the man, stepping forwards, \"H-h-how c-can I help you, sir?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One sandwich.

One of his sons started frying everything up on a griddle and loading it into a toaster-rack. Beads on an abacus clattered up and down as the man worked out the price. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes sir!\" he said. \"That'll be a shilling!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis frowned. \"That's quite a lot, isn't it?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWHAM!! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA huge knife slammed down into a chopping-block, and the boys stepped forwards with two gigantic sandwiches! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's that?\" the man asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...nothing\", said Fortis. He handed the man his money. The man dropped the coin into a wooden box and a bell rang on top. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here son\", said Fortis. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh, thanks pops!\" said Leo. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe squares of Regis City were packed with after-dinner shoppers and walkers. The five main squares of the city, set out in a cross, were filled with flaming torches, burning braziers and towering street-lamps. Carriages rumbled past in the streets. The two fat princes waddled slowly along. People stopped to shake their hands, rub their bellies, hug them, squeeze them, pinch them, or bow respectfully. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I say! Careful!...Woah!...HEY!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis looked up. A fat man with white hair and a moustache waved his walking-stick at a youth who was sprinting towards him. A jingling sound at once betrayed what had happened. Gladius drew out his sword, but...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"GOTCHA!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy yelped as he found himself dangling upside down, over ten feet up in the air! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! Help! Put me down!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis had the boy by the ankles. He started shaking him like a bell, until with a soft 'Chink!', a coin-purse fell out of his pockets. The fat man waddled up and Gladius picked up the man's purse. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Th-thank you, young man!\" said the old man, stuffing the purse into a pocket of his robes. He stared up at Fortis with wide eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Evening, sir\", said Fortis. \"Oh I'm sorry...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WOAH!!...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>WHUNK!!</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uuuurrrgghhh...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis let go of the boy, who crashed to earth, and held out his hand to shake. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And thank you, sir!\" said the man. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're welcome\", said Fortis. \"Alright you, up!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy gulped. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't do nothin'! Honest, sir!\" the boy burbled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bertie you were always a terrible liar\", said Prince Cameron. The boy swore and gulped! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know who this guy is?\" Leo whispered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure we know who he is!\" said Edmund. \"He's a local character called Buttery Bert\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeo and Jaxxon burst out laughing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Slick and smooth, like butter!\" the boy smirked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not so slick and smooth this time, are you, boy?\" Fortis said. \"Tell me, Prince Cameron, what's the punishment for purse-snatching around here?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh don't waste your time, Lord Vanderstorm\", said Cameron. \"Bertie's no real threat. He's a horrible pickpocket, as you can see. Let him go, he won't be any trouble...WILL YOU, Bertie?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not on your life, Y'right royal rotundity!\" the boy said quickly, bowing. Cameron snorted, in a 'yeah, right!' sorta way. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Honest!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh go on!\" Cameron grumbled. \"Come to the palace tomorrow night. Get through the north garden gates. We'll find you something to eat...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes sir!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...um...you could have this\", said Leo. He handed the boy the sandwich his father had given him. Leo was still full from dinner. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cor! Thanks!\" said the boy. He snatched up the sandwich and started stuffing his face with it, before jogging off down an alleyway. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bertie's one of the um...local characters...\" Cameron said. \"He's harmless, really. Just another one of the poor street-kids around here. There's a children's home and orphanage outside of town that they're supposed to go to, but they like it here too much...Occasionally we sneak them into the palace and give them something to eat. Father doesn't like it. He thinks it makes them dependent or something. But...well...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You do good, Prince Cameron, which is all that should be expected of us\", said Fortis. \"Oh look, a blacksmith's forge...\" </span></div></div>",

He strapped down the trunks and thumped them with his fist. \"But it's nice to think about it...Alright boys! Get in!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ride home was long and boring. By the time they reached Castle Vanderstorm again, they were exhausted and glad to back in their familiar, family estate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll in all, they'd been gone almost a month. And when they'd got back, things certainly looked and felt very different...most of all, for Leonardo. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man...\" he said as he entered the foyer of the castle. \"Everything kinda looks...smaller...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis chuckled. \"You're growin', boy!\" he said. \"You're almost six feet! Go on, get your stuff up to your room. I need to find your mother...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was after dinner when Fortis returned home. And as a result, he found his wife slumbering on a couch in the drawing-room, a half-open book in her limp hand. Fortis removed the book, put it on a side-table, climbed onto the couch, wrapped his arms around her form, fondled her gently and kissed her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoftly, at first...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...then teasingly....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she woke up, Fortis planted his lips on her face and gave her a huge smacker! Eldonia moaned loudly, and then pushed her husband away! Fortis grabbed her and drew her in! He wrapped his arms tightly around her and squeezed her against his body! Eldonia moaned...and went limp....Fortis continued to kiss. Eldonia continued to moan softly. Fortis stroked her hair. She continued to moan. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Fortis broke away, Eldonia gasped and blinked! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're home!\" she gasped. Fortis smiled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm home\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiled. \"I missed you...\" she whispered in his ear. She wrapped her arms around her husband's body and snuggled up next to him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Honey...Your uncle Tacitus is still the headmaster of Dragon's Heart Academy, isn't he?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia frowned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. You know he is...Why?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh nothing...nothing. I was just thinking of how...WONDERFUL it would be...if one of our sons got to attend such a prestigious institution...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Forty! Leo's too young!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis groaned. \"He is NOT too young! He's almost ten! That's more than old enough to be admitted! Most kids start at seven!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose you're right. And it would be nice for him to receive a formal education!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis nodded. \"So you'll write to your uncle?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. I'll speak to father, first. And then I'll write to Uncle Tacitus!\" said Eldonia, firmly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis nodded. \"Fine\", he said. He got up to leave, but Eldonia took him by the hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have missed my lord's loving fondles and touches these past four weeks...\" Eldonia whispered. \"Allow me to enjoy them a little more...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis smiled. He wrapped his arms around his wife...and slowly lifted her from the couch. He held her close and carried her carefully upstairs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That could be arranged...\" he whispered.

Let's go outside into the gardens!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yaaaaaay!!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia smiled. She reached for a bell-pull and rang it. A couple of minutes later and Zacharia entered the castle library. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You rang, my lady?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See that this reaches the Dragon's Heart Academy, and into the hands of the headmaster, will you, Zachary?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes m'lady!\" said the servant-boy. \"I'll give it to one of the stable-boys to deliver!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, good!\" she said, \"Thank you!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n--- --- --- --- <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Leonardo?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Grandma!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeo Vanderstorm hurried into his great-grandmother's bedroom and hugged her. Athena smiled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooh! You're getting so BIG!\" she teased. \"Just like your father!\" she observed. Leo blushed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am NOT as big as papa!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I'm SURE you will be, my darling!\" she said. \"Your father says that you're going to Dragon's Heart!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It seems like a very poorly kept secret...\" said Leonardo. \"Yeah, Jaxxon and I are going to Dragon's Heart\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awww! Your father went there. And your grandfather. And your great-grandfather!...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, okay, I get it. Big reputation to hold up...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAthena laughed. \"Oh darling! You'll love it!\" she said. \"Your father did! So did your Uncle Cannius and Uncle Jupiter!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about Uncle Excalibur?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dragon's Heart wouldn't take Excalibur...something about lacking a moral compass...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeo giggled. He'd heard all kinds of stories about his disreputable Uncle Excalibur. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have to pack, grandma\", said Leo, \"In case Uncle Tacitus says I can go\", he added. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well make sure you pack a good cloak!\" said his grandmother. \"It's extremely cold that far north!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeo headed back to his bedroom, dragged out the trunk that he'd unpacked only a few days before, and opened his wardrobe to decide what he should bring. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeo hadn't worn his winter cloak in ages. He hadn't bothered bringing it with him when they traveled to Fatlantis, either. He brought out the dark red cloak with its brass buckle-clasp and tried it on. He rested the cloak on his shoulders and tried to buckle up the chest-clasp...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gurgh!...C'mon!...Stupid...GURGH!...Maybe if I bring UP....and then...yeah but then it doesn't...Urgh!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Weonado, Whutcha doin'?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby, his sister, stuck her head around the corner of his bedroom door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Ruby. I'm trying to put my cloak on!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehe! Looks silly!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You think so?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cloak all trailing behind you like a ponytail! Issa posed tah go on dah shoulders!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I KNOW! The stupid thing's too small!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis little sister giggled and jogged away. \"Gwamma! Gwamma! Weonado's ripping up his clothing!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am NOT!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAthena shuffled in. \"What's this I hear!?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gran I can't fit into my winter cloak anymore! I mean look! It doesn't fit over my shoulders! And the chain's too short!...And it's...It doesn't even go down past my knees at least, anymore! It'll be lucky if it even covers my ass!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well my darling, you have grown nine inches...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No I haven't!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yes you have!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All that good Fatlantean food must've boosted your growth-spurt!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't have grown nine inches in a month!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAthena reached up and adjusted the cloak, and then glanced up and down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No no no! You can't POSSIBLY wear this to Dragon's Heart! Your legs are going to freeze! Take it off!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Take what off, grandma?\" Fortis asked as he came past. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your son's growing out of all his clothing!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh good!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NOT good! What's he going to wear to school!?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well uhm...He could have one of my cloaks...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be an idiot Fortis! The boy can't wear the clothes of a fully-grown man!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh fine! He can have one of my OLD cloaks!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He can't have anything with holes and stains in it, either!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Semen washes out!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT WAS THAT!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing grandma!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll measure up a new cloak\", Athena said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks granny\", said Leo. He hugged his grandmother and kissed her. She stroked him lovingly and hugged him back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you, Forty...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh gran, I'm too old for that crap!...Oh alright...Muah!...Love...you!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awww! Granny's big strong sexy boy!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"GRANDMA!!!\" Fortis growled, clearly embarrassed at his grandmother's admiration of her grandson's...'prowess and abilities'. She giggled. \"Oh darling! Every woman needs a man who she can hold onto...\" she said softly. \"I can see Eldonia loves you very much!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis groaned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come along, young Leo! Let's measure you up!\" said Athena, brightly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gran he's too young for a cock-sock!\" Excalibur called out from the corridor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"FOR A NEW CLOAK!\" Athena hissed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...\" said Excalibur. \"Gotcha. Keep it in your britches, Leo. Keep it in your britches...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If only YOU could do that\", Fortis grumbled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Too fat and long, cuz...too fat and long...\" </span></div></div>",

A large carriage rumbled through the woods towards an enormous castle complex of red bricks in the distance. In the driver's box, Fortis and Bastion DeJaeger sat. Their sons sat inside, with their school trunks loaded onto the roof. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I haven't been back in years!\" said Bastion. \"But then I really don't have a need to\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I haven't gone back since...my...tenth graduation anniversary...\" Fortis said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no. I HATE attending those stupid things!...What houses or clubs are our kids gonna be in, Forty?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh they go by family records. You get put into the same house as your father or older brother\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh good! Then they'll both be in the same house!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excellent...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe carriage rumbled through a huge archway into a large, central quadrangle, and then through the mews on the side. The stableboys helped the two Mountanian men down, and helped the boys out of the carriage. While the stable-boys watered and fed the horses, Fortis led the boys through the school. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Coming, Bastion?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No no, I'll wander around\", said Bastion. \"I haven't been here in so long...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, I'll find you later\", said Fortis. \"Come on, boys!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bye, papa!\" Jaxxon waved. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You be good, son!\" Bastion shouted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mon boys! Keep up!\" said Fortis. He strode through the quadrangle, everyone staring at him, and the two boys who dwadled along behind him, twisting this way and that, trying to stare at everything! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverywhere they went, people stared at them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis wore his cloak and robes, and a large, ceremonial steel breastplate that was perfectly shaped to his abdomen. Underneath his cloak, were two swords and a pair of daggers. The wind caught the fabric and blew it back, and the steel glinted in the sunlight. The boys watching gasped. The buckle on the cloak displayed the Knightly Order which Fortis was a member of. Whispers followed them everywhere. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who IS that guy?\"<br>\r\n\"He's HUGE!\"<br>\r\n\"Man he's ARMED!\" <br>\r\n\"Look at those swords!\"<br>\r\n\"He looks badass!\" <br>\r\n\"What's with the cloak thing?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey I think I recognise him!...\"<br>\r\n\"He's not a student!\"<br>\r\n\"I think he's an old boy...\" <br>\r\n\"He's certainly a BIG boy!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis entered a large building, an the boys followed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I help you?\" said a man sitting behind a desk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lord Fortis Vanderstorm to see the Headmaster\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes sir. He's expecting you. This way!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man knocked on a pair of doors. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man opened the doors. \"Lord Vanderstorm, Headmaster!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah!! Excellent, send him in!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis entered, his son and Jaxxon coming after him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting behind a desk was an old man. He looked to be in his sixties or seventies at least. He got up and nodded as Fortis entered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fortis my boy! You're looking well!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes sir\", said Fortis. \"Tacitus, this is my son, Leonardo. And his friend, Jaxxon. The two boys you agreed to take in\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Quite right! We have spaces, and everything has been arranged! They'll be housed in Swordmaster House. Which was YOUR old house, if I remember\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes sir!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Haha! Excellent! They'll be there with another boy...Kannon...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah. Kannon's the son of my friend Sir Damascus\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes yes, Damascus wrote to me, explaining the situation. Kannon will help your boys here settle in very well! Come here, Leonardo!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeonardo moved forwards and bowed. The man smiled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No need to bow! But remember...just because we are family does not mean that you will be treated any differently. Is that understood?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes...Uncle Tacitus?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man nodded. \"When we are alone, you may call me Uncle Tacitus. Otherwise, it will be Headmaster or Sir. Do you understand?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes sir!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good! Good! Well, shall we walk around the school?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yessir!\" said Leo. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good! This way!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe old man put on his mortarboard hat, and they headed out of the office. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Off giving a tour, Icarus! I'll be back in an hour or two!\" said the headmaster. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes sir!\" said his secretary. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right...\" said Tacitus. \"That's the jousting-run...over there...that's the archery range...That field there is the tournament-ground for duels, fencing, swordplay etc...that's the adjoining School of Magic, across the river. There's a bridge over there\", he pointed further down the road. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"These wings here...and here...and...here...are the dormitories. Each dormitory is divided by house and year-level. Each dormitory has its own dining-hall. Next to each dormitory are the classrooms. Then here is the gymnasium...and the school infirmary...and the assembly halls, offices, meeting-rooms, etc...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uncle Tacitus, what are all those, over there?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeo pointed to a cluster of buildings on top of a series of hills, away from the main campus. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, those are the various academy fraternity houses and club-houses! We have clubs for archery, fencing and swordplay, racing, riding, hunting, jousting, athletics...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Archery!?\" said Jaxxon. He stared excitedly at Leo, who grinned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your great-nephew is a very enthusiastic archer, Uncle Tacitus\", Fortis explained. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I see!\" said the headmaster. \"Excellent! I'll take you over there!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe frat-houses and clubhouses were mostly filled with older boys, teenagers, and some even in their twenties, but there were some youngsters there as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEach house seemed extremely noisy. There was a lot of shouting and cheering coming from most of them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aaah!\" said Fortis suddenly. He stared a huge, stone structure. A flag fluttered from the roof. A large foundation-stone on the front porch read: \"SWORDMASTER FRATERNITY\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your old house, Fortis?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah!\" said Fortis, slapping the stone walls fondly. \"I spent a lot of fun times here...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe chuckled. \"A LOT of fun times...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!\" a voice called out from an upstairs window, \"Big guy!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis chuckled and waved. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Brutus who are you shouting to!?\" another member of Swordmaster House asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That guy out there!\" said Brutus. \"With the cloak!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? Where? Oooh...Oh woah!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I know him!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Decimus, you do NOT!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah I do! I've seen him somewhere...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mon! This way!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two frat-boys rushed through the house, downstairs and into a room at the back. The Swordmaster House Wall of Fame. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...uh....um...Here he is!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDecimus, a tall, blond boy with a slim build, pointed to a pencil-sketch portrait framed in glass. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's him! Fortis Vanderstorm! Oh he was SO cool!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cool?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He could kick your ass in like twelve different ways! And he could fight off like four guys at once! He's badass, man! He could pump iron and stone and he was a BEAST! He was like one of THE best this house ever made! He was a star, dude! He was a member of the Swordmaster Frat, the Bodybuilder Frat, the Hunting Frat, Riding Frat...He OWNED Dragon's Heart!! C'mon! I wanna meet him!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He had some kids with him!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're probably his sons! C'mon!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But Dec...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'MON DAMN IT!

This is too much!\" said Sir Tacitus, \"I demand an explanation at once!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh FINE! We'll SHOW YOU!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tour-party returned to the Swordmasters' House, the fraternity and club-house for the school's expert swordsmen. They headed to the back of the house where a large room showed portraits hung on the back wall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPride of place in the center was an upper-body pencil-drawing of someone that Leo thought looked familiar. Written in neat cursive at the bottom of the sketch was... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Fortis M. Vanderstorm</i>\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey pops! It really is you!\" said Leo, staring at the picture. He noticed a long list under the portrait. \"What's this?\" he asked. He stared at it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Five-star winner of jousting for First Years...Second Years...Third Years...Fourth Years...woah! First-Class Swordsman Award, five years in a row!

Extremely competitive! He won more awards than most people ever do in their lives! Although he still failed his geometry classes...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, so maths wasn't my strong-point...\" Fortis grunted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now boys, thank you for sharing all this\", said Tacitus. \"Doubtless after showering his lordship with praise, he will overlook your thoroughly disrespectful forms of address which attend his latest accomplishments!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" said Brutus. \"OH!! Oh...uh...s-sorry, um...uh...Lord...Va-va-Vanderstorm...sir!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis chuckled. \"It's alright boys, I understand. Gosh...I haven't been inside this place in years!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't understand how it works, papa\", Leo said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, every student joins one of the main houses at Dragon's Heart. They're all about different military disciplines. You join the one which your family joined. It's tradition. You'll join here at Swordmaster's House...when you're old enough.

The houses here serve as club-rooms and meeting-rooms and training-rooms. But you won't be LIVING here...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Certainly not!\" said the headmaster. \"Come along! I'll show you the dormitories and living-quarters! This way!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeo and Jaxxon stared at each other in shock and amazement. Leo gulped! He now felt he had a lot to live up to! At least three generations of Vanderstorm boys had gone to Dragon's Heart, and each generation had come out better than the last! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the tour-party reached the residential areas of the academy campus, the headmaster started more pointing-out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The dormitories are separated by age and grade\", said the headmaster. \"First-years, second-years, and so-on. The normal progression is from the age of nine or ten, up to the age of twenty. Those who want to improve themselves further and become better knights, warriors, combatants or soldiers can take the extended course which is another five years. They graduate at the age of 25! The dormitories are therefore broken into three segments!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe headmaster pointed with his walking-stick. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First-grades to fifth-grades there...that's ten to fifteen years of age! Sixth to tenth grades...there! That's sixteen to twenty years of age! An then there's ten to fifteenth grades! There! That's Twenty-one to twenty-five years of age!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As 'raw recruits', you boys will be in that wing over there. They're divided by floors and ages again. The youngest always on the bottom, older boys on the floors above. You'll sleep in four-bed dormitories, and there are bathrooms at the ends of each corridor. At the end of the buildings are communal rooms - games rooms, common-rooms and such. Beyond there is the Grand Dining Hall. This houses the school kitchens and dining-halls for all the students and staff!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Any questions!?\" Sir Tacitus asked, turning to his group. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uuuh...Do we get to write home?\" Leo asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, you may write home. We have a messenger who leaves the school every Friday evening. Post all letters and parcels home in the mailing-chest in the Great Hall, and they'll be posted for you. Anything else?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think so\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good! I'll show you to your rooms! This way!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe First to Fifth Years' dormitories were mostly empty. As they entered, the saw a tall, scarred man in his office. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Headmaster!\" he shouted, when he saw the man's entrance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah! Boys, this Master Ravenhurst! Master Jonas Ravenhurst teaches Mountanian History. He's also the house-master for the one-to-fives! Master Ravenhurst, these are our two new pupils I was telling you about last week!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I see! You must be young Master Leonardo...and you are Master Jaxxon\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe shook their hands. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened to your face!?\" said Jaxxon, indicating the long, splitting scar, that ran across the man's face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jonas was in one of the Vladian border-skirmishes a couple of years back. He's retired from military life. He now teaches Mountanian Military and National History\", Sir Tacitus explained. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooh...\" said Leo. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shall I take over your tour, Headmaster?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If it's no inconvenience!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No no no! Absolutely not! This way, boys!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe headmaster said his goodbyes, and the house-master led them through the building. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As first-years, you'll be down here on the ground floor. Each dorm-room has bunk-beds. Four boys to a room. You'll each have a desk and a locker and space for personal items. Bathrooms are at the ends of every corridor. Curfew for grades One to Ten, ages ten to twenty, is 10 o'lock every night, unless otherwise stated. And the doors are LOCKED at that time! Curfew for grades Eleven to Fifteen, ages Twenty to Twenty-five, is two o'clock in the morning, unless otherwise stated. But you're too young to worry about that now. Your room will be here...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man opened a room. Fortis entered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooooh man...\" Fortis groaned. \"These rooms still look like crap after all these years...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Be lucky that this is an end-room. You have windows and fresh air and light!\" said the house-master. \"Rooms in the center block of the dormitory building just have tiny little slits in the walls up near the ceilings! This must bring back memories, do they not, Lord Vanderstorm?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah!...Bad memories! I could never sleep on these stupid beds!...And they look a LOT smaller than what they used to!\" </span></div></div>",

He looked the same age as Leonardo. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kannon, this is Leo Vanderstorm. And this is Jaxxon DeJaeger. They'll be your new roommates\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...\" said Kannon. \"Hi\", he said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>Poof!!</b></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah!...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>CRASH!!</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooooww!!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA boy with white blond hair fell off the top bunk and crashed onto the ground! He groaned and massaged his head. The smoke from a recent apparation filled the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Still haven't mastered your teleportation I see, Master Lazarus!\" said Sir Tacitus. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooooow!!\" the boy groaned, massaging his forehead. \"Oh grandpa's gonna KILL ME if I don't pass this test! Oooooh!!\" he groaned. \"I think I twisted my ankle!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh stop crying, Laz!\" Kannon said. \"You can be sick in your own time! This is Leo, and this is Jaxxon\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello!\" said the thin, blond boy, rubbing a growing lump on his forehead from where he'd fallen off the bunk-bed and hurt himself. \"You must be the boys that my brother Merlin talked about!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah\", said Leo, \"Hi!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi! Oooh man I need some ice or somethin'!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll leave you boys to get acquainted. You'll be sharing this room from now on\", said Master Ravenhurst, the housemaster for the 1-5 years' students. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis nodded. \"Bye, son!\" he said. \"Write if you need anything!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure pops!\" said Leo. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be scared!\" said Fortis, when he saw a glint of a tear in his son's eye. \"You're a VANDERSTORM, damn it! No sniffling around here!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes-yessir!\" said Leo, but he still felt a bit uneasy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll look after him, sir\", said Kannon. \"My father told me about things, too!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis nodded. \"Good. Good. Come along, then, Master Ravenhurst, let's leave them be\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n--- --- --- --- <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fortis!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis was preparing to leave Dragon's Heart, along with Bastion. Both men turned. Sir Tacitus VonGewalt, Fortis's uncle-in-law, came jogging up to them! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah?\" Fortis asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C-could I speak to you, privately for a minute?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...yeah...Hold on, Bastion! I got stuff to do!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two men headed around the corner of the campus mews, and the headmaster cleared his throat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fortis...I know I've no right to ask this of you...but...I wondered. Would you be interested in teaching a course here at Dragon's Heart?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis frowned. \"A course...?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Three months! Might become six months! Possibly nine. Maybe a year! Um...the thing is...well...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What IS IT?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We have a course which covers the basics of knighthood. It inspires the boys here who are training to be knights, to pursue their chosen career-paths! But I'm having a lot of trouble finding someone who will do it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh it's easy! Just teach them what they have to do, explain the equipment, the fighting, the armour, the weapons and how they're used! Make it fun and interesting!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why ME?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Weeeeell, no knights from any of the other knightly orders of the kingdom have replied to my messages, and those which have, have all declined the offer. And I thought that you would be ideally...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean because I was the school's prize star pupil for...ten years...you want me to come back and teach it all!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Fortis please! It would be excellent for the boys to see what they could REALLY achieve when they see you! And um...it would make young Leonardo's time here, his first year...more comfortable...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It would pay well!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah? How well?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Five thousand sovereigns a month!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT!?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is a...a rather specialised set of classes and lessons. And very few people can teach it. So the money is very high indeed...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis whistled. He swayed back and forth on his feet, turning the thing over in his mind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gurgh! Oh fine!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excellent! I'll see you in a month!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A...WHAT!? WAIT A MINUTE!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See you in four weeks, Fortis! Give my love to your wife!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"BUT!...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can think up everything you want to teach them! It'll be fun!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But!...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll have comfortable lodgings and excellent food!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, but!...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Goodbye!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooooooooooooooh SHIT!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong?\" Bastion DeJaeger asked, when Fortis returned to the carriage. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Never mind!\" Fortis grunted. \"Let's get the hell out of here!\" </span></div></div>",

Let ME do it!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh alright...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKannon Adlerseele opened Leo's trunk.

The door opened. Master Ravenhurst was standing in the doorway. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good day, boys. Kannon, the boys will be following YOUR timetable for this year. I've made copies of it, for them to carry around\". The house-master handed them sheets of paper. \"I suggest you make copies of them yourselves, boys, and keep them somewhere safe, in your beds or in your trunks or lockers, in case your original copies get lost. All the books you'll need for your lessons will be on the bookcase over there in the corner of your dorm-room\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes sir\", said Leonardo, \"Thank you, Master Ravenhurst\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man nodded and left the room. \"Dinner in...four hours. You'll start lessons tomorrow!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes sir!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll soon get used to everything\", said Kannon. \"Wakeup is at eight. Breakfast is eight-thirty. Classes start at nine. Then ten, then eleven. At noon we stop for an hour for lunch and play. Then it's one to two, and then two to three, and that's when class ends. And we can do whatever we want, or go to club-meetings and stuff\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh that sounds cool!\" said Jaxxon, kicking his trunk under his bed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, I'll show you around, so long as Stupido the Magnificent here doesn't set the beds on fire!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OH ONE TIME!!\" Lazarus shouted. \"So I got a little enthusiastic with the fire-casting spell!\" <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I thought the magic school was across the river?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is!\" said Kannon. \"But we tend to share facilities every now and then\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is there anything we should know about how stuff...'works'...around here?\" Jaxxon asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKannon frowned. \"Yeah\", he said. \"Be careful around the older boys. Well, not all of them, but some can be real pains in the ass. Trust me, you'll see them when ad know them when I point them out to you\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" Jaxxon asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll recognise them for what they are, the moment you see them\", Kannon said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Most people aren't that bully-ish around here though\", said Lazarus. \"Probably because everyone knows that everyone else around here can kick their ass!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeonardo laughed. He guessed that made a lot of sense. In a school where combat-training and jousting made up physical education classes, it was unlikely that anyone picked a fight with anyone, knowing full well they'd have a real beatdown on their hands. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe main quadrangle was packed with students. They were playing cards, or chess, or coin-tosses, a few were doing push-up and sit-up contests. One teen with very short blond hair had two smaller boys sitting on his back while he did push-ups on the grass, with all his friends looking on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever you do, don't ever be late back to your dorm-buildings. The doors lock at ten o'clock. And if you're caught out...you're stuffed\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is there any way in?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's two sets of doors, and they're both locked at ten. If you're lucky, you'll know someone who sleeps on a ground-floor room with a window. You COULD sneak in that way\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WE sleep on a ground-floor room with windows!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Haha, yeah we do. So I guess we're luckier than most...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe four boys wandered through the school, chatting and laughing, while Kannon pointed out various rooms and buildings. Leo was about to ask where the library was, when a bell started ringing somewhere. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! Dinner!\" said Kannon, \"C'mon guys! Move it! Or we won't get good seats!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt once, throngs of hungry boys and young men charged towards a huge building with towering stained-glass windows. They headed inside and lined up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do we do this?\" Leo asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Take a tray, and a plate, a fork, knife, spoon, a bowl if you want it, a beaker, and then get in line!\" Kannon said. \"Hurry up! Or all the good food will be gone!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boys streamed past the buffet set at one end of the huge dining-hall, helping themselves to the food. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd what food! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBread-rolls, sausages, steaks, mustard, tomato ketchup, pasta, crisp garden salads, smoked salmon, cold ham, bacon, baked potatoes, four different roast meats, thick, tangy soups, and delicious fried eggs! At the other end of the room was another long buffet table, filled with desserts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll come back for that!\" said Lazarus, \"C'mon guys! Let's find our table!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boys managed to stake out the end of a long table at the back of the room, and sat down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man this place is packed!\" said Leo. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah!\" said Kannon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't the teachers eat here?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! The schoolmasters dine at the Headmaster's Residence\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh. So what happens if there's...something here?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The school prefects handle it\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who are they?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKannon pointed out tall, burly, bare-chested boys, much older, eighteen at least, with brass badges on their waists. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeo stared around. There was a lot to take in here! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man this is crazy!\" Jaxxon hissed. \"I dunno how we're ever gonna get used to this!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeo nodded. \"Totally!\" he hissed back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeo finished off his food and wiped his mouth on his napkin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey where's the desserts?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Over there!\" said Kannon. \"That long table at the other end of the room!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! Okay\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stack your dirty plates and stuff by the kitchen, and then get fresh ones!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeo did as he was told, got a fresh tray, plate, bowl and spoon, and headed towards the dessert-counter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne look told Leonardo that the school HAD to employ Fatlantean chefs. There was so much amazing stuff here! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlueberry pie, strawberry shortcake, buttery soft shortbread-cookies, sticky date puddings, and incredible firebrand custard! A cold, yellow, goopy thing set into little bowls, sprinkled with sugar and then blasted with flames to caramelise it. Leo took two or three of those! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeo picked up a few other things for his friends, and then headed back to their table, beginning to regret their decision to eat right in the corner! It was a long walk, made even longer by having to weave in and out of people's legs and other students moving around in search of more food. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><i>Crash!!</i></b> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeo was so busy trying to find his way back to his table that he crashed right into something! His own tray of food was fine, but the other guy had spilled his food everywhere! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey watch it you little fuck punk!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeo stared up at a huge tower of a boy. He had to be seven or eight feet tall at least, with short, blond hair and a pale complexion, but with an impressive build, nonetheless! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-sorry!\" Leo gasped. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"SORRY!? THESE ARE NEW BRITCHES YOU LITTLE SHIT!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...oh...um...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Voltus man, calm down...\" said a voice next to him. \"The kid's new here!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't give a shit if he was born last week! Pick it up!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeo put down his own tray of food and bent down to pick up the dropped tray and the bowl and plate and cutlery. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now go and get my dinner!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-what!? I dunno what you were eating!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then find out!\" the older boy shouted, pushing Leo back until he fell over! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Voltus! I said that's enough!\" said the voice from earlier. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up, Brutus! The little punk has to learn who's boss around here!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh jeez, not this crap again! Voltus shut up and sit down! Hey kid! C'mere!...Oh crap!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeo got to his feet and turned to the boy sitting at the table across the aisle and gawped when he recognised the tanned, brown-haired, muscular form of one of the teens who had chased after his father earlier that day! Brutus stared at Leo in shock! Then he got up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YOU IDIOT, VOLTUS!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What!? Now you're defending this little prick!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"THIS little PRICK is the son of Fortis Vanderstorm!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last words rippled through the dining-hall, and a silence rumbled through the room after it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh piss off!\" said Voltus, \"This little shit!?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's your name, kid?\" said another senior, who had apparently taken an interest in the proceedings. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"L-Leo!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your FULL NAME, kid!\" the older boy said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...oh! Um...L-Leonardo Fortis sir. L-Leonardo Fortis V-Van-Vanderstorm!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt once, people started talking. Leo felt rather bashful! Even Voltus looked extremely guilty!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I um...um...sorry!\" he said at once. \"Here, l-le-lemme take that for yah!\" he said, snatching up Leo's tray and shoving his way through the crowds, \"hey move it you assholes! My little buddy Leo's comin' through here! Taurus! Move your ass!...Here you go, little buddy! Where you sittin' down? Over here? Okay...There you go! Have a nice dessert, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...um...uh...y-yeah, t-thanks Voltus...\" said Leo, rather taken aback! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey uh, n-no hard feelings, yeah? I knew who you was! I was just um...testin' yah! Seein' if you was tough like your old man! Yeah! Th-that was all!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...Sure Voltus\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"R-right! Um...Bye!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was THAT about!?\" Kannon asked. \"Voltus Tynus is the biggest bully in the entire school! He's eatin' out of your hand!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...uh...I dunno!\" said Leo. </span></div></div>",

What are you!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...Squires!\" said one boy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NO! WHAT ARE YOU!?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pages, sir!\" said Leonardo. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very good!\" said a stout, bullish man with thick arms and a large, hairy body. \"You are PAGES! I will be showing you some of the skills you will need. I will not cover everything, that is the job of your masters! MY task is simply to build on what they have already shown you, so that you do not become rusty! Every boy will select a sword and form two rows!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvery boy hurried forwards and picked up a wooden sword and a small, wooden shield, then lined up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Closer! Closer!...That's right! Good! Very good...Now...Your sword is held in your...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right hand!\" Jaxxon shouted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good! RIGHT HANDS, EVERYBODY! Your shield is in your left! Or if no shield, then your dagger!...YOUR RIGHT HAND, MASTER ICARUS! RIGHT!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! So-sorry...\" said a timid, blond boy, and quickly changed hands. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Boys on THIS side...FORWARDS! Boys here! STAY! Boys here, STRIKE! Boys here, deflect! DOWN!...You step BACK and OUT! Remember - You CREATE distance, or you REMOVE distance! You don't stand around like an idiot waiting for your partner to do something FOR you! That's how you get STABBED!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir combat-master strolled around, watching the boys. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No no no! Don't GRAB IT! Deflect it, boy! Back! Like this! YAH!! That's a BLADE! Not your grandmother's broomstick! You do that in a REAL battle, boy, you'll slice off all of your fingers!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeo and Jaxxon were fighting together, back and forth, up and down. Their combat-master nodded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excellent! Jaxxon! Move your feet, boy! Leo, slow down! This isn't a race!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-sorry sir!\" Leo said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very good! Very good! Ah! Careful! SIDE ON, BOY! You want to be stabbed in the guts!?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter several minutes, their combat-master blew a whistle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright boys! That's enough! Put down your swords! Now we'll discuss disarming tactics! As always, distance! Use it, or lose it! Either get AWAY!...Or if you cannot get away, then get IN! And give them a bloody hard time of it! Um...Vanderstorm! Come here!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeo got up from the grass. Their combat-master pulled out a wooden dagger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Disarm me, boy!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um....okay!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeo moved in and reached up for the dagger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No no no! I'm not going to GIVE you the bloody thing! This is MY dagger! Not your birthday present, boy! TAKE IT!!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome of the other boys laughed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"COME ON BOY! I'LL STAB YOU ROTTEN! DO IT!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeo remembered something he'd seen his father do. He moved in, locked his leg behind the schoolmaster's, jerked back and pushed forwards! Then, he threw himself on top and twisted the dagger from the man's hand by grabbing his wrist and jerking it hard! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Agh!\" the man grunted. He got to his feet and brushed himself down! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very good! Very good! Be CREATIVE, boys! You have to learn how to work with what you have! Leo closed the distance and got near enough to disarm me! He put me down! A distraction! Very good! Now, I want each of you to take a dagger, and practice with your partner!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSchool went on like this for most of the day. Combat-training, then horsemanship, then lunch, then English, Latin and Mathematics, and then dinner. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was no homework issued to the children. This was a longstanding Dragon's Heart tradition. Much of the education at Dragon's Heart was extremely physical, there was nothing to be gained by also taxing their brains as well as their bodies, and most boys just wanted to relax at the end of the day. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took about two weeks for Leonardo and Jaxxon to establish something resembling a routine. They regularly hung out together, and Kannon showed them how things worked around the school. Lazarus wasn't a student of Dragon's Heart, but he was a pupil at the Silver Star College of Witchcraft and Wizardry, which had a campus across the river. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStudents from both schools often crossed the bridge which joined them together, making use of each others' facilities, although there was a strict 10 o'clock curfew, after which, the bridge-gates were locked, not to be reopened until dawn the next day. </span></div></div>",

He blew out the candles and left his office, heading down the corridor to the master bedroom. He opened the door, slammed it, and heavy footsteps crossed the room.

This will only take an hour, in the Assembly Hall, and then you may leave and return to your dormitories and common-rooms for the rest of the night! So will all boys in First to Tenth Grades currently training to be knights, head to the Assembly Hall! Thank you!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why do we have to have ANOTHER combat-teacher?\" Kannon whispered. \"Isn't Mr. Bannus enough?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mr. B. teaches attack and defense, swordfighting and dagger-skills, shield-stuff...there's more to being a knight than that!\" said Jaxxon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah\", said Leo. \"I wonder who he is?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boys headed into the Assembly Hall and sat down near the front. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright boys!\" said Sir Tacitus. \"I'm about to introduce you to your new Knighthood Training Master. I know you're all very eager for this!...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YEAH!!\" an older boy about eighteen at the back yelled out. Some boys laughed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Voltus, thank you! Now I have the VERY great privilege and honour, to introduce to you one of the BEST knights currently in our king's military service! He has won The King's Medal of Valour three times, The Golden Cross twice, he has reached the very HIGHEST rank of knightly promotion and is the head of his knightly order, the prestigious Royal Order of the Dragon!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRumbled whispers rolled around the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will you come out onto the stage, please?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe stage creaked. Steel clanked and clinked. A towering giant of a knight dressed in full battle-gear, wearing a large, ceremonial cloak and helmet lumbered onto the stage. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wooooaaaaaah...\" said an older boy behind Leo, \"He looks badass!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wonder who it is!?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sir Fortis, will you remove your helmet, please?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe knight lifted off his helmet and put on a table on the stage, and then peeled off the chainmail hood, and the woolen protective hood which was underneath that, as well! Long, thick blond hair flowed out, and a grizzled, stubbled face stared around the room. People started talking at once! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Leo! It's your paw!\" Kannon hissed. Leonardo's jaw dropped! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no!\" he groaned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mon man! He's cool!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's gonna embarrass me, I'm sure!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Naw man! Your old man's kickass! He would NEVER do something THAT uncool!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeo gulped. He hoped Kannon was right! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA loud, rumbling echoed around the room. Fortis started pacing back and forth, his armour clinking softly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"MY NAME!...\" he rumbled, it echoed through the chamber. \"IS...Lord Sir Fortis Maximus Vanderstorm...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGasps echoed everywhere. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Knight-Commander of the Order of the Dragon, Knight Grand-Cross of the Order of the Dragon. I am a veteran of four Vladian wars. I graduated with full colours from Dragon's Heart at the age of twenty-five. I was a page and squire like you! I know how hard this crap is! Being a knight is not easy!...You!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe pointed to a boy of Leonardo's age. Leo recognised the boy as Icarus, the boy who had fallen foul of their swordplay master. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here! Now!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy hurried up on stage. Fortis unsheathed his sword. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold this!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy grabbed the sword. It was immense! Fifty pounds of solid steel at least! He gasped and it crashed to the stage! Fortis picked it up and whirled it over his head with one hand. The boys gasped! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, you like that don'tcha!? You wanna learn how to stuff like that!? I'm gonna show you! It's my job to show you EVERYTHING you need to know, if you expect to be a REAL KNIGHT and how to KICK ASS!\" he roared. The boys chattered loudly now! They were getting really excited! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Some of this crap is gonna be boring! Some of it might be fun!...ALL OF IT is important!...Any questions!?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA boy of twenty at the back put his hand up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you that guy who has that big statue outside Swordmaster House?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Does the plaque say Fortis M. Vanderstorm?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's me\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wooooaaaaah...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anything else?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo-one else raised their hands. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right! I'll see you tomorrow, starting with the first-years!\" Fortis said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, boys!\" said Sir Tacitus, \"You can return to your dormitory rooms, now!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeo and Jaxxon and Kannon rushed up onto the stage. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi papa!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis turned. \"Hey son!\" he said. \"How's school, huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine papa! Wow so you're really gonna teach the whole school!?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll be teaching two thirds of it, yes. Not the older boys, they should know most of this stuff, but those boys who are still training, yes\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cool!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah yeah, don't expect no special treatment, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay papa...sure papa...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis smiled. He ruffled his son's head. \"Alright kids, scram!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is so cool!\" said Kannon. \"Wait til the others hear about this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NO!\" said Leo. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NO! Kannon you can't tell ANYONE!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why not!?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's embarrassing!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKannon sighed. \"Yeah but...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kan, NO!\" said Jaxxon, \"Leo's right. Let the other guys find out by themselves, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh alright...\" said Kannon. \"Spoilsport...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they reached their dormitory, they passed by their windows to head to the back doors. Suddenly, there was a loud blast! The window-glass blew out followed by a huge fireball and plumes of smoke! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"LAZARUS!!!\" Kannon shouted. A sooty blond boy stuck his head out of the broken window. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-sorry! I was trying to light a candle!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great! NOW where we gonna sleep tonight!? This sucks!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope he didn't burn everything!\" Leo groaned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mon, let's go see what kinda damage he did...\" Jaxxon said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm SORRY!\" Lazarus said. </span></div></div>",

They were large, of course, but they weren't as large as the bed Leo had at home. Not big enough to just spread out in and roll around on. There was enough room to lie down comfortably and sleep, but that was about it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn bed, Leo wrapped his arms around his plush-kitty. He stroked Mortimer's fuzzy, wooly body and hugged him close to his chest. His one, precious little link with home.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A group of two dozen boys sat on the grass. Fortis stared them over. He sighed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGosh he knew what it was like. Sitting there, not knowing a damn thing... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe cleared his throat and headed outside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning, class\", he said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning, Sir Fortis!\" the boys all said in unison. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right. Mr. Bannus has told me about your swordplay training and your attack and defense. And that's all very important. But a knight does a lot more than just wave a sword around. A knight also has to know how to ride a horse!...How many of you here, ride?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMost boys put their hands up. Leonardo, Kannon and Jaxxon among them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, good. One of the most important parts of being a knight is knowing how to ride. And there are many parts to being a knight. You must master a wide range of skills! This is why not everyone can become a knight! BUT...those who do, must be, and will be, exceptional at everything that they do\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll start today with some of the basics. I want you to identify everything that I'm wearing\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis had been walking back and forth, dressed in his armour. \"Let's see...You!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe pointed at Icarus. \"Come up here, boy...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIcarus stepped forwards. Fortis handed him a wooden rod. \"Start! Top down!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...Helmet...visor...gorget...um...shoulder-plates?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Besagues! These protect your shoulders and upper-arms!...Carry on!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, uh, besagues! Upper vambraces, lower vambraces, couters...gauntlets...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, good...An upper vambrace is also called a...WHAT?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...um...rerebrace!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good! What else?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tasset...Cuisses, poleyns...um..fauld on the insides...tassets on the outsides...um...yeah!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You forgot something\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...um...eh...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis glanced at his feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! Um...sabatons!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good! Now you can get dressed! But you still have to know how to use a sword! That's another part of being a knight!...You!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKannon stood up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come here...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis drew out his sword. \"Identify!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...cross-guard, blade, edge, point, grip or handle...blood-channel...uuh...scabbard...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You missed something\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...what?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis twisted the sword in his hand and thrust backwards! He missed Kannon's head by an inch!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The POMMEL, boy! When you're fighting more than one opponent, you SWING! forwards! You swing back! THRUST! There's another bastard behind you!...WHAM!! Right in the face!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe class laughed and clapped loudly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"EVERY part of your sword is there for a PURPOSE! Not just to look cute! If you don't know what that purpose IS, you'll never make full use of it! WHAT is the purpose of the pommel!?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeo put up his hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, boy?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To strike your opponents, to give balance to the sword, and to help maintain a grip!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excellent! Your father must've taught YOU very well!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeo struggled not to laugh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, let's see how much you've learned from Mr. Bannus...um...you!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe pointed at Leonardo again. \"Come here!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeo stepped forwards. Fortis handed him a smaller sword. Fortis swung his sword through the air! Leo ducked and threw his up! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><i>CLANG!!! </i></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe jarring vibrations rattled through Leo's body so hard, he thought his eyes might pop out! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Left!...Right! Down! UP BOY! UP! SIDE ON! Good! Good! Back! Don't just stand there! Move around! Make it DIFFICULT for me! EASY for you! You STAND THERE, it's easy for me because you're not moving around! YOU move, it's harder for me! You move AROUND me, you can hit me where I can't reach! Come on, boy!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeo swung his sword around, left, right, ducking and weaving. Fortis matched every strike and swing! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good! Good!...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis connected with Leo's sword, ran his blade all the way up the edge and smashed into the cross-guard at the end! The force ripped the sword from Leo's hand! It spun out, flipped through the air and hit the ground several feet away! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis shook his head. \"You're good...\" he said, \"But always remember to keep BOTH hands on your sword as often as possible! Or else it's FAR too easy to disarm you! See?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes f...yes sir!\" said Leo. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis patted his son on the shoulder. He bent down, as if smoothing out his clothes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not bad, son...not bad...\" he whispered in his ear. \"Go sit down\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis spent the rest of the lesson testing the sword-skills of the other students, before pairing them off and watching them duel each other. At midday, the bell tolled for lunch. Everyone had crowded around Leo as he headed back to the school campus. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Boys! You're all squires now\", Fortis said, as the lunch-bell tolled. \"That means more advanced training. In our next lesson, we'll be going over riding, and using the quintain! I hope you boys all have good balance!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Vanderstorm!\" said one of the boys, running up to Leo. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boys were heading back to the school dining-hall now, ready for lunch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you KNOW that guy or something?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...why?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well me and some of the other boys was watchin'. That guy is SCARY!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Scary?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's HUGE! And he could rip our guts out with his bare hands if he wanted to! You were the only one in the entire class who didn't drop his sword!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...oh!\" said Leo. \"Um...I guess I'm...just...um...just have a better grip\", he said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's GOTTA be more than that!\" said Icarus, hurrying up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It...it isn't, really!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKannon stared at Leo. He opened his mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't you dare!\" Leo hissed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't dare he do what?\" Icarus asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, four older boys came past. They were all seventeen or eighteen-year-old teenagers. A couple, Leonardo recognised from the swordplay fraternity house. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Vanderstorm! Your old man's pretty cool!\" <br>\r\n\"He can kick ass, though!...Damn it he kicked mine! I can't even walk straight!\" <br>\r\n\"No WONDER he was the school's star athlete and warrior!\" <br>\r\n\"You gonna be like him one day, huh Leo?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe four older boys laughed and headed off. Leo froze as every single one of his classmates surrounded him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's your FATHER!?\" the boy from earlier, Wolvern, shouted! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...um...y-yeah...um...w-wasn't that obvious?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! I mean...he's GIGANTIC! And you're...Well...you're not SMALL...but...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No WONDER you weren't scared!\" <br>\r\n\"What's he like!?\"<br>\r\n\"Is he really as cool as they always say!?\" <br>\r\n\"I bet your old man could kill all of us with one hand!\" <br>\r\n\"Leo you must be SO GOOD at...EVERYTHING!!...if you've got Fortis Vanderstorm for a father! He carried off every single prize the school has!!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeo blushed. \"I...I...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey guys shut up!\" Jaxxon said, \"And if we don't hurry, we're not gonna get lunch! Now move it!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Something small and fuzzy lay on his chest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHoppit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby and Emerald, Fortis's two youngest twin daughters, had insisted that their father take Hoppit with him, to keep him company at night.

But he didn't want to disappoint his daughters. Besides, at home, they were probably cuddling up to the real thing - their pet bunnies, Nutmeg and Cinnamon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr, even more likely, cuddling up against the body of the next big, muscular male in the Vanderstorm household.

There was nothing there apart from a shield attached to an arm. On the other end of the arm was a sack of sand. The whole thing was balanced on a pivoting, swinging post and stand. A quintain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA loud horse-whinny echoed across the grounds. A powerful chestnut steed came thundering past! A flash of steel! A crunching noise! A whirl of dust!...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd the shield lay on the ground, cracked and shattered to pieces. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis Vanderstorm brought the horse around and dismounted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good afternoon, class!\" he shouted, landing on his feet, wearing his battle-armour. \"Today, we're gonna be practicing your horseback combat!

Fortis backed away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I ain't here!\" Fortis said. \"YOU get up on the horse!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nXerxes stared at Vortex, a tower of muscle and sinew, just like his master.

Um...\" He grabbed the reins, put his right foot in one of the stirrups and then, pushing down hard, threw his left foot up and over! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WOAH!!\" he yelped, and crashed down the other side! \"Ow! My arm!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other boys laughed. Fortis chuckled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mon boy! You know it helps if you lean forwards!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! Um...Right!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nXerxes tried again. He remounted the horse, leaning forwards, bracing himself against the horse's neck using his arms. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good! Good! Alright! Ride! Once around the tree at the end of the field, and back!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay! C'-C'mon, Vortex! Uh...G-Good horsey!...uh...Tch-tch-tch?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nXerxes shifted his legs slightly and squeezed the horse's flanks. It snorted and started trotting off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"While we're young, Xerks!\" another boy shouted out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who was that!?\" Fortis snapped. A boy put his hand up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Silas, you just volunteered to go next!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone laughed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nXerxes returned a few minutes later, and slowly dismounted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How was that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-not bad! But it's kinda weird being so high up!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll get used to it! Silas! Up!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilas put his right foot into the stirrup on the right side of the horse, and then reached up. He grabbed the reins but his hand slipped! He snatched out wildly and his hand caught Vortex's mane! The horse snorted and whinnyed loudly! Silas yelped! Suddenly, Vortex was off! Silas slipped and fell backwards, his right foot hooked into the stirrup! He screamed as he was dragged across the ground on his back! The other boys screamed and hooted with laughter! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"VORTEX!\" Fortis shouted, \"Come back!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I got it, papa!\" Leo shouted. He sprinted after the horse! \"Vortex! Vortex calm down!\" he shouted. He cut across the horse's path, holding out his arms and barring the horse's route. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Calm down Vortex! Calm down! It's me! It's Leo! You know Leo! It's okay! Good horsey! Good horsey! What did that bad naughty boy Silas do to you? Did he try and pull off your mane!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"BAD NAUGHTY SILAS!? That horse nearly killed me!\" Silas gasped, finally getting his leg out of the stirrup! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh don't be an idiot, Silas! Vortex is sweet!\" said Leo, patting the horse affectionately. \"Aren't you, Vortex?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><i>SLURP!!</i></b> <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"EEEWW! OH GROSS! HORSE-SLOBBER! VORTEX!!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving recovered the horse, Fortis sent every other boy around the tree on Vortex's back. Most did very well. A couple fell off, one or two found the horse hard to control. Leonardo did the best of all of them, though. Having grown up with the horse, Leo knew how it behaved. He galloped at full-speed across the field, rounded the tree at the end, galloped back, whipped past the class and then slowed to a canter, then a walk, then a trot, then he dismounted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excellent!\" said Fortis. \"Well...apart from Silas. He'll be in the school infirmary with that twisted ankle of his for a few days...Now! Let's move onto the quintain! You should all know how this works, so I don't have to explain it to you. But just so we're clear, what is a quintain used for?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Target-practice for jousting and horseback swordfighting, sir!\" said one of the boys, loudly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good! So you're not all idiots!...That's a relief!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone laughed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right! I want you all to pick a practice-sword, line up and then you'll mount Vortex, ride down, strike the target and then ride back! If you fail, then you ride down again! You'll do it until you hit it! Once you hit, you dismount, and the next boy goes! Right! And remember, this isn't some walk in the park! You're expected to put some speed into this! No knight ever killed a guy by going out for an evening walk!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

They didn't hear the 'salutation' at first. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I said 'Hey you!' Vanderstorm! Get your papa's-boy butt over here!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaxxon gripped Leo by the shoulder and turned. He saw a youth of about eighteen or nineteen standing outside one of the school fraternity-houses. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ignore him!\" Jaxxon hissed as they walked nearer, and then started walking back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Flavius leave the kid alone!\" another older-voiced boy said. \"It's not his damn fault you suck!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HEY FUCK YOU! VANDERSTORM! GET THE FUCK OVER HERE!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ignore him!\" Jaxxon hissed. Leo took a deep breath and let it out slowly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeonardo tried, but then things changed when they heard heavy footsteps coming up behind them! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you a fucking TREE or something!? I SAID GET THE FUCK OVER HERE!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeo winced when he felt a hand grab his shoulder and spin him around! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeonardo was a fast grower. Like his father before him, Leo was already six feet tall. And he wasn't even approaching his teenage years yet. But the boy who accosted him was even larger! He towered over the youth at least another two feet! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Leo knew what was happening, a fist hit him in the face! He gasped when he felt blood running down his nose! Warm, salty and sharp! He fell to the ground and staggered up again! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your old man failed my unarmed combat! Who the hell does he think he is!? I can fight just as good as anyone else! Get up!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Flavius! Stop it!\" a voice shouted. Leo gasped and wiped the blood from his nose. He put up his hands as if he was trying to diffuse the situation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What!? You can't fight like your old man!? Yah!\" the enraged Flavius snapped, flicking another punch that missed Leo's head by an inch! Leo ducked and punched back! He hit Flavius in the chest! A heavy, meaty 'thunk!!' Leo tried not to show that the punch did more to him than it did to the much older, taller, stronger boy he was fighting! Flavius kept punching! Leo ducked and scooted back! He tried to remember what his father had taught him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Combat of any kind is a door on its hinges. Open it or close it! Never leave it ajar! </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeo ducked back! Then he swung around! He kicked Flavius hard in the ribs! The older boy was caught off-guard and let out a loud grunt of surprise! He staggered back! Leo shifted in! Whunk! Whunk! Crack!! He punched Flavius hard in the chest, jaw and face! The last strike repaid the bloody nose! By now, a small crowd had formed. Flavius was taller, stronger and bulkier, but Leo had the advantage of speed. And a vicious right hook. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYears of archery practice had built up Leo's torso and upper-body. Pulling and flexing bowstrings, lifting the heavy wooden bows and firing countless arrows had given him a powerful chest, back and arms. He was able to land vicious blows, one after the other, after the other! Older boys watched as the young tornado ripped into his opponent! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"STOP THIS AT ONCE!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSir Tacitus broke through the crowd, waving his walking-stick through the air. \"Flavius! Leonardo! MY OFFICE! NOW!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n--- --- --- --- <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because...you are my niece's firstborn child and son, and heir to your father's title, fortunes and estates, I will grant you this ONE chance to exploit nepotism, and let you tell your side of the story FIRST\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite being in his seventies, Sir Tacitus VonGewalt was a hard man. He was not especially tall or muscular. He didn't look like an old war-dog like his brother Venatarius, but he nonetheless managed to command respect. Leo gulped. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing happened, Uncle Tacitus. We were walking back to our dormitory after talking to you and papa! We didn't know anything! And he started shouting and swearing at us, and telling us all these things and calling us names!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then you should ignore it!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We DID! He came after us! He grabbed me and nearly ripped my arm off!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you hit him!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not first! Jaxxon and Kannon were there! That Flavius guy hit me first! I think he broke my nose!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then what?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I didn't have a choice! I hit him back!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You didn't have a choice!? You could've walked away!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And had my head ripped off!?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTacitus nodded. \"Well, then what?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dunno! Everything just went nuts!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you fought him after his provocation\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And from what I saw, you probably beat him\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-well...um...I...maybe...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSir Tacitus chuckled. \"Leonardo you are REALLY your father's son! Very well. You may leave\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-what?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dragon's Heart Academy is a military training school, my boy! If you can't hold your own in a one-on-one fight you have no business here! I can see that you have inherited your father's fighting spirit! Very commendable!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeo blushed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I shall tell your father about this and explain things to him. But you better get that nose of yours attended to! Get your friends to take you to the school infirmary\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe headmaster struck a bell on his desk. A young man entered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Master Leonardo is not to receive any punishment. Fighting in self-defence is not a crime\", said Sir Tacitus. \"Escort him outside and see that his friends take him to see the matron. Then, send in young Master Flavius\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes sir!\" said the headmaster's secretary. </span></div></div>",

His back burned with the welts of the heavy whip that had sliced into his skin. It stung like a million needles from where salty water had been washed over the wounds to keep them clean. A dozen vicious lashes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, he sat at the back of a group of upperclassmen. Older teenagers who were in their secondary stages of schooling at Dragon's Heart Military Academy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOriginally, Fortis had only agreed to teaching the younger children how to do the basics of being a knight. But eagerness and pressure from older students meant that he'd started teaching them, as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright!\" said Fortis. \"Today I'm gonna be teaching you unarmed combat. This is something you all need to know! How to fight without a weapon! You won't always have your sword! You won't always have a shield or a dagger or a spear or a crossbow or anything like that! Today I am going to teach you how to literally kick someone's ass!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis stared around. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Brutus!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tall, bronzed, brown-haired hunk got to his feet. \"Sir!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get over here\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrutus stepped eagerly forwards. He stood in front of his classmates at the edge of a sporting-field. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis handed him a sword. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have disarmed me. I don't have a dagger, I don't have my sword. I don't have my shield. You are attacking me. What do I do?...Go on!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! Uh...okay...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrutus swung his sword down! Fortis threw a left arm up! He blocked the downward sword-swing, twisted his wrist, grasped Brutus's arm, grabbed his wrist with his other arm and bent! Brutus grunted! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Twist his arm! Back! Back! Back! CONTROL IT! Make sure he can't use this thing to do anything against you!...Get...BEHIND!...HIM!...And TWIST!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AUGH!!\" Brutus yelped. A jolt of pain shot up his arm and he dropped the sword on the ground! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There!\" said Fortis. \"Now...We're both disarmed. Now what?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...Unarmed combat\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good! You're all big strong boys! I assume you all know how to throw a punch?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey all nodded confidently. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright. But do you know how to fight? When you're doing this on the battlefield, you don't want to be disarmed too long. You want a quick fist-fight to beat the crap out of your enemy so that you can go and pick up your sword again! That's what I'm going to teach you. You have to learn how to move fast and decisively. How to make blows that count!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis looked at the small crowd. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sit down, Brutus. Flavius! Come here!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhispers started at once. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlavius took a deep breath in...and out. He got slowly to his feet and walked forwards. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes yes yes, we've all heard!\" said Fortis. He paused. \"Who hasn't heard?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA couple of hands went up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooh...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boys laughed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Flavius here picked a fight with a boy. A boy half his age, and a boy half his size. A boy who beat him up and broke his nose. My boy. Leonardo\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YEAH!\" someone shouted at the back. More boys laughed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This proves two things. That I know how to teach, and that Flavius does NOT know how to fight. Today I hope to remedy this issue. For all of you\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis stared at his class. \"Alright boys! Stop! Stop! Get up! Get into pairs. I want you all to practice simple takedown maneuvers. How to get your opponent on the ground, so that you can make a kill-thrust with your sword or knife. I'll show you a few here, using Flavius...\" </span></div></div>",

Chill OUT, Forty! We're havin' fun here!\" said Excalibur. A senseless Karenina sank to the floor, groaning in foggy bliss. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do...I...GET OUT!\" Fortis shouted at Karenina. She staggered to her feet. She snatched up her dropped clothes, and hobbled out of the underside of the spectator-stand, walking decidedly bow-legged. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT WERE YOU DOING!?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...testing the fit?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YOU FUCKING IDIOT!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nExcalibur ducked as Fortis swung a fist through the air!

If you'll write out a letter to my dictation, we can have it done at once\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two women headed to the castle library and sat down at a desk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who do I write it to?\" Eldonia asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"King Hercules\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Her...Oh yes I forgot you were friends! Okay...Wait...who is this painter?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The court painter, of course! I'm only going to use the best!\" said Athena. \"I'll not be paying some talentless hack good money for rubbish!

He slowly opened his eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething was wrong...what was it? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bed was very small...no that wasn't it...He rubbed his eyes. As his vision cleared, he realised what it was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bed was empty! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Girl?\" he rumbled. He got up. \"Girl!?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe shuffled to the door and headed downstairs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"GIRL!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis lumbered into the dining-room. The entire Vanderstorm family was gathered there. The housemaids curtsied as their master entered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning, my lord\", said Eliza. Fortis grunted. His dark blond hair was a mess, he was naked apart from his undershorts, and he looked exhausted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, someone slept in...\" said Jupiter. Cannius laughed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Boys, enough!\" said Athena. \"Good morning, Fortis\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gramma...\" Fortis mumbled. He sat down heavily and stared around. It was so strange to be back... At the other end of the table, Eldonia sat with her father while she played with her three daughters. His three daughters. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThree girls...what a nightmare. Dowries and husbands and boyfriends and...oy... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis felt a slender arm around his own massive bicep. He looked to his right. He smiled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey girl...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You sleep well?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You saying I don't sleep well when I sleep with you?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course not!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmm...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aaah! Forty! Don't muss up my hair! I just combed it!...Oh great now I have to do it again...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVesta laughed. She kissed her husband. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooooooh!\" said Leo. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Boy! You keep it shut!\" Fortis barked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeo ducked his head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo boys of five toddled up to their father. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi papa!\"<br>\r\n\"Hi papa!\" <br>\r\n\"We love you!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis let out a weak grin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Boys\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awwwww!!\" said Minerva, as Thunder and Gabriel hugged their father. Fortis smiled and wrapped them in his huge arms. He ruffled their heads and kissed them both. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go on! Go eat your breakfast...Leo! You got two brothers and three sisters. You used to it yet?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes papa!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis laughed. \"Suuuure...\" he said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Ares! You naughty boy!\" said Minerva, cleaning the porridge off of Ares's cheek. \"The spoon goes IN the mouth! Good boy! Good boy...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ama! Who dat?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This? This is your Uncle Fortis!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Waaaaaaah!! Uckle Forest skawey!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nuuugggaaarrggghhhh!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!!!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis and his brothers burst out laughing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fortis! That was very mean!\" said Minerva, \"Oh there there, Ares! It's okay. Uncle Forty loves you very much! Don't you?\" she asked, shooting her brother a dirty look. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh...sure...C'mere kid...heh. You look like your momma! You got her brown hair...don'tcha got her brown hair? Who's got brown hair!? Who's got brown hair!? Pretty pretty pretty hair! Huh?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Forty don't tickle him! He's eating!\" Minerva cried out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi everyone!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone at the table turned to see a tall, good-looking young man enter. Crown Prince Cassius, now aged twenty-three, sauntered in. Fortis turned in his seat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your Royal Highness\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...um...My lord\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hear that you've been busy in my absence\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you did not see fit to ask my permission?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...see, the thing is...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You dare to marry my sister without the permission of her older brother and master of her household?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It wasn't like that! I...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So it was a marriage of necessity, was it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What!? No!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore anyone could say anything, Fortis got up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You. Me. Upstairs\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fortis!\" Minerva began, but Athena gave her a \"Sit down!\" sort of look. Cassius followed Fortis out of the room, and upstairs to the study. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis was older than Cassius, although they were now almost the same height. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You dare to marry my only sister without asking my permission?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now...my lord...\" said Cassius, raising his hands defensively, \"I didn't do anything wrong! We just thought that...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You dare to relieve her of her virginity?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well to be technically correct, she...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me make a few things clear...You have married her. You have enjoyed her. You have made a child with her. With possibly more on the way. I won't complain. I want her to be happy. And if marrying YOU makes her happy, then I will not intervene. But understand this very clearly...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis stared Cassius right in the eye. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When your father dies, you will be king, and my sister will be queen. King, or no king, crown or not, if you make my sister cry for any reason, I will hunt you down like a wolf, and I will do things to you that you will remember for the rest of your life. Do I make myself clear?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You cannot intimidate me!\" Cassius said, \"I'm not fifteen anymore!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do I make myself clear?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My Lord Vanderstorm, I know that you come from an ancient and proud family of excellent warrior stock, and that you want to protect that. Like you said, when I am king, your sister would be the queen. I assure you I will forever treat her as nothing less than what she deserves\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hold you to that until your last breath\", said Fortis, softly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes sir\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well, then\", said Fortis. \"Now...Young Prince Ares...which is, I suppose, what he is...you find him to be a fine lad?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes sir. Very lively and active\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm. Far too timid\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's two!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis shrugged. \"I need to start training my own boys...\" he said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Training?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If they're to earn their knighthoods, they need to learn from a knight!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! Yes of course! And I heard you earned a Knight-Commander rank...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis nodded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Impressive!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I suppose you hold the same thing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lord Vanderstorm, you KNOW my father doesn't hand out honorary titles and ranks! Listen. Now that everything's over...Why don't we go hunting? All us men?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis frowned, \"Hunting? Where?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here on your estate!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis slowly nodded. \"Fine\", he said. \"Tomorrow. We can go out all day\". </span></div></div>",

It wasn't uncommon for Eldonia to wake up to find her husband already in bed with her, gently fondling her, rubbing her, stroking her tenderly, wrapping himself around her and running his big, rough hands through her hair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe would twitch and roll over and sniff his musky masculinity...and tease him...and snuggle...if she was awake enough, she might initiate proceedings...but usually Fortis would whisper something in her ear and pin her down, while getting himself into position. Eldonia would pretend to fight him off before succumbing to the will of her lordly master...And once it was all over, she knew it was silly to fight him anyway... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut for over a month, now, such nighttime trysts had been nothing but playful memories! And once again, Eldonia was doomed to a sexless slumber, without at least her husband's vast, powerful form to snuggle against and cuddle lovingly... What a thorough disappointment! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd it didn't get any better when Eldonia woke up in the morning. As she wandered the halls, chambers and passages of the ancient family castle, everything reminded her of her husband! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ancestral suits of armor reminded her of Fortis's military background and breeding, the grand chambers reminded her of how wealthy he was. The high doorways and towering ceilings reminded her of his gigantic physique and height! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd she couldn't BEAR to enter his bedchamber! The master's bedchamber, and the bed where he had so often thrown her onto the mattress and jumped upon her, to ravish her form in ways so memorable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFour of those memories were busy keeping her busy. Leo toddled around the castle after his mother as she entered the nursery. She sniffed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whyza momma kwy?\" Leo burbled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Momma's just sad about your papa, Leo. He's been gone away so long now!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Weo missa papa...Papa cuddles!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia smirked. <i>Oh yes. Papa certainly knew how to cuddle</i>...and stroke...and kiss...and...Oh damn! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, darling\", she said. Ooooh Leo looked so much like his father! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One day you're going to be Lord Vanderstorm! Just like your papa!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yaaaay! Wawd Weo Wandlestorm!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia giggled. \"Yes darling\", she said softly. Eldonia headed downstairs to the dining-hall to have breakfast. A plate with eggs, bacon, buttered toast, grilled tomatoes and two enormous sausages lay at her place at the table. Eldonia stared at the two fleshy flanks of...Oh Forty! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There now!\" said Athena, understandingly. \"You get used to it, my dear! Your husband being at war!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But granny what if he doesn't come back!? I'm too young to be a widow! And I've got four babies! And I might even have another coming!\" she said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be stupid! He's a Vanderstorm! Vanderstorms never die in battle!...It's not polite! They die at home where people can keep an eye on them!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinerva giggled at her grandmother's sensibilities. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh granny! Don't say that to Eldonia! It'll only make her feel worse!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You listen to me, my girls! The boys will return!\" said the old woman. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gwamma 'Teena wite!\" said Leo, sitting next to his great-grandmother and nubbling away at his porridge, \"Papa come home!\" he squeaked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There! See how smart the boy is!?\" Athena said, proudly, \"You're a very smart boy, Leo!\" she cooed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Papa come home!...\" Leo mumbled again, and went back to trying to feed himself with the wrong end of his spoon. </span></div></div>",

She approached the door and opened it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Castle Vanderstorm?\" a messenger said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A letter for the lord of the castle\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEliza took the letter and closed the doors. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Zacharia!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZacharia entered.

No...But we are expecting visitors\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh...WHEN!?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This evening. Wolfgang and his family are coming over. To see the babies, I think\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had, after all, been a couple of weeks since Eldonia's pregnancy. Athena had completely forgotten that she had written to them! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh dear! I completely forgot that I invited them to see the babies! I hope the house will be ready!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The servants are on it, don't worry, grandma!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wonder if they brought anything for the babies?\" Minerva asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The last time Wolfgang came, he brought a home-knitted phallus-warmer for Leonardo!\" said Athena, \"I ask you!?

Hehehe...Atta boy, Leo...C'mon, drop your cocks and hoist your jocks! We're goin' huntin'!\" Fortis said. He threw blunderbusses and muskets at his brothers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What for?\" Jupiter asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pussy!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seriously?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're shootin' game you blockhead! Mrs. T. needs somethin' to put on a plate for when Wolfgang shows up this evening! Unless you want to slice your ass-cheeks onto a plate and garnish them with rosemary, get it moving up those stairs!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, alright, we're goin', we're goin'...Becoming lord has made you grouchy...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside, the three young Mountain lords mounted their horses and rode off, with Fortis's squire, Koviac, riding along behind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are we hunting, my lords?\" Koviac asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever moves slow enough for grandpa here to shoot\", said Jupiter, slapping his older brother on the back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh shut up!\" Fortis grumbled. \"We're hunting pheasant!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooh I love pheasant!...Could we shoot two or three, so the servants can have one too?\" Koviac said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis shrugged. \"Oh alright. If we can hit them. But we gotta be quick. So you better have quick hands with those powder-horns and shot-bags, boy!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes my lord!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right\", said Fortis. He charged his blunderbuss with black powder and aimed it into the trees. Then, he fired, at nothing in particular. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe explosion was what he wanted. The sudden blast sent shock-waves through the forest on the manorial estate! That was when the birds jerked awake and started fluttering out of the trees! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right! Now! Now!\" Fortis shouted! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Bang! Bang! Bang! </b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Reload! Quick!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Bang! Bang! Bang!</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlump!...Flump! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I got one!\" Jupiter shouted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hah!\" Fortis shouted. \"Bullseye! Kovi! Go get them! One's over there, and the other one is somewhere in the middle of the field!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How many more should we get?\" Jupiter asked as he poured more shot-pellets down the muzzle of his blunderbuss. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get us a few more! May as well while we're out here!\" Fortis shouted, \"We can smoke them, or sell them, or give them to the poor or something!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Crack! Crack! Boom!</b> <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I got one!...No...Damn it! I nearly did! Stupid bird!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the end, they returned to the castle with six fat, feathery pheasants. Fortis smiled and Mrs. Tibbs gasped when she saw them! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh splendid, my lord! But what are we going to do with them all?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll have two for dinner. Two for us, one for the servants. The other three, we can smoke or salt or dry, or we can sell them\", Fortis said. Mrs. Tibbs nodded, \"Very good, my lord!\" she said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbove Fortis's head, a bell rang. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oops! Front door...\" he said. \"I'll get that\", he said. </span></div></div>",

Fortis hugged her against his chest and tried to calm her down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia knew that her husband had never meant to strike her. He was just angry and needed to give vent to his feelings. Lord knew, if she was in his situation, she would probably do the same thing! Eldonia pressed her tear-streaked face against her husband's broad chest. Fortis didn't say anything, but she could tell that he was boiling inside with pent up rage! His chest rose and fell in slow, heavy breaths, and his heart was pounding like a pair of drums! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Forty...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT!...is it...Girl...?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is Eldonia's baby a...a...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis was SO angry he couldn't even speak. He'd already lost his temper far beyond his control once, and he didn't want to do the same thing again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSensing that the lord of the castle was undergoing a lot of stress, Ursula strove to speak for him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The child, when it is born, will be of...mixed parentage. Of Vladian blood, to be sure\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA look of silent shock swept over Athena's face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is there anything we can do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Certainly not! Short of...aborting the pregnancy\", she said. She gestured vaguely towards the bottle on the table. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis snatched up the bottle and opened it. \"Donnie open your mouth!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fortis NO!\" said Athena, firmly, \"This is Eldonia's choice to make!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I guess so...\" Fortis said, but he still didn't like the idea of HIS wife carrying some BASTARD to term! </span></div></div>",

I had no part in its creation!  That blasted, stinking Vladian did!  Your carrying it for the next eight months is only going to be a reminder to all of us of what happened to you!  I just want to get past all this!  Don't you?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia wrenched herself out of Fortis's arms and went over to look out the dining room window.  It seemed appropriate that a storm suddenly swept in behind Ursula's and Merlin's arrival, for rain began pelting the glass.  She hugged her arms around herself, gazing out unseeingly at the gray, cloudy sky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All I see when I sleep,\" she began in a low monotone, \"is HIM taking me over and over again...forcing me...<i>hurting</i> me.  Trust me, the last thing I want is a daily reminder of what I went through in Vladia.  But....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia took a deep breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you know why I was an only child?  I was the only baby my mother was able to carry to term.  She had miscarriage after miscarriage before I was born, and of course my parents kept trying, in hopes of eventually having a son, an heir.  But you all know the rest of the story:  that my mother died giving birth to me, and I was all my father ever had.  I suppose he spoiled me terribly, but I was his little girl, the only lasting reminder he had of my mother.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia turned around to face everyone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perhaps because of all that he went through, my father believed and instilled in me the thought that all life is precious, no matter the cost.  I...I still believe that, too, despite everything I went through.  This baby,\" she said, putting her hand on her belly, \"regardless of who sired it, is precious.  It's innocent of it's father's sins.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Donnie,\" said Fortis, coming up to her and gritting his teeth, \"are you honestly saying that you WANT this baby, that YOU could raise this child?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia opened and closed her mouth a couple times.  Eventually, she closed her eyes and shook her head.  \"I...don't think I could,\" she whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe opened her eyes.  \"But just because you and I can't raise it with the love and rearing it deserves, doesn't mean it doesn't deserve to live!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUrsula cleared her throat.  \"If I may interject something that may help in your decision, my dear?  While both the abortion herb the Valleyan gypsy gave you and the potion that I have available for you are highly effective means of relieving your of your burden, they are not without risk.  Many of the women I have given my abortion potion to have found it difficult to ever conceive again, and when they have, they frequently have miscarriages.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis glared at the witch.  \"You mean that if Ellie gets rid of her baby, she might never give me another child?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUrsula nodded her head solemnly.  \"Indeed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis scowled and crossed his arms over his chest.  \"I don't believe this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fortis!\" said Athena harshly.  She came up to Eldonia's side.  \"My dear, no one would fault you if you wished to terminate this pregnancy.  However, we all respect the values your father instilled in you, and it would be very brave of you to see this pregnancy through.  All I have to do is look at each and everyone of my grandchildren, and especially little Leo, and agree with you that life is precious.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAthena took Eldonia's hands in hers.  \"Mostly, I don't want Leo to be the only child Fortis gives you.  I have always longed to see this house filled with children again!  I don't want you to risk not being able to have any more children.  That would ultimately make that horrible Vladian the winner!  If you can stand to have that Vladian's child growing in your belly for nine months, I will do everything in my power to help you find a good and loving home for it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As will I, my lady,\" said Ursula with a nod.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, we're all behind you Donnie,\" said Minerva, coming up to her friend and putting her hand comfortingly on Eldonia's shoulder.  \"Whatever you decide.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Forty?\" Eldonia asked in a small voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis scowled.  \"I don't like this, ANY OF THIS!  But,...I don't want to risk your health or the possibility of our future family.  If you go through with this pregnancy, Donnie, YOU WILL give up the child.  Do you understand me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia nodded.  \"Yes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come here, woman,\" he said gruffly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia launched herself into his arms, crying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I still love you, Eldonia,\" he said softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I know, Forty.  I l-love you, too!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come, everyone,\" Athena said briskly.  \"Let's leave them alone for a while.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAthena herded the rest of her grandchildren and Ursula out of the room, leaving Fortis and Eldonia in an uneasy embrace.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>While Fortis held his wife gently in his arms, internally he was seething.  How dare some insignificant, abominable, lousy excuse for a man show him--Fortis!--up in his ability to sire children!  Eldonia should be getting plump and round with the fruit of HIS seed, not some Vladian who had merely used her for his own pleasure!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis couldn't stand losing this particular contest.  It was a test of his manhood, and Fortis chafed at being the loser!  He was a tall, strong Mountain Lord!  He had power and might, youth and strength!  His sperm should be the same!  How could Eldonia NOT be pregnant with his child?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, he'd have to just prove--to both himself and his wife--that in all ways that mattered, he was STILL the winner over that Vladian...that <i>Loki</i>, or whatever his name was.  Since Eldonia was going to carry Loki's child to term, Fortis couldn't impregnate her again any time soon.  However, that didn't mean that he couldn't <i>practice</i> for when that time came.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis reveled in feeling Eldonia's lush body firmly pressed against his own.  Despite the weight she had lost during her captivity, she was still curvy and gorgeous, generously apportioned in all the places that had made him take notice of her in the first place.  Other than that one glorious, semi-drunken night of pleasure, Fortis hadn't lain with Eldonia for more than two months!  This was definitely not something the young earl's body was accustomed to, and it was definitely telling him to rectify the situation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis groaned as he took in the sweet scent of Eldonia's hair.  He leaned down to nuzzle her neck and enjoyed the scent of her skin--lavender soap and womanly musk.  He ran his hands lightly down her back until they reached the swells of her bottom.  Then, he suddenly brought her lower body into firm contact with his, showing her in no uncertain terms how much he wanted her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"F-forty?\" Eldonia gasped.  \"Wh-what are you doing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What does it feel like I'm doing, woman?\" he growled, palming her buttocks and rocking her soft body against his raging hard-on.  He placed rough kisses on her cheek and neck.  \"I want you, Donnie.  Been wantin' you fer too blasted long!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But Forty,...I don't...oooohhhhh!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis grinned at having made her moan so wantonly.  Take THAT you Vladian scum!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, he swooped down on her open mouth and began to devour her, possessively licking and sucking every inch of her delectable mouth and lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe get so caught up in what he was doing and the blood was pounding so loudly in his ears (what little of it not down in his groin was left TO pound in his ears, that is), that it took him several minutes to realize Eldonia was squirming in his arms and pounding her fists on his chest...and not in a way that said she was enjoying what he was doing to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis eventually loosened his hold enough that Eldonia was able to wrench away from him.  She backed clear up to the wall, and Fortis frowned.  Her face was completely white, her eyes wide and wild.  She was breathing heavily...but not from pleasure.  She was...she was...afraid of him?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Donnie, what's wrong?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe took a single step toward her, and she scrambled against the wall as if she were trying to climb it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"St-stop!  STOP!  Don't come near me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis looked at her in utter confusion.  \"Alright....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia took several deep breaths, putting one hand to her stomach and the other over her mouth.  She twisted her head to the side as if she were going to be sick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Donnie,...what did I do?  Talk to me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia merely shook her head before collapsing to the floor and vomiting!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Donnie!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis went over to her, but despite being ill, she still cringed away from him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't...don't touch me!\" she gasped hoarsely between heaves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis let go of her as if she had burned him.  \"Fine!\" he said angrily, rising to his feet.  \"Whatever, Donnie!  You obviously don't want my help!  You also don't want my touch!  Well, FINE!  In case you hadn't noticed, I'm NOT that blasted Vladian that took advantage of you!  I merely want to show you a little love and comfort--Fortis-style--and you push me away!  Well, <b>FINE</b>!  See if I ever touch your skinny, pale, ugly body ever again!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis stormed out of the room, leaving Eldonia shaking and crying, huddled up on the floor.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Fortis stormed up to his bedroom, growling and snarling at everyone he passed, making them all duck their heads and scurry hurriedly on their way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe slammed his door shut hard enough to splinter some of the wood, but he could care less.  He stalked over to his weapons cabinet, took out a long broadsword and proceeded to attack numerous virtual enemies, swinging and slicing the air with abandon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a good hour, when his muscles began weeping from the intensity of his workout and having worked off most of his anger, he slumped down in a chair near the fire and put his head in his hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he first came home after the war, everything seemed right and wonderful in his life.  He had returned home a hero, a vanquisher of Vladians.  He had proven his masculinity and virility by coming home to a new son and marrying the lovely Eldonia.  He had reveled in his new family and in ravishing his wife every night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then his attention had turned to his duties as Earl, and ever since, his life had gone downhill.  Granted, he had gained much more respect and admiration in the eyes of his tenants, the people of his land, and the citizens of Dynamos and the other small villages.  But his wife began to resent him and all the time spent away from her--time doing hard, physical labor that made him too tired to even make love to his beautiful wife!  Then, those wretched Vladians began raiding the surrounding countryside.  And finally, Eldonia was kidnapped right under his nose!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough he had been trying to protect her against the Vladian outlaw raiders, because of his inattention for a mere half hour of time, and because of his...<i>ineffectualness</i> (a word that stuck in his craw), Eldonia was now pregnant with some stinking Vladian warlord's child...and she couldn't even bear to have him touch her!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis's breathing sped up in anger once again.  He craved her, wanted her, his blood boiled with lust and need, to prove to her his virility and strength, to renew his ability to protect her as he hadn't a couple months ago.  And yet she denied him!  How could he be the husband and protector he was supposed to be if she wouldn't let him?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile deep in his mind he understood that Eldonia gone through an horrific experience in Vladia that had left her mind and her body in their current vulnerable state, the desires of his body were so strong right now that he practically shook with need.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSwearing, he got up hastily and threw his chair across the room.  He yelled out his anger and frustration.  A desperate part of him wanted to go to Eldonia, to force himself on her, to make her see that she was HIS and his ALONE to seduce and to have sex with.  But the larger part of his mind remembered his grandmother's threats and the way Eldonia had looked at him with fear.  Fortis HATED feeling so impotent, when he knew he was anything but!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot knowing what else to do to try and rid himself of his anger, his lust, and his uncomfortable feeling of helplessness in regards to his wife, Fortis stomped over to his liquor cabinet, threw off the lid of a crystal decanter of Lucian Cognac, lifted the bottle to his lips, and began to glug down the sweet spirit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis's father had been rather fond of hard liquors, enjoying a short glass of this or that every evening before retiring for the night.  Fortis had inherited the man's collection upon the elder earl's untimely death and had even added a few bottles of his own over the past couple of years.  Fortis's liquor cabinet now held a wide array of various spirits, each a specialty of their country of origin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucian Cognac was a brandy made from the sweetest of Lucia's prized apples and pears.  Fantasmian Rum was distilled from the sugar cane grown on the southern humid coast of far-off Fantasmia.  The Vladian Vodka Fortis himself had plundered off a dead Vladian that he taken down during the recent war.  His most recent acquisition was Valleyan Gin, which Jupiter had given him just a couple days ago.  The gin, made with Mountanian Juniper berries and was distilled with magic, had been a present to Jupiter from the Valleyans who had seen Jupiter and Eldonia home.  Jupiter didn't care much for gin and so had given it to Fortis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the Cognac was gone.  Fortis took a deep breath, enjoying the burn and the heat the liquor left in his stomach.  However, Fortis wanted--needed--something stronger.  He craved oblivion from his emotions for a while, and only one drink he knew of could effectively do that for him right now.  His eyes lit on an old, aged bottle towards the back of his cabinet.  It was the strongest drink he had in his collection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMountanian Rock Whiskey was made with the finest quality Fatlantean barley and the hardest Mountanian mineral water that had trickled down from the highest of Mountania's mountains.  The additional minerals in the water gave it a potent, metallic taste, and the whiskey was aged for at least a century before being deemed drinkable.  Only the strongest of Mountain men could stomach the strong taste of Rock Whiskey, let alone stay standing after drinking a mere two fingers of the stuff because of the potent amount of alcohol it contained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis grabbed his bottle of two-century-old Rock Whiskey and a clean short glass and staggered over to a chair in front of his window.  He poured himself a heaping two fingers of whiskey, gazing at the brown liquid in hunger as a light steam or smoke gently rose up from the surface of the alcohol.  He closed his eyes and knocked it back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe hissed and choked and coughed!  It felt as if a virtual fire were licking through his mouth, on his tongue, and steadily down his throat.  When the whiskey landed in his stomach, an intense heat bloomed in his belly, making him moan in appreciation.  Unfortunately, it felt all too reminiscent of another burn that he was trying to escape.  He had forgotten than Rock Whiskey tended to make one extremely randy.  However, if he drank enough of it, he would soon be too snockered to do anything but pass out in his chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConvinced that getting supremely drunk was the only current recourse to his anger, Fortis proceeded to pour and drink (and cough), and pour and drink (and hiss), and pour and drink,...until the room began to swim and the glass and bottle fell onto the floor, his fingers so numb he couldn't grip anymore...and his cock so hard that it throbbed and ached with every beat of his heart.</span></div></div>",

You are very young! Fortis loves you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No he doesn't!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't you say that! He adores you! He has produced a child with you, he has protected you, he has shown his love to you, he has given you a home and he has tried everything to make you happy! Now I know you're having a hard time at the moment, and he's only acting the way he is because it's the only way he knows to try and make you feel wanted\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia frowned at Athena, \"By manhandling me!?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...I...I wouldn't exactly call it that! More...um...rough love? I'm sure you're no stranger to the fact that Fortis, like most men of his age and position are very physical. He's not very good with all the lovey-dovey stuff. He shows his affection through actions. And passions. And that's really the only way he knows how. He would never want to hurt you! He just wanted to feel you in his arms! And to feel you! And to think that you wanted him!...After all, it is what you want, isn't it?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia took a deep breath, \"Oh granny...of course I do! But...Oooh...Why does he have to be...I'm being silly. Of course I know why. He's trying to prove himself or something. But what do I do?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAthena smiled, \"I would've thought that would be obvious\", she said, with a twinkle in her eye. \"Of course he's tryiing to prove himself. Fortis sees himself as having failed you as a husband, and a lover, and as a protector! You need to show him that he hasn't! That'll make him feel better. It'll bolster him up a bit! Once he feels better, things will sort themselves out in time. Once he feels good about himself, he won't bother you anymore about his issues\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia nodded. That seemed to make sense. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what do I do?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's probably feeling very low right now. You should go and spend time with him. Don't resist...just let him do what he wants...within reason, of course...Let him vent a bit and go along with it. It'll help him relax and calm down\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia let out a weak smile. That sounded like a good idea. Poor Forty...so stressed...so angry...so frustrated. he had to blow off some steam. Spending time with his favourite little woman might cheer him up...? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe got to her feet and headed upstairs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>CRASH!! </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia gasped! What in the name of... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she heard muffled swearing coming from behind a pair of closed doors. Apparently Fortis was blowing off more than just steam! She approached the doors cautiously. She noticed that the handles were loose. Apparently, in his blind rage, Fortis had used more force on the doors than usual, and had nearly ripped the handles off! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia steeled herself for what was to come next. She would wait until things calmed down, and then she would go inside. The noise had woken up the baby. She went to comfort her toddler son and get Leonardo back to sleep. That would surely take long enough to give Fortis to work off the edge of his fury. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There you are...my little brave fighter\", Eldonia whispered, as she tucked her son back into the crib. Leo stared up at his mother with big, wet blue eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shhh...beddy-byes!\" she whispered, and tiptoed out of the nursery. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe closed the doors behind her, and turned towards the master's bedchambers. Nobody answered when she tapped on the door. Cautiously, Eldonia opened the doors and peeked in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe room was in a mess! A shattered chair lay against one wall. A heavy sword lay on the ground. At least three or four empty bottles or decanters sat on the sideboard. Slumped on the floor in a half-nude state, the lord of the manor lay in a heap. Eldonia noticed at least one empty bottle nearby, and a shot-glass on its side. She picked up the bottle and sniffed it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Eeeuuuuggghhh!! </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe recognised the sharp, fiery scent of Mountanian Rock Whiskey. That stuff would burn you up from the insides out if you weren't used to strong liquor. Her father had given her a thimble-full of this stuff once, a few years back, when she constantly pestered him to find out what was in the bottle he drank each evening. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n...She had never asked again. That one sip had set her innards on fire like nothing else! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd here, Fortis seemed to have drunk an entire bottle of the stuff! Along with all the other empty bottles...boy! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis was tall, beefy and solid. A huge Mountain lord of the first order, and a prize knight and warrior. But even his hardened constitution couldn't take the heavy doses of liquor that he'd swilled down his throat. He lay, stone cold on the floor...snoring. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia got onto the floor by her husband's head and sniffed...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEugh! He must've drunk every drop of every bottle in the whole room! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Forty?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo answer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Forty?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill no answer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia stared up and down her husband's form, looking for some sign of life. And she found one, sure enough. At least fifteen inches long and straining against his undershorts. Eldonia gasped. Was he...Oh gosh! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia shifted his smalls, and a heavy appendage sprang out! It lulled heavily to one side. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Oh wow...</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe carefully tucked the lord's 'sword' back into its sheath, and struggled to help her husband to his feet. Fortis groaned. His flailing phallus rubbed against the cloth of his smalls, and he let out a heavy groan of bliss. Slowly, his eyes opened. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-wh...Oooooh...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Forty?\" Eldonia whispered, \"Forty are you okay?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis moaned. A hand groped down, trying to find the strange addition to his body that seemed to be weighing him down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe let out a quivering groan of dizzying bliss. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n...He found it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis closed his eyes and staggered to his feet, his back slamming against his wardrobe as he struggled to remain erect...something that his southerly section was having no problems with. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-He-heeeeey sweetie...\" he burbled. Even from four feet away, his breath smelt like lamp-oil! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis staggered forwards, high on booze and drunk from sexual frustration. He fell on top of his lady companion and together, they staggered backwards! They crashed onto the bed and Eldonia gasped! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe felt his rough hands feel around her. Around her chest...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehe-eheeeey...I-I kn-kn-know th-th-theesssse hahahahaha...hehehe...Mmmm...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia gasped as she felt him slowly applying his mouth to her womanly orbs. She thought she should protest...but...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis continued to feel her up in a drunken haze, hardly aware of what was going on... </span></div></div>",

Jush...jusht <i>feel</i>....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia struggled a bit in Fortis's arms as he explored her breasts with surprisingly gentle hands and his warm, wet mouth.  Her mind and emotions were in a whirling conflict within her, and she puzzled through what she wanted as Fortis drunkenly plied himself with her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe felt bad about what happened earlier in the dining room.  She had merely reacted to Fortis out of instinct--giving in to the behavior that she had learned during her captivity in Vladia.  That same instinct had told her to flee away, to be frightened out of her mind.  However, she also clearly remembered the hurt she saw briefly on her husband's face as she pushed him away before that hurt turned to anger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis moved his lips up her chest, placing hot kisses on her collarbone and neck.  His hands, meanwhile, slowly traced the outer curves of her breasts, causing her to shiver as the delicate caress gave her goosebumps.  His drunkenness had made him rather languid in his actions, and Eldonia found that she didn't mind so much his gentle treatment of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe knew that Fortis hadn't been trying to hurt her earlier, nor <i>had</i> he hurt her.  His actions had just reminded her too much of Loki and how he would grind himself into her belly before raising her skirts and forcing himself inside her.  Eldonia had no desire to EVER experience such treatment again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...But Fortis hadn't treated her that way at all.  He hadn't forced himself on her.  Granted, he was very strong and a bit rough, his hands were calloused from all the hard lifting and labor he did, and he had showed her in no uncertain terms how much he wanted her, but he hadn't treated her as if she were an object or a possession or less than human, like Loki had.  He also hadn't taken away her consent.  When she had said 'no,' he didn't force her to continue to endure his amorous attentions.  Loki had never paid any heed to her protestations.  But Fortis had never taken her against her will.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis's hands began to slowly drift lower, his fingertips gliding along the sensitive skin of her sides.  When they reached the material of her dress, they slowly and clumsily began to ease the dress the rest of the way down her waist, hips, and thighs.  He moaned into her ear at feeling so much of her soft, smooth, silky skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia thought on what Granny Athena had told her just now, too.  Fortis rarely said that he loved her.  Indeed, he was a very physical man, and he had always shown his love, his devotion, his desire, and his protection in physical ways.  In fact, even though he was horribly drunk right now and terribly randy because of the drink, Fortis was playing her body like a well-tuned violin.  He knew exactly where to touch her and kiss her to make her feel special and wanted.  And if she gave in, she might even feel that wonderful, delirious pleasure that he had so often brought her before....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis ground himself into her thigh, and Eldonia gasped.  He felt harder and longer than she remembered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'n you...feel how...hard I 'm?\" he slurred.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe took one of her hands and brought it to the impressive bulge in his shorts.  He groaned as he stroked her small hand over his length through his smalls before roughly pulling his undershorts over his hips.  Eldonia instinctively curled her hand around him and held him tightly, making him hiss in pleasure.  Instead of recoiling in fear or loathing at having her husband's erection in her hand, Eldonia quelled her disgust, gulped, and slowly slid her hand all the way up to his spongey head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, yeeeeaaaaahh....  Moooorrre,\" he murmured.  He slowly began to thrust himself into her hand.  Eldonia felt a small smile curve her lips.  She had Fortis at her mercy right now.  It...empowered her.  She hadn't felt powerful in a long time.  So, she continued to stroke and fondle his phallus, gaining more confidence with every groan and sigh that left his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Fortis began to return the favor by teasingly sliding his fingertips up the insides of her thighs.  Eldonia let her eyes drift shut as the first spark of pleasure burned low in her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...Unfortunately, that pleasure reminded her of Lord Ramius.  An involuntary shudder racked her body at the memory of the Vladian warlord and how he had coaxed an obscene number of orgasms from her body merely with his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Forty, don't...don't touch...me...th-there...oh...oohhh...oooohhhhhhh!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia bit her lip to try and hold in her moans, arching her hips as Fortis stroked her most intimate place.  This felt so different from Ramius's rough, wet tongue.  Fortis's warm, calloused fingertips touched her so softly and so gently, it made her feel cherished and desired.  Fortis slowly drew his fingers up and around her clit, making her moan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs zings of pleasure began to dance down her spine, she made up her mind:  she <i>needed</i> this from Fortis.  She needed a positive experience to replace all the horrible, violating ones that she had so recently experienced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Fortis,\" she hissed into his ear, beginning to stroke him in earnest, while she placed her other hand on his buttock and drew his lower body even closer to her own.  \"Please!  Make love to me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis snarled and captured her mouth with his, kissing her earnestly.  Because of the alcohol still flowing through his veins, he didn't have much finesse or display near his usual level of skill, but he more than made up for that with his passion and eagerness.  Eldonia ignored the sour taste of whiskey still on his breath and enjoyed his hot, wet tongue dancing and dominating hers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia lifted her legs to wrap them around his trim waist and slowly helped guide his long, aching rod to her core.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yessssssss,\" Fortis hissed, when he felt the wet heat of her envelop the head of his cock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis head was spinning between the lust and alcohol in his body, but instinct took over as soon as his member touched her womanhood.  In one long thrust, he was completely encased by her sheath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey moaned in unison as they became one once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia wrapped her arms tightly around his strong, broad shoulders as Fortis began an unsteady rhythm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, sho...sho goood!\" he slurred into her hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe used one hand to balance himself as he slowly began to pick up the pace and hardness of his thrusts, while he brought his other hand to one of her buttocks, holding and angling her lower body so that he could get as much of his length inside her as he could.  However, his new angle also made him hit a special spot inside her that made her cry out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"F-forty!  Oh, again!  There, there!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bed began moving across the floor until the headboard banged again and again against the wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCries and moans filled the air.  Fingernails scratched down his back.  His hand fisted in the sheet near her shoulder until the linen tore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBodies slapped.  Hearts pounded.   Breathing was furious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...Until they both came, screaming each other's name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"FORTY!\"<br>\r\n\"EL...EL-DONNIE!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe entire world burst in a dazzle of lights, and they shook and shivered in each other's arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis slumped down on top of his wife and promptly passed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia sighed, hardly able to breathe as Fortis's weight pressed her down into his large, comfortable bed.  She let her hands drift slowly up and down his long, muscular, sweaty back.  She had missed her husband greatly while she was in Vladia, and now she was back home with him, back in his bed again.  Everything was going to be okay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia snuggled down, relishing how protected and surrounded she felt with the mattress at her back and Fortis's strong body at her front.  Yawning, she closed her eyes and drifted off to sleep.</span></div></div>",

's too early ta be up and doin' work!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBright sunlight was streaming in through the window and hitting Fortis in the face, making him squint.  He turned over and put his pillow on top of his aching head, trying to drown out the painful pounding.  He pressed the pillow down tighter, but it didn't help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe didn't hear the soft moan come from the bed next to him.  However, his body stilled when he felt a long, lithe, womanly figure snuggle up next to him.  What the...?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis pulled the pillow off his head and quickly shot up several inches, only to sink back down to the bed in agony.  He put a hand to his head and swore.  His mind was a bit fuzzy, but he did clearly remember drinking a substantial amount of his father's collection of hard liquor, including the hardest stuff of all:  Rock Whiskey.  No wonder he felt as if his head were being whacked with a sledgehammer with every beat of his heart, his mouth felt filled with cotton, and his stomach felt a bit queasy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...But that didn't explain how he ended up in bed with a woman, the both of them completely starkers!  His mind was a complete blank after finishing off the Rock Whiskey and slumping down in his chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn arm wrapped itself around his torso, and Fortis gently opened one eye to peer at the woman in his bed.  When he saw Eldonia's sleep-flushed face, he breathed a sigh of relief.  He'd had a few mornings before in his bachelor days when he would wake up from a night of carousing and drinking to a woman he couldn't remember ever seeing before, or occasionally one of the castle maids.  He was glad that hadn't happened this time.  He had no desire to be unfaithful to his wife, despite everything they had been through recently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Donnie,\" he said gruffly, his voice hoarse from all the stiff drink he had consumed the previous night.  He gently shook her shoulder to try and wake her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia yawned and slowly opened her eyes.  She looked up at Fortis and gave him a small smile.  She leaned up and gave him a small kiss.  \"Morning, my lord,\" she purred.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis could hardly believe his eyes and ears.  The last thing he knew, he had been at odds with his wife!  She had rejected him in the dining room, sending him into a rage that resulted in his severe imbibing!  How had they gone from her being deathly afraid of him and not even letting him touch her, to now having everything okay between them again?  What happened last night?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, morning,\" he said.  \"How are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia stretched her body on a long yawn, drawing his eyes involuntarily to her plump breasts, her shapely torso, and her womanly hips and thighs.  His randy cock perked up at the sight.  \"I feel...warm.  Relaxed.  Wonderful!\"  She snuggled back next to him, placing a kiss on his breastbone that had him drawing in a ragged breath.  \"Thank you for being so gentle with me last night,\" she murmured.  \"That's exactly what I needed to try to put that awful Vladian out of my mind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis's mind was in a whirl.  He had obviously made love to her last night.  And she was...GRATEFUL...for it?!  He desperately wished he could remember it!  He wanted to know what exactly he had done to bring her back into his bed!  How unfair was this?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis sighed and gently wrapped his arms around her.  Well, unfair or not, he wasn't going to look this gift horse in the mouth!  He would do everything he could to show Eldonia that he still loved and cared for her.  If he had to treat her with kid gloves for a while, well, hopefully he could do that!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe felt her small, delicate hand trace the ridges of his abdominal muscles before they ventured further south.  He sucked in a breath as her hand curled around him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This I'm certainly used to,\" she said with a small giggle.  Fortis smiled.  It had been a long time since he had heard his wife's delightful laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You always wake up ready to go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, when I wake up with my beautiful wife next to me, how can you expect anything else?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia leaned up and looked at him seriously.  \"Remind me again of how it's supposed to be, Forty.  Please?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How what's supposed to be?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know...between a man and a woman...between us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis swallowed hard.  He literally felt all the blood rush out of his head and his cock becoming impossibly hard in her hand.  \"Are you sure?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia nodded.  \"I dreamt of him again last night.  I don't want to dream of him anymore.  I would rather dream of you.\"  She blushed and turned a bit shy.  \"I figure...maybe the more times you make love to me, it will eventually displace all the awful times <i>he</i> took me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ellie,\" he said hoarsely, \"I have to be honest with you.  I...don't remember much of last night.  I had way too much to drink.  I don't remember making love to you.  You said I was gentle with you, and I'm surprised by that, especially since I was soused to the gills.  I've rarely been gentle when I've taken you before.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia shook her head, tears in her eyes.  She leaned closer and placed a soft kiss on his lips.  \"It doesn't matter,\" she whispered.  \"You never have and never will take me in a way that hurts.  And you've never taken me when I didn't want you to.  So, I'm asking you now:  please, Forty.  Show me.  Make love to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis growled.  Despite the continued unpleasant sensations in his body from his hangover, he wasn't about to deny himself of what he'd been craving for the past month (last night not withstanding)!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe spread himself out on top of her and began to show her again and again and again how effectively he could bring both of them pleasure....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--- --- --- ---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAthena pulled away from the closed door to the master bedroom, a smirk on her face.  She pulled her robe closer around her body and headed down to breakfast.  She was glad that Fortis and Eldonia were back together after their horrible ordeal.  She would make sure that no one bothered them the rest of the day as they...reacquainted themselves...with each other.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span><i>Knock! Knock! Knock!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enter!\" Loki growled as he paced restlessly in a circle in front of the large fireplace in the great hall of his crumbling Vladian castle.  Ever since his father, Lord Ramius, was killed and the wife of the Mountain Lord had escaped, Loki had been on edge.  He desperately longed to take out his revenge on someone--anyone!--but he had yet to find the right people to blame...or harass.  It also didn't help that he'd gotten used to having the young Mountanian woman in his bed.  He definitely missed the explosive releases he'd found with her lithe, supple body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVilnius's two oldest sons, Ranulf and Adolf, entered the room, a struggling, brightly clothed man in their grips.  \"We captured several foreigners on the road heading towards the keep, my lord!  This man seemed to be more or less the leader o' the bunch.  He claims they're wanderers and ain't lookin' for no trouble, but they look suspicious!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLoki sneered at the captive man.  <i>Gypsies</i>, he thought with disdain.  Loki had no use for the wandering tribes of nomads that made their living in the lowlands of Mountania and often ventured beyond Mountania's contentious border into Vladia and even into Fatlantis.  Loki nodded his head at his nephews, who then threw the man to the floor.  They bowed to Loki before leaving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well?\" Loki said, coming towards the man and crossing his arms over his chest.  \"What were you and your people doing trespassing on my land?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe middle-aged man slowly got to his feet and glared at Loki.  Joaquim stood stoically and silently, his arms hanging loosely at his sides.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you dare hold your tongue when I ask you a direct question, you <i>ukjent</i>*!\" Loki spat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have no need to defend myself against thee or thy wrongly held assumptions,\" Joaquim said softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLoki snarled and lunged at the man, grabbing his brightly colored tunic and hauling him close.  \"You don't wanna anger me more than I already am, <i>ukjent</i>!  I am the Earl of Transyl, and you will answer me, or I will have you and all your people killed without another thought!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoaquim's eyes widened, and he gulped nervously.  \"There is no need for such hasty actions, my lord!  We Valleyans are a peaceful people and mean thee and thy people no harm!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I ask you one last time:  WHY WERE YOU ON MY LAND?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-we travel all over, my lord.  We seldom stay in one place for very long.  We did not realize we were not welcome on thy lands, or we would not have ventured this far into Vladia.  However, we hadst left some of our company waiting for us here before we ventured south to warmer climes in Fatlantis for the winter.  We were merely meeting up with them again.  That is the truth, my lord!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why did your company part ways?  Such activity sounds suspicious to me!  How do I know you're not spies for the Mountanian crown?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I swear to thee, my lord!  No Valleyan be a spy for the King of Mountania!  Granted, we keep decent relations with him for free access to roam his lands as we desirest, but we have never been employed by him for such means!  No!  The reason I hadst parted with some of my people was that we had escorted some poor lost souls back to Mountania.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who?\" Loki growled.  He began to have a inkling of how his Mountanian flower had escaped!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I didst not acquire both of their names, but the man's name was Jupiter.  He be a tall, strong, strapping lad.  He hadst a young woman with him.  She had looked a bit worse for wear and was rather sickly when she was with us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Describe the girl!  Was she about 5'8\" with long, blond hair?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, my lord!  How didst thou knowest?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLoki roared and pushed the man roughly away from him so that the Valleyan fell to the floor.  Loki grabbed his sword from his scabbard and held in at Joaquim's neck.  \"That woman was MINE, old man!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Th-thine, my lord?  Begging a thousand pardons, but I was under the impression she were the wife of a Mountain lord!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not anymore!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So it must be thy child she carries!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLoki's eyes widened, and the point of his sword dipped to the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did you just say?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The woman, my lord!  Our old seer, Matilda, said she was newly with child.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLoki's thoughts were in a whirl.  A child.  A son, perhaps.  Now, his desire to get Eldonia back was more fierce than ever!  He leaned down and placed his sword tightly against the man's throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where EXACTLY did you take my woman?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoaquim licked his lips and slowly explained the route he and several others of the caravan had taken to lead Eldonia and Jupiter back home to Castle Vanderstorm, Loki listening intently and committing everything to memory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, <i>ukjent</i>,\" Loki sneered, \"I should thank you for your valuable information.  But since you were caught trespassing on my land and I can't let such a crime go unpunished....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a sharp swipe of the sword, Joaquim's head separated from his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLoki grabbed a cloth to clean the blood off his sword before hollering, \"Guards!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo young Vladians entered the room and bowed before their new warlord.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Take this filth outside and burn it.  Kill the remaining trespassers and burn their bodies, as well.  After that, have Ranulf and Adolf saddle up three horses and prepare for several days' journey.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aye, my lord,\" the guards responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLoki hurried out of the great hall and up to his bedroom, where he proceeded to load several packs with clothing, weapons, and other supplies.  He'd let his nephews grab the food rations they'd need for their journey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Loki felt no love or liking for the lovely Eldonia, he wasn't just going to sit around and have her bear his child so that some stuck-up Mountain lord could raise him!  Granted, she could easily abort the child, but Loki doubted the kind-hearted girl would be able to do such a thing.  Therefore, Loki would sneak back into Mountania with his two nephews, steal back the woman that, somehow, had gotten under his skin, and hold her in his keep until she delivered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA cruel smile spread across Loki's face as he hauled his packs onto his shoulders, strapped numerous swords, daggers, and muskets to his body, and prepared to go down to the stables to meet Ranulf and Adolf.  If all went well, he'd have a chance to have his revenge on Eldonia's husband and brother, who dared to kill members of his own family.  Further, he might just have to keep Eldonia around after she bore his child.  He would have a constant outlet for his sexual energy, and she'd be a wonderful broodmare for him.  The thought of keeping her barefoot and pregnant made him smirk.  Oh, yes!  He definitely had plans for the feisty filly!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--- --- --- ---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFour days later, Loki, Ranulf, and Adolf approached the outskirts of Castle Vanderstorm.  They tied their horses off in the trees some distance away, observing the many people moving about the castle until evening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm going in by myself,\" Loki told his nephews.  \"Her bedroom is that one right there,\" he said, pointing to a window in the side of the enormous manor.  \"Don't come in unless I give you the signal.  Understood?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Uncle.\"<br>\r\n\"Yes, my lord.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good!  Tyranny or death!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tyranny or death!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll three men pounded a fist on their chests before Loki began heading towards the castle as dusk settled over the countryside....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*<i>ukjent</i> means stranger, foreigner, or alien in Norwegian.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Meanwhile, his nephews, Ranulf and Adolf waited out in the yard. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLighting a candelabrum, Loki headed through the house. He headed down the corridor, turned left and headed up the grand central staircase, and down the corridor. To the end...to the right...wait...was that the right from the outside? Or th inside? The right from...is the left when...but unless...Oh damn it! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLoki stared at the doors. The huge double doors at the end obviously led to the master's chambers. But these rich toffs didn't always sleep together. And he wasn't about to risk barging in on the lord of the manor! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo...which door!? Damn! He looked left and right. Then, he picked the door which was closest to the master's chamber. This made the most sense! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLoki opened the doors and tiptoed inside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Forty?\" a female voice called out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shhh...\" Loki whispered.

It was some younger, pretty girl with brown hair and much softer features! Loki turned and tried to run! But then he tripped on the rug! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinerva shrieked! Her hands reached under her pillow and she pulled out the dagger that her brother once gave her as a birthday present! Taking advantage of Loki's confusion, she jumped on him and started stabbing and slashing! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the bedroom next door, Fortis jerked awake! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the...Girl!?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia had also heard the shriek! She got to her feet as quickly as she could, under the circumstances, and staggered to the door! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWHAM! WHAM!! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doors to Fortis's bedroom flew open!

Fortis kicked his sister's bedroom door open, sword in hand! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Back, girl!\" Fortis shouted! Minerva tried to scurry away, but Loki grabbed her nightdress! Panicking, Minerva swung her dagger around! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HAAAAAAAARRGGHH!!

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A fierce battle ensued!  Cannius and Jupiter took on the two younger Vladians, Ranulf and Adolf, while Fortis took on the older, more experienced Loki.  Snarls, grunts, and growls, as well as the clangs and whines of swords clashing filled the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAthena watched the vicious parrying and thrusting, deflecting and swinging with pride and approval.  Her grandsons were well-trained, and she had every confidence the Vanderstorms would come out the winner in this contest of strength, wits, and virility.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia, however, crept over to Minerva and gathered up the shaking girl in a soothing embrace.  Eldonia could barely watch the fight, though she did sneak a glance every once in a while at her husband.  He was fighting for her and his sister, defending their honor and protecting them from these horrible invaders.  Eldonia tried not to think about why the Vladians had decided to sneak into Castle Vanderstorm.  Just seeing Loki again had filled her with intense, irrational fear.  She put a hand to her belly, which had just the slightest of curves, revealing the child that she carried.  She felt a slight flutter within that made her shiver; it was as if the child knew that its father was near.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot wanting to dwell on such unpleasant thoughts anymore, Eldonia turned her attention to the girl in her arms.  \"Are you okay, Minnie?\" Eldonia said softly into Minerva's ear, hoping that the girl could hear her over the clashing of swords.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinerva shuddered, but nodded her head.  \"I...I think so.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did he...do anything to you?  Did he hurt you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinerva shook her head.  \"He didn't get a chance.  I yelled and stabbed at him before anything happened.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia slumped in relief.  The last thing she wanted was for Minerva to experience what she had in Vladia!  \"Maybe I should have Fortis teach me how to wield and use a dagger,\" Eldonia said, \"in case something like this happens again.  I don't know the first thing on how to defend myself!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not a bad idea,\" said Athena, coming over to check on the two girls.  \"I'm sure Fortis would be more than willing to teach you.  My Gabriel made sure to teach me numerous ways of defending myself--using a dagger, firing pistol.  Considering all you've been through, my dear, such teaching would be advantageous.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinerva's breathing slowed a bit from its rapid pace as the adrenaline from her surprise attack ran its course.  She raised her head to finally take a look at the fight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCannius and Jupiter each seemed to have the upper hand against the two they were fighting.  Minerva smiled slightly at knowing her twin brothers could hold themselves well in a fight.  If she had to judge, she would think the two Vladians were tiring rapidly.  Their sword swings were becoming erratic, and they were beginning to stumble and groan after her brothers struck at them.  Further, they were breathing much more heavily.  But given the fact that Ranulf and Adolf were much shorter and didn't have near the muscularity as Jupiter and Cannius, overall these developments weren't too surprising.  Those two Vladians would either die or give up before too much longer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinerva then looked over at Fortis and Loki.  She shuddered at the look of sheer hatred on the Vladian's face.  The oily, slimy, lust-filled glances he kept sliding over to Eldonia made her grimace.  Was Eldonia the reason they had come back here?  Fortunately, Loki wasn't faring much better against Fortis than the other two Vladians were against Cannius and Jupiter.  Fortis was a solid wall of muscle and Mountanian strength.  Loki was quite a bit smaller, more lithe and agile, and used his smaller size to duck and circle Fortis.  However, he could barely find any quarter or breach Fortis's defenses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's not to say that neither Loki nor Fortis were unscathed.  Loki had numerous wounds on his body, courtesy of both Minerva and Fortis, that had blood flowing freely down his body.  However, Fortis also had several small wounds on his arms and legs and one long gash on his torso that Loki had managed to inflict on him.  Each wound seemed to give Fortis a new surge of energy, while Loki appeared to tire more and more as Fortis gouged nick after nick and slice after slice into Loki's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter another five minutes, both Jupiter and Cannius had managed to disarm their opponents.  Ranulf and Adolf looked in alarm at the twin Mountanians, then looked at each other and gulped.  They had a quick, silent conversation with their eyes before turning back to the advancing brothers.  They hung their heads to their chests and raised their arms above their heads in surrender.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLoki saw this and grit his teeth in rage.  \"What do you two think you're doing?!\"  He ducked another swipe from Fortis's sword and took several quick steps closer to his nephews.  \"Fight back, blast you!  They're only Mountanians!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha!  Only Mountanians!\" Jupiter said with a sneer.<br>\r\n\"He obviously hasn't fought many Mountanians if he thinks we're so easily beaten,\" said Cannius.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two brothers quickly took the arms of the two Vladians and held them roughly behind their backs, preventing the invaders from moving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How dare you enter my home and attack my sister and think you can easily have the upper hand!\" Fortis yelled, striking at Loki's head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLoki ducked again and staggered towards the window.  He leered at Eldonia.  \"I've already HAD the upper hand!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia flushed and turned away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis roared.  \"Quit looking at my woman!  You may have taken her without her consent, but she's NOT YOURS!  SHE'S MINE!  AND SHE ALWAYS WILL BE!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLoki parried and thrust, giving another nick to Fortis's forearm, making the Mountain lord swear.  \"Then, why is she carrying MY child, hmm?  Seems SHE IS my woman!  At least I can get her with child--something you obviously couldn't do!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT?  HOW DARE YOU TAKE ANOTHER MAN'S WIFE!  I HAVE YOU KNOW WE ALREADY <i>HAVE</i> A CHILD TOGETHER, AND YOU'RE LUCKY SHE DIDN'T ABORT THE CHILD SHE NOW CARRIES!  AFTER SHE'S HAD THIS CHILD, I'LL GIVE HER SO MANY CHILDREN, THE VANDERSTORMS WILL BE ABLE TO INVADE VLADIA AND SUCCESSFULLY CONQUER YOU HEATHENS JUST ON OUR OWN!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia blushed at Fortis's words, but hope bloomed in her heart.  While she and Fortis had been much more at ease with each other over the past couple of months, there was still a small, lingering distance between them, primarily caused by Fortis's continued guilt over what had happened to her.  Hearing and seeing him fiercely defend her honor and proclaim how much wanted to still make a family with her made Eldonia feel that last bit of distance wash away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLoki's eyes widened.  With the fury rolling off Fortis in waves, Loki could practically see his death in the Mountain lord's eyes.  Loki was tired and had lost a lot of blood.  He knew he wouldn't be able to win this fight...without resorting to other means.  Loki transferred his sword to his other hand, then grasped the pistol he had stashed in his waistband behind his back.  He drew it quickly and cocked it, levelling it so that it pointed right between Fortis's eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think so, <i>my lord</i>,\" Loki smirked.  \"Now, you will let me and my nephews go, or I will kill you right here in front of your family.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA shot rang out, and Loki looked at Fortis in surprise...before he looked down and saw fresh blood blooming from his stomach.  He turned over to look at the old woman, who had a smoking pistol held solidly in her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You!\" he gurgled, recognizing the woman who had killed his older brother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLoki's eyes rolled back in his head, and he collapsed to the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, Granny,\" Fortis grunted, \"but I had it all in hand!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmph!\" Athena said.  \"I save your life, and you complain!  Such gratitude!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis chuckled and went over to scoop his grandmother up in a smothering hug.  \"Thanks, Granny!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is he...dead?\" Eldonia asked quietly, pointing at the still bleeding Loki.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis scowled and stalked back over to the fallen Vladian.  He saw Loki's chest rise and lower slowly, indicating the man was still breathing.  Fortis sighed and ran an agitated hand through his hair.  \"No.  He's not dead.  Just passed out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We should let him lie there and die!\" said Jupiter with a snarl.<br>\r\n\"I agree!  He invaded our home, and we were merely defending ourselves!\" added Cannius.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis sighed, internally agreeing with his brothers' sentiments.  Death would be a just sentence for all the crimes Loki had committed, particularly against his own family.  However, the political part of the earl realized that he should put the three Vladians in the holding cells in his basement so that they could await trial.  Fortis figured he'd have to appeal to the king to hold trial for these three.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I agree with you,\" Fortis said between gritted teeth, \"but you know as well as I that these three SCUM have to stand trial for their crimes.  Since we're the wounded party, I can't in good conscience preside over their trial.  I will write a letter and send it off to the king as soon as possible, appealing to him to serve as judge.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone nodded.  They knew that King Leviathan would see that justice was done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis sneered down at Loki, but gathered up the Vladian roughly in his arms and carried him down to the basement; Jupiter and Cannius followed, prodding their captives along with them.</span></div></div>",

Vallerius what are you still doing here!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh!? Oh!\" said the page, and dashed out of the room to fulfil his orders... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n--- --- --- --- <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It seems rather routine\", said Old King Hercules. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Indeed, father.

See to it that you are packed and ready to leave by tomorrow morning\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, father\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And if I hear of so much as a single incident from either Lady Athena, or your grandfather, you'll be grounded for six months!

She put an arm around Cassius's shoulder, \"My lord, what is going on here!?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeviathan swallowed, and cleared his throat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing, my dear. Just um...having a conversation with our son\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nQueen Athena nodded. \"So I see\", she said. \"Is this concerning his actions for which he was dealt with last time?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not exactly...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe queen frowned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cassius, I would expect such things from your brother Gladius, and not from you! We have had to deal with his misdemeanors as you have seen. You are meant to be our heir and our example. See that you act like it!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassius groaned, \"Yes, mother...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe queen gave her son a kiss. He was certainly growing much taller now that he was in puberty. She stroked his golden hair and pinched his cheeks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"MOTHER!!!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe king chuckled. \"Away with you, son, but mind what I told you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes father\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now...\" said Leviathan, once the door closed. He grabbed the queen and twisted her around, \"What brings my lady into my chambers?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe queen smiled. \"My lordship's presence therein, of course...\" she whispered. She reached up to his broad shoulders and wrapped herself around him. Leviathan chuckled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that all?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAthena slipped her husband's robes off of his shoulders, \"I should hope not, if his majesty will allow...\" she whispered... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n--- --- --- --- <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cassie, where are you going?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Out\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Out where?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Visiting\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Visiting who?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"People\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"People where?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Out\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What people?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mountain people\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do I know them?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Papa said you were grounded!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He changed his mind\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you going to see that pretty girl?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassius blushed. \"No!\" he lied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's her name?

Why does everyone yell at me!?\" Triton fumed, and sulked off back to his own room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKing Hercules chuckled. \"Don't worry so much, my boy. Tomorrow you won't have to deal with him for at least a week!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope so!\" Cassius said. \"Stupid...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aaah, he's your brother!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's still stupid!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cassius don't say such things about Triton.

Inside, he could hear a bell jangle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a moment's pause, and then the doors opened. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah! Your Majesty! Your Royal Highness\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My dear Mistress Tibbs\", said Hercules. \"How do you fare?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, my liege\", said the old woman, \"Come inside!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll be staying for dinner. And overnight. Then Lord Vanderstorm and I will be leaving in the morning, after breakfast\", said Hercules. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, your Majesty. Your guestrooms have been prepared upstairs. Eliza!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe head housemaid approached and curtsied. Her eyes flickered over the slim, handsome form of the young prince. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The servant-boys will bring up your trunks\", she said. \"If you'll follow me upstairs\", she said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe led them upstairs, and down a corridor to the right, far from the main wing of private apartments. The two private chambers had been aired and prepared and candles burned in the sconces and fires burned in the grates. What a wonderful arrangement! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd to think, Cassius considered...he'd be here for at least a week. He relaxed and dressed, and then went exploring. At the end of the main corridor, he could hear a deep, male voice singing as he packed a large trunk for an upcoming journey. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLord Vanderstorm seemed to be in a good mood. Cassius hoped that it would stay that way. The last time they'd seen eye to eye, the hulking mountain lord had nearly throttled the life out of him! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who you?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassius stopped and turned around. A blond-haired toddler stood in the middle of the corridor, holding a fat, yellow plush-cat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well Hi!\" said Cassius, getting on his knees, \"I'm Prince Cassius!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy suckled on a thumb. \"Pwins Cassicus?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassius smiled, \"Close enough\", he said. \"What's that, huh?\" he pointed at the toy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dis Moo-moo!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's Mortimer!\" said a woman's voice. Lady Athena glided down the corridor and squatted down to pick up her great-grandson. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gwamma! Pwinz Cassicus!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes I can see that, my dear! It's very nice to see you, my lord\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassius bowed, \"Madame...\" he said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My Lady Athena\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAthena turned to see Hercules striding towards her. She smiled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your Majesty\", she said, bobbing in curtsy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please\", said Hercules, raising a hand, \"Keeping a grip on your grandchild is more important than formalities\", he said. \"Hello young fellow!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeo giggled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's your name?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Weo!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Leo!\" Athena said, \"Leonardo Fortis Vanderstorm\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aaah...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA door down the corridor opened and two girls came out. Eldonia, who looked visibly pregnant, and her best friend, Minerva. The two girls froze at the sight of the king and his grandson. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you think they see us?\" <br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\"<br>\r\n\"Maybe they don't\". <br>\r\n\"Don't be silly!\"<br>\r\n\"...The prince is staring at you, Minnie...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAthena laughed, \"oh come here, girls! Don't be silly!\" she said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mama! Mama! Pwinz Cassicus!\" Leo burbled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia hugged her son, \"Yes my dear, that's right\", she said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia kissed Cassius's hand, \"My lord\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lady Vanderstorm\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, Fortis came out, carrying his travelling-trunk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Little girl...you're the one girl for me, <br>\r\nLittle girl, you're as cute as can be, <br>\r\nLittle girl, you were mine from the start, <br>\r\nThe moment we...YOU!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a jolting 'BANG!' Fortis dropped his trunk in the middle of the corridor and stared at Cassius. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT are you doing here?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now Fortis...\" said Athena. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stay outta this, grandma! You! Now you get this through your head! You put a FINGER on my sister and I'll...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fortis!\" Minerva hissed. The influence Minerva seemed to have over her oldest brother seemed to have almost no limits, and Fortis took a deep, heavy, but reluctant breath. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike the squaring off of lions, Cassius stepped forward. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My Lord Vanderstorm\", he said. \"I swear to you on my honour as heir to our Mountain Throne, I will ever treat your valued and treasured sister, the Lady Minerva, with affection, love, friendship, respect and kindness, and that...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis snorted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fortis! What happened was...well it was...consented!\" said Minerva. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It wasn't consented by me so the hell it was!\" Fortis snapped. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was consented by me!\" Minerva hissed, \"Or does that not count!?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis groaned, \"'Course it does...girl...\" he mumbled, and draped an arm over her shoulder. Everyone seemed to wait for Cassius to continue. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know why you're upset, and I swear to you, I would never do anything to harm your sister, or bring dishonour or disgrace upon her, or your noble family and household. Your sister's a very beautiful and intelligent girl and...well I want to be friends with her. That's all\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis took another deep breath. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright\", he said. \"BUT...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My Lord Vanderstorm\", said Hercules, \"I can assure you that if there was ever any 'buts' about it, my retribution would be far swifter than yours\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perhaps, your Majesty, but certainly not as effective\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe old king chuckled. \"With any luck, we won't have to find out\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the first time since he spotted the royal party...Fortis let out a smirk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright whatever\", he said. \"I gotta get this stuff downstairs. Grandma when's dinner?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not for half an hour\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn! I'm hungry already...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

This way, your Majesty...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis took his wife's arm, and the king linked hands with Athena. Minerva stared around. Her two other brothers had already headed downstairs...inconsiderate snobs... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll escort you to dinner, my lady\", said a voice. Minerva turned to see Cassius standing behind her. Minerva blushed, <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you\", she said. <i>Gosh, he looked so handsome...Had he grown even taller??</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAthena followed Cassius downstairs, arm-in-arm. They entered the dining-room where dinner was being served. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What have we tonight, Mrs. Tibbs?\" Fortis asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We've got pheasant pie, roast pheasant, mashed potatoes with gravy and peas, garden salad, potato-chips, fresh, crusty bread with butter, and for dessert, I've made you a very nice blueberry tart\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you\", said Fortis, \"Could we have something to drink as well?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At once, my lord. I'll bring out some flagons of ale...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll do no such thing!\" said Lady Athena. She seemed offended at the very notion! \"You'll bring out some of my late husband's best aged port! Fortis, ALE? When we have such distinguished company...really!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe table laughed. Mrs. Tibbs smiled and went to find the wine. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where is it that these miscreants are being held, Lord Vanderstorm?\" King Hercules asked, as he got up to carve the roasted pheasant. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Down in the basement cells\", Fortis said. \"The servant-girls have been feeding them tea and buttered toast. And ONLY tea and buttered toast. I would have insisted on water, but Girl...well...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fortis, you can't just give them BREAD!\" Minerva shot back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is my damn castle! I'll serve what I like to whoever I like!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Quite so\", said King Hercules. \"Fresh butter to be wasted on the likes of Vladian raiders. Lady Minerva I can't agree with you. Such a wanton extravagance on persons of no importance...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My sister is invested with a more tender heart than us men\", Fortis said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So it would seem\", said King Hercules. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassius sat next to Minerva and held her hand under the table. He squeezed it, and she blushed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's right, you know...\" Cassius whispered to her. She tried to hide a grin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDinner progressed smoothly. Mrs. Tibbs was not afraid of overfeeding her master and his family; Mountanians ate almost as much as Fatlanteans did, the only major difference was how tall they were and what happened to the food once it had entered the body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmm...delicious pie, Mrs. Tibbs\", said Fortis. \"And the gravy was spectacular\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cook blushed, \"Thank you, my lord! I'm very glad you enjoyed it!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I certainly did. I think everyone did\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were murmurs of agreement around the table. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooh...That was wonderful\", said Eldonia. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You must be very full\", said King Hercules, \"Eating for two\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stupid Vladian stealing our food...\" Fortis grumbled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was that, Lord Vanderstorm?\" Hercules asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know what I said! That bastard inside her is eating all her food!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fortis! It's a baby!\" Eldonia said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't care WHAT it is! But before I get back from this trip, the only thing that monster's dick is gonna be shoved into is a coffin!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now Lord Vanderstorm, we don't know...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Assault, battery, home-invasion, use of a lethal weapon and offences against one of your kingdom's oldest and most noble families, my liege. A family which has served yours loyally for generations! Right grandma!?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh!?...Oh, right!\" said Athena. She was busy wiping cream from Leonardo's mouth (<i>\"Maw kweem gwamma! Weo wike dah buuberry taht!\"</i>)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I expect some sort of damn justice here!\" Fortis said hotly. \"I want those guys strung up like geese in a butcher-shop window!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lord Vanderstorm, I can assure you that everything will be taken care of in the proper manner and that due justice wil be served\", said King Hercules. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It better be! I don't like people touching my sister!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Fortis!\" Minerva sighed. \"Honestly your over-protectiveness can get rather tiresome at times! I was perfectly capable of looking after myself!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not against three armed men, girl!\" Fortis snorted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I suppose that's your job!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're damn right!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fortis! No arguing at the dinner-table!\" Athena snapped, \"I'm very sorry, your Majesty! But as you can see, my grandson cares deeply about our family, its rich history and deep sense of honour\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No need to apologise. Every family should preserve their honour\", said King Hercules. \"Not to divert attention, but I think I should get to bed early. We have a long day tomorrow\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis nodded, \"We do, don't we? Alright...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis and King Hercules headed upstairs. Slowly, everyone dispersed to have an early night... </span></div></div>",

He smiled at himself in the full-length mirror. A handsome teenage boy with blond hair and blue eyes, and with an increasingly muscular form, smiled back at him. Cassius couldn't help but try a couple of poses for his own ego. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter he'd washed up, he removed most of his clothes, and climbed into bed wearing just his undershorts. He yawned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Nibble-nibble...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh!?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA fat, toffee-coloured bunny-rabbit bounced across the bed towards the door. It sat in front  of the door, waiting. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...\" said Cassius. He got up and opened the door. The bunny hopped off down the corridor... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassius frowned as he stared down the corridor. He wondered which room was Minerva's? It would be kind of thrilling to spend some time with her late at night...in her own room...all alone...together...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassius pulled on his dressing-gown, a deep wine red with gold trim and lining, and headed down the corridor. He turned right at the end, past the stairs, and stared down the passage. With only his candles to guide him. All the wall-sconces had been extinguished. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe took a deep breath. He didn't know which door belonged to Minerva's bedroom! There were so many...The huge pair of double doors at the end of the corridor obviously belonged to Fortis, and led into his huge private apartment. Cassius made a mental note to stay the hell away from there. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe tiptoed down the corridor, and stopped outside a door with light showing underneath. He turned the handle and peeked inside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo, this was the nursery... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Prince Cassi...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Waarrghhh!!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassius yelped! He whirled around! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLady Athena stood behind him. Cradled in her arms was a very sleepy Leonardo. Cassius gasped and panted... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"May I ask what you're doing still awake?\" the old woman asked, as she headed into the nursery to put her great-grandson to sleep. Leo wriggled in his grandmother's arms. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gwamma...Weo wanna sweep wiff papa...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh you can't do that tonight, honey. Papa's going out in the morning\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Den Weo go wiff papa!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He'll be very busy. He wouldn't be able to play with you\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww...Awwwwwhhhhhh...Weo sweepy gwamma...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAthena kissed her great-grandson on the forehead and put him into his crib. She handed him Mortimer, his yellow plush-cat. Leo hugged the toy possessively. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Were you looking for something?\" Athena asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only to ask which room belonged to Lady Minerva\", said Cassius. He blushed, \"I...I wanted to say goodnight to her\", he added. Somehow, a look on the old woman's face told him that she wasn't fooled, but that she acted as if she believed him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Last one on the left\", she said. \"Goodnight, your Royal Highness\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassius nodded, and headed back down the corridor. He reached the last door on the left and peeked through the keyhole. There was still a light burning. She must still be up. Cassius took a deep breath, raised a hand, and knocked... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a pause. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who is it?\" a girl's voice called out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassius took a deep breath. \"It's me\", he said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassius heard footsteps moving behind the door. Then, the doors opened... </span></div></div>",

Minerva appeared, holding a candle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I come in?\" the prince whispered. Minerva nodded, and backed away. Cassius entered. Now six and a half feet tall, Cassius smiled down at Minerva. Gosh she was so pretty...that delicate, excellently cleaned hair which was so soft and silky. That cute little face, and that wonderful shapely body. Cassius closed the door and Minerva locked it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I help you, my lord?\" Minerva asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...Well I...I um...\" Cassius shifted his weight uneasily from foot-to-foot, \"I just wanted to say um...h-how nice you are.

I...No! I...I um...You're not little! I...no...I mean...you're...um...Oh gosh!...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinerva stepped closer. She was beginning to feel a boiling within her. Cassius was so tall and svelt, and cute. He had that cocky, cute grin and that beautiful wheat-gold hair and the big eyes. The perfect teeth and his body smooth with a hint of a tan. All that military training was really building up his body...in the right places...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do not be afraid, my lord\", Minerva said, \"Little Minnie won't hurt you...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassius laughed nervously and Minerva grinned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean...we're...cool...after what happened...in the castle...MY castle...um..last time...right?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinerva's eyes seemed to glaze over as the memory of that night wafted back into her head in the same way that the smell of hot buttered toast might waft up her nose. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was...it was fun...\" she said softly, \"I like it when you hold me?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You do!?...I...I mean...Of course you do!...what could these big beefy arms not do to make you happy, huh!?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinerva laughed! Cassius chuckled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh not so loud!\" Minerva hissed, trying to stop giggling, \"Fortis might hear!\" she said. Cassius smiled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTogether, they moved closer to the bed and sat down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey sat closer together, and slowly, Cassius put his arm around Minerva's shoulders. She was getting older now, and seemed to be developing nicely. He reached around and rested a hand on her...chest. Minerva gasped. She shifted slightly, until they were face-to-face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seemed almost impossible that Cassius could look so perfect. It was as if the queen had sculpted him out of clay and painted him. No marks, no pimples, not even freckles. His hair was kinda ruffled up and messy and it made him look cute. She reached out and felt his cheek. Then, the two young lovers moved closer together and he put his arms around her and she slipped her hands under his arms and around the back. He kissed her and Minerva kissed him back. They overbalanced and rolled onto the bed, continuing to hug and rub and kiss. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassius gulped when he felt Minerva rubbing other parts of his body with her hands. He started returning the favour. Then, he slowly took off his dressing-gown, revealing the fact that he was wearing almost nothing at all. Minerva felt his slim, tight body against her, and her hands felt the round, tight orbs of his backside. <i>Such a pert little posterior... </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassius groaned and gasped when he felt Minerva touch him in such a personal place! <i>How dare she... </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he knew what he was doing, Cassius found himself tugging against Minerva's nightgown, shifting it above her legs and tugging at her undergarments. Minerva gasped at this bold intrusion! Fumbling with one hand, Cassius awkwardly tugged down his shorts and his pulsating pony bucked and kicked! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt all happened so fast! Minerva felt herself being pushed back, and then she felt hands pressing on her chest! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Does my lady consent?\" Cassius whispered. Minerva opened her mouth in shock! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cassius!\" she began, \"I...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassius moved in, but Minerva backed away! \"No!\" she cried out, \"Don't touch me!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you're so pretty!\" Cassius said roguishly, moving closer and putting his hands against her shoulders, \"And you like this don'tcha!?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! Don't you dare Cassius Van Draconis or I'll scream!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I want to! And you want it too, you little vixen...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinerva's mouth opened as she felt his hand touch her bare breast! The NERVE! But...it felt so tender...and soft... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe let out a shivering moan. A smirk crossed Cassius's face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only if...we do...what happened last time\", Minerva gasped. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did we do last time?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinerva reached down and grasped Cassius's member and squeezed it! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?...Oh right...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassius reached for his dressing-gown and reached into one of the pockets. He pulled out a condom in a waxed paper packet. He ripped it open and fumbled to get it onto his trembling member. Minerva laughed when it slipped and missed a couple of times, but he finally got a grip on things and rolled it down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next thing Minerva knew, the royal ramrod was being driven inside her! This being only the second time she'd experienced it, she let out a low groan! Cassius put his hand over her mouth! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shhh! You don't wanna get Fortis bursting in on us again!\" he whispered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry!\" Minerva gasped, \"B-b-but I-I forgot how good it is...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course it is...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh YOU!\" Minerva cried out, and Cassius laughed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinerva lay there while she let her royal boyfriend plunder her depths. It felt so strange, and at the same time, so wonderful, the way he acted, the way he touched her, and made her feel...</span></div></div>",

Just then, there were blurs of brown and gold as four towering princes rocketed past! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WE'LL GET YOU, LEO VANDERSTORM!!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Boys! No running in the palace! And play nice with Cousin Leo!\" Minerva called after her four gigantic sons. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But momma...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Apollo, Bastion, Kannon, Daemon, don't let me warn you again!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Yeees mother...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now play nice!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine...Hey Bastion, go get the swords...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I SAID NICE!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? We just wanna duel...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinerva threw up her hands. A queen's work was never done...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n--- --- --- --- <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>Thump-thump-thump!!!</b></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinerva jerked awake! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe suddenly realised it was morning! Did she fall asleep!? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith his arms around her, and fast asleep, Crown Prince Cassius slumbered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Girl!? Open up!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no!\" Minerva gasped. \"Cassie! Cassie wake up! Fortis is coming!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh!? Oh crap!\" he gasped. He scrambled to his feet and stared wildly around the room. He quickly ducked behind Minerva's dressing-screen, just before the door opened. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You okay, girl?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Was there someone else in here, hmm?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh-huh...Then why is there a male dressing-gown at the foot of your bed?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinerva gasped! She'd forgotten about Cassius's dressing-gown! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...Prince Cassius gave it to me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's a foot taller than you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To MEND!\" Minerva said, \"He ripped a pocket\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis nodded, seemingly satisfied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm leaving\", he said, \"We rounded up those Vladians and King Hercules is ready for the Off. I'll be back in a couple of weeks\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinerva nodded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis grabbed his sister, hoisted her up into his arms and gave her a kiss. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Be safe, girl\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis nodded. He bent down and picked up the dressing gown. Then, with a CRASH! He pushed the dressing-screen aside! Cassius stood there, buck-naked apart from a towel wrapped around his waist. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis snorted, \"I might've known...\" he muttered. He grabbed Cassius by the shoulders, hauled him up and pinned him to the nearest wall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because of your grandfather, I will consent to having you stay in my house as my guest in my absence. But, if I find out that Minerva's pregnant, I will know why, and by whom. And when I do, you will either stop breathing, or you will marry her and make her your queen. Do I make myself clear?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassius nodded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good. Have a nice holiday\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fortis! You can't treat him like that!\" Minerva hissed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why, because he's a prince!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because he's my boyfriend!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis turned on his sister. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are my sister. And I'll be damned if anything happens to you. You understand!?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing's GOING to happen!\" Minerva said, \"Now don't worry! Besides, grandmother's here! She'll be our chaperone\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Some chaperone!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I beg your pardon?\" said Lady Athena, entering her granddaughter's bedroom, \"Fortis, you better hurry; King Hercules won't wait, you know\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cassius snuck out of his room into girl's room and you didn't know!?\" Fortis snapped. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh...of course I knew! I told him where it was!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YOU WHAT!?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fortis! It's not a secret!\" Athena said. \"Besides. I knew he was a sensible boy. He'd brought the necessary protection\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ho-how...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassius and Fortis gawped at the old lady. Athena smiled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I could feel the paper packets in the pockets of the prince's dressing-gown. Fortis, you should trust him more. You'll get along better. His intentions are always honourable and safe\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassius nodded, glad that someone was on his side, for a change! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine!...I...I gotta go\", Fortis said, and hurried downstairs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You could just say that I was right!\" Athena called downstairs. Minerva and Cassius burst out laughing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now come along\", said Athena, \"It's time for breakfast!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes grandmother. Come along, Cassius. You can just wear your dressing-gown\", Minerva said. Cassius nodded. He bent down and picked it up. Several more paper-wrapped packets fell onto the floor. Minerva gawped at the selection on the ground. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you're expecting to use all those up before my brother comes home, don't get your hopes up...\" she teased. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassius blushed and quickly picked them all up again. </span></div></div>",

Leo wailed and sobbed, holding tightly to his toy kitten. He had a death-grip on his little animal comforter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside, thunder rumbled and crackled. Lightning flashed, and rain poured down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's alright, it's just a thunderstorm!\" said Athena. \"It's just a...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>BOOM!!</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!!!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shhh! Shhh...there there...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAthena pushed the rocking-chair over to the windows and sat down. Leo sat in his great-grandmother's lap, his head pressed against her chest, sobbing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look Leo...Leo look! See? It's just rain...see? Just rain...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><i>Rrrrrruuuummmmble...</i></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uuuuuuuh...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLightning flashed across the sky, lighting up the room a brilliant white-blue for a second, and then vanishing. Leo sobbed and cried. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look Leo!\" said Athena, \"It's alright. Look at the pretty lightning...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeo sniffled. He was being SILLY! Papa wasn't scared of the stormlights! He wasn't going to be scared either! No way! No sir! No ma'am! No...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>CRACK!</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hahahahah!! What's going on!?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCannius and Jupiter came in, carrying candles. They watched as their nephew trembled against his grandmother's chest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm just trying to acclimatise him to the storm\", Athena said, \"Like I did with you two when you were his age\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah\", said Jupiter, \"Hey Canny, remember the Lightning Lord?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whitening waud?\" Leo mumbled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah\", said Cannius, \"The Lightning Lord is someone who lives in the sky. He sends down the big bolts of lightning to light the way for travellers who are out in storms, so that they can find their way to safety\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAthena laughed. The Lightning Lord was a character she'd made up, to try and calm her grandsons' fears! She'd completely forgotten. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gwamma! Uckle Candywuss whying!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no he's not! There really is a Lightning Lord. See, when storms come, it's so dark and scary and all the candles and lamps are blown out! So he sends down lightning to brighten up the stormy skies, so that people can find their way home safely, and get out of the rain!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeo stared at his grandmother. If granny said it, then it HAD to be true! Granny never lied about anything! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeo turned around, and pressed his hands against the arm of the rocking chair. He watched as bolts of lightning flashed against the sky. It was so mesmerising and dazzling...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--- --- --- --- <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside in the bucketing rain, which was being driven sideways by the relentless wind, a cloaked figure huddled along a dirt road, leaning on a staff. The cloak was drenched through and the figure beneath was freezing, and soaking wet. He may as well have swum through a river instead of walking. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA lightning bolt exploded over the sky and in the flash of light, the traveler spotted the silhouette of a towering castle against the stormy night sky. Lights burned in the windows, so someone was obviously home. Shivering, the figure kept walking. The only way this night could possibly get any worse was if it started snowing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFighting the soaking rain, the figure entered the castle grounds and staggered up the main driveway towards the front doors. On his last legs, he raised the heavy knockers on the front doors and dropped them back... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n--- --- --- --- <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><i>WHAM!!...WHAM!! </i></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust getting over his fear of the lightning, Leo burst into tears again! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was that!?\" said Athena. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounded like the knockers on the front door\", said Jupiter, \"But it's raining sideways outside! There can't be anyone out in THIS kind of weather!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><i>WHAM!!...WHAM!!</i></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe Fortis forgot his keys?\" Cannius asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be stupid. If Fortis forgot his keys, he'd climb up through one of the windows\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's someone at the front door!\" said Minerva. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who is it?\" Athena asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I haven't looked...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll go\", said Athena, handing Leo to her granddaughter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh granny be careful! It might be mean people!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassius held onto Minerva. \"It's okay. You, Jupiter, Cannius, you better go too\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who are you tellin' to...Oh right, prince, prince...I keep forgetting...\" Jupiter said. \"Alright, we're goin'...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, the entire upstairs household made their way to the front door. The knocking continued. Leo calmed down now that he realised it was the doorknocker. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAthena approached the door. Cannius picked up a fireplace poker from the parlour, just in case. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, Athena drove back the bolts and pulled the door open. Despite its height and immense weight, Athena had been opening and closing these massive doors every day for fifty years. She could easily handle it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding in the alcove was a figure about seven-and-a-half feet tall, and soaked to the skin! Suddenly, a walking-staff in his hand clattered to the ground and without a word, the knocker keeled over and collapsed in the hall! A sack, presumably holding his possessions, dropped to the ground at his feet. Athena gasped! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The poor fellow! He must've been travelling all day like this! Jupiter get him inside quickly before he dies of the damp!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damp!? Gran he's soaked through!\" Cannius grunted. He grabbed the figure by his arms and hauled him inside while Jupiter closed the front door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who is he?\" Minerva asked. They pulled the hood off of the cloak. The face was unkempt, and unshaven. He looked like he hadn't seen a razor-blade in at least two weeks. The face was youngish. Perhaps seventeen, despite the weathering and the grizzled stubble, Minerva could tell that he had a rough sort of handsomeness about him. He looked somehow familiar...She frowned as she tried to figure out why...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We better get him upstairs and out of those clothes...\" said Jupiter. He bent down to grab the man's arm while Cannius put his own arms under the man's legs. Together, they hoisted the man up in a sitting position, and started to carry him up the stairs. Normally it would only take one of the Vanderstorm twins to do this, but the man's heavy clothes were soaked through with water, which almost doubled his bodyweight. Through the damp, Cannius could feel the man's muscular back and shoulders. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Down here!\" said Athena. She opened a door to a guest-room. \"I'll tell Eliza to light a fire. Someone get him out of those clothes! And BURN them! They smell horrible!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can do that, Minnie\", said Cannius. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way!\" said Minerva, \"I'm not touching him! He's filthy!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Eliza the housemaid lit a fire, the Vanderstorm family gathered around the bed. The figure lying upon it coughed, and slowly opened his eyes. He spied Cassius and moaned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"F-f-f-For-forty...Uh-huuuugh...uuuunngh...Ulp!...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then he passed out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Forty!?\" said Cassius, \"I'm not Forty! I'm 16!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I THINK he means Forty!\" said Minerva, \"Fortis! That's always been his nickname in the family\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You think this guy is family?\" Cannius asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He looks kinda familiar...\" Jupiter mumbled. They all turned to Athena. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll know more when he wakes up,\" she said. \"Someone undress him, and then dry him, and then let him sleep\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinerva picked up the sack which held the stranger's belongings. Without warning, the water-rotten base suddenly ripped open! All the sack's contents exploded onto the floor! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh dear!\" she gasped. Jupiter left, and returned with an old barrel. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here, put all that stuff in here\", he said, \"That sack is useless!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJupiter put the barrel on a table and Minerva started picking everything up. It was an odd assortment of things. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A money-pouch...with...fifty sovereigns in it...a set of keys...Some sort of uniform...Handcuffs...chains...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinerva picked up something about six feet long and very heavy. She unsheathed a rusty old sword. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eeeewww!!\" she yelped, and dropped it! \"That thing is FILTHY!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassius picked it up. \"It's a pretty standard sword. Looks old\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinerva reached down and picked up a metallic disc on a chain. Scratched into the steel plate was a series of letters and numbers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassius grabbed the disc. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've seen these! Papa showed them to me...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

They have stuff like name, date, crime, and all that stuff\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What does it say there?\" said Athena. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassius held the plate up to the light. It was made of copper. Engraved into it were some letters and numbers and words. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is his name...\" Cassius said. \"Um...His initials and stuff. It says 'Excal. R. V/D Storm...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAthena's mouth opened slowly, \"V...Van-Der-Storm?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah!...Oooooh...\" Cassius said, when he realised what that meant. \"Um...and then this is the date of his imprisonment and...wow it's been extended three times over!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What else is there?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then down here is the crime he would've been imprisoned for. It says here, thievery, robbery, ungentlemanly conduct and...something I can't read...Oh, brawling...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh dear...\" said Athena. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassius turned the plate over to the other side. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This should have the prison where he was held. Oh wow...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it?\" Minerva asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"'Castle Ravenwood...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah...\" said Jupiter, \"I heard about that place...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's Castle Ravenwood?\" Minerva asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Castle Ravenwood is a prison\", Cassius said. \"It's up in the northern highlands, near the Vladian border. It's got gold and silver mines there. And the prisoners carve and split rocks, they make chains, they do ropemaking, quarrying. It's freezing cold all year round...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds like a horrible place!\" said Minerva, hugging her boyfriend for comfort. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If that's where this guy came from, he's come a VERY long way\", said Cassius. \"What should we do, Lady Vanderstorm?\" Cassius asked his hostess. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAthena sighed. \"I will take the plate\", she said, indicating the prison-plate. \"I want to find out exactly who this person is. Minerva, go downstairs and find Eliza or Mrs. Tibbs. Tell them to prepare some buttered toast and some tea for him. Then find one of Fortis's razors...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't do that!\" said Minerva. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why not?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fortis's razors are made of Obesitan ivory! They cost a fortune! AND they're antique AND a family heirloom! I wouldn't trust them around someone like...THAT!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Someone like THAT might be a relative of yours!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...you could at least undress him, and lay out some of Fortis's old clothing for him to wear\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright I'll do that\", said Minerva. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where's Eldonia?\" Jupiter asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's in bed. This pregnancy is wearing her out\", Cannius said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs everyone dispersed, Minerva went to her bedroom and came back with her tailoring shears, enormous, razor-sharp scissors used for cutting cloth. Fortis had honed them on a sharpening wheel until they were so sharp they'd draw blood. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giant on the bed was out cold. Cassius entered, holding a knife. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought I'd keep you company, just in case he wakes up or something\", Cassius whispered. Minerva nodded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStarting at his chest and shoulders, Minerva began to cut. The shears chomped through the thick woolen fabric, down his chest, past his heart, and down to his navel. Minerva slowly peeled back the soaking layers of cloth, and then she started removing his sleeves from his tunic and robes. She removed the hood and the cloak, and threw the soaking scraps of fabric onto the fire. The fire hissed and sizzled from the moisture, and let off great clouds of steam. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe beast had dark brown hair and thick, bulging, tightly-formed muscles. Minerva gawped at the size and apparent virility of the monster. He was very tall. At least seven feet. Even through his beard, she could see he had a strong, angular jaw. His body was bronzed and dark, and the skin on his hands was rough and callused. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The rock-splitting, the mining and the chain-making makes them incredibly strong\", Cassius said. \"All that physical labour builds up HUGE muscles\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinerva nodded. She bet! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...that's everything!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, you still have to do his pants!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pa-pants?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure!...C'mon...you know what's inside pants, huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Prince Cassius!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassius laughed, \"here, I'll help you\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassius took the shears and began slicing down the pant-legs, and removing the underwear as well. A fat, flaccid phallus flopped out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my...\" said Minerva. \"He's rather impressive\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Minnie!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-you are too!...or you will be, once you've finished growing...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the body had been stripped, Minerva dried it off with a large towel. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We need to shave him\", said Minerva. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I better do that\", said Cassius. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you know how to shave?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure...but I've never done it on someone else before\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAthena came in, carrying a tray of buttered toast and a pot of tea. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My goodness. He's quite a specimen, isn't he?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have you found out who he is yet, grandma?\" Minerva asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not yet...what's wrong?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We need to shave him, but we're not sure how\", Minerva said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I'll do it\", said Athena. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know how?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I had to do it to your grandfather. Well...not...HAD to...but I liked to shave him, and he liked being shaved. It was a 'thing' that we had\", she said. \"Alone-time together\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAthena left, and came back with another tray, loaded with shaving-equipment. Eliza came upstairs, carrying a large bucket. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The hot water you asked for, my lady\", she said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh thank you, Eliza. Just put it in the jug over there, please\", said Athena. Eliza poured the steaming hot water into the wash-basin jug on the washstand, and left. Minerva and Cassius watched the old woman as she worked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe lathered up the soap and the shaving-brush, and warmed up the stranger's face with a hot, damp towel. Once she was done, she lathered up his face all over his whiskers, and then, she opened one of the straight-razors. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lord's straight-razors were massive. Six inches long by two inches wide, and lethally sharp. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAthena moved behind the bed and pulled back the man's head. She started at his throat and began pulling the blade up. Shaving-cream and thick stubble came with it. She did the other undercheek...then across the throat...then down one cheek, and then the other. She shaved the chin, and then the moustache under the nose, and then the angles of the jaw. She ran a hand over his face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not the best shave I've given\", she said. \"I am rather out of practice, but it'll do for the time being...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith his beard gone, Athena stared at the figure on the bed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He looks familiar...\" she said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who is he?\" Minerva asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come, let him rest. My lord, I could use your arms if you don't mind\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure\", said Cassius. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey left the room, leaving the naked hunk slumbering, with tea, toast and fresh robes, old ones taken from the attic, resting at the foot of his bed. A fire and candles burned in the room, to warm it up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAthena entered the library, and indicated a huge old family record-book. Cassius heaved the heavy tome over to a desk, and opened it. She scanned the names and family trees and all the birth-records, until Athena stopped, and pointed at something with her magnifying-glass. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's him!\" she said, \"I thought that name and face looked familiar\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinerva bent over. \"Excalibur Rubicon Vanderstorm...I've never heard of him!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He came from your Uncle Versuvius's side of the family\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uncle WHO?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He was your father's cousin\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Never heard of him...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I suppose not.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinerva looked at the birth-date. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's only seventeen!...Why is he so HUGE!?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The prison labour\", Cassius said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How...\" Minerva had to sit down. It was a lot to take in. Athena sighed. It was all coming back, now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You wouldn't have remembered, Minerva. You would've been...two? I think...? Young Excalibur was always getting in trouble. He was your Uncle Versuvius's only son. Only child. And I suppose he spoilt him. After the death of his mother. Excalibur got in with bad people. He drank, he would fight, he had countless...escapades...with the village maidens. Eventually, Versuvius disowned him and disinherited him! I begged him to give Excalibur another chance. But your grandfather said that Versuvius had brought this on himself, and that there were no more chances left to give\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened then?\" Cassius asked?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He ran away from home. We never knew what happened to him. The next time we heard of him, he was fifteen. He'd been arrested for housebreaking. And there were already charges of brawling and rape and...goodness knows what else...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rape!?\" Minerva gasped. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think those were ever proven in court...but then he was sent to six months' hard labour. In prison he brawled, he took part in riots...strikes...his sentence was extended over and over. It broke his father's heart. He died shortly after. After that, we just forgot he ever existed. Until he showed up now, I'd completely forgotten about him!\" </span></div></div>",

Crack!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww fuck! What the hell...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giant lying on the bed groaned and rolled over. With a 'thud!', he hit the floor! He groaned. What the hell was going on!? Where was he!? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe got unsteadily to his feet and stared around. He was in some sort of bedroom, with a fire burning, and tea and toast, and...woah he was naked!...and shaved...and...clean! His belongings had been placed in a box on a table. He stared around and saw clean robes folded at the foot of the bed. He picked them up and tugged them on. They fit...sorta. If he was honest, they were actually a bit loose. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hulking giant tugged up the smalls and tucked his snake into them. It flopped around without any blood inside it. Loose and slack. He did up the belt, the hood and everything else and got to his feet, stretching to his full, eight-foot height. He shuffled over to the table and sat down. The tea was still warm. He wolfed down the half-loaf of buttered toast, and slurped down the tea. Bleeerch! TEA! Where was the fucking beer... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe let out a loud belch and yawned. He didn't notice the door behind him swing open. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Aaaah...\"</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>*suck-suck-suck*</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nA little blond-haired toddler entered the room, sucking on his thumb. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooh...Waaaah!!!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hunk turned, \"Woah! A baby...Hey little dude...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe toddler plomped onto his bottom and burst into tears! Just then, two women hurried in. One was old, at least sixty. The other looked...well she looked just fiiiiiine... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh there there, Leo!\" said the old woman, scooping him up, \"It's alright!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who are you people...?\" the hunk groaned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is Castle Vanderstorm\", said the old woman, \"And you Excalibur, son of Versuvius, cousin of the late lord\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...Yeah...\" said the hunk, \"Yeah! Hey um...so who are you?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm your grandmother!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Grand...Ooooh...It's um...Antelope or something...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Athena\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah...Aww geez...um...hi...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hunk shifted his feet uneasily. The girl stared at him. He seemed to breathe muscles. He towered over top of her by a good two feet, at least, and he had scruffy brown hair and a dark tan on his bulked up body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So this is like...your...granddaughter?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is your Cousin Minerva. Minerva, this is Excalibur\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-h-Hello...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well heeeey...Hehe...You're cute...So where's Ol' Uncle...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm afraid that he's been dead for over a year already\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooh...So who's the boss around here?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fortis, of course\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Forty!? Oh wow...Geez.

He flexed his arms and shoulders out of habit. \"So um...Hi...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perhaps we should go downstairs...?\" Athena suggested. Excalibur nodded and followed his grandmother and his young cousin downstairs. They entered the parlour and sat down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why did you come back?\" Athena asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nExcalibur swallowed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just got sick of it all...\" he said. \"I got tired. I got bored! I fucked the whole thing up and you know it! I was sick of running around and not doing anything. I just wanted to come home. But I couldn't go HOME-HOME...So I came here. I just wanna be part of a family again\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Need I remind you of the scandals you brought upon our house?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gran'ma...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAthena sighed. \"I want to feel like you can change...\" she said, \"But you've done some terrible things!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just wanna come home!\" Excalibur said. \"I wanna sleep in a bed. I wanna eat at a table! I wanna wear my own clothes! I wanna joust and duel and chop wood and build things and work out and do stuff! I'm sick of being on the run all the time!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAthena sighed. \"I would like to help, but the running of the castle isn't in my hands. You'll have to ask Fortis when he comes back. But until then, I suppose you can stay, provided you behave yourself\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nExcalibur nodded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It's just that, well, I don't wanna waste any time, so I thought I could accompany Minerva into the village and she could show me around\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd love to!\" said Minerva. \"Excalibur won't want us bothering him, anyway. Come along granny\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll just check on Eldonia upstairs\", said Athena, \"this horrible pregnancy is making her very ill\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone rushed to get ready. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What am I gonna do?\" Excalibur asked, standing up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Explore the castle!\" Minerva called down the stairs, \"I suppose you haven't been here since you were ten!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nExcalibur nodded. Good point. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the castle was empty, and Jupiter and Cannius had gone hunting, and Minerva, Athena and Cassius had headed off into town, Excalibur started exploring. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs with any curious teenager, one of the first places he went to were all the bedrooms, starting with Fortis's. He tried Eldonia's room, but the door was locked. He supposed that she was sleeping. He headed downstairs and explored all the reception-rooms: The parlour, the dining-room, the drawing-room, the ballroom, the morning-room and the billiard-room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nExcalibur headed out of the dining-room and pushed open a pair of swing-doors that led to a long passage. He didn't remember this from his last visit. He headed down the corridor to a pair of doors at the end. He certainly didn't remember these! He slowly pushed them open. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I told her, I said, I don't care what you think, she's a wonderful person, and she deserves him!\"<br>\r\n\"Too right. I mean he's a nice boy, really. And I think his lordship worries too much\"<br>\r\n\"He only wants to protect her. And can you blame him? She's very pretty. I wish I had a brother like that\"<br>\r\n\"You do!\"<br>\r\n\"No I don't! He's useless! Why do you think my mother sent me here? Because at least here I get paid! My brother doesn't work at all! A total layabout!\" <br>\r\n\"What a shame...\"<br>\r\n\"I know...ah, what're you gonna do?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEliza, Emily and Matilda, the three young housemaids sat around the kitchen table, chopping vegetables and meat for Mrs. Tibbs' pie for that evening. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Penny can be very possessive about her\".<br>\r\n\"Well she's lucky. I mean one day, I might become a ladies' maid, too...\"<br>\r\n\"Would you want to?\"<br>\r\n\"Hey it's just a short step from there to retirement with benefits, sweetie...\" <br>\r\n\"True...true...Oh damn I HATE cutting carrots! These stupid things roll everywhere...Oh now look!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEliza put down her kitchen-knife and turned around to pick up the carrot that had rolled towards the door. She bent down and picked it up, before slowly getting to her feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aaaaaaaaaaah!!\" she squeaked! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other girls turned! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding in the doorway was a tall, broad-shouldered hunk of the genus hom-mountanius Maximus. With beautiful chocolate-brown hair and a strong tan and rippling, solid muscles... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-hello...\" said Eliza. \"Y-you must be um...Uh...you're um...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about you just call me 'Cutie', huh?\" said the hunk, entering the kitchen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls stared at him. He was nowhere near as tall as their lord and master, but he had a certain brutish charm about him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excalibur Vanderstorm\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, my lord\", said Eliza, curtsying. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, we heard stories...my lord...\" said Matilda, getting to her feet, \"Are they...are they true?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whadda you think?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two girls squealed! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...are you the only girls here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well there's Penny, but she's gone out. There's Mrs. Tibbs the cook, and then there's just the servant-boys, Zacharia, Hermes, Perseus, and then there's his lordship's squire, Koviac\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sweet...\" said Excalibur. </span></div></div>",

And beyond that, a long corridor that went down into darkness. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's all that?\" he asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's our quarters, my lord\", said Eliza. \"Mrs. Tibbs the housekeeper and cook, has the room at the very end. Then all of us use the other rooms\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nExcalibur pointed to a pair of large, double doors at the mouth of the corridor, to the left. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's that?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Those doors lead to the basement, my lord. We store food and firewood, tools and other things in there. Old furniture and such. It's also the location of the family vaults, the cells, the root-cellar, and the wine-cellar...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nExcalibur smirked, \"Wine-cellar, huh? Cool...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe towering hunk picked up a candlestick. \"I think I'll go um...check it out...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nExcalibur opened the double doors and headed inside. The first couple of yards were a landing, but beyond that was a large, stone staircase leading slowly down, protected on one side by a stone balustrade. Excalibur headed down, his candle flickering and burning as he went deeper and deeper. Every few steps, there was another landing, but he did eventually reach the bottom. Here, he saw the cells, and the various store-rooms, as well as the thick, clay pipes used to channel water and sewerage away from the castle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the bottom of the stairs, to the right, he entered a large chamber filled with racks and barrels and shelves. He smiled. Jackpot! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLighting a couple of lanterns, the young mountain lord stared at everything. Sherry, whiskey, brandy, port, vodka, rum...it was all there! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking an old sack, Excalibur started dumping all kinds of things into it. Bottles of whiskey, sherry, brandy, port, rum, even a couple bottles of Vodka. Vladians weren't very smart, but they sure knew how to make a nice vodka. Along with that went some of the lighter drinks, such as ginger beer and sarsaparilla. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the end, he'd filled up two sacks! Slinging them over his shoulders, Excalibur carried them back upstairs. He peeked out of the basement...all the servants had gone off to do their chores. He quickly took the back stairs up to his bedroom. Boy, he needed a drink... </span></div></div>",

Then, he left the room and headed down the corridor. Where else was there likely to be booze in this place? Grandma probably kept a tipple or two for cold nights, but she'd probably shriek up a storm if she knew he'd stolen it. Wanting to keep on her good sides, Excalibur went instead to the master's bedroom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lord's liquor cabinet was the master's private stash of booze. It had been restocked since the last time Fortis went on a serious bender, but now that Excalibur was looking for a sip, anything was fair-game. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPicking the lock with a bent nail, Excalibur opened the cabinet and carried off all the decanters and bottles back to his room. He could easily finish them off and have them back before Fortis returned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nExcalibur headed back to the kitchen and came back with a shoulder of mutton, and a large hunk of cheese, and a loaf of bread. He'd have a nice dinner of bread and meat and cheese...and booze. Lots of booze... He'd missed being able to just eat and drink while he'd been out on the road, constantly having to move from town, to town, having to beg, borrow or steal, having to do menial work for a meal or a bed. As a mountain lord, such things should've been beneath him, and they probably were, but Excalibur also had a rebellious streak in him. He never liked doing things in the prescribed manner. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd that, really, had been what had started his life of misery and his reputation in the family, to begin with! But it was, oddly enough, just how he liked it! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeing a solid and bulky eight feet tall, Excalibur could drink a lot without passing out. Of course, Fortis could drink more, but Excalibur, like most mountain men, was a heavy drinker at the best of times. The backbreaking work which so many mountain men did was what had made them heavy drinkers. Sawing, felling, splitting, mining, digging, quarrying, delving, thatching, hammering, carrying, lifting and shifting. The very labours which gave the men of the Mountanian kingdom their powerfully built and renowned physiques, were also the source of their legendary capacity for alcohol. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter several hours of eating and drinking, Excalibur felt dizzy, lightheaded and sleepy. He staggered to his bed from the table where he had been having his little bender, and flopped onto the mattress. Within fifteen minutes, he'd passed out and fallen asleep. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She shook off the bedsheets and laid down fresh ones, she swept down the dust, brushed out the chimney, flue and grate, and polished the windows. She was busy trying to push the enormous linen chest across the floor to sweep under the bed, when the double doors burst open! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aaah!\" she squealed, and whirled around! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis Vanderstorm entered. He towered over her, a prime example of the Mountanian warrior elite. He dumped his travelling bags on the floor and tore off his sweat-drenched tunic, revealing his glossy, sweat-smeared body. He had obviously just arrived home and had come straight to his room. He looked rough and grungy, as if he hadn't washed...or shaved...in three whole days. And it looked like he'd been on the move the whole time. He grabbed the linen chest and shoved it roughly across the floor. It slid over the smooth flagstones and banged up against the far wall. His powerful biceps and broad shoulders rippled as he exerted his brutal force upon the heavily-loaded chest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Th-thank you, my lord...I'll...I'll be done soon\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis merely shrugged and nodded. He headed into his private bathroom and started working the pump that filled up his enormous bathtub. Eliza couldn't help but peek through a crack in the door as his powerful muscles worked up and down, driving the pump handle back and forth to bring water from the main cistern to his bathtub. Then, he started working another pump, and water from the boiler downstairs in the kitchen started gushing out. The water was hot and steamy. Finally, Fortis disrobed completely and climbed in. He let out a loud groan and sank beneath the water, stretching out to his full ten-foot height...even though the bath was almost double that size, to accommodate the extra length of his arms. He grabbed a sponge and started scrubbing all over. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eliza! What are you looking at!?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEliza jumped! She whirled around to see Lady Athena. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...um...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing moving the furniture around!? What's all this stuff on the floor!? Oooh that Excalibur's been in here already and...who's in the bathroom!? If he's in there making a mess, I'll...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Eliza could say anything, Athena pushed the door open the whole way...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HEY!!!\" <br>\r\n\"Aaaaaaaah!!!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a violent splashing, the splatter of wet feet, and a flurrying of linen! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"GET THE HELL OUT! I'M HAVING A BATH IN HERE!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAthena backed quickly out of the room. She was proud of her oldest grandson and everything about him...although she blushed a bit, at seeing him in his bathing attire of...nothing! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was about to say that his lordship just got back...\" Eliza said, blushing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's...Oh my! Then that must mean...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My lady\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAthena turned around to see King Hercules. She kissed the king's ring, while Eliza curtsied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your Majesty\", Eliza said. She bowed, and went back to her cleaning. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When did you arrive?\" Athena asked, \"We thought you weren't coming back for another three days at least!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Things wrapped up rather quickly\", Hercules explained. \"If it be your pleasure, my lady, my grandson and I will spend the night here, and then be on our way tomorrow morning\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yes! Of course! Eliza, tell Mrs. Tibbs we'll be expecting company for dinner\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes m'lady!\" said Eliza, and she hurried downstairs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, the bathroom door opened and a full-naked Fortis lumbered into the room, a towel over his head. He opened his closet and reached for a fresh shirt. He tugged the towel off and threw it over his dressing-screen, and turned around...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\"WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARRRGGGHHHH!!!???\" </b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHercules and Athena burst out laughing! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"CAN'T NOBODY GET NO PRIVACY IN THIS DAMN HOUSE!?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKing Hercules doubled over, laughing. \"My good lord Vanderstorm, I...hahaha! I assure you...your...hahahahaha! Your grandmother and I have seen it ALL before!...Come, my lady. We shall leave your good grandson to dress and retain what little of his dignity he still possesses!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis let out a frustrated groan and went back to dressing. He tugged on his hose and then reached for his codpiece, an enormous, sock-like fixture which he tied around his waist to stop the girls from screaming at the size of his...aristocratic attachment...something that happened pretty often, he was proud to say... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was just tying things up, when the doors opened again. A tallish, brown-haired hunk entered, carrying bottles of alcohol. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh wow...um...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis stared at the hunk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who the heck are you?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-i-I'm...wait a minute...who the hell are YOU?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is my castle! And I am its master! And you will answer me when you're spoken to, sirrah!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah, chill out...So...Oh yeah you gotta be Forty!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I beg your pardon!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Forty! It's me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...who?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don'tcha remember? It's me! Remember your little cuzzy?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...No. Get out\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Foooorty. It's me! It's Excalibur! Remember? Last time we saw each other, I was ten and you were...what? Thirteen or fourteen? Minnie was like seven...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah well I spent a couple of years up in Castle Ravenwood...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA look of dawning settled on Fortis's face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NOW I remember you...What the hell are you doing in my house!?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah, cuz...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"GET OUT!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, I'll come back later...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NO! I MEAN GET THE HELL OUT OF MY CASTLE! NOW! PACK YOUR SHIT AND LEAVE OR I'LL THROW YOU OUT OFF THE ROOF!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sheesh! What crawled up your ass and laid an egg!?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YOU KNOW DAMN WELL WHAT YOUR FUCKING AROUND DID TO OUR FAMILY! WE NEARLY LOST OUR WHOLE REPUTATION THANKS TO YOU!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah calm down, Forty! I done my thing! I screwed up! I come back! I just wanna settle down...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How'd you like to settle six feet under!?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis crossed his room. Then, he noticed the bottles of alcohol. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis turned and stared at his empty liquor-cabinet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HAVE YOU BEEN DRINKING MY STASH!?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Weeeeeeell...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YOU BASTARD!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey watch it, cuz! I brought it back, see? I was gonna top it up!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis drew a sword out of its scabbard on a rack, \"GET...OUT! NOW!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAthena hurried upstairs. \"Fortis WHAT is all this shouting about!?...PUT DOWN THAT SWORD AT ONCE!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell him to leave!\" Fortis snarled, \"We got no space in our house for Vanderstorms who bring disgrace to the family name!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now see here, Fortis!\" said Athena, \"You might be master now, but I am STILL the family matriarch for as long as I draw breath! And as such you WILL obey me! You know that Excalibur is your cousin! You will give him bed and board while he stays here!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Says who!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Says ME! I will NOT allow you to turn FAMILY out into the streets and the wilds! Excalibur has paid hard for his wrongs, and has come to make amends and a new start in his life!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well he can make that start SOMEWHERE ELSE!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fortis don't be a child!\" Athena shouted, \"Excalibur HAS nowhere else! Ever since his father died...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And a good thing too, the shame he brought on him!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"DON'T YOU DARE TALK ABOUT YOUR UNCLE VESUVIUS LIKE THAT! Ever since he died, Excalibur HAS nowhere to go! So he came here! The least you could do is show him common familial mercy!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mercy my ass! I want him OUT within an hour!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Absolutely not! Excalibur, go back to your room!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT!? YOU GAVE HIM A ROOM!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well of course! Where else!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HE CAN SLEEP IN THE PIGSTY FOR ALL I CARE!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fortis! What's this shouting about!?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NOT NOW GIRL! I'M IN NO MOOD FOR ALL YOUR SWEET SHIT!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fortis! Excalibur's been a big help!\" Athena said, \"He's been helping around the house! He's been doing the things that you couldn't do because you were away!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I'm BACK now, so he can beat it!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Forty! But he's really nice!\" Minerva said, \"He even plays with the baby!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YOU...HE...DON'T YOU DARE LET THAT DEGENERATE NEAR MY KID OR I'LL...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You wouldn't dare!\" Minerva fired back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis looked like he was about to erupt. He strode up to his cousin, grabbed him by the neck and slammed him against the nearest convenient wall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You stay the HELL away from my kid! You so much as LOOK at him I'll slice your ears off and boil them in a pot of oil! I don't need YOU passing on all your FINE traits to him like your whoring and brawling and cussing and drinking!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, this..fr-from a...a-g-guy with a...b-bbooze c-cupboard i--in his own room!\" Excalibur coughed out as Fortis's hands locked around his throat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"GET...OUT!\" Fortis growled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

On the table in front of them were pies and roasts, crispy garden salads with rich sauces and dressings, loaves of bread, and olive-oil, and butter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAthena and Minerva entered the dining-room. Fortis and the king stood up, both men gesturing their desired females closer to their sides. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How fares your wife, my lord?\" Hercules asked, sitting back down, \"She does not join us?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lady Eldonia is still feeling poorly from her pregnancy\", Athena explained, \"What DID happen to that scoundrel who planted his seed within her?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He has been dealt with\", said the king. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You had him executed?\" the old woman asked, matter-of-factly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No...\" said Fortis, grumbling, \"KIng Hercules wouldn't allow that\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My dear fellow, I know precisely what you wanted\", said Hercules, \"But the fact is, those miscreants are worth more to us as prisoners than corpses. We have put them to work in the salt-mines\", he explained to Lady Athena. \"Their addition to the prison-labourers allowed us to release three Mountanian men on good behaviour\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That sounds very nice\", said Athena. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I still wish you'd had them hanged\", Fortis grumbled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wanted to do what was best\", Hercules said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That WAS best! What if they escape!?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can assure you that won't happen. To get out of Castle Ravenwood they'd have to escape across the gorge and river, first...and then up the mountains...and through the valleys...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y'know he's right, Forty. It ain't easy gettin' outta that place. Trust me, I tried!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis stopped and looked up. Excalibur stood in the doorway. The young hunky teenager gave a cocky grin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh. Remember me, Forty? I come back! It's your ol' buddy cuzzy Cally!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis's eyes narrowed. \"What is HE doing here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now Fortis\", Athena said, \"I invited him to dinner\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He can have his dinner up in his room\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. He'll have his dinner here. I want him to be with family\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WE ARE NOT HIS FAMILY!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We are the ONLY family he has left!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And who's fault is that? Ours or his? I won't sit around with someone who disgraced his family and nearly ruined ours!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAthena sighed, \"Fortis. Stop being a child! Excalibur. Sit down here. Eliza. A plate and cutlery and a bowl and a goblet for Lord Excalibur\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis turned to King Hercules, \"I thought noblemen lost their titles after they'd been convicted of crimes!?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do they?\" Hercules asked, \"I wasn't aware of that\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WELL THEN IT SHOULD BE A LAW! He's not a lord! He's lucky to be alive!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My good Lord Vanderstorm. Your cousin, despite his misdeeds, has served his time and has been released lawfully back into society. He has come to you for a home and for mercy. I would think someone as noble and generous and honourable as yourself would grant him both\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't have any honour when he went to jail! We only just got it back!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Fortis you're exaggerating things!\" Athena sighed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are young, Lord Vanderstorm. You are but...what? Twenty-one? Twenty-two? In time, you'll learn mercy and tolerance and patience\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have plenty\", Fortis countered, \"But NOT for scoundrels who blacken our family name!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis felt a pair of arms wrap around his massive left bicep. His sister. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fooorty...Please be nice...Excalibur's really sweet!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YOU TOUCHED MY SISTER!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah calm down!\" said Excalibur, \"It's not like I tried farming her! Sheesh!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fortis, Excalibur was perfectly honourable and sweet!\" Minerva said, \"Why can't you see that!?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh whatever...Eliza!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe housemaid stepped forward, \"Yes, my lord?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Another bottle of port\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, my lord\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis glared at her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean 'No, my lord'? I said port! Now!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's none left, my lord\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W...THERE WERE FOUR BOTTLES OF IT! Where's it gone!?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh was that what that stuff was? Gee it was good...\" Excalibur said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YOU DRANK FOUR BOTTLES OF MY BEST PORT!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey it was good...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis groaned. He got slowly to his feet and bowed to the king. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you'll excuse me, my liege, but my...COUSIN...and I...have matters to deal with. Excalibur! Come!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis left the room and dragged his cousin with him, and down to the cellar. He lit the candles in the sconces and stared around. He gawked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? It was...it was good booze...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HOW MUCH DID YOU TAKE!? HOW MUCH DID YOU DRINK!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I dunno...um...maybe um...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HALF THE BOTTLES ARE GONE!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...okay um...in that case, I drank half of the stuff you got...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooooooh mountains above...Did you write any of it down!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Write it down, what for?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W...SO I KNOW WHAT TO BUY NEXT TIME!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No...I didn't know I had to...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's a BOOK right here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh is that what it is? I thought it was some stupid math-book. It had all these fractions and numbers in it...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Those are the numbers of BOTTLES you idiot!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W...like that song?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What song?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know...99 bottles of beer on the wall, 99 bottles of...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"SHUT UP!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he could restrain himself, Fortis landed a punch on Excalibur's cheek! Excalibur staggered back against the wall, the bruise rising, and smarting, on his face! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey cuz! Sheesh! If you wanted to play rough, you should'a told me! I can do that too, y'know!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that a challenge!?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hell yeah if you want it...Duel to first blood, huh? Tonight?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine!\" said Fortis. \"Tonight! After dinner!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine!\" Excalibur said. \"And your wine was delicious!...Oh thank you, Excalibur, I'm glad you liked it...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"SHUT UP BEFORE I POUND YOU AGAIN!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww jee cuz, I appreciate the sentiment, but I'm really not into boy-boy sex...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis felt his temples pulse and the blood rise in his neck and chest...</span></div></div>",

Down below, they wore white hose. They stood out in the castle gardens. Everyone watched from the open dining-room windows. Between them were two identical dueling-swords. The two parties stepped forwards and selected their blades, and then began to square each other off, slowly circling around each other. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe swords were long, thin dueling rapiers, not the heavy battle-swords that Fortis was used to. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nExcalibur made the first swing! Fortis ducked and swung his blade up! A shower of sparks! The crowd gasped... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis lunged forwards! Excalibur hopped aside! He swung down! Fortis reared back, but swung his blade down! Excalibur thrust upwards to block it! A loud 'clang!' echoed through the gardens. Everyone gasped! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, both Mountain lords were going at it, hell for leather! They swung, thrust, deflected, blocked, twisted, plunged, engaged and disengaged, shifting their feet from side to side in a circle. Their incredible stamina meant that both parties could go on for hours if they wanted to. As a result, it was considered good sportsmanship to end a duel as quickly and decisively as possible. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo that end, the dueling became more and more ferocious, as each tried to outdo, and exhaust the other. Fortis tried to keep up, but the fact of the matter was, he was already worn out from all the travelling he'd done earlier in the day. Excalibur swung down his sword and with a mighty blow, knocked Fortis's blade from his hands! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you surrender, cousin?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Again!\" Fortis shouted. Excalibur picked up Fortis's sword with his own blade, and flicked it through the air. Fortis caught it and they went back to dueling. After a while, Excalibur disarmed his cousin again! Fortis's sword flew off his hands and hit the ground, sliding several yards across the grass. Excalibur tripped Fortis over and pressed his swordpoint against his throat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you surrender, cousin?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a flick of his blade, Excalibur gave Fortis a nick under the chin, drawing forth a drop of blood. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Duel to first blood, cousin. I win!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis groaned. \"Fine. Whatever. Get me up\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd rather not. The servant-girls might like to, but I don't\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis groaned, \"Whatever...\" he grumbled, and got to his feet. </span></div></div>",

How else was he supposed to protect all the pretty girls who admired him? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sat down at a chair at the table and reached for an upturned tankard. And started drinking beer out of the nearest keg. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was strong beer. Mountanian lager. Not just ale. Real heavy stuff. He gulped down pint after pint of the stuff. He'd finished six pints before he grabbed four kegs, tucked them under his massive arms, and lumbered up the stairs with them to his bedroom. He gripped the tankard between his teeth. He shuffled upstairs and to the bedroom at the end of the corridor. He kicked the door open, kicked it shut, dumped the kegs on the floor, set one up on a table by the window, and started drinking out of it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first, Fortis began just drinking it, tankard after tankard, but then, he simply hoisted the barrel over his head. He opened the spigot and put his mouth around the nozzle, guzzling down gallons of beer at a time. When he was done with that, he chucked the barrel out the window, and began on the next barrel. He kicked his chamber-pot over to the window so he could piss halfway through his sorrow-drowning session. In a room at the other end of the castle, even more drinking was going on... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n--- --- --- --- <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Poor loser...\" Excalibur slurred as he gulped down another bottle of rum. \"Why can't he...*hic!*...be a ...be happy fo-for my success...\" he moaned. \"I...I just w-wanna-wwaaaanna be friends...a-an-and cucuzzinz...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe groaned and another empty bottle, the fifth, slipped out of his grasp and rolled onto the floor. \"I...I mean...Uuugghh...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomeone knocked on the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C-c-commin!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door opened. Excalibur sniffed and blinked and brushed his chocolate hair out of his face. \"W-who....who iz it...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Calibur!\" said a girl's voice, \"You look terrible!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>*hic!*</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh! You SOUND terrible, too!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehehehehe...C'-c'mere...*BURP!!*\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinerva entered the room and sat down on her cousin's bed. \"Calibur, why can't you be nice to Forty?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...*BURP!!*...I am n-nice...\" he groaned. \"I am...sooooooooooooo nice...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe draped an arm around his cousin and kissed her, \"Hehehe...purdy girl...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know you are! And I want you to show that to Forty! If you want him to trust you and let you stay here, you gotta show him that you're nice! That you're not gonna be some terrible influence or something!

Excalibur let out a drunken giggle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-you th-think I...I should go speak to him?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. Just...tone it down a bit, that's all...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmmm...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nExcalibur gave his cousin a drunken kiss. \"Arrigh...\" he said, and yawned. \"Hemme up...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinerva got to her feet and tried to ease Excalibur to his own feet. He got up and groaned, leaning against his bed. \"Oh man...\" he said. He stepped on a bottle and rolled across the floor! Minerva grabbed his arm before he fell over! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn it! Can't this...f-fucking floor stay SHTILL!?\" he slurred. He fumbled for the doorknob before staggering out into the corridor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you want me to show you the way?\" Minerva asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know ho...h...how tah...w-w-ugh...walk...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinerva watched as Excalibur weaved his way down the corridor, staggering from door to door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Forty!\" he shouted, opening a door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Uckle Salad?\"</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...s-sorry Lion...*hic!*...Leo...w-wrong d-door...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nExcalibur finally reached the master bedroom and fumbled with the doorhandles. he pushed them open. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-hey f-Forty...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n--- --- --- ---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis kept drinking. He was now on the last barrel of beer. Soon, he was pretty sure, he'd pass out, flop over and fall asleep...Then when he woke up, he'd forget all about this shit... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, his bedroom door opened and Excalibur lumbered in. He carried two bottles of rum with him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-hey f-Forty...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis groaned, \"W-whaddayou want!?\" he slurred, \"F-fuckkov...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis got to his feet. But he was already so whoozy, that it was impossible! With one arm still on the last barrel of booze, he suddenly flipped backwards out the window with the barrel still in his arms! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Forty! N-now's no t-time to-to go f-flying...\" Excalibur blubbered. He shuffled over to the window and stared out. Fortis was lying on the ground, the barrel nearby. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"F-Forty?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>*Burrrrrrp!*</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nExcalibur leaned out the window, \"Forty?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why's my bedroom full of leaves!?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-you f-fell outta th-the w-window...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The w-window's behind me...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-no it isn't...Y-you tripped o-over...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...Hey pretty bunny...hehehe...prettyprettyprettybunny...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woooaaaah!!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nExcalibur let out a yelp as he too, fell out the window and landed in a bush! His two bottles of rum landed with a 'thud!' in the grass nearby. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two cousins got to their feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"F-*hic!*-f-Forty I's so-Sorry f-for being a p-pain in the butt! I...I just r-really wa-wanna stay here! I-isso nice!\" Excalibur slurred, trying to pull himself up. He reached out for a bush to steady himself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AAAAAAAAAAAAAARRRGGGHHHH!!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"E-c-Calibur?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-why'd the b-bush BITE ME!?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a-r-rose bush you i-*hic!*-idiot!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah...I f-forgot they have teeth...Bad bushy!

He burst into giggles. He pulled the cork out with his teeth and started gulping it down. \"Mmmm sweeeee-*hic!*...sweeeet...Y-ywant s-some rum F-Forty?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmm...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Th-there's another bottle somewhere...Oh here it is...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis took the other bottle from his cousin and began drinking. Boy it was good...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"F-forty I'm so-sorry for being mean and acting up!\" Excalibur slurred. He tipped the rum-bottle upside down and drenched the front of his shirt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh-what happened...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You put the bottle in your MOUTH first!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah...Aww no more...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis blinked furiously. \"I g-guess I was...If youse really wanna s-stay...Y-you gotta pwommis t-to...*BURP!* B-be good!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I pwommis!\" Excalibur said, and sniffled. He ripped his shirt off and threw it on the ground. \"Aww damn...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehehehe...wow yo-you grew muscles...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah grew 'em in pr-prizzon...B-bre-breakin' rocks an' shit...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-you break shit?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-y-know what I mean...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You break up hunks of dried shit with a shovel?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OH SHUT UP!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis exploded into drunken giggles. \"Y-you pro-romise...?\" he asked.

And the family which they all served, tended to be rather laid back, most of the time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEliza shuffled into the kitchen and lazily poked the fire in the grate. She filled a kettle with water from the pump over the basin, and hung it on a hook to boil. She headed to the wood-locker and brought out several logs which she dumped on top of the fire to get it up to proper flame again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Morning, Eliza\", said Mrs. Tibbs, shuffling towards her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mornin' Mrs. Tibbs\", said Eliza. \"I'm making some tea\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good...Yes I could do with a cup!

You go and get some eggs for our breakfast\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's none in the basket\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then take the basket and go to the hen-house\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright...Huuuurrrrggghhhmmmm...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sleep badly?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I had...dreams...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"About his Lordship?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mrs. Tibbs!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aaah, you young girls...all getting in a tizz over a boy!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEliza grabbed the egg-basket before the housekeeper could make anymore jokes about how much Eliza fantasized about her lord and master. He was...VERY cute... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe opened the kitchen door and headed outside. A few yards away from the castle was a chicken-yard. Inside, chickens roamed around, in and out of their coop, and in and out of the fenced-in area around it. The gate was generally left open. The chickens never wandered very far, and invariably came back, since Eliza always fed them lots of delicious corn and grains. The result was that the chickens were all extremely fat and fluffy...and not able to waddle very far, to begin with! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Chitter-chitter!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nEliza entered the chicken-yard and began collecting eggs for breakfast. Two dozen. Enough for the servants, and their masters and mistresses. She heard a rustling sound and turned around. Butterscotch the bunny was slapping his ears against the fence. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's the matter, Butterscotch?\" she asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rabbit let out a soft chittering noise, and bounced away on its fat, fuzzy legs. She followed after him. Then, she saw it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLying buck-naked in a mess of fallen apples and a broken tree-branch, Lord Fortis and his cousin Excalibur, lay stone cold on the ground. Eliza's mouth dropped open! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my goodness!...Mrs. Tibbs! Come quickly!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If this is for anything other than a fox getting at those chickens again, then I'll...WHAT on earth is going on here!?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wuuuuuuhhh...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis groaned and his head lolled to one side. \"W-whuu....whut'z...wuzzgowwinawn...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe opened his eyes and immediately regretted it, as the morning sun sliced into his brain! He winced from the blinding light! His head pounded like his heart had traded places with his brain! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooooooh fuck...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My lord!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OH SHIT!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis's eyes snapped open and he now fully took in his surroundings. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the...w-where the fuck are my clothes!?...W-where's my...Why's there an apple up my ass!? Ow...why...what am I doing out here!?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis sat up and slowly pulled himself to his feet, and surveyed the scene around him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woooooaaaah...w--wa-what happened...*hic!*...Oh man...I...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis took in the empty rum-bottles and the beer-barrel. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooooooh...\" he said slowly. \"Oh n-now I r-remember...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, he turned around and spotted Mrs. Tibbs and Eliza. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey...WOAH WHERE'S MY CLOTHES!?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMrs. Tibbs blushed and Eliza giggled. Fortis stood before them, completely naked, his heavy sex-tackle hanging low and flaccid between his thick, muscular legs, his blond hair mixed with grass and water, his towering frame leaning slightly from a mind-bending headache and hangover. Suddenly, he hunched over into a bush and emptied his guts! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh lord!\" Mrs. Tibbs said, \"Eliza! Go and get some towels! And...and some clothes! Quickly!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEliza hurried inside. She bumped into Emily and Matilda. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's going on outside?\" Matilda asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can't talk! Naked boys! Gotta go!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-naked...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily stared at Matilda, \"Did she just say...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two maidens hurried outside. Eliza heard their muffled squeals of delight at the discovery of their disrobed lords.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerhaps she shouldn't hurry back with the clothes? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEliza found towels and spare clothing, and hurried back downstairs. By now, Excalibur had woken up, as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooh man...wooaaah...H-*cough!*-Hey F-Forty...w-what happened man...I...WOAH!!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSPLASH!! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"STUPID...*spit!*...LAKE!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a POND!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHATEVER! Oh damn! It's cold!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore splashing, as Excalibur pulled himself out of the pond...again. The maidens dried them off and led them indoors. Mrs. Tibbs seemed singularly unphased. Eliza questioned her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My dear\", she said. \"I helped raise three Vanderstorm boys who got drunk all the time before their time. I've seen them do more than enough reprehensible acts to be shocked by this!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So-sorry M-Mrs Tibbs...\" Fortis said, blushing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You two best go upstairs and rest. Sleep off those alcohol headaches\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-Sure Mrs. Tibbs...\" Excalibur moaned. Together, barely standing upright, they headed to their rooms. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mrs. T., what should we do with all those apples?\" Eliza asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMrs. Tibbs frowned, \"That's a jolly good idea, Eliza. I suppose we should thank his lordship and his cousin for getting them off the tree...so long as we overlook the um...creative manner in which they carried out their fruit-harvesting...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe maidservants giggled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Collect them up, and we'll make pies!\" said Mrs. Tibbs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooh boy!\" said Emily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AFTER...breakfast\", Mrs. Tibbs said, before Emily dashed out the kitchen door. \"Now come on! Eggs and sausages and bacon to cook, toast to make, butter to be spread. Where's the blueberry jam...?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n--- --- --- --- <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis lay in bed, trying to sleep off his hangover. Minerva had watched her brother and her cousin being helped to their respective rooms. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomehow, she knew that after their session last night, they would get along a lot better with each other, from now on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe headed downstairs for breakfast with Cassius. Cassius laughed when she'd told him what had happened. Sleeping in a guestroom at the far end of the castle, the prince had not heard any of last night's commotion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Papa?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis yawned...He slowly opened his eyes. Crawling across his bed was his baby boy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Papa!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Papa! Papa pway wiff Weo!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Papa! Pwaaaaay!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go awaaaaay...\" Fortis groaned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Papa?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Papa's all hung-over, kid. Go play with Uncle...um...what's his name...uuuuh...Jupiter...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Papa pway wiff Weo?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. Papa no play with Leo\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awww...Papa sweep wiff Weo?\" the toddler asked, hopefully. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis groaned. Actually that sounded rather fun...perhaps he could do with some company... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay...Papa sleep with Leo...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeonardo Fortis Vanderstorm immediately wriggled into his father's bed, and Fortis rolled over, wrapping his arms around his son and giving him a bristly kiss. Leo giggled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Papa wuz funneh las' night...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Papa an' Uckle Eggsaladbar! Wuz singin' funneh songz. A-and s-swimmin'.

Perhaps it was just a dream? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Papa wuz dwinkin' funny water!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh...Ooooooh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNOW he remembered. Oh man what a NIGHT. He had to remember not to do that so often...but boy... wow! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeo hugged his father. \"Papa okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah son...papa's fine. Papa's just not feelin' so good. Papa wanna sleep\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww. Weo sweep too\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh...Okay son...\" </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Excalibur lay on his bed, groaning. His head felt like someone had split his skull open with an axe. What a night! And he had a lump on his head. How'd that happen? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh right, he fell out the stupid window...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis back was killing him. He'd landed harder than he'd realised. He groaned and tried to sleep, but his aches and pains and dizziness was making it hard. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomeone came upstairs. Eliza carried a bottle, a bucket of hot water, and some towels. She knocked on one of the doors. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My lord?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe put down the bucket and opened the door. Fortis was asleep. She tiptoed in and was about to shake him awake, when she saw a tuft of blond hair peeking out from under one of his huge arms. She squatted down and a smile spread across her face. Baby Leo was fast asleep in papa's arms... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGliding silently, she slipped out of the room and closed the door behind her. She headed down the corridor and turned left at the landing. She knocked on another door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huuughh...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe opened the door a crack. Excalibur was on his bed. \"W-who izzit...?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's Eliza the housemaid, my lord. I thought you would like a massage\", she said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh...Oooh...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nExcalibur tried to sit up. He winced! Damn it, his back hurt...Yeah that massage might be good... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay...\" he grunted, and laid back on the bed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEliza tugged down her dress slightly, pulling it off of her shoulders, and pulling down her frontage slightly. Just a little taste for his lordship...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe picked up the hot bucket of water and the oils and cloths, and headed into the room. She kicked the door shut and approached the bed. Excalibur lay in amongst the sheets, naked, except for a towel wrapped around his waist. She moved up to the bed and put down the bucket and the other accouterments that she'd brought with her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where does it hurt, my lord?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My back is killing me!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awww...Perhaps his lordship should roll over?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nExcalibur nodded. As he repositioned himself, Eliza took in his brown, flowing hair and his bronzed, sculpted body. Those years of quarrying and mining had built up powerful back muscles, strong, broad shoulders, a thick neck and impressive arms. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEliza put the bottle of oil into the bucket of water. As the oil heated up, Eliza rubbed her hands together to warm them. Then, she took the bottle out of the water, opened it, and poured the oil over Excalibur's back, between the shoulder-blades. Excalibur gasped from the heat of the oil, and then let out a low groan. He felt a pair of hands rub along his back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMassaging Excalibur was not easy for Eliza. Quite apart from his sheer size and girth, there was not an ounce of fat on his body for her to grab or squeeze. Instead, she stopped using her hands, and reached for a pair of wooden mallets. She started beating and scraping these up and down his back in deliberate patterns. Excalibur let out a moan as the mallets drummed into his back. He panted and groaned...oooooh that felt so good! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He got to his feet and staggered backwards, tripping over something on the ground and falling flat on his ass! He groaned and got up again to examine the cause of his untimely descent. He saw his cousin Excalibur lyin on the ground. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C-Cuzzy...?\" he mumbled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>*Burrrrp!*</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...y-you'se s-s-sleepin'...I'mma letcha sleep...Huuurrggghh...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis crawled along the ground towards the back door.

He bumped into a large potted plant on a low stand and grunted. He steadied himself against the wall and started watering the hapless fern with his garden-hose, before staggering into the nearest bedroom. He fumbled around in the dark, and then flopped into the bed, completely naked. He pulled the covers over himself and snuggled up to the other occupant therein.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm-mmmm...So pretty...so...sooooo puuurrrdddeeeey...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis put his arms around the other person and let his hands linger around the chest...Hehehehe...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fortis?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis giggled drunkenly, \"Hehehehehehe...Yeah it's Forty...Mmmmm...hehehehehe....you like that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stroked a pair of soft, tender breasts in his large, rough hands. \"Yeeeaaaah...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"FORTIS!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh!?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat voice wasn't Eldonia's!

She was used to her brother's nocturnal visits. They happened often enough that she never bothered waking up for them. Whenever Fortis wanted some tame, female companionship in bed, without the pressure of 'commitments to marital activities', he would sneak into his sister's room and share her bed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinerva didn't stir when she felt her brother's legs around her...or his head against her shoulders.

She gasped! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn't care if he WAS her brother! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"FORTIS!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis rolled back off of her and giggled. \"Hehehehehe...purdy l-laaaady...\" he slurred. He tugged on her arm, \"Purdy l-laaady...c-come to...to y-your f-For-for-Forty...Hmmmm...F-Forty loooooooooorr-*hic!*-love....\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fortis!?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinerva gasped as Fortis grabbed her with strength which he rarely displayed in her presence and dragged her on top of him! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehehehe...Whyza lady runnaway?\" he burbled. He pulled her in, \"She w-wanna play hard--hardy g-get w-wid her m-*hic!*-M-Mou-moun-mountain l-lord!?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis hands started rubbing all over her. It was now that Minerva smelt the alcohol on his breath. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fortis you're DRUNK!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"D-durnk m-make g-good f-fucking...y-ou-you know l-lady? Is w-what you lii-*hic!*-liiiike...mmmm?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinerva frowned. LADY?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer brother had never called her anything but 'Girl!' in his entire life! She gasped! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fortis! It's me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of c-*hic!*-course it is! Sooooo SEXY!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout warning, Fortis rolled over, pinning his sister underneath him! He held her down and tugged on her nightie, trying to rip or pull it off! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fortis NO!\" Minerva cried out. She tried to kick but her brother's legs and knees kept her legs from moving! And she only had one arm free to fight him off! Useless at best! In desperation she swung out a hand and slapped him in the face to distract him! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huurrghhh!\" Fortis grunted, \"ugh! Damn it...Ugh...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fortis! It's NOT Eldonia! It's me! It's Minerva! It's your sister!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whu...nooooooo...G-girl's r-room is the f-first on the left!

Minerva gasped! She got out of bed and bent over him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Forty?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uuuuuggggh...purdy lady...hehehehehehehehehe...you look like girl...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fortis!\" said Minerva, kneeling on her brother's chest, her face inches from his, \"Who do I look like!?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh...FUCKSHIT!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis crawled backwards on his hands! He crashed into the bedside table! A heavy jug of water fell off the table and cracked him on the head! Minerva caught the jug before it hit the ground, and her brother slumped over, completely unconscious! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinerva got to her feet and stared at her unconscious brother, and sighed... NOW what was she going to do!? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh, he was naked... she hadn't realised that!... </span></div></div>",

Eldonia squatted down at the front and Minerva held the back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ready? Lift!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinerva hoisted the frame up and they started walking out of her bedroom.

However, I have no intention of letting that happen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRanulf and Adolf grinned.  \"So, what are we going to do to escape?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLoki gave an evil smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--- --- --- ---<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I <i>hate</i> bringing those men their meal everyday,\" Katie complained to Lucy as the two young scullery-maids carried trays of tea and buttered toast down the steps to the dark, dank basement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy shuddered.  \"I know!  They're so big and scary!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, ladies!\" said Koviac, who escorted the two girls every day to the basement to feed the prisoners.  He patted the sword strapped to his waist.  \"I won't let anything happen to you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, Kovi!\" Katie gushed, making Koviac smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy, however, looked Koviac over skeptically.  \"I don't know.  You're awful small compared to those men.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!\"  Koviac frowned and brought his arms up to pump his biceps a bit.  \"I'm not that small!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatie and Lucy giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA loud moan rent the air, causing the three children to stop in their tracks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh-wh-what was that?\" Lucy whispered as she huddled close to Koviac.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!  You girls here with our dinner, yet?  We got a problem in here!\" came a loud voice from the cell a bit further down the hallway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKoviac drew his sword and looked at the two girls.  \"You two stay behind me, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatie and Lucy nodded quickly and scurried to get behind the older boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKoviac cleared his throat and called out, \"What's the matter?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My brother's sick!  He ain't used to all this damp, cold air down here!  He's got a fever or somethin' 'cuz he's shaking and won't wake up!\"  Another loud moan came from the cell.  \"Hear that?!  He's been doing that all day, and he's only gettin' worse!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKoviac frowned and drew near the cell.  He stood up on his tiptoes to peer through the bars in the door.  He immediately drew back when Ranulf's face greeted him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!  You listenin' to me?!\" Ranulf asked angrily, trying to put a hand through the bars to reach out towards Koviac.  \"My brother needs help!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKoviac took a step back and raised an eyebrow at the Vladian.  \"What, you think I was born yesterday?  You can't fool me with the old 'my brother is sick' trick!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Out of the way, Ranulf!  Let me talk some sense into this kid!\" came a low, gruff voice near the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLoki's stern face appeared between the bars, and he glared at Koviac.  \"You think we would waste your time, boy, on some sort of trick?!  My nephew needs medical attention, and he needs it NOW!  So, you better get your butt and your keys over here, or you might have a dead Vladian on your hands before morning!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKoviac snorted.  \"Puh-lease!\"  However, Koviac turned his head when he felt a tugging on his sleeve.  \"What?\" he whispered to Lucy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kovi, um, one of them was coughing and stuff yesterday.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" said Katie, \"and he was sniffing real bad and sneezing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not really gonna let him die are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, please, don't let him die!  That's mean!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKoviac sighed.  \"Look, girls!  They're faking!  What do you think they're gonna do once I open that door?  They're gonna escape, that's what!  And I'd be lucky to keep my hide once Lord Vanderstorm knows I'm responsible for it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I don't think he <i>is</i> faking, Kovi!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, and what if they promise to not escape if you unlock the door and take a look at the sick man?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKoviac rolled his eyes, but felt himself giving in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, <i>Kovi</i>,\" Loki sneered, \"we'll be good and promise to not escape if you come take a look at my nephew here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See?  He's gonna be nice!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine!\"  Koviac scowled at Loki and drew his sword.  \"Step back away from the door and keep your hands where I can see them!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLoki made a show of holding his hands up so that Koviac could see them before moving away from the cell door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKoviac kept his sword at the ready as he fumbled with the key-ring at his belt.  Finding the correct key, he unlocked the door and slowly pushed it open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stay back!\" he hollered, brandishing his sword.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What, you think we'd rush you when we're completely unarmed?\" Ranulf asked, scoffing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKoviac took several small steps into the cell, keeping one eye on Loki and Ranulf, while briefly glancing at the third Vladian.  The sick man was lying in the far corner of the cell, curled up in a fetal position, moaning every once in a while, and shivering violently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKoviac kept slowly walking into the cell.  He was just beginning to think the Vladians were telling the truth, for the moaning man's face appeared flushed with fever and sweat, when....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NOW!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Koviac found himself swordless.  A hard knock on the head with the butt of his sword had him falling to the stone floor, out cold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Katie and Lucy could even scream in alarm, Loki and Ranulf had caught them and clamped large hands over their mouths.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll stay quiet if you know what's good for you!\" Loki snarled at them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLoki and Ranulf hauled the girls into the cell, gagged them with strips of cloth they tore from the girls' skirts, and tossed them in the corner next to the passed out Koviac.  Adolf, meanwhile, had gagged the squire for good measure and relieved the boy of his keys.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that went off without a hitch!\" Ranulf said clapping a hand on his brother's shoulder.  \"Way to act, bro!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Quiet, you fool!\" Loki hissed.  \"We're not out of the woods, yet!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We ARE going to leave now, right?\" Adolf asked with a raised eyebrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRanulf noticed the gleam in his uncle's eye and said, \"Oh, no!  You're not seriously considering going back after that woman, are you?  Come on, Unc'!  Let's just go home!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And leave such a great opportunity?!  Besides the woman, the Old Mountain King is certainly occupying one of the guest quarters of this castle!  If we take him captive, just imagine how much we could ransom him for!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, please!\" snorted Ranulf.  \"The old king would probably rather die than have the reigning king pay any sort of ransom for him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I agree,\" said Adolf.  \"If we have to leave with someone, I'd rather it was the woman.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, now,\" said Loki with a smirk.  \"That sounds more like it!\"  Loki swished Koviac's stolen sword a few times through the air before pointing towards the open cell door.  \"Let's go, boys!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdolf locked the three servants in the cell, and the three Vladians crept up the stairs towards the house proper.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>This time, Loki was NOT going to screw up. He left the basement with Adolf and Ranulf, and the three of them bounded up the stairs. This time, he was NOT going to make a mistake. No sir! No ma'am! He was gonna get the RIGHT door and get the RIGHT girl this time! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLoki tiptoed down the corridor. The door on the left at the end belonged to the lord's sister. He supposed that made sense now. The door in the middle, at the end of the corridor obviously belonged to Lord Vanderstorm. The door on the RIGHT must belong to his wife...of course... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLoki approached the door and tried the handle. The stupid thing wasn't even locked! He pushed the door open slowly. Eldonia was asleep, heavily pregnant, exhausted, and lost to the world. She never heard them creep in. But she felt them when they put their hands on her! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore she could scream, Loki pulled a pillowcase over her head and gagged her mouth! Eldonia gagged and tried to scream, but only a very muffled, indiscernible sound could be heard. The two underlings hoisted Eldonia up and carried her off! They hurried out of the room and downstairs, and then out the back door, through the gardens, out a side-gate, around the castle, and then off into the woods down the road... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n--- --- --- --- <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMrs. Tibbs yawned. She woke up early today. She knew that his lordship would want to be ready to leave as soon as possible. She turned off her alarm-clock, wound it up, and shuffled out of bed. What a night... she headed out of her bedroom and shuffled down the corridor. She frowned. Something was wrong. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doors to the basements were wide open. That was never meant to happen... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLighting a torch, she headed downstairs. The basements stored barrels, sacks and crates of things; firewood, tools, Lord Vanderstorm's workshop, old furniture, gold, food-stores... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shhh...someone's coming...\"<br>\r\n\"What do you mean 'Shhh!'? HEY! HEY WHO IS THAT!?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMrs. Tibbs jumped! She hurried to the bottom of the stairs and ran to the four holding-cells that were to be found under the castle. She screamed when she realised what had happened! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh dear!\" she cried out, and hurried towards the cell. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mrs. Tibbs get us out of here!\" Katie yelped. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs housekeeper, Mrs. Tibbs naturally had a set of keys to every lock in the castle; her very job depended on them, of course. But while she had keys to the basement, only Lord Vanderstorm had keys to the cells! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't have the keys!\" she said. \"I'll have to ask his lordship!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He gave the keys to me!\" said Koviac, \"But those bastards stole them!...Oh crap! Lord Vanderstorm's gonna MURDER me!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now don't panic! I'll go and explain what's happened!\" said Mrs. Tibbs, and she jogged upstairs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n--- --- --- --- <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My lord...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmmm...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My lord do wake up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh...Hmmm...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lord Vanderstorm! Wake up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh!? What...Mrs...What are you doing here!?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Something's happened! The Vladians escaped in the night. I think they overpowered Koviac and the girls when they brought them their food. They locked them in the cells and we can't find the keys!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT!?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis leapt out of bed, \"WHAT!?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know what happened!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooh shit!\" Fortis groaned. He rushed out of the room and then kicked open his sister's bedroom door! Minerva shrieked! Cassius fell out of bed!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I swear nothing happened!\" Cassius blurted out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRealising that Minerva was safe, although possibly pregnant...Fortis moved to the next door on the other side of the corridor. He rushed in and whipped the curtains back!...Eldonia's bed was empty! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"FUCK!!!!\" he roared. In a fit of blind rage, he slammed a fist into the fireplace mantle! Some ash-buildup actually crumbled out of the chimney and landed with a \"poof!\" in the fireplace below. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis lumbered out of the bedroom and headed downstairs. He went through the kitchen. Cupboards were open. Food gone! He lumbered downstairs to the basement. Koviac saw the furious state of his master and mentor and backed against the wall of the cell. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a deafening screech and scraping, and cracking noises, Fortis grabbed the cell door and physically ripped ot off its hinges, in his uncontrollable rage! He threw it across the basement, narrowly missing Mrs. Tibbs. It crashed to the ground several feet away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT THE HELL DID YOU DO!?\" he roared. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My-m-my lord, I -I swear!...\" Koviac began. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YOU'LL BE DOIN' A LOT MORE THAN THAT, BOY, WHEN I TELL THE KING WHAT YOU DONE! YOU CAN FORGET ABOUT YOUR FUCKING KNIGHTHOOD AND GO BACK TO YOUR FUCKING PARENTS TONIGHT!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My lord!\" said Mrs Tibbs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT!?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...nothing!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls rushed out of the cell and Koviac followed. Fortis grabbed him and slammed him against a nearby pillar. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You better talk FAST, boy, or I'll be sending you back to your parents in a BOX!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-w-we c--ccame d-d-ownstairs t-to f-f-...feed...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"FEED THEM BULLSHIT! WHAT HAPPENED!?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They tricked us! They disarmed me and pushed us into the cell and then they ran off!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YOU FUCKING IDIOT! HAVEN'T I TAUGHT YOU ANYTHING AT ALL, YOU STUPID BLOCKHEAD!?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"B-b-b-bu-m-m-my lord! All they did was escape! Y-y-ou can-c-can f-find them again!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"FUCK IT! THEY KIDNAPPED MY WIFE YOU STUPID BITCH!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O...oooh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There better be a damn good explanation coming out after that...\" Fortis said, his voice dangerous and rumbling. Koviac struggled to swallow, and shook his head. Fortis dropped him. Veins pulsed. He was BEYOND furious! Koviac got up and rushed upstairs! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n--- --- --- --- <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What on EARTH is going on downstairs!?\" Lady Athena asked Mrs. Tibbs when she came to her bedroom in tears! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Vladians escaped and they've taken Lady Eldonia with them! They locked Koviac and the kitchen-maids in the cells! His lordship is VERY upset!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I heard!...I daresay the village down the road could hear him!\" Athena said, \"I better go and see him...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh don't do that, my lady! He's in a furious temper!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't care if he's stark-raving mad! Out of my way!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n--- --- --- --- <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDownstairs, King Hercules was trying to reason with Fortis, who was pacing back and forth in the dining-room. He was breathing very heavily and he looked like he would rip someone's arms off! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fortis!...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT!...is it...grandma?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You will STOP this display at once! You're acting like a child!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"BULLSHIT!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I BEG YOUR PARDON!? FORTIS MAXIMUS VANDERSTORM YOU WILL SPEAK TO ME WITH RESPECT!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis collapsed into an armchair and, to the surprise of everyone...burst into tears! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awww there there...\" said Athena, \"Granny's sorry...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh shut up!\" Fortis sobbed, \"I fucked it all up! I can't even look after her AFTER she got back!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fortis you have NOTHING to reproach yourself about!\" Athena said, kneeling by her grandson's massive thighs, \"You're a loving husband! A wonderful father! Nobody could've seen this happening! But we'll find them! And we'll bring them back!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The fuck we will!\" Fortis croaked, \"When I find them I'll tie them to a fucking tree! I'll GUT THEM ALIVE WITH MY OWN SWORD!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lord Vanderstorm! You'll cease this display at once!\" King Hercules said. \"If you're truly deserving of the title which you have inherited, of the position which you hold, of the decorations and honours presented by your country's rulers upon your family's achievements, then you'll do less moping around and more action! We'll rally together a search-party at once!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis sniffed, and coughed...and took a huge sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I guess you're right...\" he said, \"I'm sorry...I...I feel like such a LOSER!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No-one with a record, temperament and personality like yours could ever be considered a 'loser'\", Hercules said, fatherly. \"Now come along, or all the good Vladians will be dead already...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis let out a weak laugh. Trust old King Hercules to treat this like a hunting-trip. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Koviac!\" Fortis called out, sounding more like his old self. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-y-yes my lord?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get upstairs. Find me my battle-armour...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Surely that's not necessary?\" said Hercules. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHEN I FIND THOSE COCKSUCKERS THEY'RE GONNA WISH THEY HAD ARMOUR BY THE TIME I'M DONE WITH THEM!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Right...\" said Hercules, \"Point taken...Lord Cannius, Lord Jupiter, you'd better both go and get ready as well\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, your Majesty!\" they said, and hurried upstairs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinerva hugged Cassius and gave him a kiss! Cassius's mouth dropped open in shock! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh isn't he a WONDERFUL person!?\" She said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who? My grandpa or your brother?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Both!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh!...yeah....yeah...they's...you can stop squeezing me so hard now...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? Oh!...Sorry Cassius...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Eldonia grimaced as her bottom bounced up and down on the hard saddle of the horse.  She cringed from how close Loki was holding her to his body, as she was seated in front of him between the vee of his thighs.  She felt disgusted and almost dirty at feeling his hard erection press firmly into the crease of her buttocks.  She wanted to gag at how he thrust himself into her every once in a while, whether intentionally or involuntarily from the movement of the powerful steed underneath them.  All she knew was that she was cold, tired, sore, and uncomfortable, especially as the steady trotting and running of the horse made her large, pregnant belly sway up and down too much.  She tried to hold it to keep it from bobbing too much, but her hands could only do so much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Quit squirming, <i>Krasivaya</i>,\" Loki murmured into her ear, making her shiver in disgust.  \"You're not making this any easier on yourself.  All you're doing is making me want you more.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe licked the shell of her ear, making her yelp in dismay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLoki grinned.  \"Oh, yeah.  I love the sounds you make.  Tell me more.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia clamped her mouth firmly shut, but couldn't help the groans of revulsion that left her throat as Loki continued to press hot, slimy, wet kisses on her cheek and neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLoki chuckled.  \"That's it, <i>Krasivaya</i>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Eldonia soon had to let out a different kind of moan.  Her eyes clenched tightly shut, and she gripped even harder on her belly as she doubled over, gasping.  Pain radiated through her middle--a pain she had felt before about two years ago--a pain that made her heart pound wildly in fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing?\" Loki hissed, his hand moving up from her belly (which he had been caressing fondly, feeling his child kick within her in delight) up to her bosom to press her back against him.  \"Are you trying to fall off this horse?  Are you stupid?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AAAAAHHHHHHHAAAAA!\" Eldonia screamed as a horrible lance of agony raced again through her abdomen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLoki frowned.  He put his hand back on her belly and noted it felt rock hard, where before her belly had felt merely firm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is...something wrong?\" he asked, a tiny note of fear creeping into his voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia hissed in a breath.  \"I...I think...all this stress...has put me into labor!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLoki's eyes went wide.  \"Labor?!  But...but it's too early, isn't it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes!\" she hissed.  \"It's only been...seven months...but when the baby decides to come...he comes!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, then,...what should I do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know!  When I...had Leo...it took almost a whole day...before he was born!  But...these pains are coming...very fast together already!  AAAAAHHHHHH!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLoki held her close as she bent over her belly again in pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've never delivered a baby before!\" he said harshly into her ear, trying to not let the panic he was feeling show.  \"Try to...hold it back before we reach the next village!  I'll find a doctor or healer for you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's...there's no time!\"  Eldonia groaned, and Loki swore as warm wetness began to sodden his trousers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gross, woman!\" he growled.  \"Couldn't you have told me you needed to relieve yourself?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was my...water breaking!  The baby's coming...really fast!  I...already feel the need...to push!  OOOOOOHHHHHH!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you're not birthing MY SON on the back of my horse!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLoki whistled to his nephews and halted his horse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's up, Unc'?\" said Adolf, as he and his brother came up to a halt beside Loki.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, why are we stopping?\" asked Ranulf.  \"We're only a few miles from the border!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My woman's having her baby!\"  Loki kept a hand on Eldonia as he swung off his horse.  He then gently cradled Eldonia to his chest and eased her off his steed before walking over to a soft pile of ferns and laying her down.  Eldonia immediately rolled to her side and gripped her belly, moaning in pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdolf and Ranulf looked at Eldonia in fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"B-b-baby?!  Here?!  Now?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, you idiots!  Look at her!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLoki knelt down next to Eldonia and tenderly brushed her hair off her sweaty forehead.  \"What can I do?\" he asked her helplessly, quietly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just...don't leave me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia grasped his hand tightly in hers and squeezed hard.  Loki frowned as his hand was crushed.  Trying to think, he looked over at his nephews, who were just standing next to their horses, gawking at his woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You two!  Tie up the horses!  Then, go find some firewood and build a fire!  We're camping here for the night!  Also, find a rabbit or two for some stew!  And find a couple of those blankets in my saddle bag!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving grown up responding to the swift note of command and barked orders, Adolf and Ranulf were soon scrambling to obey their uncle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come, <i>Krasivaya</i>,\" Loki crooned, gently easing Eldonia onto her back and then to lean against a nearby tree.  Eldonia's face was scrunched in pain, and she was panting and breathing rapidly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooohhhhh!  He's...he's coming!  I...I gotta push!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLoki scrambled down to her legs and gently lifted her nightgown up to her belly, baring her womanly assets to the cool evening air.  Loki's eyes were mesmerized by the sight of his child's head already visible and covered with fine blond hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I see his head!\" he choked out, an impossible grin splitting his face.  He had never really thought much about being a father, but with the reality of it staring him right in the face, he found he rather enjoyed the idea!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It...it hurts!\" Eldonia whimpered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLoki crawled back over to her side and ran his hand gently along her cheek.  \"I know, <i>Krasivaya</i>.  But a few more pushes, and our child will be born.  Come on, now.  Push for me!  PUSH!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia let out a long groan and bent forward over her belly, pushing with all her might.  Loki looked down between her legs.  \"That's it!  I see more of the head!  Keep pushing!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia pushed and pushed, groaning and moaning, her face a study in concentration and pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Loki left her side and gently pulled.  Eldonia screamed as the shoulders came free, and the baby suddenly left her body in a rush of fluid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLoki lifted up the squalling newborn, his eyes raking over the new life in wonder.  It was red and slimy, skinny and small.  But it was all his.  His...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn enormous grin lit up his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a boy!  His son!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLoki laughed in joy and stood to his feet, lifting the unhappy infant above his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Behold!  My son!  The fruit of my loins!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe lowered the child and held him by his armpits in front of his face.  \"You will be a great leader someday, my son.  Therefore, you need a strong name worthy of your position!  I name you Odin, king of the gods, for you will be a ruler and leader among the Vladians!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLoki wandered over to his nephews, who already had a roaring fire going and were busy skinning rabbits for supper.  He grabbed a blanket and wrapped up his son, proudly showing off his new offspring to Adolf and Ranulf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia, meanwhile, was temporarily forgotten.  She lay on the cold ground in a mess of her own fluids.  Her body was shivering from the cold and the shock of giving birth.  She moaned as she passed the afterbirth, and then curled in on herself.  She was sore and exhausted, and she soon slipped into an uneasy sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A boy, huh?\" said Adolf, looking down at the newborn in his uncle's arms.  \"Congrats, Unc'!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, now that you have what you wanted,\" said Ranulf, \"what are we gonna do?  What're you gonna do with the woman?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLoki looked up at his nephews and raised an eyebrow.  \"Why, keep her, of course!  Who else am I gonna find to feed my son?  Besides, she's a good lay and obviously fertile.  I'm sure I can get a whole army of sons off of her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But, Unc'!  That Mountain lord won't give her up without a fight!\" warned Ranulf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, but he first has to know where to look in order to find her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdolf and Ranulf looked at each other in confusion before turning back to their uncle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" asked Adolf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Boys, I think we'll need to leave Vladia for a while.  Hide out in some other country for a bit, to make sure that Vanderstorm won't find us.  After a few years, he'll give up looking and find a new wife.  Then, we can return to Vladia and begin our mission of conquest once again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"L-leave Vladia?!  But, Unc'!  It's the only place we've ever lived!\"<br>\r\n\"Where will we go?!\"<br>\r\n\"What if people recognize us?!\"<br>\r\n\"Won't our accents give us away?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLoki sighed and rolled his eyes.  He couldn't believe his own family could be so stupid!  He'd make sure to raise his son right so that he'd be intelligent and cunning!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up and listen!\" Loki barked, stilling his nephews' tongues.  \"First we go back to the keep to get some money and supplies.  Then, we go to Lucia or *gag* Fatlantis.  Maybe even as far south as Fantasmia.  We say we're refugees from Vladia, trying to escape the tyranny and unfair way of life.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe winked, and his nephews grinned, understanding the irony.  After all, 'tyranny or death' was their family motto.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And,\" Loki continued, \"who would recognize us since we've never been to Lucia or Fatlantis or Fantasmia before?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But...what about the woman?  Won't she make a fuss?  Try to give away our cover?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLoki smiled evilly.  \"She wouldn't dare.  Not if I threaten the health and well-being of her child.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Unc'!  You wouldn't!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" 'Course I wouldn't!  But, she don't know that, does she?\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Eldonia's mind was filled with a whirlwind of strange dreams intermixed with a few snatches of awareness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...She was at home with Fortis and Leo, showing her happy, laughing son his new sibling. Even Fortis seemed to accept the child....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...She saw a tall, dark, stone keep, full of armed men that eyed her with either lust or distaste. She shivered in fear and succumbed to exhaustion once more....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...She was in said keep with Loki, and he cuddled her close and gently to him as they lay in their bed. He pressed kisses into her hair and ran a hand along her arm, making her skin erupt in goosebumps. He aroused her slowly, warmly, and easily brought her to ecstasy with his hand before he gently entered her from behind, bringing them both to an amazing climax....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...Then, Loki was slapping her face, smacking her arm, and pushing her roughly to the stone floor of a cell. He laughed and mocked her, sneered at her, spat at her, and raped her again and again and again. She cried and screamed and tried to escape, but nothing she did succeeded....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...A jarring bump had her moaning and opening her eyes. She saw fields full of wheat and corn rapidly pass by. The sight made her feel dizzy, and she closed her eyes again....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...She was living in a small cottage on the edge of a large forest. She stood at a window looking out and saw six or seven children of all different ages playing outside. She smiled. They seemed to be all boys. Leo was the oldest, and there was even a set of twins. A pair of strong arms wrapped around her waist, and turned her head to receive the passionate kiss from her lover. His face was out of focus, but it didn't seem to matter to her who it was. His hand came up to rest on the small head near her chest, and she looked down to admire the baby in her arms. The baby was feeding hungrily at her breast....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia moaned and put a hand to her head. She felt weak and tired, hungry, thirsty, and sore. Pain radiated out from her nether regions, and when she tried to sit up, her abdomen protested. Her hand flew to her belly, and her eyes shot open when she realized it wasn't round and firm, but deflated and a bit soft. The memories came to her suddenly. She had given birth! But where...?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then acknowledged that the suckling she had felt from the baby in her last dream had continued, even though she was now awake. A warm, squirming weight in her arm and a small, hungry sound had her looking down. A smile slowly spread across her face as she watched her child feed. The baby was small and thin, but as she examined the child (a boy, she discovered first), she found that he was perfectly formed. Ten little fingers, ten tiny toes, a cute little button nose, and wisps of blond hair covered his head. She placed a small kiss on his forehead before gathering him even closer to her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Ursula had told her many months ago that the child she carried was not Fortis's, Eldonia had felt a sharp spear of betrayal pierce her heart.  Even though she knew in her head that her kidnapping and rapes hadn't been her fault, bearing the evidence of it in the form of a child made her feel as though she had betrayed Fortis, betrayed her wedding vows to him.  At the time, even though she didn't want to kill the unborn babe in her womb, she felt no love or longing for it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, now....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had felt the child grow and kick and move inside her over the past several months.  Yes, his father was Loki.  But she was his mother.  She bore him in pain and blood and suffering.  He was hers.  And well, how could she not love her own child?  He was real to her now, as she held him in her arms and fed him milk from her body.  He was depending on her for his life.  Despite the fact that he was Loki's son, Eldonia merely saw her own looks on the child--her blond hair, the shape of her face, her nose, her mouth, her ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe would protect him with her life against anyone who would harm him.  Against the whole world, if necessary.  And especially against his own father.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich brought to mind her once-again captor:  Loki.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere was he? It was just she and the baby in the homey room. Eldonia looked around her and noted the large, comfortable bed she was on, the colorful quilt and drapes, the rustic wood of the table beside the bed and the dresser across the room. Where was this place that Loki had brought her to?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs fortune would have it, the door opened, and Loki strutted into the room, his nephews following behind him, trays overflowing with food in their hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, my <i>Sladkaya</i>, you are finally awake,\" Loki said with a leer, settling himself on the bed near her hip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia glared at him and shuffled away from him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And feeding my son. He's a hungry little thing. Demands to be fed every two hours! Had to support him myself when he fed from you while you were passed out with fever.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia swallowed hard, despite her dry mouth. \"Wh-where are we?\" she asked hoarsely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Adolf!\" Loki snapped. \"Don't just stand there! Fetch the lady a glass of water!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdolf quickly set down his tray and poured some water into wooden cup. Eldonia took it gratefully and gulped it down. She wondered, though, why Loki was being even remotely kind to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLoki sneered at her. \"I will tell you where we are, <i>Krasivaya</i>, but only after we make a little deal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What sort of deal?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLoki reached out a hand and gently cupped his son's head, copping a feel of her full, round breast as he did. Eldonia shuddered in revulsion and tried to scoot back farther on the bed, but Loki caught her arm and kept her from moving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will tell you of our plans,\" Loki said softly, \"where we are, where we're going, what we'll be doing, but only if you promise not to tell ANYONE what I tell you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And why should I do that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, my spunky woman. That's what I love about you. You see, my dear, if you tell anyone, in hopes of escaping from me, well, I'll just take the punishment out on your body. I'm sure you're familiar with my...methods.\" Loki licked his lips as his eyes raked down her form, still clad only in her ratty nightgown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia shivered. However, steeling her courage, she stiffened her spine and spat back, \"Yeah, well, since I <i>am</i> familiar with your methods and have endured such before, how can you be so certain that will deter me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLoki's eyes went hard and he yanked her close to him, making her yelp and causing the baby to wail. \"Oh, I know it won't deter you. However, you are not alone now, <i>Sladkaya</i>. If you wish no harm to come to your son, you will keep your mouth shut!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia looked at Loki in horror and held her squalling son tightly in her arms. \"You wouldn't! He's...he's your son!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLoki shrugged in nonchalance. \"I can always sire more children, more sons. What is one small, scrawny boy in the long run?\"  Loki looked hard into Eldonia's eyes. \"Now, do I have your word, on threat of your child, that you will not repeat what I am about to tell you to ANYONE?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia gulped and nodded, her eyes wide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My nephews and I have decided to travel for a bit. The Vladian countryside has seemed...rather stifling lately. So, we're journeying south for a while. We're currently in Fatlantis, in an inn in Glastonbury, some fifty miles from the Vladian border. And, since I need a minder for my new son, we're taking you with us on our journey.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia didn't think she was being told the whole truth, but she figured Loki would reveal nothing if she pressed him for clarification.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where is your...our...ultimate destination?\" she hesitantly asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I haven't decided yet. However, I doubt we'll linger long in Fatlantis. Fatlantis is so...boring. And everyone here is so disgustingly obese.\"  Loki shuddered with a grimace. \"The only plus about journeying through this wretched country is that the food is always exceptionally good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia's stomach decided that moment to growl. She blushed while all three men laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It has been two days since you've eaten anything, <i>Krasivaya</i>,\" Loki said. \"Feel free to eat anything on the trays here that Adolf and Ranulf have brought up. Meanwhile, we'll look after the babe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia tried to hold onto her still-crying baby, but Loki firmly removed him from her arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There, there, now, my little Odin,\" Loki said, smirking down into his son's red face. \"There will be plenty more milk for you in a couple more hours.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLoki's face grimaced, and he held out the upset infant to Ranulf. \"Go change my son!  He stinks!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRanulf cringed, but gingerly took the baby from his uncle. He and his brother had been responsible for burping and changing the newborn since they had left Mountania. Loki merely made sure the child was fed and warm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Ranulf and Adolf left the room, Loki turned his eyes back on Eldonia, who was trying to straighten her torn, tattered gown over her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll leave you to eat,\" Loki said huskily. \"However, I'll be back with better clothing for you to wear. And I'll expect a certain...payment for my generosity.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia gasped.  \"But...but I am not yet recovered from giving birth!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLoki grasped her arms and hauled her to his body again, where she could clearly feel the hard bulge in his pants. \"I care NOTHING for your travail! If I WANT YOU, WENCH, then I SHALL HAVE YOU! Is that understood?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia nodded her head, her body quivering in fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLoki let her go and got to his feet. \"I'll be back in thirty minutes. You'd better eat what's on those trays, because you won't be fed anything else the rest of the night!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door slammed shut behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia merely curled into a ball and sobbed. \"Forty!\" she whispered fiercely. \"Forty, please, please, please find me!\"</span></div></div>",

While he well understood his grandson's obsession with the heirs to the Fatlantean throne (he had had a similar obsession himself when he was Merlin's age), his current task at the Fatlantean capital required discretion--something his grandson still didn't grasp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Merlin, for the last time:  my appointment with King David is private and personal.

Now, get on back to your studies!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awww....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Merlin dejectedly left Draxon's room, Ursula came in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was Merlin's long face for?\" she asked her husband.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDraxon groaned as he waved his wand in a complicated pattern towards his dresser and closet and clothes magically flew into his waiting bags and trunk.  \"He wanted to go to Regis City with me.  I'm afraid I had to be rather firm with him that he couldn't come this time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUrsula chuckled.  \"He reminds me of Mordred when he was Merlin's age.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDraxon snorted as he fastened the clasps on his luggage.  \"He reminds me of ME when I was his age!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUrsula laughed.  \"I bet he does.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDraxon sighed and embraced his wife.  \"I'm not looking forward to this visit, to be honest.  To be called in as a special counsel for the Fatlantean and Mountanian crowns regarding Vladian activity near the border is not my idea of fun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I'm sure it's not.  However, I know that Kings David and Leviathan will appreciate any intelligence and insight you'll bring to the table.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you for your confidence, Ursa.\"  He gave her a kiss on the cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, is that any way to say goodbye to your wife?\"  She gave him a saucy grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDraxon grinned back before planting a solid kiss on her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm.  Now that's more like it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDraxon chuckled and gave his wife a mock shove away from him.  \"Tease me anymore, and you'll encourage activities that will give me a heart attack!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You didn't have a heart attack last night!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDraxon blushed.  \"Hush, woman!  You'll let the entire castle know our secrets!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUrsula gave him a kiss on the cheek before whispering in his ear, \"I love you, Draxie.  Come home to me soon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I love you, too, Ursa.  I'll be back in a week.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUrsula left the room so Draxon could finish packing.  As Draxon was walking by his window, fastening his cloak about his shoulders, he caught sight of three horses in the distance, meandering along the dirt road that led passed the White Castle.  While travellers weren't terribly common this far north in Fatlantis, he occasionally saw people on horseback journeying towards or from Mountania.  Normally, seeing horses and riders outside his window wouldn't give Draxon pause.  However, as soon as his eyes landed on the sight of those three horses and their riders, a feeling of foreboding chilled Draxon's heart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDraxon laid his cloak on the bed and stepped closer to his window.  He focussed intently on the travellers in the distance.  Two horses carried just one passenger, with both of them appearing to be men, while the third and lead horse carried two passengers, with one of these appearing to be a woman.  The sense of wrongness increased in Draxon's heart as he kept watch on the four riders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe aimed his wand at the three horses and muttered a phrase in Latin, and suddenly it was as if he were looking through a telescope:  the people in the distance now appeared to be just a few feet away from him.  Draxon frowned.  The men were nothing remarkable to look at, though he got awful waves of evil rolling off the man in the lead, who had the woman in his arms.  Draxon's arms widened when he realized the woman was holding a young baby in her arms.  He gasped when the woman raised her head, revealing her exhausted, pained, tear-streaked face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman was familiar to him.  He KNEW he'd seen her before...but where?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ursula!\" he called.  \"Ursula, come here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What, Draxon?  I thought you'd be gone by now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come here to the window and look at these people passing by.  Tell me if you recognize any of them, particularly the woman.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUrsula frowned, but came near her anxious husband.  She peered through Draxon's spell in front of the window.  She put a hand to her mouth and gasped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eldonia!  She's had her baby already!  But that isn't Lord Vanderstorm or his brothers with her!  Where have I seen that face before?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you recognize this woman?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't you remember the Earl of Vanderstorm's lovely wife?  We attended their wedding and met their firstborn son, Leonardo.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, yes!  I thought she looked familiar!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But she looks terrible!  And who in the world is she riding with?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have no idea, but I get the most terrible feeling that something is not right with her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUrsula tapped her chin and thought.  Her eyes widened when a particular memory came forward in her mind.  She grasped Draxon's arms desperately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Draxie!  Oh, no!  I...I remember where I've seen the face of the man Eldonia's riding with before!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, who is he, Ursa?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's that no good Vladian warlord who kidnapped her and raped her!  He's the father of her newborn child!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT?!  Why that scoundrel!  What in the world is she doing with him again?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have no idea!  But it can't be anything good!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Draxon and Ursula watched the riders a few minutes longer, full of concern and anger, with the sense of unease growing stronger and stronger the longer they watched.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have a feeling she's been kidnapped again,\" Draxon said softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think you're right, my love.  What should we do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm already on my way to meet with Kings David and Leviathan.  It won't do for me to be late.  I will inform them of what we have just seen.  Together, they should have the force and power to help Eldonia.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes.  Meanwhile, I'll take Merlin and we'll got to Castle Vanderstorm.  Lord Vanderstorm should be privy to what we know, as well.  I can only imagine how the poor dear is coping with the loss of his wife yet again!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well.  Take care, my dear.  And make sure Merlin stays on his best behavior!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course!  Would you expect any less from me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDraxon smiled.  \"No.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiving each other one last kiss, Draxon teleported himself and his luggage to Regis City, while Ursula went to go round up her grandson and head to Castle Vanderstorm.</span></div></div>",

And THAT!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPrinces Cameron and Edmund watched, amused and munching on a large platter full of fruit tarts, as Prince Gladius swung his sword, parrying and thrusting against invisible enemies, in the large foyer of the Fatlantean royal palace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha!  That'll show you to sneak up on Gladius the Great!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eeeek!\"<br>\r\n\"Aiiiiieeeee!\"<br>\r\n\"Oh no!  Not the famous Gladius the Great!\"<br>\r\n\"You mean the INFAMOUS Gladius the Great!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, shut up, you two!\" Gladius said, scowling at two laughing fat princes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, Gladdy.  We can't help it!\" said Edmund.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" said Cameron.  \"You just look so funny waltzing around the foyer, poking your sword into nothing but air.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get stuffed!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCameron grinned and rubbed his large belly.  \"I'm trying to, believe me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGladius glared.  \"Well, unlike you two porkers, who just have to sit around all day, eating and getting fatter, I have to actually TRAIN in order to keep up my skills.  Otherwise, how can I be an able bodyguard for you lardos?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!\" Cameron protested.  \"We train!  You think it's easy to get as fat as we are?  We've had to train hard to eat as much we do and wrangle our stomachs into submission!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGladius snorted.  \"Yeah, right!  I know how many potions you guys take so that you can eat more without puking your guts out!  That's not training!  That's copping out!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCameron glared at Gladius and was about to retort, but Edmund put his hand on his brother's arm.  \"It's not worth it, Cam,\" he whispered.  Turning to Gladius, he said, \"Point taken.  But still...wouldn't it be better to train against an actual opponent instead of fighting against thin air?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course it would!\" Gladius said in exasperation.  \"But where am I going to find a training companion HERE?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you could always spar with some of our palace guards,\" Edmund pointed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGladius snorted again.  \"Your guards may be stronger than average Fatlanteans, but they're still sacks of blubber!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA loud *POP!* suddenly echoed in the foyer, and the three boys turned their heads.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Draxon!\" Cameron said with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, your royal highnesses:  Cameron, Edmund, and Gladius,\" Draxon said genteelly, bowing at each prince in turn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing here?\" Gladius asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDraxon raised an eyebrow at the rude question, but answered anyway.  \"I'm actually here to meet with your father and King David.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGladius's face paled.  \"P-p-papa's here?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You didn't know?\" asked Cameron.  \"I heard that he arrived last night.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" chimed in Edmund.  \"He and our father have been holed up in the war-room all day, since before breakfast!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, crap!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDraxon cleared his throat.  \"Master Gladius, if you would be so kind as to show me to this 'war-room'?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGladius sighed.  He hated manners and following etiquette, but he didn't want word getting back to his father that he behaved less than respectfully to the aging wizard.  \"Sure, and then I'll take your luggage up to your room.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDraxon smiled.  \"Thank you, your highness.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDraxon bowed again to the fat princes.  \"Your highnesses.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See you, Draxon!\"<br>\r\n\"Will you show us some magic tricks later?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDraxon chuckled.  \"If I have the time, certainly!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, boy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGladius rolled his eyes as he led Draxon out of the foyer and down the large, stone hallways.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So,\" Gladius said, \"do you know why my father and King David are having their pow-wow?\"  His eyes glowed with curiosity and excitement.  \"Is it some hostile take-over threat?  Are we going to be going to war?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDraxon chuckled and shook his head.  \"This meeting is completely confidential, your highness, and even if I wanted to speak of it, I wouldn't.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGladius frowned and slumped his shoulders.  \"Man, I can't wait till I'm old enough to be able to sit on war councils!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All in good time, Master Gladius.  You'll be grown up before you know it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here's the war-room,\" Gladius said when they finally reached the large, closed double-doors near the throne-room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, your highness.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Gladius left to go see to the wizard's luggage, Draxon rapped loudly on one of the doors with his staff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA guard opened the door, bowed to the wizard, and admitted him entrance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah!  Draxon!  So good of you to join us!\" came the booming voice of King David.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your majesties,\" Draxon intoned, bowing before the two imposing monarchs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid was sitting on an enormous throne at the other end of the room at the head of a long, rectangular table.  King Leviathan was pacing the length of the wall beside David, his steps and posture showing his agitation and unease.  Colorful maps of Fatlantis, Mountania, Lucia, Fantasmia, Obesita, Vladia, and the entire continent were tacked on the walls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What exactly is the situation that prompted you calling my presence here today?\" Draxon asked when he reached David's left hand and settled down into a large, comfortable chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There have been many disturbing developments in Vladian activity and troop movement near the borders of Mountania and Fatlantis recently,\" said King Leviathan, pacing over to a map and pointing to several places on the Vladian border.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"While our spies have not heard or seen anything conclusive,\" King David explained, \"for the safety of our people, we cannot discount these sudden upsurges in Vladian activity so near the borders.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How long have these upsurges been taking place?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For about two weeks,\" said Leviathan, frowning.  \"Ever since I got back from visiting Castle Vanderstorm.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDraxon's ears perked up at this.  \"Was the Lady Eldonia there at the castle when you were visiting, your majesty?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeviathan scowled and cursed under his breath.  \"She was initially.  I had gone to the Vanderstorm seat to transport some Vladian trespassers to Ferramount for judgment, but the Vladians escaped.\"  Leviathan pounded his fist on the large, oak table in fury, making the heavy, solid table shudder.  \"They captured Lady Vanderstorm right from under our noses and took her with them!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid frowned.  \"Levi, why didn't you share this with me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And admit to my failure?!  The Lady Vanderstorm had already been kidnapped once by those awful brigands--tortured and abused and raped!  She even had the indignity of becoming pregnant by one of the filthy, lawless, moral-less scoundrels!  Then, to have her be kidnapped again by the same mercenaries?!  And for me to not have been able to stop it?!  I still hate my ineffectualness at protecting one of my own, David!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDraxon cleared his throat.  \"If I may, your majesty, I believe I have some news that will lighten your burden.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is that, Draxon?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Before I teleported here, I saw some riders along the road near the White Castle.  I got an awful sense of unease as I watched them, and my wife Ursula helped me to identify them.  We clearly saw Lady Eldonia on horseback with a newborn baby in her arms.  She was riding with three other men, whom I believe now are three Vladians who re-kidnapped her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeviathan's eyes widened, and he stalked over to Draxon.  \"You're sure it was Eldonia you saw?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My wife was positive it was her, your majesty.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Levi, might I suggest you go with Draxon, find the Lady Eldonia, and help her return to her family?\" David said gently.  \"We can continue our discussion at a later point.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeviathan ran a hand through his hair.  \"I don't want to leave just yet!  I practically just got here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And we're making little progress without better intelligence!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your majesties,\" said Draxon, getting up and moving slowly over to the map of Vladia on the wall.  \"All of the Vladian troop movement seen recently are along these stretches of the border, correct?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two kings frowned as Draxon ran a gnarled finger along the map.  \"Yes,\" said Leviathan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, a large keep, used as a main stronghold of Vladian forces, is right here, a mere forty miles from all of these sections of the border.\"  Draxon pointed at a large dot on the map.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeviathan's eyes widened, and he stalked back over to the map.  \"That's the stronghold of former Overlord Ramius and his sons.  They're the ones responsible for Lady Vanderstorm's kidnapping--both times!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe room was silent a few minutes as the three men pondered this news.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Levi, is it possible that these recent troop movements are merely a diversion?\" asked David.  \"To distract us from looking for and finding Lady Eldonia and her kidnappers?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You said yourself, your majesty, that the rise of activity along the border began after Lady Eldonia was kidnapped again,\" Draxon pointed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeviathan rubbed a finger along his chin.  \"That does sound possible.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Levi, let us not worry about the borders for right now,\" said David decisively.  \"We'll keep abreast of any new information from our spies.  However, if it's truly a diversion, we need to focus our efforts more on finding and rescuing Lady Eldonia.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Agreed,\" said Leviathan with a nod.  \"Master Draxon, will you be able to find Lady Eldonia with your magic?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDraxon frowned.  \"I should be able to scry her whereabouts, but only if I have a close relation nearby that I can touch:  someone who shares her blood.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, then, would you care to teleport us to Castle Vanderstorm?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Certainly, your majesty.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a wave of Draxon's wand and a loud *POP!*, Leviathan and Draxon disappeared.</span></div></div>",

AND THAT SHE HAD GIVEN BIRTH TO THAT NO GOOD VLADIAN'S CHILD?!  WHY DIDN'T YOU RESCUE HER WHEN YOU SAW HER?!  WHY DID YOU MERELY COME HERE TO GIVE ME SUCH NEWS, INSTEAD OF DOING SOMETHING ABOUT IT?!  GO AND FIND YOUR GOOD-FOR-NOTHING HUSBAND AND HAVE HIM FIND MY WIFE AND BRING HER TO ME!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That would be Lord Vanderstorm,\" Leviathan said on a sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was anticipating him being upset and angry, but I had no idea he would be this...volatile,\" said Draxon with a shudder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, how would you feel if your woman were kidnapped right out from under your nose--twice?!  He's feeling understandably emasculated.  There's a part of me that feels that way, too, considering she was taken from under my watch this second time, too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two men cautiously ventured over to the front parlor, where the cursing and swearing and angry litany of disparaging comments were still being yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fortis Maximus Vanderstorm!\" came Lady Athena's voice above the din.  \"How dare you say such things to Ursula!  She has done NOTHING wrong!  You should be GRATEFUL that any news has come to us of poor Eldonia's whereabouts, instead of berating Ursula for coming here and trying to help!  At least we have an idea where Eldonia is now, and the search for her can begin in earnest!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Indeed, my lord,\" said Draxon as he and the King entered the parlor.  \"If I had not been called away to an important meeting, I would have followed Lady Eldonia and her captors in my crystal ball until they had stopped to rest for the night.  Then, I would have made sure you were informed and able to form a rescue party in order to retrieve her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis ran his hands over his face.  He looked notably tired, pale, and haggard, with dark purple bags under his eyes.  He had obviously not been sleeping well since his wife's re-capture.  His eyes were blood-shot and bleary, his clothes looked dirty and rumpled, and he had the distinct smell of strong spirits about him.  Leviathan could only surmise that the young lord had been drowning his sorry and worry in liquor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you here with any good news for me?\" Fortis asked Draxon hoarsely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do not know where your wife currently is, my lord,\" the aging wizard said apologetically, \"however, there is a way that we can locate her current whereabouts.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, tell me, man!  How much longer do I have to wait for someone to tell me where I can find my wife?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Forty,\" said Minerva gently as she came over to him and put her arms around his waist.  \"Please, calm down!  Uncle Draxon and Aunt Ursula are here to help!  I know you're worried about Eldonia!  I am, too!  We all are!  And we all miss her terribly!  I'm weary of having to rock poor little Leo to sleep every night as he cries for his momma!  But, now that we have such great wizards to help us, surely Eldonia will be back with us soon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis gave a weary sigh and put his great arms around his sister, holding her close in a desperate embrace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...apologize, Ursula, Draxon,\" he said grudgingly.  \"You say there's a way to find my wife?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Indeed, my lord,\" Draxon said with a nod.  \"There's a special form of scrying that I can do that will allow my mind's eye to see her and then show you exactly where Lady Eldonia is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, then, let's do it already!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The only catch, my lord, is that in order for this type of scrying to work, I need a person that shares her blood to help me focus my magic and find her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, you need a blood relative in order to locate Eldonia?\" Minerva asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, my lady.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis sighed impatiently.  \"We don't have time to go and fetch her father!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My lord, we do not need Lord VonGewalt for Draxon to perform the spell,\" said Ursula kindly, though she was still a bit bristled by how Fortis had treated her earlier.  \"We can use young Leo.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis instantly rose to his full height and snarled, \"No!  Absolutely not!  I will NOT let you take my son's blood or have him subjected to some...some weird blood magic!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My lord, your son will not be harmed at all, I can assure you!\" said Draxon.  \"I do not need to collect any of his blood, or anything like that!  I merely need to hold his hands while I perform the spell to give me special sight!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis looked taken aback for a moment.  \"You only need to hold his hands?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, my lord.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you can guarantee my son's safety the entire time you do this...spell?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, my lord.  He will be perfectly fine.  He won't feel a thing!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis sighed again, noticeably deflating.  \"Alright.

Yea!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come here, my lad.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDraxon gingerly took the toddler from Minerva, sat down creakily on a settee, and settled the boy on his lap so that Leo was facing him.  He gently took the boy's hands in his.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, I'm going to use a bit of special magic to try and find your mother, alright, Leo?  But for me to do that, I need you to hold my hands tightly.\"  He smiled as Leo squeezed his hands in a death-grip.  \"And I also need you to close your eyes and think about your mother.  Keep picturing her in your head--what she looks like, what her voice sounds like--and keep thinking of her until I tell you to stop.  Do you think you can do that for me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yah!  I fink of Momma fo' you, Unca Dracsa!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeo closed his eyes tightly, bit his lip, and thought hard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAthena wiped a tear from her eye at how brave and strong her little grandson was being.  Fortis, meanwhile, sat down on the settee across from Draxon.  He looked stoic and strong, but everyone knew it was just a front to hide the turmoil he was feeling.  Minerva settled next to her brother, and he draped his arm around her shoulders to hold her close.  Jupiter and Cannius stood off to the side, clenching and unclenching their fists.  They were anxious to go out and rescue their sister-in-law.  They hated seeing their strong, formidable brother reduced to an ineffectual mess because of what happened to Eldonia.  King Leviathan stood with Athena on the other side of the room, interested in seeing this bit of magic that Draxon was going to perform to find Lady Eldonia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUrsula and Merlin came up behind Draxon, and they put their hands on one of each of his shoulders, closing their eyes and channeling their own magic into him in order to strengthen his Inner Eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDraxon closed his own eyes and chanted a spell:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Blood of blood flowing through loving hands,<br>\r\nToo much time has passed through the sands.<br>\r\nThrough the son, may the mother be found.<br>\r\nShow me the place; show me the ground,<br>\r\nThat Eldonia Vanderstorm I may See,<br>\r\nAs I will, so mote it be!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA bright, white light surrounded Draxon, Ursula, Merlin, and Leo, making the six spectators look on them with growing anticipation.  The three wizards and Leo stayed glowing for several minutes, with Fortis becoming more and more tense.  He noticed Draxon's eyes roving wildly under his lined, sagging eyelids.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Draxon's eyes opened, and the six onlookers gasped.  The old wizard's eyes were completely white, with no iris or pupil to be seen!  He began speaking in Latin, and when he was done, a large image appeared, floating in the middle of the room for everyone to see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis leaped to his feet as the image showed Eldonia sleeping on the ground, huddled around a blanket-wrapped bundle, shivering and chattering her teeth.  A fire was burning several feet behind her.  What made Fortis clench his teeth, what made his blood boil, was that, as they were watching, a man's arm threw itself around Eldonia's torso and hauled her back.  She wriggled in discomfort, and the bundle in her arms squalled.  However, the sound of shushing and the disgusting sound of wet kisses being placed on her neck made Fortis growl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, so you found her,\" Fortis said gruffly.  \"But where is she?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDraxon blinked his eerie, white eyes.  The image floating in the middle of the room suddenly changed to Castle Vanderstorm.  Then, the picture began moving in fast motion, moving away from Castle Vanderstorm as if they were flying over the vast landscape of Mountania.  The scenery kept changing, following through forest paths and winding roads.  The hills and forests of Mountania soon gave way to the flat grasslands and fields of Fatlantis.  The quick movement slowed as they passed through a village with a stone marker identifying it as Laceton.  The images moved passed a bit more until they stopped in a small forest glade, where they spied upon Eldonia and her captors once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're camped out a few miles east of Laceton in Fatlantis,\" Fortis said.  \"Jupiter!  Cannius!  Go grab your swords!  We're going to go bring my wife home!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will go with you, my lord,\" said Leviathan.  \"It's the least I can do since she was re-captured while I was in residence in your home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis nodded, and the king left with Fortis and his brothers as they went to go adorn themselves with appropriate clothing and weapons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDraxon slowly came out of his trance.  His eyes went back to their usual state, and he eased his hands out of Leo's firm grip.  He then slumped down on the settee.  That level of magic, performed for so long, took a lot out of his ancient body.  Ursula came around the couch and gathered her exhausted husband into her arms.  Merlin also came over and took Leo from his grandfather's lap.  Leo slumped in the boy's arms, fast asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is Leo okay?\" Minerva asked hesitantly as she came up and ran a hand over Leo's little arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's fine,\" Merlin replied.  \"Grandpa's magic drew strength from Leo's thoughts of Lady Eldonia.  After a good long rest, he'll be good as new.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come, my lady,\" Athena said, \"I'll show you and Draxon a room you can sleep in tonight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDraxon groaned.  \"I can't sleep, yet, Athena, though I appreciate your hospitality.  I need to teleport Lord Vanderstorm to his wife so that she can be retrieved tonight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you certain, Draxie?\" asked Ursula.  \"You've drained a lot of your magic with that spell.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe squeezed her hand.  \"I'm certain, Ursa.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, then, at least let me help you, old man,\" she said with a huff.  \"I can teleport a group of people just as easily as you can.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDraxon gave a hoarse laugh.  \"Yes, dear.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter another couple of minutes, Fortis, Leviathan, Jupiter, and Cannius returned to the parlor, each decked out with numerous weapons hidden, hanging, or strapped to their bodies.  They each had stern, fierce looks on their faces.  They would definitely be a formidable force to deal with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you ready to go, my lords?\" Draxon asked, wearily getting to his feet with the aid of his wife.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" Fortis said curtly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDraxon held onto his wife's arm, closing his eyes and focusing on their destination, as Ursula withdrew her wand.  After a quick wave, the party disappeared with a loud *pop!*.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"May Odin grant you success,\" Athena murmured as she, Minerva, Merlin, and Leo headed upstairs to find some rest.</span></div></div>",

Ursula staggered to the ground, as well, as she had been holding onto her husband's arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Draxie?  Are you okay?\" Ursula asked in concern, running her hands over her husband's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDraxon grimaced and slowly opened his eyes.  \"I...I think so.  My magic is just so weak after that scrying spell....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where in the world did you bring us, old man?\" came Fortis's gruff voice.  \"I thought we'd arrive in the middle of a forest somewhere, with Eldonia and those blasted Vladians nearby!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" added Cannius, his hand gripping the pommel of sword, ready for some action.  \"Instead, we're at the driveway of some sort of mansion.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mansion?\" asked Draxon, breathing hard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKing Leviathan came over to Draxon and Ursula and helped the old wizard to his feet.  \"Do you know where we are, Draxon?\" the king asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yes!\" Draxon gasped.  \"This is the manor house of the Earl of Laceton!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeviathan frowned and looked up at the impressive building.  He had never been to Laceton before, but he knew who resided here, and he was less than pleased with that fact!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would the Earl know anything about my wife or her whereabouts?\" Fortis asked between clenched teeth.  He was ready to get to his wife already!  He had been waiting for weeks to get her back home, and now that they were on the cusp of rescuing her, they were dithering around!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He might,\" Draxon answered.  \"The Earl is good friends with my son Mordred, and I have gotten to know the Earl fairly well.  He usually keeps himself abreast of everything taking place near his home.  Perhaps we should go knock on his door and inquire if he has knowledge of Eldonia's exact whereabouts.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NO!  ABSOLUTELY NOT!\" thundered Leviathan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis and his brothers were taken aback at the king's vehemence.  Draxon and Ursula, however, knowing exactly who the Earl of Laceton was and his relation to the king, looked at Leviathan in frustration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really, your majesty,\" Ursula chided.  \"Isn't time to let bygones be bygones?  What happened with Lucius was more than twenty years ago!  What has he done since that time to earn your ire?  I heard that he's been an exceptional ambassador to Mountania, and that he's smart and cunning.  Besides, he knows this area of Fatlantis much better than we do!  He could surely help find Eldonia easier than we can, and he might even be able to round up a few more men to help us find her.  The more men we have in our company, the easier it will be to take those marauding, kidnapping Vladians down!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeviathan sighed and ran a hand over his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My lord,\" Fortis said, turning to the king quizzically, \"who is the Earl of Laceton?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe king gritted his teeth and punched out, \"My older, deposed, semi-exiled brother, Lucius.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis, Cannius, and Jupiter's eyebrows all rose in astonishment.  None of them had any idea that Leviathan had a brother other than the fun-loving, joking prankster Achilles, who lived down in Fantasmia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ol-older, your majesty?\" said Jupiter in surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, why isn't he king?\" asked Cannius.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"THIS IS NOTHING I WISH TO DISCUSS!\" Leviathan shouted.  He took a deep breath to calm down, then said gruffly, \"Suffice it to say, I want nothing to do with my brother.  But!\"  He raised a hand when Draxon and Ursula opened their mouths to argue.  \"I appreciate your reasoning in that he...<i>might</i>...be able to help us rescue Lady Vanderstorm.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLevi sighed, then scowled.  \"Alright!  Let's ask for his aid.  But, I swear to you, I want as little interaction with the man as I can get!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, your majesty,\" Draxon said with a soft smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe party, minus Levi, then hurried up the drive to the front door of the large, well-maintained estate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Psst!  Draxon!\" Cannius said under his breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDraxon sighed.  \"Yes, Lord Cannius?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did the king's older brother become the Earl of Laceton in Fatlantis?  And why have none of us ever heard of him before?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My lord, that is a tale for another time.  Let us focus now on rescuing your sister-in-law, yes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright.  But, I expect to hear this story from you when it's all over!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDraxon nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis was the first to the door, and he banged on it loudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMerely a few seconds passed before the door was opened by a young maid, who curtsied respectfully.  \"Good day to you, my lords.  What can I do for you this eve?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am the Earl of Vanderstorm of Mountania,\" Fortis said imperiously, rising up to his full height and crossing his muscular arms over his strong chest.  \"I, my brothers, and the rest of my party would like to speak to the Earl.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young maid's eyes widened, and she hastily curtsied again.  \"R-r-right away, my lord!  Let me j-just check and see if Lord Lucius is available for an audience!  In the meantime, p-please follow me into the parlor!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rescue party filed into the large, airy foyer and proceeded to follow the maid down a short hallway to the large, well-appointed, and nicely decorated parlor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would you care for some refreshments, my lords?\" the maid asked nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, please, my dear,\" Ursula answered kindly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe maid curtsied one more time before saying, \"I'll have a tea service sent to you right away, while I go inquire of Lord Lucius.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you,\" Ursula said again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUrsula and Draxon gratefully sank down onto a large, comfortable couch, while the other four men wandered around the parlor.  With the adrenaline pumping through their veins in the hopes of rescuing Eldonia, they were too restless to sit and wait.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>When the parlor door opened again, everyone looked to the doorway eagerly.  When Leviathan saw who it was, he sneered in disgust, then promptly turned so his back was to the door.  A tall, muscular, yet portly man filled the entrance.  He had neat brown hair and warm, brown eyes.  He was clearly Mountanian, but had obviously been living in Fatlantis for a long time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My lords, my lady, welcome to Laceton.  It's a pleasure to have you in my home,\" he said kindly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucius entered the room, followed soon by a couple maids, bearing platters with tea service for seven.  As the maids went about the process of getting a cup of appropriately sugared and/or milked tea for everyone.  Lucius settled himself down on a large chair next to Ursula and Draxon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, my lords, have a seat, and we will discuss what brought you to my door,\" Lucius said, waving his hand at Fortis and his brothers and indicating the numerous free couches, settees, and chairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Lucius saw the back of King Leviathan, he frowned before recognition lit his eyes.  His face fell, and a look of sadness and resignation crossed his noble features.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My lord,\" Fortis began as he sat on the very edge of a chair opposite Lucius, \"I am Lord Fortis Vanderstorm.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, I've heard of you, Lord Vanderstorm.  You were quite instrumental in Mountania's recent war against Vladia.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Fortis had a chance to ask for Lucius's help, Lucius turned to the other people in the room, minus Levi.  \"Ursula, Draxon, how nice to see you again!  It's been quite a while since I've been to the White Castle, though Mordred keeps hounding me to come up and visit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDraxon chuckled.  \"You're welcome to our home anytime, your highness.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucius looked a bit embarrassed at the title and waved it away.  \"Please, just call me Lucius.\"  Though he might technically still be a Prince of Mountania, being deposed and semi-exiled left him feeling that he just be recognized as the Lord of Laceton.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Cannius.\"<br>\r\n\"And I'm Jupiter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're Fortis's brothers,\" the two said together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucius nodded his head with a smile.  \"It's a pleasure to meet you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone sensed the tension between the king and his brother and didn't bother to include the stoic King in their discussion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEager to get the ball rolling, Fortis cleared his throat, getting Lucius's attention back to him.  \"So, what brings you to my door?\" Lucius asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis clenched his jaw, and he unconsciously tightened his grip around his teacup, such that the porcelain cup nearly broke.  \"We're looking for my wife,\" he forced out.  \"She was recently kidnapped by Vladian war-lords.  We have reason to believe they're camped out not far from here.  We want to know if you have any knowledge of their whereabouts and request for some additional forces in aiding our endeavor to rescue her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucius's face hardened.  \"Some Vladians DARED to kidnap your wife?!  I know they have no honor, but to stoop so low as to do such a thing...!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing their brother about to lose control, Cannius and Jupiter took over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lord Lucius, have you seen them at all?\"<br>\r\n\"It's three men:  two teenagers and one in his mid-twenties.\"<br>\r\n\"Eldonia is very lovely.  She has blond hair and blue eyes.\"<br>\r\n\"She's about 5'8\" or so.\"<br>\r\n\"Oh!  And she'd have a baby with her.\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah.  She recently gave birth.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucius's eyes widened at this realization, and he quickly got to his feet to begin pacing.  Anger rolled off him in waves.  \"I CAN'T believe I was so STUPID!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLevi snorted at this, but kept his face at the window.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To be DUPED by some Vladians!  And he told me she was HIS WIFE, and I BELIEVED him!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you going on about?\" Fortis growled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucius turned back to towards Fortis, his face red with rage.  \"Three foreigners, a woman, and a baby--all matching the description you just gave--came to the manor earlier today, asking for supplies and food.  They said they were refugees from Vladia--as I recognized their accent--trying to escape the tyranny and injustice up there.  I foolishly gave them clothes, food, blankets, and a few other supplies before they went on their way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YOU FOOL!\" Levi yelled, finally turning around and facing everyone.  He stalked up to his brother, his fists clenched in front of him menacingly.  \"YOU LET A BUNCH OF VLADIAN BRIGANDS INTO YOUR HOME AND GAVE THEM SUPPLIES?!  YOU ARE MORE STUPID AND IDIOTIC THAN I EVER FIGURED YOU FOR!  YOU HAVE ALWAYS BEEN TOO SOFT-HEARTED AND WEAK, AND THIS JUST PROVES IT!  YOU WERE <i>NEVER</i> FIT FOR THE CROWN, AND FATHER WAS WISE TO TAKE IT OUT OF YOUR LILY-LIVERED, FAT, BLUBBEROUS, UNFIT HANDS!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore anyone could say anything, the king threw a solid punch to Lucius's face!  Lucius's staggered back several steps, his nose spurting blood, but he kept to his feet, impressing the other three Mountanians in the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucius glared at his brother and swiped at his bleeding nose with the back of his hand.  \"How dare you strike me for making an honest mistake!  I may have to put up with your abuse in Mountania, <i>brother,</i> but I will not stand for it in MY OWN HOME!  And when will you ever get passed what happened twenty years ago?  I never WANTED the crown!  I was GLAD when Father transferred it into your hands!  No, I'm not proud of what I did or what happened so long ago, but why can't you let bygones be bygones?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I WILL <i>NEVER</i> FORGIVE YOU FOR WHAT YOU DID!  YOU ARE <i>NOT WORTHY</i> TO BE CALLED MY BROTHER!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your majesty!  My lord!  PLEASE!\" said Draxon, struggling to his feet.  \"This is neither the time nor the place to be fighting about the past!  We need to find Lady Vanderstorm and her child as soon as possible, before the Vladians' trail becomes cold and impossible to follow!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLevi and Lucius glared at each other, their chests heaving in anger, but eventually, they both turned to the rest of the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Draxon,\" the king said gruffly.  \"You're right.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lord Lucius,\" said Fortis, \"do you have any idea where they are?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucius nodded his head.  \"Yes.  They headed east, along the main road towards Lucia.  It was already getting dark by the time they left here, so I can't imagine they'd have gotten very far before needing to make camp...unless they decided to travel on through the night.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDraxon shook his head.  \"No, they stopped to camp.  My scrying revealed them lying on the ground next to a fire.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me round up a few of my men,\" Lucius said, \"and we can get underway.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLevi snorted, looking his brother up and down and focussing on his large, fat belly.  \"I don't think a few <i>Fatlanteans</i> will help us much!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucius sighed, trying for patience.  \"Levi, the men I have in mind are not only Fatlantean.  I have several Mountanians employed here, and I assure you:  they are strong and able-bodied.  Besides, the Fatlanteans I'll recruit to help us are stronger than the average Fatlantean, as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmph!\" Levi sneered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis sighed.  \"My lord, how long will it take to round these men up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not more than a hour,\" Lucius said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then, let's not delay!  I don't want to be away from my wife a second longer than I have to be!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucius nodded his head and quickly left the room to gather his men and suit himself up for battle.</span></div></div>",

As head housemaid, Eliza tended to notice everything that went on in the castle. Apart from Mrs. Tibbs the housekeeper-and-cook, Eliza was privy to almost all sorts of household gossip. And one of the perks of working for a prominent aristocratic house such as Vanderstorm was that famous people were always coming and going. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPrinces, lords, ladies, wealthy merchants, and all their sons, daughters, servants and hangers-on wafted in and out of Castle Vanderstorm like the changing tides. Most of them were friends of Lady Vanderstorm, the Dowager Countess, but there were a smattering of aristocratic girls, for the Vanderstorm boys, and a few warrior boytoys, who came to try and plant their seed in Lady Minerva's womanly dirt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n...Not that they ever succeeded, with Fortis hanging around for protection. He was a more effective cock-blocker than a stone condom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think Lord Vanderstorm's on the warpath again\", said Zacharia, coming into the servants' hall where his younger brother and sister sat. \"he's upstairs going nuts!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's it about?\" Eliza asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know. I kinda have a fetish for living, see? I didn't want him slicing my head off for interrupting him during his deep and potent reflections\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>CRASH!!!</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Right. Deep and potent reflections...\" said Eliza. Some heavy piece of furniture upstairs had obviously met with the formidable Mountain lord's fury. \"I um...I better go and see what's up...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEliza smiled. Before Fortis had married, before he became earl, and simply held the courtesy title, \"Lord Fortis Vanderstorm\", the long-serving housemaids knew that the bucky young Mountain hunk had always availed himself of two escape-routes from stress, fury and boredom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of them was spending time with his sister. He would never admit this to anyone, but sometimes, he just needed a cuddle and a kiss and a snuggle with someone special. And his sister was always that someone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEliza knew this because as head housemaid, she knew everything that went on in this house. Those doorknobs and keyholes didn't polish themselves, and those bedsheets were a library of information... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other avenue of escape for Fortis came in sexual release. As heir to his father's estate, Fortis was strictly forbidden from premarital sex with anyone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, asking a Mountain boy not to have sex was like asking a cow not to give milk. It was never going to happen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Eliza figured that she could kill two birds with one stone. She could experience the height of Mountanian sexual passion, and her good master could achieve his much-desired relief. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n...perhaps he could do with some relief now? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn her bedroom (Eliza held enough seniority that she held her own bedchamber), she loosened the straps on her uniform and slowly tugged down the front of her dress and perked up her breasts. His lordship might like a drink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...of fresh milk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEliza flitted past her fellow servants and headed upstairs. Lady Eldonia was obviously in no mood for company, and had announced her desire to retire early. That suited the servant-girl perfectly. Nobody else was likely to enter Fortis's bedroom, anyway. Apart, perhaps, from Lady Minerva. But that wasn't likely. Minerva generally steered well clear of her brother when he was in fury. True, she was one of the few people who could really calm him down, but even she had her limited effectiveness! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEliza tapped on the bedroom door to the master's chambers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M'lord?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo answer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M'loooord...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill no answer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEliza opened the door and slipped in. She closed it behind her, and locked it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe room was a mess. A chair, a broken side-table, and several empty bottles and decanters were everywhere. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlumped drunkenly in a chair by a small table, with an empty bottle of extremely potent whiskey next to him, and a knocked-over shot-glass, the great lord of the manor lay. He was dressed only in his smalls and he looked extremely drunk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis was usually rather moderate with his alcohol, and it took a lot to send him under. Eliza could only remember two or three times when it had happened in the past. Usually because he was upset about something. Eliza slipped closer. She could tell that Fortis was incredibly horny. An unmistakable bulge of impressive size was growing in his shorts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe housemaid knelt down and slowly unbuttoned his fly. She maneuvered the fabric and a heavy, solid fuck-piston flopped out, sagging slightly under its own weight. Slowly, she wrapped her hands around its colossal girth, and gave it a couple of generous, teasing, stroking squeezes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe monster pulsed in her hands as if it was alive. Fortis let out a muffled, drunken groan. Eliza licked her lips and slowly slid the solidifying sex-serpent into her salivating sluice... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shaft was impossibly thick. And warm from the blood rushing inside it. It smelt slightly musky...but then it would if it was stored where it was, for long periods of time...Oh the poor thing. Not being allowed to come out and play! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo matter...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe started a steady, up-and-down motion, slathering the meat-shaft with her own oral lubrication. Fortis's breathing intensified. She added her teeth to the mix and Fortis groaned and shuddered, letting out an agonised wail of suppressed pleasure. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEliza started sucking on it. Slowly...quickly...slowly...teasing her master in his drunken haze of agony. Fortis panted and groaned...So good...so goooood... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the sucking stopped. Fortis groaned in desperation! No! Why did it stop!? He reached out in a drunken haze for the provider of pleasure...he felt hands on him...small...womanly hands...he staggered to his feet and nearly fell over! Leaning his full weight on his mystery mouth-machine, he stared down and through his spiraling vision, spotted the suckling seducer. He let out a sleazy leer and a drunken chortle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis hands gripped her roughly, tugging hard on her dress to pull it off her. He pressed her up against him and tried to pull off his shorts. Frustrated, he ripped them to shreds. Free from its prison, his pulsating pillar shot upwards, flopping back and forth, like a dog with its tongue hanging out, which was panting and begging for more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My lord has been displeased...\" Eliza said. \"How would his maid service her master, my lord?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis growled. He ripped Eliza's blouse off, and pushed her back onto the bed! He jumped on top of her, pinning her down! Eliza struggled! Things were moving a bit too fast! She reached out with a flailing left arm, for the drawer of one of Fortis's bedside tables, and pulled out a folded paper packet. Inside, a membrane condom...extra-large, extra long. Extra strong. She wasn't about to give birth to another child, after seeing how Fortis reacted earlier! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe struggled to sheath the shivering soldier. Eliza knew where everything in Fortis's bedroom was. She cleaned it, after all... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis pinned her down. The bed creaked as he dragged himself onboard. Using his legs, he peeled her apart and, holding her down with one arm, drunkenly guided his missile into her chute with the other. It wasn't easy. He had all the hand-eye co-ordination of a dead fish. But he managed it. And Eliza gasped as the unmerciful invader plunged into her womanly depths...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEliza felt herself being forced open, and she struggled to accept the enormity of her new occupant! If Fortis wasn't wearing his condom, Eliza was sure that what was going in, was probably larger than what might come out, if she ever got pregnant! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn...out...in...out...in...out...in... The constant pounding barrage was making her sore and excited. It was steadily growing faster and more and more intense as she felt the monster within slowly awaken from his drunken haze. She was about to kill those two birds with one stone again...make herself happy, and make him happy....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...perhaps she'd get a raise? She'd certainly given <i>him</i> one... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEliza was fortunate and glad that the stone walls, and the doors, were so thick and heavy...much like the monster that was ploughing her furrow...because she couldn't contain her vocal pleasure at what was happening to her southerly orifice. It was too intense not to keep silent about! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis didn't say much, beyond grunting and moaning. His brain was probably still too swimmy for him to register anything else. But when the end came, they both found themselves hot, sweaty, spent...and exhausted. Still in a drunken haze, Fortis passed out in bed. Too exhausted from trying to keep up, Eliza dozed off in her lordship's arms...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat evening, Fortis's bedroom door was unlocked. A figure entered, holding a candle, surveying the mess, but then spotting the scene on the bed...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"FORTIS!\"  </span></div></div>",

Her brother Jupiter had gone off to rescue her. But Minerva was still nervous and scared. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe prepared herself for bed, her maid, Penny, bidding her young mistress goodnight before going to her own chambers downstairs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinerva climbed into bed. She felt under her pillows for the dagger that her brother Fortis had given her once. Lethally sharp and nine inches long, Minerva had never had to use it. But she kept it with her just the same. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe lay in bed, beginning to doze off, when she heard footsteps. A soft shuffling sound. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Granny?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just me, Minerva! I'm putting the baby to bed!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinerva sighed. She drew the curtains around her bed and blew out the candles. She snuggled into the warm blankets and shut her eyes to the world. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>A clattering sound...</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinerva opened her eyes!...What was that? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFootsteps... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeveral footsteps. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the servants were all asleep. Fortis was in bed. Cannius was asleep and certainly grandmother wouldn't be up at this hour!? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinerva fumbled around and reached for a striker. She lit the candelabrum by her bedside and reached for the dagger under her pillow. As quietly as possible, she put on her slippers to muffle her footsteps, and opened her bedroom door. She crept onto the landing and to the top of the stairs. More muffled clanking. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shhh!\" she heard someone hiss, \"They's all asleep upstairs!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ain't my fault silver makes so much noise!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will you two shut up!? Get the candlesticks on the sideboard!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCLUNK!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooow!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hit the chair-leg...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll BITE YOURS OFF if you don't hush it! Now get the damn candlesticks!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinerva gulped! Intruders! Thieves! Robbers! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took a deep breath and, blowing out all but one of the candles on her candelabrum, she hurried down the corridor and opened Fortis's bedroom door. She tiptoed inside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA roaring fire filled the master bedroom. And lying sprawled on a gigantic bed, was the gigantic master of Castle Vanderstorm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLord Fortis Vanderstorm himself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n...asleep. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis grunted and snorted and snored...and yawned...hmmmmmm...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinerva put down the candlestick and hurried to her brother's bed. She shook him awake! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Forty! Forty wake up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm...pretty girl...mmm...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fortis!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA huge hand shot out and wrapped itself around her throat! Minerva gasped! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, the hand released its grip. Eyes opened. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...sister...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinerva swallowed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Forty get up! There's people downstairs!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Servants\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! There's voices downstairs! People! They're trying to steal the silveware!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh...what!?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis was now fully awake. \"What did you do!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I haven't done anything! I could hear them from the top of the stairs!...You know, they're not very smart...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Probably think in a big house like this, their voices don't travel very far\", Fortis mumbled. He got up and got dressed. He reached for a sword above his fireplace. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You go into grandma's room and get the baby. And STAY there. I'll go wake Cannius\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCannius yawned and got out of bed. He grabbed his sword, and, along with Koviac, the lord's squire, they headed downstairs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh, would you look at these goblets? Sterling silver! Purdy stuff huh?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA scraping of steel. A flash of light. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Put the damn thing down\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThree Vladian males in their late twenties or early thirties, turned to see two full-grown Mountain men, both half-dressed, holding full-size swords. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is my land, this is my estate, this is my house, and that is my damn silverware...\" Fortis said slowly. \"You will hand over EVERYTHING or I will personally slice you open like a freshly-delivered envelope. Understand?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How's an envelope delivered fresh, Yans?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shaddup you stupid bubble-head!...Eeh lissen buddy, this silverware, ain't nothin'...y'still got pooter and brawnz and brass...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis stepped forward. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is the finest grade Mountanian-wrought silver and you will relinquish it at once\", he said slowly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's requinish?\" the other Vladian asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think he means we need to clean it...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah silver goes black doesn't it...or is that green? No green's steel...right?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's COPPER you dunderhead!\" the main thief said, \"And he wants us to give it BACK! Am I the only one here who fucking understands anything!? Listen Mountain boy, we's travelled a long way, and we's tired...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis raised his sword on a level with the man's face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now\", he said. </span></div></div>",

Not a castle in the strictest sense of the word. It was, once. A long time ago. But various renovations and changes had turned it more into a home than a citadel. Perhaps it was time to turn it back into a fortress again? With all these Vladian raiders everywhere, stone walls and locks might not be enough to keep people out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrandmother would be very upset. The family silver had been her bequest to her grandsons. To think that inadequate protection had been given to it would make her extremely angry! To think that it had nearly been stolen! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis sighed. He would have to build a better silver-safe for it, that was obvious. He would start thinking about it in the morning.

In the light form the fire coming dimly through the curtains around his bed, he saw a tiny figure lying on its back. It kicked and rolled over and crawled towards him. In its mouth was a wooden pacifier. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>*suck-suck-suck*</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis laughed, \"Hehehehe...Hey little fellah!\" he said. He beckoned and the baby crawled faster. Leo scrambled up to papa and pressed himself against his chest. Fortis wrapped a gigantic arm around his little toddler son. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehehehe...awww, hello my little darling...aren't you cute, huh?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis spanked the baby on the backside. Leo gave a squeak of surprise! Fortis laughed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Raaaaaaaaawwwrrr!!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pacifier popped out of the baby boy's mouth as he giggled! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hahahaha...RAAAAAAAWWWRRRR!!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"hehehehe!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Muuurrrrggghhh!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hahahahahahaha!!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"BOOGLY BOOGLY BOOGLY!!!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eeeeeeehahahahahaa!!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis laughed as he made faces and scary noises! The baby sat there on the bed, giggling and laughing! Papa was funny! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Muuuuaaaaaahhh! Rrrruuuuaaar!!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"kekekehahhahahahaha!!! Aaaaah...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis laughed. He tossed the baby in the air, bounced it on the bed, and gave it tickle-torture! Leo squeaked and squealed! Papa was fun! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis smiled. He squeezed his little boy in his arms and gave him a rough, whiskery kiss. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You sleep with papa tonight, huh?\" he said. \"Such a pretty little baby boy...Muah!\" he said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis lay in bed, with his baby boy snuggled up against his broad bare chest, one arm wrapped around the little mite. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne day he was gonna be a big, beefy Mountain lord just like his papa... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who cares about some stupid candlesticks, huh Leo? I think you're the real treasure in this house, huh buddy?\" Fortis said, sticking his son's pacifier back in his mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>*suck-suck-suck!!!*</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He filled three more pints. The teenager leaned across the bar and gave her father a small kiss on the cheek.

It's not your fault!\" said Bacchus. \"HEY!\" he shouted, \"NO BRAWLIN' IN MY BAR!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe huge, barrel-chested bartender picked up a solid walking-stick and leapt over the bar, \"ALRIGHT BREAK IT UP!\" he shouted, \"YOU THERE! YOU!...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Bacchus never finished as someone landed a punch on his jaw! He staggered back, shook off the pain and went back in for more! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Lord Vanderstorm! Do something!\" Ophelia cried out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aaawww jeeez...\" Fortis groaned. He got unsteadily to his feet, \"OY!\" he roared, \"QUITCHER BRAWLIN'!\" he bellowed. \"C'MON BREAK IT UP!\" he shouted. \"Hey Bacchy! Gimme your fucking toothpick!\" he said, reaching for the heavy walking-stick. Fortis charged in, shoving people apart, tearing them from each other and beating them back with the heavy club! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who are you to tell me what to do!?\" a drunk farmhand shouted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I AM YOUR LORD AND MASTER AND YOU WILL DO WHAT I FUCKING TELL YOU!\" Fortis shouted. \"NOW SIDDOWN AND SHUDDUP!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the brawl had been settled down and the spilt beer had been cleaned up, Fortis bought the three Von Eisenwald brothers another round of drinks. Shortly after, he passed out. Bacchus carried Fortis upstairs to one of the empty bedrooms to sleep it off for the night. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Sunlight streamed in through the window. A bird whistled and chirruped outside. Fortis groaned and opened his eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDah fuck...? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis first vocalisation was a heavy belching sound. He slowly rolled over and took stock of where he was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was lying in a bed in a small room with one window which had curtains pulled across it. The heavy night-curtains had been pulled back, and flimsy, light cotton curtains covered the windows, the sun beaming in through their pathetic defenses. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis rolled out of bed and his feet slammed into the floor! He grunted in pain! The stupid bed at home was a good three or four feet off the ground, to accommodate his greater size and height. This bed was not. As a result his feet had hit the floor faster than he had anticipated. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe pulled the blankets off him and stood up. Thankfully, the ceiling was high enough. He felt a bit dizzy...He leaned against the wall and stared around the tiny room. On a small table was a tray with a tea-towel over it. Fortis lifted the towel up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBreakfast. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEggs. Two of them. Sausages. Bacon. Toast, four slices. And what looked like a large mug of beer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis sat down and stared devouring the food like an animal, hardly bothering to pick up the knife and fork provided. He quaffed down the tankard of ale and belched loudly. He wiped his mouth on the towel and went to the window, pulling the curtains back to look into the street below. The villagers were all up and about. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning, my lo--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>WHUNK!</b></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OW!!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh sorry!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis had tried to stand up and had banged his head on the top of the window-frame! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOphelia the barmaid entered the room and curtsied low. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My Lord Vandestorm\", she said respectfully. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis smiled at Ophelia. She had beautiful dark brown hair, done up in braids at intervals. She was the same age as Eldonia. She was very beautiful. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Ophie!\" someone called out. A slim, handsome teenage boy entered the room, \"There you are! Papa said...Oh...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning, Master Hades\", Fortis said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHades was Bacchus's oldest son, and Ophelia's oldest brother. He bowed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My lord\", he said. \"Sorry I was...um...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your sister will be with you presently\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes sir\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis looked at the empty tray of food, \"You brought that up?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOphelia nodded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, my lord\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis nodded, \"thank you...um...here...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis reached into his pocket and pulled out a few gold coins. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no! Father said...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Never mind what your father said. Take it\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you my lord! If there's anything else...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, thank you\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOphelia took up the tray and headed downstairs. Fortis followed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bar in daytime was quiet and rather empty, apart from a few people who came in for drinks and breakfast-meals. Bacchus sat in a rocking-chair behind his bar, his feet up on a stool. He seemed to be drinking some of his own beer, and munching on what looked like a huge, bacon sandwich. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Joo wike jaw bekkisht?\" he said around a huge mouthful. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Darling! Swallow first!\" Martha said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMartha was a buxom, but rather rotund female in her forties. Like her husband, she was of stout and hefty build, but did not have her husband's height. She smiled at Fortis. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do hope you liked your breakfast, my lord!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was very nice, thank you\", said Fortis. \"I'll take a walk around the village, I think\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis left the public house and went for a saunter through the village. Thor, the blacksmith, hammered away at something at his forge, and waved as Fortis walked past. People waved to Fortis, and Fortis waved back. As he entered the square and went to get a drink from the public fountain, he spied someone in the square. </span></div></div>",

He closed the windows and bolted the shutters, hung out the lamp on the porch, and locked the doors. His wife trudged upstairs to bed, followed by his sons. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Philly, are you coming to bed?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOphelia sat by the fire, poking it absent-mindedly. She jumped!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Papa!?...Oh!...Yes I'll...I'll be up...later...\" she said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe heard her father grunt noncommittally, and head upstairs to bed. When she heard the faraway slamming of a door, the young innkeeper's daughter got up and carried her candle upstairs. The first floor held rooms for guests. At the end of the corridor was a bathroom, containing a bathtub and pipes that led from the kitchen below, and a simple flushing toilet, which ejected everything into the ditch and garden out the back, to be spread around as fertiliser for their vegetable-patch. Leading off the landing were the half-dozen rooms for rent. Cards hanging on the doorknobs told her which rooms were occupied. White cards were vacant rooms. Black cards were occupied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the moment, all the doorhandles had white cards hanging on them, apart from one. She tiptoed towards it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpstairs, she could hear her parents and her brothers moving around, getting ready for bed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrembling with excitement...Ophelia opened the one, black-carded door, at the other end of the corridor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Hhrrrrrmmmm...Hrrrrrrmmmm...*cough*...Hrrrrrrrrrmmm...\"</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlumped on the huge bed, her lord and master lay stone cold drunk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was phenomenally sexy...sculpted...tight...firm...tanned...shaggy blond hair. Even under the sheets, Ophelia noticed the curvature of his flexing muscles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe slowly slid the door shut, and tiptoed over to the bed. She put down the candle and lit the other candles in the room. Then, she lay down on the bed, and reached her hand underneath the covers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe brushed up against something thick and soft. Despite the fact that, like its master, the lordly harpoon was slack and dead to the world, Ophelia could not help but marvel at its girth and length. Even in this relaxed sate, it comfortably filled his already tight smalls. She reached up his leg and fondled on his orbs. Then slowly, she grasped the warm, fleshy protrusion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huuurrrrrgggghhh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis groaned and rolled over, now on his back. His legs shifted, and in the confined space of his undershorts, his tackle rearranged itself within the limited real-estate it had been provided with. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOphelia grasped the aristocratic elongation, and started squeezing it gently. She was familiar with the action. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat? The Von Eisenwald Boys stood up for her just because she was a pretty face? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeh. She had a few other...skills...practiced on only the most worthy of boys in the village. And what worthier male than their brave, and noble master...?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe moved upwards, rubbing her hands over his broad, solid chest and his washboard abs. She slipped one leg over, and laid herself on top of him, moving up further and further. He was extremely tall...and sexy... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe brushed aside his dark blond hair and put her lips to his cheek. She gave him a gentle kiss...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good evening, my lord...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hurrrggghhh...wh...Oh...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOphelia gave him another kiss. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My lord...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis smirked, \"Well hey...\" he whispered, \"What're you doing here?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wanted to thank his lordship for saving me...\" she whispered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis frowned, \"Saving your virginity, huh?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOphelia blushed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf she was honest, she had only ever...handled...the Von Eisenwald brothers. Strictly speaking, she was still virgin territory. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, my lord...\" she whispered. \"But if his lordship would wish, I would like to display my gratitude...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis's rough, work-toughened hands rubbed against her backside. Round, pert, and smooth. He gave her a playful squeeze. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'd like that, huh?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOphelia let out a choked gasp! What wonderful hands... She felt them creep up the insides of her nightdress to her sensitive areas...and tickle her within...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe let out a hoarse moan. \"M-m-M-M-My lord...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOphelia's eyes bulged and her mouth opened as she felt something beneath her suddenly thicken and lengthen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA Mountanian warlord who towered twice as tall as his subjects was bound to have equipment worthy of such size and status. And Fortis was no exception. His trembling phallus inflated with the blood of generations of ruthless warriors, and stretched and steadily elongated to its full and impressive length and girth. Being that he was the height that he was, Fortis's erection was truly stupendous in size, dwarfing without competition, the equipment of his subjects. The only other who might come close were his own brothers, being of the same bloodline. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFew girls could accept such a monstrous intrusion. Eldonia was one of the rare few. But then, Eldonia had always been amorous and adventurous, daring and rather racy, if Fortis admitted it. She saw this as a challenge, not something to be feared! Something to be worshipped and adored... and boy, did she ever... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA superior smirk crept over Fortis's face. A smirk that just said, \"<i>You betcha, girl...</i>\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Ophelia felt herself being thrown around like a rag doll. She felt herself being pinned beneath her master's powerful arms and shoulders, her thighs being kicked apart by his legs as he forced her open for his pleasure. It happened so fast, it hardly registered! She felt her bodice and dress being ripped open and pulled off, her petticoats being shoved roughly upwards! Rough hands squeezing her ripe orbs! Her chest tingled! She gritted her teeth!... </span></div></div>",

She didn't hear her bed-curtains being drawn back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut when her bed sank and the slats creaked, she woke up! She could feel a weight on her bed. A very heavy weight! She slipped a hand underneath her pillow and pulled out a dagger. She was about to do...something...when a powerful hand grabbed her wrist, and twisted the dagger out of it! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shhhh...\" a voice whispered. \"You awake, girl?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe room was almost pitch-black. As her eyes adjusted to the starlight coming in from the one, small window in the corner that wasn't shuttered or curtained, she made out a solid, heavy-looking figure sitting on her bed, even if it was only in shadow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you want!?\" she hissed, \"I'm sleeping!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Move\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinerva felt her whole body being shoved over! The bed creaked again as the heavy weight forced its way in. The bed was really far too small, and Minerva heard two muffled \"thuds!\" as a pair of large feet accidentally kicked the board at the foot of the bed. The bed shifted and creaked, and Minerva felt herself being lifted bodily up, and over! Now, she was on the right of the bed again...and wrapping his colossal arms around her, and drawing his legs up to entrap her lower body...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...Fortis gave his baby sister a kiss. It was a rough, dry kiss, and Minerva tried to move away, but Fortis was too strong! He pulled her in and hugged her with a roughness that she still wasn't used to after all this time! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fortis I'm trying to SLEEP!\" she grumbled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shhhhh...\" Fortis whispered. \"Hush, girl...\" he hissed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you DOING in here?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I couldn't sleep...and I figured...if you couldn't sleep...you'd come into my bed...so...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinerva sighed. BROTHERS!! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince she couldn't really refuse her brother Fortis, Minerva made the best of a bad situation and shifted around to make herself comfortable. Fortis hugged her, one arm around her chest, another one slipping just a little bit lower than...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't you dare!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? You're cute down there...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"FORTIS VANDERSTORM!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis let a heavy, deep chuckle.

After all, she is...my wife and...I'm sure she's come to expect a certain...um...standard...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinerva giggled. So like her brother to talk like this. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh shut up! You know what I mean!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just wanted to sleep with someone else. Someone who's not gonna poke me and grumble and whine about it all the time, so I can actually SLEEP!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinerva sighed. She felt sorry for her brother. He spent so much time trying to make everyone else happy...She hugged him! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At least YOU don't pressure me for that kinda stuff\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinerva was glad that it was dark, or her brother might have spotted the look of horror on her face! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fortis! How dare you!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was a joke!\" said Fortis, in defense. He hugged his sister. Then, he let out a groan! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn it! I think I twisted my back doing all that roofing-work! Bending around to pick up shingles and nails and stuff...Bitch!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh roll over! I'll see what I can do...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis rolled over and Minerva lit a couple of candles. She opened a bottle of massage oil and began to massage her brother's back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was not easy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot only was it enormous and broad, but it was also firm, hard, lumpy and very rigid! There wasn't much flesh that she could grab to squeeze and massage! But she tried her best... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis relaxed and cracked his back, flexing his huge shoulders. He groaned. That felt sooooooo goooooood... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinerva kept massaging, and before long, Fortis had actually fallen asleep. Minerva was about to blow out the candles when the doors to her room opened! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Minerva, are you aw...WHAT IS GOING ON HERE!?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis jerked awake! Standing in the doorway was Eldonia! Fortis tried to get out of bed... </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Fortis trying to get out of his sister's bed was like an elephant trying to get out of a shopping-basket! It was never going to happen gracefully! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis got up and tried to move! But his leg caught the bedpost on the way out! He tripped over and hit the floor with a 'THUD!' that rattled the windows! Eldonia glared at her husband!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you DOING in here!?\" she cried out, \"I want to spend some special time with my hubby and I find him in bed with his own sister!?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinerva knew that Fortis and Eldonia had been on edge for weeks now, and there was probably another explosive argument just around the corner! Seeking to avoid another all-out screaming match...especially at 1:30 in the morning!...she intervened! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eldonia, Fortis likes sleeping with me!\" Minerva tried. Almost at once, she realised she'd stepped on a landmine! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OH! OH I SEE! YOU LIKE SLEEPING WITH YOUR SISTER! BUT YOU WON'T SLEEP WITH ME!?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's NOT what she means!\" Fortis grunted! He was trying to untangle himself from the mess of bedsheets that he'd pulled off with him when he fell on the floor! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fortis wanted someone to cuddle with!\" Minerva said, \"Some peace and quiet! That's all! He works so hard!...And he's injured!\" she added quickly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am NOT!\" said Fortis. The very IDEA that such a specimen of Mountanian masculinity would be STUPID enough to get himself injured was impossible! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinerva groaned. \"Your back, remember!?\" she hissed, while she pulled the covers off her brother's legs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh...Oh! Oh yeah...Oooow!!\" he grunted, as he got up, not entirely convincingly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your back?\" Eldonia said, accusingly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He twisted it while he was re-roofing the main barn!\" Minerva insisted, \"And it's very very sore...Isn't it, brother darling?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis nodded vigorously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He came in here so I could give it a massage! It hurts so very much! Isn't that right, Fortis?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore nodding! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fortis ADORES you just as much as he adores me!\" Minerva continued, \"You even have a beautiful baby boy! And he would LOVE to...enjoy you even more!...But he can't do it when he's all tied up with muscle-cramps! And he wouldn't want to try anything with you if he wasn't able to um...perform...to the level that you're used to...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis would probably have slapped his sister, for the first and last time in his life, if she DARED to suggest that HE couldn't \"perform\", as she put it!...But he withheld his thoughts, knowing that she was trying to butter Eldonia up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you would be very upset if Fortis couldn't make you COMPLETELY happy! And it would make HIM feel like so much LESS of a man if he failed to do that!\" Minerva continued. Eldonia burst out laughing when she spotted the look of HORROR on Fortis's face, which Minerva, who had her back to her brother, hadn't noticed! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Girl!\" He said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's true!\" Minerva said. \"Now Forty's got a very sore back! He should lie down and have complete rest for a week! Eldonia you should take care of him! He would like someone sweet and adorable like you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh would he?\" Eldonia asked. She frowned. She wasn't convinced!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well who else would there to be relax him...and massage oil on his body...and release all the...tension...within...?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia liked the sound of that...Her poor little hubby all tied up in bed, needing someone to look after him...poor boy! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A sister should do that...\" Minerva began. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't you DARE!\" Eldonia said, \"Looking after a man is a wife's duty!\" she said. \"Come along, Forty! I won't let Minerva steal you away from me!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis got up, but moved a bit too fast! He let out a grunt of pain as he felt the tightness in his back return! Damn it! He really threw it out this time! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinerva helped Fortis to his feet and the two young women helped him back to his bedroom. Eldonia went to find some candles and scented oils. Her poor hubby needed all the care in the world! And she had been neglecting him expecting  him to do things that obviously COULDN'T do because he was so very tired! It was rude of her to expect him to do things that he couldn't do...at least...not right now...She should've been able to just relax and look after him... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinerva spotted the hungry look in her friend's eyes, and tiptoed out of the master bedroom, closing the doors behind her. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Butterscotch snuggled into the nice girl's arms.  She held him firmly but delicately, and Butterscotch loved being held!  He wriggled around a bit to dry his fur off a bit more on the girl's dress.  While he enjoyed his dip in the warm pond, he didn't enjoy being wet for too long.  After all, water tended to wash away all the oils on his fur, and he needed those oils to keep himself clean.  He'd have to groom himself again when he got back to his hutch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe one thing he didn't like about his dip in the pond was that his lunch was taken away from him!  He'd just gotten in a couple of nibbles and had been about to take a good bite out of the long, juicy, thick carrot he'd found bobbing in the water, when he was suddenly airborne!  The stern, scary man tossed him to the nice girl, but the girl hadn't given him any food yet!  His belly rumbled in hunger, and he couldn't help himself as he began nibbling a bit on the flower pattern on the girl's dress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh!  What...?  Oh, you silly rabbit!\" Minerva laughed when she felt and then saw Butterscotch trying to nibble on her clothes!  She heard--actually HEARD--the rabbit's stomach growl, and she had pity on the poor, damp creature.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you must still be hungry after having been denied your snack of Fortis!\"  She giggled and began rubbing the rabbit's large, soft, fat belly.  The rabbit practically purred at the warm, nice caresses.  \"Well, you're in luck, Butterscotch!  I'm taking you down to the kitchens, and I know Mrs. Tibbs will have plenty of carrots and lettuce and radishes and other tasty veggies for you to eat!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nButterscotch luxuriated in the girl's arms.  He absolutely LOVED having his belly rubbed!  It helped to soothe the incredible hunger he felt.  He needed to eat lots in preparation for winter!  His rabbit senses were telling him that this winter was going to be a rough one, with lots of snow, bitter, cold temperatures, and little food to be had!  So, he had to get as fat as possible in order to make it through till spring.  He'd been eating at a decent pace once he'd found the large vegetable patch and the flower gardens near this huge hutch the humans lived in.  However, he wasn't near fat enough yet!  He needed to be at least twice his current size--if not three or four times!--in order to survive the winter off of his fat.  He sure hoped the humans had plenty of food for him so he could get as big as possible!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mrs. Tibbs!\" Minerva called as she entered the brightly lit, well-organized kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nButterscotch perked up once they entered the room.  His little nose began twitching wildly at all the delicious, new, and wonderful smells!  When he caught the scent and sight of his favorite meal--carrots!--he wriggled and struggled in the girl's arms!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Butterscotch!  Hold on, boy!  Hey!  Wait!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinerva tried in vain to keep the hungry rabbit in her arms, but the rodent was too eager and his legs were too powerful!  With a quick thrust of his powerful back legs, he leapt out of the girl's arms and onto the large kitchen table.  He hopped right up to a large platter filled to overflowing with freshly washed carrots and eagerly grabbed several with his front paws.  He began nibbling and biting at a quick pace, anxious to get as much food into his hungry belly as possible!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinerva merely laughed and patted the rabbit on his long ears, which were held back flat against his head as he ate.  \"I guess you were REALLY hungry, huh, boy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you call for me, dear?\" asked Mrs. Tibbs, as she came into the kitchen, wiping her hands on her white apron.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I did,\" Minerva replied.  \"I was going to ask for some food for Butterscotch, here, but it seems he's already found some!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, bad bunny!\" the older woman replied, intending to swat the rabbit away.  \"Those carrots were meant for the beef and vegetable stew I was gonna cook up for dinner tonight!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mrs. Tibbs!  Don't!\" Minerva said, putting her hand on the woman's arm to stay her.  \"I'm sure we have plenty more carrots, and Butterscotch won't surely eat all of them!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later, however, Minerva would come to eat her words.  The two ladies watched with wide eyes as the fat rabbit plowed through the large plate of carrots in record time!  Before either of them realized it, the platter was nibbled clean!  The only thing remaining on the platter was a very bloated, stuffed rabbit, whose stomach had swollen to twice its former size!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nButterscotch lounged on his back, running his furry little paws over the sides of his belly in contentment.  Those carrots sure hit the spot!  However, despite how much he had just eaten, Butterscotch still felt hungry!  He needed more food!  He rolled lazily over onto his side and slowly pushed himself up onto his hind legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinerva giggled at the sight the chubby bunny made.  His belly was so large and round, it sat a long ways on the table in front of him!  Minerva wondered if he could even hop!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nButterscotch soon proved her suspicions true by feebly jumping a couple inches down the kitchen table.  He didn't so much hop as more shuffle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have never in all my years seen a creature put away as much food as this rabbit just has!\" Mrs. Tibbs said, wiping her apron over her sweating brow in astonishment.  \"Goodness!  He can't still be hungry?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIndeed, a ways down from the platter were several large bowls filled with other vegetables that Mrs. Tibbs was going to use for her beef stew:  peeled potatoes, sliced, raw onions, sliced tomatoes, green beans, and stalks of celery.  Butterscotch sniffed at each bowl, twitching his whiskery nose in delight, before leaning over and grabbing several vegetables and nibbling and biting and chewing them rapidly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That rabbit's going to eat my entire makings for stew!\" Mrs. Tibbs cried.  \"Shoo!  Get out of here, now!  Shoo!  Shoo!  Go on out to the garden and eat what you want out there, but no more outta my kitchen!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMrs. Tibbs grabbed a broom and was prepared to swat and prod the bunny off the table, but Minerva quickly scooped the still-eating rabbit into her arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mrs. Tibbs, don't hurt him!  He doesn't know any better!  After all, he's just a rabbit, and he's hungry!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't care!  Get him outta my kitchen!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinerva quickly whisked the now much heavier rabbit out of the food-filled kitchen and into the back yard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMrs. Tibbs sighed and looked forlornly at her kitchen table.  The platter of carrots was, of course, now empty.  The bowls of potatoes and tomatoes were empty, too, and the rest of the bowls had maybe half of their former contents remaining!  How had the rabbit eaten that much in such a short amount of time?  The bigger concern, though, was how to salvage dinner?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lucy, Katie!\" she called.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young girls scurried into the room.  \"Yes, ma'am?\" they said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMrs. Tibbs looked sternly at the two girls.  \"That rabbit of yours ate most of the fixings for the stew I was going to be preparing for his lordship for dinner tonight!  I want you two to not only keep a better eye on that pet of yours so that this doesn't happen again, but I also want you to go out to the garden and gather up some more vegetables for the stew!  I need potatoes and tomatoes, green beans and onions!  Here's a couple baskets for you--gather as much as you can!  Now go, and be quick about it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, ma'am!\"</span></div></div>",

The hutch door was rarely closed. Butterscotch was pretty well house-trained, and was generally free to hop around the kitchen and gardens and servants quarters, but he rarely wandered far. That was why Lucy was shocked when she saw that the hutch was empty! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Butterscotch?\" she said. She peeked under the wash-baskets...and in the huge copper, the big water-boiling pot. Sometimes, when the wash was done and the water was still warm, the bunny hopped in for a scrubdown in the hot, soapy water. But this time, the bunny was nowhere to be seen! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy checked under all the beds, the chairs, tables, in the garden, in the bushes...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--- --- --- --- <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis hugged the sobbing servant-girl. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey now!\" he said, \"Shhhh! It's alright...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"BUTTERSCOTCH GOOOONE!!\" she wailed, hugging Fortis...the closest thing she had to a father...and sniffling hard! Fortis hugged her back as gently as he knew how. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Butterscotch wasn't really your pet, Lucy. If he decides to hop away, there isn't really anything you can do\", he said. \"Besides, you don't know that he won't come back! Winter's on it's way, you know. These animals all have to hibernate for the cold weather!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's a hidermate?\" Lucy asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi-BER-nate\", Fortis explained, \"The animals all get really fat. Then they go and hide underground where they sleep and sleep for weeks and weeks, to protect themselves from the cold weather when the snow comes! You saw how fat Butterscotch was getting! He was preparing for winter! If he still likes it here, he might come back\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When!?\" Lucy wailed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh not for a long time! Three or four months, perhaps...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"FOUR MONTHS!? Is that more than tomorrow!?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis laughed at the young girl's naivety. \"Yes\", he said. \"It's over twelve weeks! You know how long that is, don't you?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy nodded, \"But...but I want Butterscotch!\" she sniffled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you were really nice to Butterscotch, he might come back\", Fortis said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy sniffed. \"You promise?\" she asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. But he might. That's all\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy nodded. \"Okay...\" she said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis smiled, \"Now go on. Help Katie with the dishwashing. It'll take your mind off of the bunny\", he said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis sighed. He figured he'd have to go through stuff like this if Eldonia ever had a little girl, so he may as well practice with the younger servant-girls. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cI miss Butterscotch,\u201d Lucy moaned as she stood in front of the kitchen fireplace, warming her hands.  The weather had begun getting much colder lately, and all of the womenfolk tended to dress in many layers and huddle around the fireplaces in the large manor as much as possible to keep warm.  The men, particularly Fortis and his brothers, didn't seem to be affected by the colder temperatures as much.  (Eldonia had commented to Minerva that her husband always seemed to give off an inferno of heat, which explained why he never got cold...and why Eldonia always shared his bed these days, as Fortis kept her nice and warm during the night...among other things.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI miss Butterscotch, too,\u201d little Katie commiserated with a sniffle.  \u201cWhy'd he go away?  Didn't he like it here?  We gave him lots of food to eat, and we patted him and snuggled him lots and lots!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, Lord Fortis told me that since he came from the forest, he musta gone back to the forest.  He also said that since we took real good care of him, he might come back some day!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI hope some day is real soon!  He was so soft and warm and cute and snuggly....\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMrs. Tibbs sighed as she overheard the girls' conversation.  \u201cAre you two still moping about that rabbit?  Goodness!  He was only here for a few weeks!  And he practically ate me out of my vegetable garden, too!  Which reminds me:  you two get bundled up and go out to the cellar to get me some jars of pickled beets.  Lady Athena requested we have some for dinner this evening.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, ma'am.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two girls wrapped scarves and thick woolen shawls around themselves, grabbed a couple baskets, and headed outside.  The cellar was a large underground storage room dug out of the earth a little ways away and under the manor, but the only door to reach it was outside and practically horizontal to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the girls were heading around the corner of the house, Katie noticed the bushes a ways off moving and quaking.  A bit frightened, she grasped Lucy's arm and said, \u201cLucy!  There's somethin' in those bushes over there!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy looked where Katie was pointing and gasped in alarm.  With the colder weather, it wouldn't be uncommon for wild animals, such as foxes or wolves, to come near the manor house and the surrounding buildings, looking for easy prey or scraps of food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet's get back to the house!\u201d Lucy said quietly, holding Katie close to her side and slowly moving back the way they came.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, when the bushes jostled again, a patch of toffee colored fur appeared, followed by a whiskered face, long ears, and a short, rotund body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBUTTERSCOTCH!\u201d Katie shrieked in excitement.  She ran over to the fat rabbit and quickly scooped him up into her arms.  \u201cOh, how I missed you!\u201d she squealed, hugging the bunny tightly in her small arms.  \u201cBoy, you've gotten heavy!  You must have still found plenty of food to eat while you were gone!  Why did you leave us, huh?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think I know why, Katie,\u201d Lucy said, coming up to the other girl's side and pointing back into the bushes.  \u201cButterscotch brought a friend!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIndeed, hopping cautiously out of the bushes toward them was another smaller, fat, fluffy rabbit.  However, instead of being toffee-colored, this rabbit was nearly all black.  Its hands, feet, and face, however, were all white.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAww,...did you bring back a friend, Butterscotch?\u201d Katie cooed to the rabbit in her arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy knelt down and extended a hand towards the black rabbit.  \u201cHi, there, little fella.  Want to come with us and make your home here with Butterscotch?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe black rabbit twitched its nose warily before taking several hesitant hops toward Lucy.  When the rabbit was close enough, Lucy gently ran a hand over the rabbit's long, soft, black ears.  This seemed to be enough reassurance for the new bunny, who then eagerly leaned into the soft rubbing before lying down on its side.  Lucy laughed and began to rub and stroke the rabbit's round belly.  \u201cThat's right!  We're real friendly, and we'll take good care of you!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c...If Lord Fortis will let us keep him!\u201d Katie said worriedly, keeping a firm hold on Butterscotch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy bit her lip.  \u201cI hope he will!  Besides, having two rabbits surely won't be much more work than having one rabbit.  Right?  And we don't want Butterscotch to get lonely!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, now, what's this we've got here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls whirled around to see Koviac, Fortis's squire, lumbering up to them, his arms filled with freshly chopped firewood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHi, Kovi--...er...Kodi--...um....\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKoviac.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatie blushed.  \u201cKoviac.  Sorry!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKoviac shrugged.  \u201cIt's okay.  Oh!  Is that Butterscotch?  Looks like he came back.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatie brightened instantly.  \u201cYeah!  And he brought a friend with him!  See?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatie turned and pointed down towards Lucy, who was still rubbing and scratching the new rabbit's tummy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKoviac chuckled.  \u201cWell, Butterscotch, you ol' dog!  I guess you decided you had it good enough here that you wanted to bring your mate to come live with you!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMate?\u201d  A quizzical look crossed Katie's face.  \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, if I'm not mistaken, that little black rabbit there would be Butterscotch's mate.  You know?  His...girlfriend, or wife, so to speak.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAwww...Butterscotch has a girlfriend!\u201d Katie said, giving the toffee bunny a kiss on the cheek, making Butterscotch's whiskers twitch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKoviac placed his armload of logs down and came closer to kneel next to the black rabbit.  \u201cHmm,\u201d he said.  \u201cMind if I take a look at this little lady?\u201d he asked Lucy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy shrugged and sat back.  Koviac ran his hands over the rabbit, examining it.  Eventually, he sighed and sat back on his heels.  \u201cWell, I don't know if Lord Fortis will allow you to keep this new rabbit.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Lucy shrieked, quickly grasping the black rabbit and holding it tightly in her arms.  \u201cWhy not?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, it's definitely a female,\u201d Koviac explained, \u201cbut she's also...\u201d</span></div></div>",

His arms ached...He'd been wielding an axe for most of the past few months, splitting tons of firewood for the stoves and fireplaces around the manor and the estate. The enormous wood-lockers in the basements were full of dry, flammable firewood...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so was his fireplace. He'd stoked the grate up fully before going to bed, and now the room was toasty warm. He yawned and rolled over...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey sweetie...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis slipped a huge arm under his wife's body and squeezed her playfully, \"How's my little girl?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe bent down and kissed her. \"Wakey-wakey!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia didn't stir. Fortis hugged her. \"Awww...Oh wow...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia was sweating and was cold to the touch. Her forehead was blazing hot!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! Hey wake up, woman!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?...Ooooh my head!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia opened her eyes. She was freezing cold, sweating, and had a splitting headache! She slowly opened her eyes and stared at her husband. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you alright?\" Fortis asked. \"You feel terrible!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia gulped and grimaced! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe slumped into bed. Her head felt like it was full of rocks! She sniffled and coughed! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think you've got a cold or something!\" said Fortis. He pressed his hand against his wife's forehead. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"T-t-that's i-impossible! I was sleeping with you! I...AAACHOO!! Oh gosh!...Oooh man...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia tried to get out of bed. She swayed and wobbled on her feet! Her eyes were all blurry and her temples throbbed! She took one step forward and fell to her knees! Fortis got out of bed! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah, woah, woah, woah...\" he said, \"Easy there sweetie...You ain't goin' anywhere...Now you get back into bed right now!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia smiled weakly. \"Are you trying to tell me something, my lord?\" she asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, no time for that now\", said Fortis, \"You don't look so good. You just lay there\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia sneezed and groaned! She felt terrible! Fortis opened a closet and drew out a pile of neatly-folded handkerchiefs. He put them on her side of the bed and pulled on his enormous dressing-gown before tiptoeing out into the corridor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aaah...aaah...AAACHOO!! Uuuurrgghhh...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis stopped and knocked on a door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Girl?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uuuuggghh...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis opened the door and went in. His sister lay in bed, sweating and groaning. He whistled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow...You look like shit!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh thank you, brother...\" Minerva said thickly, through a heavily-blocked nose, \"Aren't you just adorable...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis laughed. \"Eldonia's also got a cold. Must be runnin' all over the county. You stay in bed and sleep. Penny!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinerva's maid exited from her own small bedroom and curtised. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My lord Vanderstorm\", she said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You see to it that Lady Minerva gets everything she needs, won't you?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, my lord! She took ill last night a couple of hours before bed\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I bet it was those stupid bunnies...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fawtish!\" Minerva said through a clogged nose and sore throat, \"Dahy onye been here a week! Ooh can't shay ig's dem!\" she blew her nose heavily, \"It's not fair!\" she said, in something closer to her normal voice. Fortis sighed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Crash!!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis whirled around and left the room. Halfway down the staircase, Jupiter was picking himself up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woooaaah...\" he groaned. A hand went to his forehead, feeling his heavy rise in temperature. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh for goodness sake, not you too!\" Fortis groaned, \"get upstairs and in bed! I don't need the entire household sick!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was gonna get some hot water for my bottle...\" Jupiter said, holding up his empty hot-water bottle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll do it\", Fortis said, taking up the shiny, copper hot water-bottle in its fuzzy red cozy-pouch, \"YOU go to bed\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis headed downstairs. Thank goodness for the thick rugs and carpets that covered the floors. It was so cold! Fortis went through the dining-room and into the kitchen. The fire in the fireplace was stoked up high, and the doors to the range-stove were wide open. Heat washed over everything. Fortis pumped water into a kettle and put it on the stove. A stout, middle-aged woman shuffled into the kitchen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Morning!\" she said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning, Mrs. Tibbs\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You should be in bed, my lord! This is not time for you to be up and about!\" she said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Half the household's sick!\" Fortis said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I know my lord. Hermes and his older brother Zachary are also under the weather. The girls are alright. They're playing with their bunnies. I told them there wouldn't be much work today, so they could more or less have it off\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis nodded in agreement. With everyone stuck in bed, it was unlikely that there would be much housework. He sighed as he watched the snow falling outside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wooow it's heavy out there...\" he said. \"I hope the pipes don't freeze!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perish the thought!\" Mrs. Tibbs said. \"But just in case, I've had the water-barrels in the basement filled up, just in case\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis smiled, \"Good thinking. I hope you've got enough firewood?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Never enough of that, my lord\", said Mrs. Tibbs. The kettle began to boil. Fortis filled up the hot-water bottle and put it back on the stove. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perhaps you could make us some chicken soup, Mrs. Tibbs?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I certainly will, if you tell me how many would like it\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Better make enough for EVERYONE. Two or three chickens...just in case\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMrs. Tibbs nodded, \"Very well\", she said. \"I do hope you stay healthy, my lord!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis snorted and stood up proudly. \"Yeah. Like I'm ever gonna fall sick\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You had that stomach-bug when you were ten. You were vomiting for a week!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis groaned when he remembered how long Mrs. Tibbs had been working for his family. She knew every intimate detail about every person in the household. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Yeah\", he said. \"Okay ONE time\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And the runs you had when you were twelve...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tibby...\" Fortis said, with a sort of pleading tone in his voice. The housekeeper and cook smiled and hugged him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooooh...There there...\" she said. Mrs. Tibbs had to admit, having served the Vanderstorm family for so long, she had developed a maternal interest in the welfare of the four Vanderstorm offspring. \"You just stay healthy!\" she said. \"And I'll make us some soup!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis smiled and headed upstairs. He found his son playing with his pet dragon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeo's baby luck-dragon blew out a ball of fire which lit a candle-sconce on the edge of Leo's crib. The toddler giggled and blew it out. The dragon blew another fireball which lit the candle again. Leo giggled and puffed it out! The dragon blew a huge fireball that wafted up into the air! The baby squealed with delight and giggled! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis laughed. \"Cute little fellah\", he said, stroking his son. \"You be good and stay healthy now\", he said. Leo burbled happily. Fortis hoisted his son into his arms and kissed him tenderly on the forehead, before sitting down in front of a blazing fire. The baby snuggled down and suckled on his thumb, slowly dozing off... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The chair was far too small for a person of Fortis's weight, girth and height. Ten feet of Mountanian nobleman was a lot to be contained by a chair that was supposed to be for the household nurse! Nevertheless, he leaned against the backrest and in the heat of the fire, dozed off, with his son curled up on his lap. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young nobleman didn't know what time he woke up later, but when he did, he felt a lightness on his lap. He reached down sleepily...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>...Uh-oh...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis snapped awake! He leapt to his feet, knocking over the chair! He stared wildly around the nursery, and then looked into the crib, whipping back the blankets and pillows! Empty! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"SHIT!\" he swore! \"Oooooh shit...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis left the nursery, and went into the master bedroom. The door was closed. Fortis opened it and, by candlelight, so as not to wake his fitfully-sleeping wife, he searched his bedroom, the dressing-room, the bathroom and the spare room. Nobody there. Eldonia cuddled a fat, squishy bolster, her comfort when she didn't have her husband to cuddle with...but there was no baby anywhere! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis left the room and peeked into Cannius's room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Cannius, have you seen...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hurrrrrrk!!...Ugh!...\" Cannius groaned, blowing his nose into a handkerchief, groaning and flopping back onto his bed in a dizzy faint. \"No I ain't seen nothin'!\" he groaned. \"Leave me alone, Forty!...And close the damn door! it's freezing!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis slammed the door and opened the next door. Jupiter was fast asleep, cuddling his hot-water bottle. He obviously hadn't seen the baby. Minerva was also asleep, and her maid was busy knitting. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis tore downstairs and into the kitchen! Mrs. Tibbs was busy dicing up meat on a chopping-board. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah! I have hot chicken broth with meat, and noodles, and carrots! It'll be ready in...My lord, what ARE you looking for?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis was peeking into sacks, opening baskets, checking inside storage-barrels and opening cupboards. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My lord!\" Mrs. Tibbs said, dropping her knife with a 'clank!'. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Baby...\" Fortis mumbled, pulling out a whole heap of pots, \"Where's...baby...\" he mumbled, stuffing the pots back into the cupboard. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Baby?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did Leo crawl downstairs? You didn't feed him some milk or something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bab...No!

Not a stupid LIZARD!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fortis, you have much to learn\", Lady Athena said. \"Come with me\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAthena talked to her grandson as she went upstairs. \"Luck Dragons are very special creatures. They protect their charges very territoriality. They'll follow them everywhere! It's a safe bet that where-ever the baby is, the dragon is nearby. So is the dragon in the nursery!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know! I didn't bother to look!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLady Athena entered the nursery. She stared around. She moved slowly around the room. Then, she paused. Fortis strode over. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it?\" he asked. Fortis watched as his grandmother's hands strayed to the window-sills. Fortis noticed that one of the windows was slightly open. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooooooooooooooh SHIT!...No! No no no no no!! Don't tell me he fell out! Oh fuck! Eldonia's gonna fucking MURDER ME!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis gulped. It was a LONG way down. Over twenty feet! If the baby fell out the window, then... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis pushed the window open and stared down. There was a LOT of snow outside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm going outside!\" he said. He grabbed a lamp from a table and hurried downstairs. Lady Athena went downstairs to the dining-room, which was directly underneath the nursery. She opened the windows and peeked out. Fortis came into view, wrapped in a cloak and holding the lantern. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"LEO!...LEO WHERE ARE YOU!?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLady Athena leaned out of the open dining-room window. Then she saw it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA jet of flames. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCurled around something wrapped in a blue woolen romper-suit was a sparkly, gold dragon with red under-scales, and bright, green eyes. The dragon blew flames onto the bundle and kept it warm by wrapping itself around it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Over here, Fortis!\" she called out. \"Look!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis jogged over and saw the baby. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"IT'S KILLING HIM!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh don't be stupid! It's keeping the baby warm! Here, give him to me!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis scooped dragon and baby up out of the snow-bank underneath the nursery windows, and passed them through the dining-room windows to his grandmother. Lady Athena put the two precious objects on the dining-table and Fortis climbed in through the window, closing it after him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't get it...\" he said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I can guess\", Lady Athena said, \"The baby crawled or toddled to the window to see the snow. The catch on the window must've popped open when he was leaning against the glass. He fell out and landed in the snow. Everyone was either in their rooms, or asleep, so nobody noticed. The dragon jumped out after the baby to keep it warm until it was found!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I'll be damned...\" said Fortis. \"Y'know, I don't think we ever named this dragon\", he said, looking at it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suggest 'Felix'\", Lady Athena said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"FELIX?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's Latin.

He revealed a mane of greying brown hair and a lion-face with a scar down one cheek. He grunted and blew his nose heavily into a handkerchief. Slowly, he turned to face the small assembly of people. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mornin'...\" he mumbled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLord Venatarius VonGewalt stood before them, dressed in heavy travelling clothes.

Lord VonGewalt nodded and headed upstairs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVenatarius deduced by the sheer layout of the rooms which one was the master bedroom, and headed inside. Fortis was tiptoeing across the room. He sat down on the bedside and put down a bowl of soup. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!...Woman wake up!...C'mon now...Up!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huuughh...wh...Forty...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here, Mrs. T. made you some soup.

Fortis shifted her upright in bed and handed her the bowl of soup. She coughed! Her sore throat was killing her!

They slammed the heavy axes into the largest tree they could find, chopping out chunks of wood and cutting grooves into the tree-trunk on each side. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Forty why you makin' that cut so big!?\" Wolfgang shouted, \"You don't need a groove like that! The tree's fallin' this way!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean? It's comin' down MY way!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I already started makin' my groove bigger! You stop choppin'!\" </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span><b>CRASH!!</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe unbalanced tree creaked and toppled into the snow. The two mountain lords high-fived and started chopping off the branches. Fortis and Wolfgang, eager to outdo each other, took to breaking off most of the branches using pure brute strength. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the branches were removed and the log and branches tied up, they dragged the whole thing back to the manor-house. The servant-girls helped them guide the enormous tree-trunk into the drawing-room where they had laid a bed of kindling and dry firewood. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eliza!\" Fortis called out. The head housemaid approached her master. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good Yuletide, my lord\", she said, curtsying. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, yeah...go upstairs and find my sister\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think she's still a bit poorly, my lord\", said Penny, \"She's sleeping\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis swore. It was always tradition for the youngest in the household to light the fire on the first day of Yuletide. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, I don't think Minerva's the youngest in the household anymore...\" Wolfgang said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah...Eliza! Go and get my son!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes my lord!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEliza headed upstairs, and returned to the drawing room with Leo, wrapped up in cloth. Leo stared at everyone and Fortis took him in his arms. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey boy! You wanna do somethin' special for papa?\" he said. Leo nodded. Fortis smiled. He handed his son a burning taper. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now I'm gonna lower you down, and you're gonna light the fire, right there...\" he said, pointing to the base of the fire, \"Can you do that?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeo nodded. Fortis smiled. He dangled his son upside down by his feet and lowered him down, shaking him playfully. The housemaids giggled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeo reached out with the burning taper and touched it to the twigs like papa told him. Fortis turned his son the right way up so that he could see the wood beginning to burn. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww...I was supposed to do that!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis turned to see his sister out of bed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry girl, you ain't the youngest in the house anymore!\" he said. \"And I thought you were sick?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm feeling better\", she said. \"The most important thing is that my sore throat is gone!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well don't get too close to Leo, I don't want him catchin' whatever you got left!\" Fortis said. Then he smiled, \"Nice you're gettin' better, sister\", he said. \"So, you like the log?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It'll be beautiful once it's burning properly\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMrs. Tibbs smiled, \"It's nice that you're feeling better, my lady. I tell you what, I'll make us all some cookies! Gingerbread, and shortbread sugar-cookies. And some hot chocolate!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh thank you, Mrs. Tibbs...\" said Minerva. \"Eldonia's feeling a bit better as well, but she wants to stay in bed, just in case\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis nodded, \"I better go see how she is\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinerva nodded and smiled at everyone. \"Grandma, once the weather clears, we better send out letters and posters and invitations about the estate Yuletide feast\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLady Athena nodded. \"I remember when your grandfather was still alive...We used to have such fun...Mrs. Tibbs! You're making a traditional spiced fruit pudding aren't you?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course! We're chopping up the fruit and stuff right now! Come along, girls!\" she said, to the kitchen-maids, \"Let's get back! We're making three, this year!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Three!?\" Fortis said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes! Two for the household and the guests to the party which I'm SURE you'll be holding...and one for the servants!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis nodded, \"You didn't have to! You're part of the household too, you know...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMrs. Tibbs nodded, \"But just in case\", she said, and smiled, \"Come along, girls! And don't forget the brandy in the cellar!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis smiled at his sister, when they were the only two left in the drawing room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose you forgot to get me a present this year\", she said, weakly. Fortis glared at his sister! </span></div></div>",

We give gifts, we share food, drink, dance...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds usual\", Eldonia said, \"Sounds fun\", she added. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And grandpa used to have this tradition of inviting the children of the local orphanage over for dinner\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Orphanage?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The boys and girls at the county orphanage come over for a care-basket and a plate of food each.

Mrs. Tibbs just finished the last batch of ginger-cookies\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, Minerva and her grandmother started filling up the baskets.

He headed out of the dining-room and returned a few minutes later with a small sack. The mountain lord reached into the sack and pulled out a fistful of something. He went from basket to basket, dropping a little bit of whatever was in his hand, and in the sack...into each basket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Forty what are you doing?\" Minerva asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm givin' you a hand!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mountain lord held up the sack and jingled it around. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Two sovereigns in each basket\", he said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww Forty!

Wolfgang was always a bit more of...well...a wolf. But Fortis tended to be more conservative and restrained when it came to bedding females. He never allowed himself a flirt with a housemaid...at least, not recently. And if he did, he always made sure to play it safe. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AUNT MINNIE!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinerva clapped her hands to her ears as Champion threw himself around his aunt! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Champion!

I bet she got me something cool for a Yuletide present!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Champion!

Y'know he still lives with his sister?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So?\" Fortis said, \"If I weren't married to some hot beauty, I'd probably be livin' with my sister\", he said. He draped an arm around his sister and squeezed her playfully. Minerva laughed! </span></div></div>",

And horseshoes and all other manner of things. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Grandma, what do all the things mean?\" Champion asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOld Lady Athena smiled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The toy tools are for industry and craft...\" she said, \"...the anvils are for solidity and strength...The baubles are for beauty and delicacy. The horse-shoes are for good luck in the new year...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe old woman bent down and picked up more ornaments from a dusty crate on the floor. Pretty little shields painted bright colours. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...The shields represent protection and safety for the ones we love\", she said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLast but not least, Lady Athena picked up a whole heap of little brass candle-holders which she helped hang up around the tree. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright!\" said Fortis, \"Now, we all get to light one candle each...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis slotted the thin Yule-candles into the holders on the tree-branches. He lit a taper. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Vesta, you go first\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVesta lit a candle. Then, she handed the taper to her daughter, who lit one. Then Champion. Then Wolfgang. Then Cannius, then Jupiter. Then Fortis. Then baby Leonardo. Then Eldonia. Then Minerva. Then grandma. And then, the servants in order of seniority. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, the towering tree was full of burning candles, twinkling light and ornaments. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooh, it's so pretty...\" said Eldonia. Fortis draped a huge arm around his wife's shoulders. \"Not as pretty as you are...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why Forty!\" </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Mountanians were known for rough, tough living. Their extra size, bulk and immense strength and power had been earned from generations of living in the mountains and the harsh lowlands of their native land. Not for nothing were the majority of the men tough, rough and powerfully-built giants, and not for nothing were the women fiery and determined. Not for nothing were the rest of the women caring and gentle, loving and sweet. In such a harsh and unforgiving landscape, strength, power, kindness, sweetness and mercy went side by side. And it was impossible to survive out here without all of those qualities. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEspecially in the depths of Mountanian winter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe temperatures dropped to well below freezing during whiteout blizzards. The days, weeks and months of felling trees, sawing branches, splitting slogs with an axe, or driving in heavy spikes with sledgehammers to break open tree-trunks, to produce the tons of firewood required to keep houses warm and people safe, had been the cause of the enormous Mountain physiques. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe years of quarrying, blasting, chhiseling, drilling, delving and splitting rock and stone had grown them impressive muscles, and the mining, shoring, shoveling and blasting to bring out coal, metal-ore and precious rocks and metals had grown their immense heights and breadths. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor all their fierce and powerful industry, their strength and raw ability, the people of the Mountain Kingdom knew that no amount of strength, power and size would protect them in the freezing sub-zero temperatures of harshest winter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was for this reason that during wintertime, it was tradition for everyone to mix and mingle, to share shelter, warmth, food, drink and joy with their neighbours, so that they might survive the punishing months that were to come ahead. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Jangle-jangle-jangle-jangle-jangle!!</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come in! Come in! Welcome!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA heavily-tanned young Mountanian entered, accompanied by a pretty, younger teenage girl. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThor, the village blacksmith, and his younger sister, Sapphire, steered their way into the dining-hall where the guests for the Midwinter feast were gathered. Some people were playing musical instruments, other people were dancing. More people were eating and drinking. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was not high-class royal ball. It was a simple country gathering. Villagers, farmers, their wives and children, mingled with the lord who ruled over this small parcel of their glorious monarch's kingdom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis moved among the guests, shaking hands with farmers and wheelwrights, millers, coopers, chandlers and dairy-farmers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good evening, Thor\", said Fortis, when his friend, the blacksmith, entered the dining-hall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThor bowed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good evening, my lord\", he said. He waved his sister forward, \"My sister, my lord\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The beautiful Miss Sapphire...\" said Fortis, grasping her hand and kissing it. \"It's nice to see you\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSapphire blushed! \"T-thank you, my lord!\" she gasped. She turned and went to find Lady Eldonia, while Thor went to greet Fortis's two younger brothers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the corner of the hall near the fireplace, Minerva had been cornered by three towering pillars of village life. The formidable Von Eisenwald Triplets. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Von Eisenwald triplets were three older teenage boys. They were all sixteen, and they were all identical. About seven feet tall, with tanned bodies, long brown hair, and impressive muscles. Their muscles were impressive because they came from a long line of tree-fellers, lumberjacks and carpenters. Their family had run the village sawmill for four generations. And the current batch of Eisenwalds were just as powerfully-built as all the previous ones. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd right now, all three brothers were extremely interested in his lordship's sweet, young, innocent sister. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd Minerva wasn't really able to refuse them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSibling rivalry between the three brothers was strong. They had no sisters of their own, and they were in fierce competition with each other to land any and all of the eligible girls in town. Minerva blushed at the attention that she was given. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Um...You're...very pretty...Lady Minerva...\" said Axelrod. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinerva blushed. \"Thank you Axel...\" she said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C-could we get you a drink?\" Ferrus asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well uh...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perhaps you'd like some wine? Or some of our aged brandy?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you Augustus...but some chilled raspberry cordial will be fine\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes ma'am...I'll go get some for you...\"<br>\r\n\"I'll do it!\"<br>\r\n\"I'LL do it!\" <br>\r\n\"You and what army!?\"<br>\r\n\"THESE ARMIES!\" <br>\r\n\"You call those armies? They're TWIGS!\" <br>\r\n\"They ain't any smaller than YOUR twigs!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinerva sighed. She left the three hyper-competitive lumberjack brothers and went to help herself to the cordial on the sideboard. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As everyone sat down to eat, a plump, Fatlantean man wearing a monkish habit entered the dining-hall, ringing a bell. Better-known for their charity than most Mountanians, who believed in hard work and personal strength, an abbey existed on the Mountanian-Fatlantean border a few miles away. Trudging through the snow, the children, orphans who lived at the abbey, had accompanied the monks and nuns and the abbot to the lord's castle for the midwinter feast. Everyone watched as an ancient ceremony was played out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe abbey and its order, just like Castle Vanderstorm, had existed since the dawn of time...almost. And every year in deepest, darkest midwinter, the lord of the manor gave charity and alms to the poor folk of the abbey. This was not the only time of the year, of course, but it was the most important, because of the harsh and unforgiving winter weather. Some lords gave more. Clothes, cloth and tools. Others gave less. Loaves of bread and jars of honey. But they always gave something. To give nothing at all was unheard of! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis had already donated all their old clothes to the abbey. And he didn't have any tools or equipment to spare. So instead, he gave the children a treat of candy and special foods. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe abbot approached the high table and, hands joined within the wide sleeves of his robes, he bowed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I, the Abbot of the Ancient and Noble Abbey of Rockford, do humbly beseech thee, Lord Vanderstorm, Earl, and overlord of these lands in his majesty's Kingdom of Mountania, to give us charity this dark midwinter\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone watched as Fortis stood up to give the ceremonial reply. He stepped around the table and stood in front of the abbot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good Father Abbot, the brethren and sisters of thy ancient and noble order give much to the unfortunates and drifters of our community, for which we are all of us, most grateful...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a general murmuring of agreement amongst the party-guests. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone stared at Eldonia. She blushed, but she wasn't able to do it! She'd rehearsed her part in this ceremony a dozen times...but...she'd gotten stage-fright! What if she messed up her lines!? Lady Athena smiled understandingly. She had done this plenty of times when her own husband had been lord of the manor, and had filled in for her son when his own wife had died. She supposed it would make no difference, if now, she filled in...again...for her grandson. She got up and shuffled forwards, her walking stick clicking steadily on the floor as she came forwards. She didn't need to read the words of the ancient ceremony, inscribed on an old parchment. She'd done this so many times she knew the words by heart. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"His lordship and I duly recognise the great deeds of kindness and mercy which your order hath done. Send forth your needy, so that they might receive the charity of their liege lord, this bleak midwinter eve\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crowd clapped and then fell silent. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStacked in front of the high table were small baskets, each one filled with candy, chocolates and cookies, and a few other tokens, like gold coins, silver coins, or a simple toy of some description. Fortis stood next to the pile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn orphan from the abbey would step forwards. As he or she advanced, Athena would pick up a basket and hand it to her grandson, who would pass it to the child in question. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n...or that was how it was supposed to happen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOld lord Vanderstorm had not been so tall. Or muscular. Or young. Or dark. Or so impressively vast and broad in the chest and shoulders...or so incredibly intimidating!! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go along, Samuel...\" said the abbot, to a waif of a child who was barely four years old! He was almost microscopic compared to the towering mountain lord, and as he got closer and closer, his confidence deserted him! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!!!AHAHAHAAHAHA!! WAAAAAAAAH!!\" </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hall echoed with the soft sniffling sobs, and a few snickers and giggles from the party-guests, swiftly silenced by sympathetic \"Shush!\"es. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA sister of the order rushed forwards. She was a pretty young thing in her twenties. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There now Sammy...\" she whispered, and hugged him, \"It's alright...What's the matter?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy sniffled and sobbed. He whispered something into her ear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's that?\" she said, \"I can't hear you over your sniffling, sweetie!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dah big skawey man's gonna EAT ME!!!!!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crowd in the dining-hall burst out laughing now, even louder than before! This only made Sammy cry even more!! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shhh! I'll come with you...\" said the sister. She took the mite's hand and walked him up towards Lord Fortis. The boy was terrified and hid behind the sister's skirts! He peeked out between the folds of cloth, wet, wide eyes staring up in fright. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well hello, young man\", said Fortis. His deep, heavy voice echoing through the chamber, which was now devoid of laughter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy sniffled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what's your name?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-s-s-S-sammul...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My lord...\" the sister whispered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My lord Sammul...I mean...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crowd, and some of the older orphans, laughed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's very nice to meet you, Samuel. Have you been a good boy this year?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yessir m'lord, sir...\" the boy said, so softly that not even an ant could hear him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well that's very good to hear\", said Fortis. He held the basket out. \"This is for you\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy bowed, mumbled something in reply, and scuttled off to a table in the corner, where the orphans gathered for their midwinter feast. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, the next child came up. Twins, actually. A boy and a girl. Brother and sister. Both seven years old. They walked towards the towering mountain lord, and bowed and curtsied. They gave him their names, and their solemn assurances that they had been good. And Fortis gave them each a basket of candy and coins. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, my lord!\" they said. They bowed and curtsied again, and went to their table. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn ones and twos, the orphans came forward, now that they realised that there was nothing to fear from the gigantic new Mountain lord. Fortis hugged some of the boys, and kissed a few of the girls and pinched them and patted them playfully, and some people smiled and waved. Once they had all received their presents, and the gift-giving ceremony was over, a gong sounded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ladies and gentlemen. You have up to now, been feasting on canapes and snacks\", Fortis said. \"I invite you all to stay with us for the main event. Our midwinter feast! Mrs. Tibbs!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe housekeeper entered, along with the maids and servant-boys, bearing plates and bowls of food. Then, Cannius and Jupiter staggered in! Between them, they carried an enormous, crispy, bloated roast hog! A gigantic Fatlantean swine that had been fattened up to thousands of pounds in weight! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone clapped and cheered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The hog has been donated by our good friends from south of the border\", Fortis said. \"I hope you all enjoy our feast and eat heartily this evening!\" </span></div></div>",

A few screams echoed around. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinerva and Axelrod turned! She could see Eldonia, Jupiter and Cannius both staring at something and helping someone to his feet!

You couldn't even walk properly!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whaddi paw dawn mah fuckin' froat's mawn bissness!\" Fortis slurred. He was obviously still extremely drunk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fortis! You should know better than that!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"FUCK IT!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fortis! Don't you dare talk to me like that!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you!? Gwamma!?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm your SISTER!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooooh...Fuck it! Why's erryvun tryin' ter teller me whadda do...Is wan day a year...is not da...*hic!*...Endda da wurld...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fortis the way you were acting...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dah way's I was actin'!?...Fuck...You's seen how's you was actin'!?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What ABOUT how I was acting!?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You's...caryin'yon wiv daht...daht...EisenvonWald guy....\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What...we were TALKING, Fortis! it's not like he pressed me against a wall and kissed me!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YOU KEEP OFF OF HIM!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll mingle with who I wish! Besides! It was nothing serious! And even if it was, I'd like to have seen what you would've done! You were so drunk you couldn't hardly sit down without falling over first!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HE'S A FUCKIN'...f-f-FARMHAND! You're a LADY! You don't mix wi-wi-with...SHIT like that...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you're supposed to be lord of his majesty's land in this part of his kingdom! Some lord you are to get drunk and make a scene everywhere!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AH SHADDUP!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinerva squealed! She felt a sharp, unfamiliar stinging sensation as a heavy, rough hand struck her across the face! It took her a minute to understand what had happened! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe burst into tears! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YOU COMIN' UP HERE AN' T-TELLIN' ME...A-ALL THIS SHIT!...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDownstairs, the conversation was interrupted by the muffled shouting upstairs. Wolfgang sighed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll be back in a minute, granny\", he said to Lady Athena. \"I wanna see what on earth all that yelling is about...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe older Vanderstorm male headed upstairs. He opened the bedroom door to Fortis's private suite. He watched as Fortis smacked his sister hard across the face! Minerva shriekd, yelped and burst into tears! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"FORTIS!\" Wolfgang shouted, \"Don't you DARE hit your sister like that!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinerva regained her composure quickly. \"He's drunk!\" she said hotly, \"He doesn't know what he's doing! And he should be sleeping it off!\" she said even more firmly. Wolfgang nodded in agreement. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mon cousin!\" he said, \"Lie down, and sleep\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't wanna fuckin'...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"SLEEP!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWolfgang swung a heavy fist through the air! It connected with the side of Fortis's head, knocking him out cold! Fortis toppled back and slumped into bed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry Forty, old buddy, but it's for your own good\", said Wolfgang, \"Hey girl! Help me tuck him in\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinerva tucked Fortis into bed, clucking to herself and shaking her head disapprovingly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Frost formed on the windows and snow blanketed the Mountanian countryside. Outside, the woods and trees were quiet. All the birds had flown south for the winter, probably settling in Lucia, or southern Fatlantis. In the ancient stronghold of Castle Vanderstorm, the only signs of life were a couple of smoking chimneys. The entire household, up and down, was fast asleep. In the master bedroom, the glorious lord of the land slowly rose from his slumber... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uuuuurggghhh fuuuuck my head...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis groaned. He felt sick, queasy and dizzy. He tried to sit up, but felt so giddy that he just flopped back into bed again, groaning and moaning, his head throbbing and his ears humming. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat a fucking hangover... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis felt around the bed...he was alone...No seductive, teasing missus...no sweet, cuddling sister around...the room was empty. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis groaned. His head was killing him...he wanted something to cuddle...and if there weren't any pretty girls in his bed, then he'd have to go and find a pretty girl and get into HER bed... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, the dizzy, drunken lord got to his feet. Damn his height...why did the floor have to be so far away...he staggered dizzily forwards, his vision blurred and hazy. He opened his bedroom door and shuffled out. The squeaking of the hinges sliced into his ears like screeching eagles. He heard the soft 'ding!...ding!...ding!...ding!...ding!...' of the clock downstairs. Five in the morning...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis lumbered heavily down the corridor, leaning against the wall every step of the way. He pushed open a door and shuffled inside. He closed the door none-too-quietly, and slumped into the bed next to it. The bed was nowhere near large enough for a giant of his physique, and he had to curl up to fit in. Not that he really mattered...he was more interested in curling up around the pretty young thing already wrapped up in the sheets, than he was in stretching out and trying to sleep. He wrapped his arms around the girl in the bed and drew her in, squeezing her tight, wrapping his legs around her waist and binding her firmly to his body. He rubbed his stubbled chin against her head, playfully, and gave her a kiss... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinerva yawned...then she felt the arms and legs around her...and the rough scraping and the kissing...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe giggled. \"Forty...Forty!!...Forty get out of my bed!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinerva suddenly started kicking! With surprising ease, she dislodged her brother from her bed, who flopped onto the floor! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-what the...hey...whussa matter girl...I thought you like me sleepin' wit'choo...all warm and snuggly in win'nner...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis got to his feet and stared at his sister. But then he spotted the black eye. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-h-Hey...w-who did that!?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YOU did!' <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehehe...what? I...I wouldn't do that...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinerva glared at her brother and sighed, \"You really don't remember, do you?\" she asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? Remember what?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinerva told her brother, shortly, about what had happened last night. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis groaned, \"Aww girl...\" he said. \"I'm sorry...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinerva crossed her arms and shook her head. \"Humph! I never saw anything so disgraceful!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Girl!...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"MINERVA!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis groaned. Sister must be REALLY pissed off. As long as he'd known her, he'd always called her 'Girl', and she'd never complained about it...until today. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's the matter?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YOU HIT ME! And Wolfgang saw it! And you're so drunk you didn't remember ANYTHING!?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinerva burst into tears! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I thought my brother was nicer than that!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw girl...\" Fortis got on his knees and grasped his sister's hands, \"I'm sorry...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh leave me alone!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!\" said Fortis standing up, \"I'm real sorry, okay!? I didn't mean it! I love you! You know I'd never hurt you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you did!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Girl!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinerva shook her hands out of her brother's grasp, \"Oh just go!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not goin' anywhere! Now come on girl! I'm sorry!...Now let me get in bed with you, okay? You know you like that...It'll make you feel better!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm NOT sharing my bed with a drunk! Not even you!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Girl!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"MINERVA! MINERVA! MINERVA!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine! MINERVA! What...what can I do to make you believe that I ain't gonna hurt you!? You know I'd never do that!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You could stop drinking!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis paused, but then he laughed, \"No seriously...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"SERIOUSLY!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No I can't!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! Honey I have to drink something!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Drink water!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Water ain't got no kick to it, gir--Minerva...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fortis...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I tell you what. I promise to drink proper and responsible so's i don't make you upset no more, okay?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinerva sighed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mon! Gimme a break, girl! It was an accident!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooh alright...But you gotta do it properly!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis raised his right hand and placed his left fist over his heart. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I, Fortis Vanderstorm, Earl, Lord of this esate and the lands surrounding it, do, in the presence of my sister, the cutest, most adorable, sweetest, and most forgiving...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't push your luck, brother...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...do solemnly swear from this day forth to drink in moderation\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinerva smiled. She kissed him and Fortis sighed. \"Now can I get into bed with you? It's freezing!' <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinerva smiled. She got into bed and moved over and Fotis climbed in after her, wrapping his body around her and giving her a kiss. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jeez you're cold...\" Fortis said. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Eldonia shivered! It was fucking cold outside! She rose from her bed in her frozen bedroom and wondered why it was so damn cold! But then she realised that her fire had gone out. She sighed. It was freezing! She went to the windows and cautiously parted the curtains. It was white everywhere outside. She touched her hand to the glass. Yeek!! Thor's sledgehammer! That was freezing! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeciding that she needed some warmth, Eldonia went to seek out her husband. She had not heard all the commotion from last night, as she had been lazing in her bath, and had no clear idea of Fortis's current condition. She entered the master bedroom, took in the mangled sheets, and determined that he wasn't there. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere else would that lumbering brute go? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe checked on the nursery. Baby Leo was curled up with Baby Astrid, both babies slumbering in the same crib. The guestroom was filled with Wolfgang, his vast form wrapped around his wife, whom he snuggled protectively. She kicked and fidgeted slightly and Wolfgang drew her into a tight, warm embrace... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia decided that was what SHE wanted!...But first, she would have to find her husband! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe closed the doors to the guestroom and frowned. Where else would he be?? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nthen she remembered Minerva's room. She opened the door and tiptoed inside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere he was, curled up around his sister. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia slipped onto Minerva's bed and snuggled up under the covers, and sidled up over to her husband's broad, muscular back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinerva's bed was not designed for this. Most mountanian women, even those who had...enjoyed the company...of the largest of Mountain men...rarely grew taller than about seven and a half feet. In fact, the average height for tall women was about six foot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bed was designed for a woman. It was about eight feet long...long enough for even the tallest of Mountanian women to stretch out and luxuriate under the covers. But it was nowhere near large enough for a full-grown Mountain lord! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven with his body curled up, Fortis's large feet still kicked the bottom of the bedstead. And he took up so much space that there was almost no space left for Eldonia! But she managed... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe snuggled up against her husband and slipped an arm underneath his shoulder....then hugged him. Her hands reached right down, playfully caressing and pinching his round, tight buttocks...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, she felt a sharp, stinging \"smack!' on her behind! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are such a naughty girl touchin' a married man like that...\" said a heavy, deep voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why Forty...\" Eldonia teased. Fortis rolled over and pinned his wife deep into the mattress. \"Good morning, then\", Fortis said huskily. Eldonia shuddered...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinerva yawned. \"F-forty...i-if you're...gonna...do the...do...THINGS...to her...do it somewhere else...\" Minerva said sleepily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y'know girl, that's not a bad idea...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Minerva was wide awake! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What!? I...ELDONIA!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis and Eldonia burst out laughing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh get OUT! Both of you!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis laughed and kissed his sister, \"Yes ma'am\", he said. He scooped up his squealing wife, and carried her off out of the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Revolting!\" Minerva grumbled, as Eldonia pulled the doors shut behind them as she and her husband left the room. </span></div></div>",

Her feet tapped out the rhythm lively as her hands swung her skirts around her legs.  The three Von Eisenwald brothers were dancing in a close circle around her.  They crept in closer and closer until one of them grasped her around the waist, hauled her up and around, and set her back on her feet.  He smiled at her dazzlingly before giving her a sound kiss on the lips.  Then, she was swept off to be spun around in a circle by the next brother.  They all three kept spinning her around and kissing her, making her laugh and smile in delight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, though, the song ended, and Axelrod, Ferrus, and Augustus bowed to her gallantly.  Then, in their bowed position, they slowly stepped back away from her, as did the rest of the people on the dance floor.  The crowds parted, and a tall, blond figure moved forward confidently.  Minerva smiled shyly and curtsied when the tall boy stopped in front of her and bowed.  He took her hand in his and kissed the air above it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You dance divinely, Lady Minerva,\" he said in a low voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinerva gulped and blushed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you have room on your dance card for me?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I always have room on my dance card for you, Prince Cassius.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe smiled brightly at her, then took her hand to place it on his shoulder.  He placed one hand on her waist and held her free hand tightly in his other hand.  Magically, the musicians began a slow waltz, and Cassius slowly began to lead Minerva in a well-practiced, elegant dance.  Minerva felt like she was floating, safe and warm in Cassius's regal embrace.  She sighed and rested her head on his well-muscled chest, enjoying the strong beat of his heart under her cheek.  She smiled as she felt him shudder and stumble his steps a bit at her bold move.  His heart began beating a bit faster, too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, she felt both of his arms come around her to hold her gently but closely too him as they slowed to a gentle swaying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Minerva,\" he murmured, and she felt him place a kiss on her hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe snuggled into his warm and comfortable embrace, feeling safe and content in his arms.  He continued placing kisses on her hair, drifting lower to her forehead, and then around to her ear.  He licked a warm stripe on the shell of her ear, making her shiver before gently biting it with his teeth.  However, he then kept biting at her ear, nibbling at it over and over, until a harder nibble had her frowning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Prince Cassius, what are you...?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn her sleep, Minerva batted her hand at her ear, only to have her hand encounter a large, soft, furry object.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was suddenly awake, screaming!  She sat up quickly, flinging her arm at the thing that had been nibbling on her ear!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AAAAHHH!  BUTTERSCOTCH!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rabbit, despite being rather fat, had easily ducked under Minerva's flailing arm and had hopped a bit to the other side of her bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinerva put a hand to her pounding heart.  \"You silly rabbit!  You scared me to death!  That's not very nice, you know:  nibbling on someone's ear when they're asleep!  And you interrupted a really nice dream I was having, too!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nButterscotch, his ears drooped sadly behind his head, hesitantly hopped back towards her, twitching his whiskers as if asking for forgiveness, his large, innocent eyes looking contrite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww,\" Minerva said, holding her arms out to the rabbit, \"it's okay, buddy.  Come here, all's forgiven.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nButterscotch willingly went back into Minerva's arms, luxuriating in the warm snuggles she gave him.  However, after a minute or two of cuddling, Butterscotch wriggled in her arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, then.  Enough snuggles for now, I guess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLetting the bunny down on the floor, Minerva yawned and stretched her arms over her head.  What time was it, anyway?  Minerva checked her mantle clock across the room and groaned.  It was still much too early to be up yet!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe snuggled back down in her warm bed, intent on getting another hour or two of sleep.  However, just as she got comfortable again, that nibbling was back at her ear!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Butterscotch!\" she moaned, batting at the rabbit again.  \"Leave me alone!  It's still sleeping time for me!  Go bug someone else.  Please?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, this time, the nibbling was more insistent, and a particularly hard bite had her biting back a curse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OW!  Butterscotch!  That really hurt!  Stop it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time, when she sat up, Butterscotch's demeanor didn't seem quite so easy-going or laid-back.  He hopped a little ways across the bed, then stopped back to look at her, twitching his whiskers and rubbing his front paws together.  He then hopped a little further, stopped, and looked back at her again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" she groaned.  \"Did you want me to follow you or something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nButterscotch then hopped off the bed and slowly made his way across the room to the slightly open door to her room.  There, he stopped to look at her again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, fine,\" she sighed, slipping out of bed, shrugging on her dressing gown, slipping her feet into her warm houseshoes, lighting a candle, and following the rabbit out of her room and down the hall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nButterscotch led her all the way downstairs and into the scullery.  Minerva wrinkled her nose.  The scullery smelled funny.  It smelled more like the barn or something and rather unpleasant.  Then, she looked over to the corner Butterscotch hopped to.  A ragged old blanket was all wadded up there, and Chocolate (the name Katie and Lucy had decided on for the dark female rabbit Butterscotch had brought back with him) was lying on it, her chubby torso heaving up and down rapidly.  Butterscotch hopped up to Chocolate and rubbed his nose on hers, then glanced back up at Minerva.  Minerva crept closer, wondering what was going on.  Was Chocolate ill or something?  However, when Minerva got close enough, she put a hand to her mouth and gasped.  Then, she smiled and cooed in delight.  Two tiny little furry lumps were lying behind Chocolate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh!  Chocolate, you're a Momma!  So, that's what you were getting me for, Butterscotch!  I wonder how many babies you're gonna have, Chocolate?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThinking that Lucy and Katie would hate to miss out on seeing baby rabbits being born, MInerva got up and hurried towards the door of the scullery.  She turned back right before she left to say, \"Don't worry, Butterscotch!  I'll be right back!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinerva hurried to the servants' quarters and found Katie's and Lucy's room.  She easily woke both girls, explaining the situation, and both girls excitedly leapt out of bed to see Butterscotch's and Chocolate's kits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awww...they're so tiny and cute!\" Lucy marveled as she and Katie knelt down reverently before the ratty birthing blanket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.  Miss Minnie, do you think we can hold them?\" asked Katie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, I'm not sure.  I don't think so quite yet,\" Minerva said.  She wasn't any kind of an expert on animals, but she didn't think Momma's liked their babies being taken away from them too soon.  \"Maybe when the babies are a bit older.  Let's let Chocolate and Butterscotch enjoy and take care of them for now, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatie pouted but said, \"Alright.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wonder how many kittens she's gonna have?\" Katie wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, she's had four so far,\" said Lucy, \"and the kittens are so small, and her tummy was so big and round....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter another half hour, Chocolate had a total of eight little mewling kittens moving about her, wobbling around on unsteady little limbs.  She licked them all clean and brought each one up to a teat to suckle.

Come and have a look!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two girls went into the kitchen and into the warmth of the scullery. Katie and Lucy were on their hands and knees, playing with the bunny-rabbits and stroking them, feeding them milk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awww they're so CUTE!\" said Eldonia, \"Oh we should keep them! I bet Leo would LOVE to have a bunny all of his own!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He ain't havin' no bunny! He's gonna be havin' a dog, or a horse, or a dragon or somethin' worth havin'!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis had entered the scullery. \"We can't keep the rabbits\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two servant-girls stared at their master. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But they're babies!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We can't keep them! Once they're grown enough, they'll have to leave!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But they're CUTE!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I DON'T CARE IF THEY GROW FEATHERS OF GOLD! THEY AIN'T STAYIN' HERE!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two young servant-girls stared at Fortis with shock! They knew that their master was a rough and tumble character with a brash personality, but they didn't think he was heartless! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey burst into tears! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh now LOOK what you did!\" said Eldonia, \"Those girls are very attached to the bunnies!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eldonia just TWO rabbits ate up my entire vegetable garden! If we have TEN rabbits, they'll uproot the whole damn forest! We CANNOT KEEP THEM ALL!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt once, Fortis realised he'd made a mistake. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How many can we keep?\" Katie asked. Fortis opened his mouth...and said nothing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn it!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia and Minerva burst out laughing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, try and talk your way out of THAT hole, big man!\" said Eldonia, poking her husband in the chest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...You girls can keep the two big ones. And one small one. Leo can keep one. That's four in the house. That's more than enough! Perhaps Wolfgang might like one\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WOLFGANG!?\" said Minerva. She laughed, \"Wolfgang isn't the kind of person who plays with bunnies, Fortis!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not HIM you sponge-brained oaf! He's got two kids, doesn't he!?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah...\" said Minerva, blushing at her mistake. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They might make a good present if they have one or two\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about the rest?\" Lucy asked, \"That only makes...\" she counted...\"Five! There's still five more!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They'll have to be sold\", said Fortis. \"We could give a couple to the orphans at the Abbey, they might like some pets. But the others will just have to be sold!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls looked VERY upset. Fortis sighed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen girls!\" he said, \"They're REAL cute, but these are Fatlantean Forest-Lopers. They eat and eat and eat and eat! We'd never be able to feed them all! They'd be better off with other people who can feed them like they should be!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls sniffed. Lucy hugged Fortis. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pwommis?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I promise!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Okay...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis hugged the two servant-girls. \"Now, they can stay here for a few months, but once they're ready to go, we gotta let them go!\" </span></div></div>",

You want to die of pneumonia, young man!?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a scene of complete opposites. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis stood on the landing while his diminutive grandmother lectured him about the importance of good health. She walked around him, clucking and grumbling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Grandma, it's just a little cough!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's nothing of the sort! Now you go and sleep! And lie down!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not tired!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NOW!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis grumbled and stalked off to his bedroom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinerva closed her bedroom door as her brother passed, and opened her closet. She pulled something out, wrapped in paper, and left her room, carrying the package down the corridor into Fortis's bedroom. Fortis sat in bed, drinking hot, medicated sweet tea. He smiled weakly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey girl\", he said hoarsely. Minerva smiled and approached her brother. She held the enormous package in her hands. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is for you!\" she said, and handed him the package. Fortis smiled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is this my yuletime present?\" he asked. She nodded. Fortis ripped the paper off and looked at what was contained within. It was a dark, rich red fabric, soft and smooth, with gold and silk and large, shiny brass buttons here and there. He frowned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhhh...It's nice!\" he said, trying to find something positive to say. \"Um...what is it?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a dressing-gown!\" said Minerva. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis stared at the mess of fabric with skepticism. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinerva sighed, \"Get out of bed and see!\" she said. Fortis chuckled. He got out of bed and stood up. He shook the whole thing out in front of him. Now he could see the robe in its entirety. It was about nine and a half feet long, and was a deep, rich mauve color, with gold-thread buttonholes, cuffs and collar, gold-edged pockets, and a large, gold-coloured cloth rope around the middle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooh...\" he said. \"Huh...\" Fortis mumbled. \"Interesting\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well try it on!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis pulled the robe on. It was thick and warm and soft, lined with silk all over, and was surprisingly comfortable. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh...\" he said, staring at himself in the mirror. It fit his arms, his shoulders, chest, back, and around the front, and it went right down to his ankles. Fortis pulled the robe shut around the front and held it closed with two buttons and the cloth belt. The robe came with three, silk-lined pockets, two down by his sides, and one breast-pocket up around his chest. Fortis nodded. There was even a matching maroon and gold nightcap to go with it! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh...\" he said. \"Not bad...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you like it?\" Minerva asked, anxiously. Fortis nodded, \"It's good, girl...thanks!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinerva beamed, \"Granny helped me make it\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did you know my measurements so good?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you spend so much time cuddling me...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinerva hugged her brother, \"Get better soon!\" she said, and left the room. Minerva wasn't about to admit to her brother that she had actually stolen some of his clothes to get the measurements right, without him knowing! </span></div></div>",

It was lined with gold satin edges on the cuffs, hems, collar, edges and pocket-tops. It had a deep mauve silk lining inside, and a nice, warm cap on top, and a beautiful dark gold tassled belt around the middle, with gold-satin belt-loops. Fortis was surprised that his sister could make something so beautiful. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then...Minerva was a one of the kind sorta girl. She was light, delicate, soft, incredibly sweet and beautiful...perhaps it stood to reason that she could therefore make such beautiful things with those delicate, smooth hands. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGee she was pretty... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis wrapped himself up in the gown. It was really warm and snugly! He climbed back into bed and laid down, examining the stitching. It was both strong and extremely fine and neat. He suspected that granny had told Minerva to double or even triple-stitch all the seams against his gigantic, super-muscles...Fortis tested the seams by flexing his arms. He laughed. Boy this thing was great! He snuggled down in bed, deciding to sleep wearing the gown. It was so warm and fluffy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis blew out the candles and yawned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he lay in bed, Fortis never noticed his bedroom door swing slowly open. The lock had been broken for a while, and he hadn't bothered to fix it yet...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Hop!...Hop!...Hop!...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis yawned. He groaned. Stupid...blocked...nose! He reached for a handkerchief and blew hard!...Ooooh that was better... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Hop!...Hop!...Hop!...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmmm...mmmmm...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis groaned. He couldn't sleep...He was so used to cuddling something when he slept. Usually, that something was his sister. Lately, it had become his wife. And when she was unavailable, then it was the baby. Either way, Fortis was used to having something in his arms when he went to bed. But with his cold, grandmother had insisted that not even...in fact...ESPECIALLY not the baby...was to be allowed into his arms until he was better. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Bounce!</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis rolled over. Sitting on his bed, waggling its ears was a fat, fluffy bunny with black, white and caramel-brown splotches of fur everywhere. He smiled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awww...Hey bunny...C'mere...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis hugged the bunny. He guessed this little rodent would do for the night's sleeping companion...It was soft and warm and fluffy and cuddly, and by the way it fidgeted, nibbled and nuzzled...extremely affectionate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis kissed the rabbit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"G'night little fellah...\" </span></div></div>",

Not since he moved south to Regis City. He was supposed to be on his way home to spend the winter holidays with his family...and...got stuck...spending the winter holidays...with his family. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe ran his hands along the tables, chair-backs and the sideboard in the dining-room, he looked at the portraits, and at the ceremonial suits of antique armor that hung in beautiful glass display-cases. He looked at the medal-case which showed off all the ribbons and decorations won by Vanderstorm men over the generations. Lying at the bottom of the latest column of prizes was a gold, and purple ribbon and medal. The king's medallion for valor. Fortis's decoration for his war-service. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWolfgang was so lost in his own thoughts, he hardly noticed the doors to the kitchen open up ever so slightly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eliza! There's a man in the dining room!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's always men in the dining-room, Lucy! Go back to scrubbing those pots!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a BIG man!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're all big in this family\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow he is big!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Katie, you too!

He's much too old for you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well who is he?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah Eliza! Who is he?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's Lord Wolfgang. He's the earl's older cousin. He's thirty-something...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What a giant!...Look at his arms...and his chest...and those hands!...Eliza, could you imagine all that...wrapped around you...tight and strong..safe and secure and warm...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure Rachel. You're thinking about his arms and ONLY his arms...suuuure...He is too old for you! You're only sixteen!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're only eighteen! Gosh he has beautiful hair...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWolfgang turned to face the kitchen door. It slammed shut as the girls quickly retreated! They were backing down the service-corridor when it opened and Lord Wolfgang entered. The two younger girls squealed! Wolfgang was even taller than Fortis! Not much bigger in size, but certainly taller, and certainly older! A hulking beast of Mountain nobility. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well hey there\", he said in a heavy, deep voice, \"You must all be the house-girls...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEliza, the oldest, curtsied, \"Good eve...af...good morning...My lord Wolfgang\", she said. \"Will you be staying with us long?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh a couple of days, until this weather clears\". He pointed outside to the swirling snow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEliza stared at the older, taller, larger mountain lord. He was just like Fortis...only older...with darker-tanned skin and brown-blond lion's mane hair and heavier stubble. Like some kind of wild animal...ready to pounce...and...do...stuff...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will you girls go back to the kitchen!? We got lunch to be preparing!\" Eliza said, waving the other girls away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the two of them alone, Eliza sized up Wolfgang. She didn't dare try to lay a hand on the earl. He was married with a son, and he had his reputation and the money and the house and land, and his sister, his grandmother, and his two brothers...Eliza didn't want to ruin all that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Lord Wolfgang was older, larger, stronger...and had a rugged, masculine handsomeness around him...She moved closer and wrapped her arms around his waist...the highest part of his body that she could comfortably reach...and stared up at him. Wolfgang laughed nervously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well now...\" he said. </span></div></div>",

Fortis, not knowing what else to do, closed the curtains back around his bed and drew his sister back with him to the head of the bed.  He drew the covers around them both and held his sister close in his arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There, there, now,\" he said haltingly, uncertain exactly what to do.   While his sister had always seemed delicate and small, she wasn't much of a crier.  She was made of sterner stuff.  However, given what she had gone through yesterday....  Fortis gritted his teeth and clenched his fists angrily behind Minerva's small back.  He'd very much like to kill that Lord--well, Mister now--Vergallen with his bare hands!  In his mind, the older man didn't deserve to live!  He had disobeyed one of the most sacred oaths of chivalry and nobility in Mountania.  ALL Earls, Dukes, Marquesses, Barons, Squires, Knights, etc., swore before the King to serve and protect the fairer sex.  For the former Lord Vergallen to take advantage of a girl less than half his age in the way he had....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis quickly curbed his thoughts when he realized he had begun to crush his sister in his arms in his anger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're gonna be okay, now.  I'll make sure nothin' happens to you again,\" he said gruffly into his sister's ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinerva looked up, her face streaked with tears, and Fortis wanted to commit murder all over again.  \"H-how do you know that?\" she hiccuped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because I won't let ya outta my sight when we're out and about ever again!  When you're here in the house, I'll always make sure someone else is here with you.  It's my duty to protect you and keep you safe.  It's my fault for what happened to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinerva shook her head minutely.  \"It...It's not your fault, Forty.  It's...It's mine for being too weak!  I can't even fall asleep without seeing him again in my mind....f-forcing me...and...and....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sh, sh, sh!\" Fortis murmured as Minerva began sobbing again.  He rocked her back and forth in his arms, muttering nonsense words to try and soothe her.  Eventually, her breathing evened out and her body became limp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis sighed and laid his sister out carefully on the bed, drawing the covers up and tucking them securely around her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis clenched his jaw and got up.  He was too riled up to sleep just yet.  He went over to the fireplace, laying some more logs on top and angrily jabbing the poker in the hot coals until a blazing fire was roaring.  He wanted to make sure his sister was warm enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, Fortis began to pace the length and breadth of his bedchamber, his thoughts in a whirl.  Minerva had always represented to him everything that was sweet and good and innocent and wonderful in the world.  She was kind and good-hearted, eager to laugh and compassionate.  She was spunky, too, and wasn't afraid to stand up to him when she needed to.  And that blasted Vergallen stole all that away from her!  He introduced her to the ways of men and women in the most heinous way possible!  Fortis had a real situation upon his hands now.  Even though Minerva was still young--much too young in his mind--it won't be too much longer and she'd be eligible for marriage.  Eldonia, his own wife, isn't much older than his sister.  However, what young nobleman--for nothing less than an earl or an heir to an earldom would he even consider for his sister when the time came--would want his sister since she wasn't a virgin anymore?  While Mountanians in general were more open to a little promiscuity than their surrounding neighboring countries, a woman was still generally expected to have been untouched when she came to her wedding night.  Granted, his own wife hadn't been so, but she had only slept with him, and she was a virgin the first time he took her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis gritted his teeth and stomped over to his window, throwing it open and breathing deeply of the night air.  He didn't relish the thought of anyone touching his sister in such an intimate fashion.  Nor did he want to think of her marrying anyone until she was at least twenty!  However, he knew she fancied the Crown Prince, who seemed to return her affection.  Would Prince Cassius still be interested in her, despite knowing she was...\"soiled goods\"?  Fortis slammed his fist on the window sill, making the wood splinter and crack.  His sister was NOT soiled goods!  However, he knew others would consider her such!  At least Vergallen didn't have a chance to spill his seed inside her!  About the only fortunate thing in this whole awful situation was the fact that his poor sister didn't have to deal with the indignity of bearing the product of her rape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis sighed and turned back to his bed.  He saw through a crack in the bed curtains that Minerva was curled up like a baby, her poor body trembling as tears slowly rolled down her cheeks in her sleep.  Was she having another nightmare?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis closed the window so his sister didn't get too chilled, then climbed back into bed.  He made sure his favorite dirk was underneath his pillow and his loaded pistol was in the drawer in his bedside table before curling up around his sister and holding her close to his body.  Her trembling ceased almost instantly, and she fell into an easier sleep, apparently recognizing the protective embrace of her brother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis would protect her with his very life and make sure that NO ONE ever hurt her or took advantage of her again!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith such thoughts going through his head, it was hard for Fortis to fall asleep, despite the fact that his body was tired after their long day of travel.  However, he eventually succumbed to an uneasy sleep.</span></div></div>",

She twisted around and remembered what had happened last night. Her brother towered over her. He smiled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey girl!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sighed. \"Morning...\" she mumbled. She got out of bed and went to wash up. She left the room and headed downstairs. That was when she felt something grab her and lift her off her feet! <br>\r\nack and <br>\r\n\"Pretty girls shouldn't walk down stairs. They might trip on those cute little dresses and hurt themselves...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis carried his sister downstairs...then past the stairs...then down the corridor...and then into the dining-hall for breakfast. She smiled. Fortis always did get a kick out of showing off his strength, hardly an uncommon thing with Mountanian males. She walked over to the breakfast-buffet and began selecting her breakfast-items from the dishes on display. She carried them back to the table and sat down. She reached for a knife and began dabbling butter onto her toast. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, hey!\" Fortis said, moving closer, \"Shouldn't do that. You might cut yourself...Here let me do it...\" He took the knife and began rapidly buttering her toast for her. Minerva stared at Fortis...He'd NEVER offered to do THIS before! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe'd also never offered to cut up her sausages. Or crack open her boiled eggs. He'd also never offered to pour the jug of syrup over her waffles. Eldonia entered the dining-room for breakfast. She had stepped into the room just as Fortis bent over his sister, to blow on her porridge! She stopped short and stared at the bizarre scene. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...\" she began, unsure of what to say! \"Wh...what's...uh...\" she was lost for words! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fortis is protecting me from the hidden dangers of breakfast...I think...\" Minerva said, trying to laugh off her brother's strange behavior. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...right...\" said Eldonia, still not entirely convinced. She went to get the coffee. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis's behaviour continued to be strange throughout breakfast. Whenever Minerva picked up her knife...or fork...he made some sort of movement or adjustment to whatever she was doing. He wouldn't even let her put sugar in her tea by herself, claiming that he'd never forgive himself if the sugar-tongs accidentally snipped off one of her fingers by accident! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow Minerva, you got him feeding out of your hand...How do I do that?\" Eldonia whispered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't want to know...\" Minerva mumbled back. </span></div></div>",

Lord Vergallen threw Minerva aside and got to his feet. He tried to fight the youth with the sword, but he was too quick on his feet and fast with his hands! The older lord grabbed down a sword hanging over the fireplace, and by the light of the flames, Minerva watched as her youthful saviour and her older aggressor fought back and forth! The clash and screech and scrape of steel echoed through the room! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinerva backed into the side-room where her maid, Penny, screamed in horror, and immediately tried to clean up the mess of bruises on Minerva's face! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe huge, four-poster bed rocked and shook as Lord Vergallen hit it hard! Minerva watched as her gallant savior, Prince Cassius, no-less, fought off the older, taller, stronger man. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile there was no denying these differences, there was also no denying the fact that Cassius was younger, faster and lighter. He could not, perhaps, produce the powerful, shattering blows that someone of Fortis's size and strength could produce, but he was able to zip around his larger, more cumbersome opponents and strike them where they weren't able to reach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fight moved around the room until it spilled out into the corridor! People emerging from their bedrooms screamed and ducked behind doors. Fortis came out swinging! He hadn't brought his sword, but he dealt Lord Vergallen a solid, heavy, driving punch in the face! Taken by total surprise, Lord Vergallen dropped his sword! What ensued was a bloody fist-fight! The two giant Mountain lords beating each other up! Fortis had heard his sister's screams, but he hadn't emerged from his bedroom right away because...well...Eldonia was appreciating his...other...fighting skills... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassius watched as the two older warriors battled it out! Fortis ducked, kicked, punched, grabbed! Fortis got Lord Vergallen into a powerful armlock! Aurelius ducked over, flipping Fortis down a flight of stairs! Women screamed! Fortis crashed into a suit of armor! Lord Vergallen leapt down the stairs! Fortis rose to his feet and grabbed the nearest thing that came to hand! He thrust it forwards as Aurelius reached the bottom and...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWomen screamed and covered their faces in shock! A couple of them had fainted! Two guards rushed forwards to help! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sword that Fortis had picked up from the suit of armour was an unsharpened decorative piece. But the swordpoint was still sharp and pointed. And Aurelius had come barreling down the stairs so fast that he couldn't stop! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, Fortis pulled the blade from Aurelius's chest. The body slumped to the ground. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinerva rushed downstairs and threw her arms around her brother, hugging him and kissing him frantically! Fortis was drenched in sweat and panting hard. He figured he broke a rib falling down the stairs, but he was otherwise alright... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shhhh...\" he whispered. He patted his sister on the back, perhaps more forcefully than he realised, and hugged her. \"Go on back to bed, girl\", he said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinerva turned and saw Prince Cassius. He too was sweaty and exhausted. Everyone gasped as she hugged and kissed him, too! Cassius looked horrified...but then he blushed...and smiled. But then he looked horrified again as Fortis lumbered up to him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice...\" Fortis said, simply. He swung out a huge fist and Cassius met it with his own, in a solid \"thump!\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice...\" Fortis said again. \"You got balls, kid\", he said. Cassius scowled. <i>Kid!?</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very impressive swordwork, son\", King Leviathan said, moving towards them. \"But next time, you really should use a shield as well. Lord Vanderstorm, what do you have to say for yourself?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do I have to say??\" Fortis asked, \"That slimy dog was trying to drill his cock up my sister's hole! I was defending her honour and mine, is what I have to say!\" he snorted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKing Leviathan nodded slowly. \"...Yes\", he said, just as slowly, \"I suppose that is true. Who here will bear witness to the fact of Lord Vanderstorm engaging in defensive combat with Lord Vergallen?\" he shouted, looking at the gaggle of sleepy courtiers and guests up on the landing. At least half a dozen people raised their hands. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe king shrugged. \"That's good enough for me\", he said. \"You men!\" he waved over the two guards nearby, \"Take this away\", he said, indicating the dead body. \"You've done well, Lord Vanderstorm. Your nobility and gallantry show you are well-deserving of all titles and positions which you hold in our glorious kingdom\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis bowed. \"Yes sir\", he said, solidly. \"Thank you, sir\", he said. The king nodded appreciatively. \"Let us retire, then\", he said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone dispersed and started heading back to bed... </span></div></div>",

Fortis nodded, \"You're...you're quick on your feet. That's good. But you could stand to build up your arm-strength. You're no good with a sword if your swings aren't gonna drive back your opponent with force...But you make up for it, I suppose. You're faster than they are, so you can get them where they can't stop ya\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis shrugged a powerful shoulder. He clapped a hand on Cassius's back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice work\", he said. \"And uh...thanks\", he said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks?? What for?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...for...protecting...um...Girl...\" Fortis mumbled. The built Mountain Lord would never admit that protection of his sister for once, had not come from him, but from someone else, who was younger and smaller...but he was trying to! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! You mean...um...Yeah, no problem\", said Cassius. Cassius thought that Minerva was an angel, and wished to spend more time with her, but her overprotective oldest brother, who guarded her like a lion, was always an imposing and dangerous force to be reckoned with. Cassius knew that his status as a royal prince was the only reason why Fortis hadn't physically dragged him off his sister and thrown him down a flight of stairs! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You uh...You like...girl...don'tcha?\" Fortis asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassius blushed. \"Well...yeah...she's very sweet and...special. She's...she's different...Good-different, I mean!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis nodded, finding himself agreeing with everything that Cassius had said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You like spendin' time with her, don'tcha?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeciding that honesty was the best policy, Cassius nodded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good...\" Fortis said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis was extremely attached to his sister. To him, she represented light, and innocent, sweetness, kind-heartedness, tenderness, softness and love. And he would do literally anything to protect her from anything that would drive those qualities away. After two brothers, Fortis was eager to have a sister. Someone he could toy with and protect and love. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen mother died giving birth, Fortis had promised her on her deathbed that he would protect his sister, a promise that he had never broken ever since. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe idea of \"giving his sister away\", so to speak, was very hard for Fortis. He just simply couldn't imagine doing it. Not even for her to have a boyfriend! In his mind, there was no-one good enough for her soft, tender and loving graces. Who would treat her as well as he did. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWas he being selfish? Probably. But it was in his nature to protect her. He sighed long and hard. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know you like her...a lot...\" Fortis said. \"And uh...well...I can see that you...love her and...want to protect her and...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis took a deep breath. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassius gulped when Fortis stopped, and rounded on him, pinning him against the wall, where nobody could see. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You like my sister\", Fortis said. It wasn't a question. It was a statement of fact. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassius nodded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you would like to spend time with her. Lots of time. Hmm?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, Cassius nodded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis took in this information slowly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I grant you that permission to spend time with her. I see that you're protective and well-moraled, which is good\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassius blushed. \"Thank you, my lord\", he said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But hear me good...If you hurt her...if you make her cry...Prince or no prince, I will slice you apart like a smoked ham...Hmm?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassius nodded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good!\" Fortis said. He held out his hand, and Cassius shook it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mon kid, this way...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lord Vanderstorm\", Cassius said. \"I'd appreciate it if you actually called me something OTHER than 'kid'\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well....Prince Cassius, this way\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassius followed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinerva was in her bedroom with her maid tending to her bruises. Cassius and Fortis entered, and she hugged and kissed both of them. Fortis smiled and hugged her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Forty, can you sleep with me tonight?\" Minerva begged. Fortis shook his head. \"Sorry I can't\", he said, \"I have Eldonia here, or did you forget that?\" he said. \"Besides, I'm sure the prince here would much prefer to sleep with you, hmm?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassius blushed, \"It would be my duty to protect you, my lady\", he said, kneeling and kissing Minerva's hand. Minerva gasped and blushed...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"T-thank you, my prince...\" she said. Fortis nodded. \"Penny, we better give them some time alone\", he said. Penelope curtsied and retired to her room, and Fortis left, closing the doors behind him. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Despite being the Crown Prince and having numerous different servant girls and daughters of the nobility eye him up over the past couple of years, he had never kissed a girl before, or held one in his arms, or stroked her long, silky hair, or....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassius lost himself a bit in the moment and gently eased his mouth open to run his tongue along Minerva's sweet, plump lips.  She gasped in surprise, and he eagerly swept his tongue into her mouth.  He didn't quite know what he was doing, but he knew she tasted sweet and innocent, and the taste of her sent his senses reeling.  He crushed her more tightly in his arms, enjoying the feel of her soft body pressed along the length of his own muscled, hard, angled planes.  Her small breasts felt like soft pillows against his front, and he couldn't help pressing his now insistent erection against her soft stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe tried to control his reactions a bit, for his chivalry reminded him that she'd just be violated by that awful Vergallen.  However, he had never felt such intense lust coursing through his body before.  He ran his hands gently from her hair down the long length of her back, massaging her sides with his thumbs, until they landed on the upper swells of her buttocks.  He continued kissing her, licking and stroking against her tongue and the insides of her cheeks, as he eased her lower body closer to his own.  He groaned as he ground his throbbing length into her belly.  He drew his face away as he gasped for breath and began laying kisses along her delicate cheek and around to her ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My lady,\" he breathed, shivering with the intensity of his feelings, \"I've...never felt like this before.  You're so...exquisite and sweet and soft....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinerva could hardly take in all the sensations that the prince was eliciting in her own nubile, still mostly innocent body.  She'd never felt so loved and cherished before by someone outside of her own family.  He touched her as if she were something precious,...and yet she could feel how much he desired her.  She gasped when she felt his hard member press into her stomach.  She was a bit afraid of it, to be honest, as her recent attack by that vicious Vergallen was still very fresh in her mind.  But when Prince Cassius did nothing more than grind himself into her, her fear waned a bit.  He wasn't ripping at her skirts or trying to press into her, where she was still very sensitive and very sore.  She knew he would never abuse her that way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've...I've never felt so safe and warm in someone's arms before...well, outside of my brothers'!\"  She giggled a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassius moved a bit away from her to calm down his overheated body a bit.  He raked his eyes over her face, smug at the fact that HE had brought that delightful flush to her creamy complexion.  \"Let's move to the bed, my lady.  We can be a bit more...comfortable there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Al...alright,\" Minerva said hesitantly.  If he kept holding and touching and kissing her on the bed, it would only make her feel more safe, right?  After all, Vergallen had taken her up against the wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassius took one of her hands gently in his own much larger one and slowly led her to sit down on the very comfortable mattress.  He sat down beside her and gathered her up into his arms again.  He pressed gentle kisses on her forehead, her pert little nose, her eyelids, her cheeks, her chin, the corners of her mouth.  Minerva sighed as he pressed those delicate, butterfly kisses all over her face.  She placed her hands along his strong forearms, taking comfort in the strength of his corded muscles.  He didn't have the bulky, sculpted musculature of Fortis.  He had a more lean, ropey build, but she could feel the power and strength and warmth emanating from his firm form.  She relaxed at the safety she felt in his arms.  She needed that after her recent, horrific experience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassius soon slanted his mouth over hers again, and she immediately opened her mouth again to his questing tongue.  The prince groaned.  His body was on fire at her innocent, eager response to him.  He pressed his aching manhood against her shapely hip and slowly began to lower them to lie on the bed.  He continued kissing her as he began to caress the soft curves of her sides, the flare of her hips, the individual bumps of her spine, the delicious curve of her buttocks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt soon became too much for the fifteen-year-old prince.  He ripped his mouth away from Minerva's, throwing his head back and groaning, humping himself mercilessly against her thigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinerva's eyes went wide at the look of pain on Cassius's face.  \"Your highness, are...are you alright?\" she asked quietly.  She ran her hands over his grimacing face and down his neck to his firm chest.  He caught her hands before they could explore anymore of his overheated body.  He panted as if he had run ten miles, and his body shivered with want.  His chivalry was a quiet clamor in his mind as lust pounded through his teenage body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My lady!\" he gasped.  He opened his eyes to gaze into her lovely, concerned face, and she gasped in return at how dilated his eyes were.  \"I...You...you feel so sweet and soft in my arms.  I...I can't help wanting to go...farther than just mere kisses and touches with you.  I know what you just went through with Vergallen was horrible, but...if you would let me...I could show you what it <i>should</i> be like between a man and woman.  I swear I will be ever so gentle with you!\" he rushed to say, \"I would never hurt you, my lady, though I heard the first...er...couple of times might sting a bit.  It's just...I want you so desperately.\"  He was loathe to admit to her that he'd never lain with a woman before, though he was sure he understood the mechanics of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe ignored the look of shock on her face and placed a sweet kiss against her temple.  \"Please, Minerva...Minnie,\" he pleaded, \"let me show you pleasures that only a man that adores you can give you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinerva could hardly believe her ears!  She'd just been violated by a disgusting, perverted old man...and now here was Prince Cassius begging to do the same thing to her?!...Though he was being very gentle with her...and he hadn't done anything to her that made her feel violated or uncomfortable...and she felt shivers and tingles in her body that she had never felt before...and his kisses were so very sweet...and his large, warm hands made her feel safe and wanted....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShould she consent?  Could he really show her what all the fuss was about?  What Eldonia was always talking about with her and Fortis?  She was already not a true virgin anymore because of Vergallen.  Should she just give in to the loving prince and let him...make love to her?</span></div></div>",

We leave them in here for people when they come...here they are!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassius picked up a box and opened it. Inside was a row of little paper packets. He unfolded one and a round, rubbery disc fell out. Minerva stared at it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think it's nice that you said 'yes'...but I don't wanna land you with child. Your brother would slaughter me!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't say yes!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you're gonna...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinerva stared at the prince. The NERVE! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut...at the same time...She really WAS NOT a virgin anymore. She'd been violated! Her innocence taken! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd yet, this dashing handsome young prince wanted to have his way with her. He obviously didn't care that she'd been raped. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo, that wasn't right! He DID care. He cared very much!...And despite her...broken status...he still wanted her. Obviously to the likes of Crown Prince Cassius, Lady Minerva Vanderstorm was still a fine conquest...and someone worth enjoying...and spending time with...someone he loved and wanted to care for...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I won't do it if you really don't wanna...\" Cassius said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That HORRIBLE man...He hurt me and he hit me and he tried to have his way with me!\" Minerva said, tears welling up. \"Fortis beat him black and blue! And he deserved it!...I guess...\" she sniffed, \"...I guess if I AM going to be...taken...by a man...then it should be with a prince...and a gentleman...who's sweet...and...cute and...who's a friend...and...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassius blushed. Minerva smiled. \"Alright\", she said. \"It might be fun\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh it will be...\" said Cassius, slipping the sheath over his shaft, \"It will be...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n--- --- --- --- <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinerva had known that Fortis was well-endowed. Exceptionally so. She knew that he had a truly colossal organ. She didn't need Eldonia's screams and groans, or her giggling stories afterwards, to tell her that. Minerva knew it firsthand. The number of times he'd playfully bumped it into his sister whenwever she slept with him. The number of times she'd seen him naked, whether he intended it or not. The number of times he'd made lewd jokes about it and Minerva had been furious with him! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPrince Cassius was not nearly what Fortis's formidable phallus was...but that wasn't to say it wasn't impressive. She watched as he shifted and moved into position. It was certainly of a generous size. She watched him tense up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Something wrong?\" she asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassius blushed. It seemed absurd...but... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've never actually done this before...\" he said. Minerva laughed! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Neither have I!\" she said. They both giggled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'd think someone like me would have...lots of practice...me being me...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wouldn't think that! You're not a rogue!...I mean I've heard others tell stories of Mountain princes from other generations, who were positive rakes! But...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassius smiled. \"Here goes...Close your eyes...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinerva closed her eyes. She felt her dress being lifted up. She felt Cassius's shoulders press against her shins...and push back her legs. She felt her back bending and her legs being pushed back until they rested on her chest, and the crooks of her knees rested against his shoulders. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, she felt it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first, it was nothing particularly of note. But then, she felt the shaft slide in. The stretching. It was not much at first...but then she felt it. The tightening...the opening...She gasped! She felt the rubbing against the lips of her opening...the soft, smooth, slightly tingling sensation...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the bedsheets shifted! Cassius lost his balance and the whole length was harpooned between her legs! She gasped and squealed! Cassius covered her mouth! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry...\" she whispered. The royal rod was removed, and Minerva felt oddly empty. But then, it was inserted once more...Every time it went in, and out...she could feel the walls of her cavern being rubbed and massaged...every time it went in and out, she could feel her lips tingling, and she could feel something deep within her spark and quiver...it was...it was...addictive... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd every time that pistoning action happened again...it felt even better...and better...and better'n'better'n'better'n'better'n'better'n 'better'n'better....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, both of them were in the throes of passion! They tried to keep their voices down, but it wasn't easy! Cassius must've spent a lot of time jousting or on a horse, because he was riding her like one! The bed creaked and shook! They were roaring away! They were in their own world of sweat and strain and bliss and wonder and...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\"What in the name of Thor's sledgehammer is going on here!?\" </b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two teenagers in the bed leapt apart! Cassius got himself tangled in the sheets and flipped out of the bed, crashing onto the floor, leaving Minerva lying in bed, naked! She tucked down her knees, and Cassius got up, trying to cover himself with the mangled up bedsheets! They stared towards the figure standing in the doorway, who was... </span></div></div>",

Then, roared and cursed and yelled some more!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe literally saw red at the sight of his sister covering up her legs and the naked prince feebly trying to cover himself with the bedsheets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe snarled and stalked up to Cassius, grabbing him by the throat and throwing him against the wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I TRUSTED YOU!  I CAN'T BELIEVE I ACTUALLY <i>TRUSTED</i> YOU WITH MY INNOCENT LITTLE SISTER!  I TURN MY BACK FOR ONE MOMENT--ONE STINKING, LOUSY MOMENT!--AND HERE YOU ARE TAKING ADVANTAGE OF HER AFTER SHE'D JUST BEEN <i>RAPED</i>!  DO YOU KNOW NO SHAME, YOUR FREAKING HIGHNESS?!  DO YOU HAVE NO HONOR, NO CHIVALRY?!  PRINCE OR NO, I'M GOING TO RIP YOUR HEAD OFF!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassius gasped and panted for air!  His hands clawed desperately at Fortis's stranglehold on his neck, but his efforts were futile.  Despite his relatively decent strength, he was practically powerless against a man the size of Fortis, let alone when the Earl was in a livid rage!  Cassius tried using his legs to kick out at the man crushing his throat, but it was like kicking a large, sturdy, solid tree!  Nothing he did made a difference to Fortis's hold on his body, and he was beginning to get scared for his life!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis placed his other hand around the prince's throat and squeezed, taking wicked delight in the way Cassius's eyes were bulging from their sockets as the boy tried to breathe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinerva was merely watching all this from the bed in shock!  Her body was still tingling from the wonderful delights Cassius had been showing her, and her mind hadn't quite caught up yet to what was happening right in front of her!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NO!\" Fortis growled.  \"DECAPITATING YOU WOULD BE MUCH TOO GENEROUS FOR THE CRIMES YOU'VE JUST DONE ON GIRL!  I'M GOING TO RIP YOUR <i>PATHETIC PRICK</i> OFF YOUR BODY!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis kept one hand on Cassius's throat, but moved the other down to the boy's groin, easily grasping the still hard rod and giving it a brutal yank.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite his constricted windpipe, the prince was able to get enough air through his throat to scream his pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe scream brought Minerva out of her stupor.  She quickly got off the bed (grateful she was still wearing her dress) and hurried over to her brother.  She pounded on any part of him she could reach, though she knew she probably only felt like a mild irritation to his hard, muscled body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"FORTIS!\" she screamed.  \"FORTIS, STOP IT!  You're hurting him!  Leave him alone!  He wasn't raping me!  I consented to him!  PLEASE!  I'm not hurt!  He's not taking advantage!  I...I wanted him to take me!  PLEASE, FORTY!  LET HIM GO!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis barely registered his sister's pleading voice yelling near his shoulder.  The only thing he could see was his desire to emasculate the upstart boy in front of him who dared to take his sister right after she had just been violated by that nasty Vergallen!  He squeezed the prince's phallus again, practically crushing the organ in his fist, eliciting another high-pitched scream from Cassius.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, that second scream was loud and piercing enough to have several bodies burst into the room a minute later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT IN THE NAME OF VALHALLA IS GOING ON IN HERE?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your majesty!\" Minerva gasped, quickly running over to King Leviathan.  \"Your majesty, please!  My brother is going to kill your son!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lord Vanderstorm!\" the king yelled, storming up the irate earl.  \"What do you think you're doing to Cassius?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stay out of this, Sire!\" Fortis had the audacity to say, keeping his hands firmly on the prince's neck and penis.  \"I caught this <i>boy</i> violating my sister!  He's going to PAY for what he's done to her...especially after what she just went through!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lord Vanderstorm, you will NOT speak to me that way.  And what do you mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, the king could see for himself the disheveled state of Minerva's dress and his own son's lack of clothing.  The bedsheets had fallen to pool around Cassius's feet, leaving him naked and vulnerable in front of everyone to see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My lord,\" Minerva gasped, \"Cassius...Prince Cassius...was...well...he was showing me what it <i>could</i> be like between a man and a woman.  But I let him, your majesty!  He had my consent!  He was...really gentle and patient with me.\"  Minerva's cheeks were red at confessing such to the king, but she had to do what she could to keep Fortis from tearing the prince apart!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cassius, is this true?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassius gasped and panted, trying to make sense of everything going on around him as his blood pounded in his ears.  He barely nodded his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis growled at the prince's admission, but loosened his hold slightly on the boy's body.  \"Consent or no,\" Fortis snarled, \"you should have known better than to force yourself on Girl when she hasn't recovered yet!  Besides, she's much too young to be having...relations...yet!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Forty!\" Minerva sighed in exasperation.  \"I'm thirteen!  I'm not really a virgin anymore, anyway!  And it's my body!  I'll choose whom I have my first real time with--not you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My lord, I must insist that you release my son at once!\" the king said, grasping Fortis around an impressive bicep and shaking his arm firmly.  The king was just as strong and built as Fortis and could easily try and force the young earl to comply.  \"Whatever he may have done, it is not up to you to be judge, jury, and executioner!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It <i>is</i> my right, considering he violated my sister!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mutual consent was given!  Yes, they are both young and naive, but if Lady Minerva gave her consent, my son has done nothing wrong, except perhaps suffer from a lack of good judgment!  Now, let go of my son, or suffer the consequences!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe king shook Fortis's arm viciously in warning.  Fortis growled his displeasure, but slowly loosened his grasp on the princely pride followed by the prince's neck.  Dark purple bruises were already making themselves known on the boy's skin, and he collapsed to his knees, coughing.  He groaned lightly as he placed one hand on his injured cock and the other on his tender neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis was greatly tempted to kick the boy in the stomach, but just barely kept a rein on his temper.  Instead, he turned to his sister and gathered her up gently into his arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did he hurt you?\" he asked gruffly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinerva sighed and snuggled into her brother's embrace.  \"No.  He was very gentle, very sweet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis snorted, but held his tongue at his opinion on the Crown Prince.  He turned back to look at Cassius.  The boy was gently eased to his feet by a couple of guards.  Fortis figured they'd take him down to the infirmary.  He smirked at the idea of the prince having difficulty urinating or getting it up without pain for the next several days.  Serve him right for what he did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning back to the king, Fortis said, \"I suppose the boy won't even be punished for what he did.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe king growled and fisted his hands at his side.  \"I should challenge you to a duel, Lord Vanderstorm, for your disrespectful tongue!  However, considering the situation, I will be lenient this once.  From now on, do NOT forget your place!  As for my son, if I punish him or not is purely up to me.  However, if it eases your mind some, he will get a stern talking to.  I will decide if he deserves a punishment after I have a more thorough understanding of the situation.  Now, I suggest you all get back to sleep.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis sighed, but bowed before the king and said, \"Yes, your majesty.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinerva curtsied and said, \"Good night, your majesty.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lady Minerva, if I could speak with you tomorrow after we've all rested and get the facts from both you and my son?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, your majesty.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe king nodded.  \"Good night, then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe king left, and Fortis immediately scooped MInerva into his arms, making her giggle.  \"Forty!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe settled her gently on her bed and pulled the covers up to her chin.  \"I'm going to send Eldonia in to sleep with you.  I don't want you to be alone, but I don't trust anyone else to be with you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinerva sighed.  \"For-ty!\" she whined.  \"You and Eldonia should be able to sleep together!  I'll be fine!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!\" he said firmly.  \"SOMEONE will be staying here with you, and that's final!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine!  How about Penny?  She could sleep here in the bed with me or on the settee across the room.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright,\" Fortis said gruffly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter making sure the maid was settled in with his sister, Fortis closed the door to his sister's room and walked wearily back to his own room.  Who would have thought that visiting the royal palace to get some new servants would result in such drama!</span></div></div>",

For those first two offenses you are grounded for a month!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A month!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No friends, no visitors, no letters, no attending court parties and no access to your forge!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Papa!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NO!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright...\" </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"And if you put even ONE TOE out of line this next month, Cassius, I might just ship you off to Fatlantis with your brother Gladius to teach you discipline and respect!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Papa.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you for coming down to see me, Lady Minerva.  Cassius, you are dismissed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassius tucked his chin to his chest in humility, despite the pain that brought to his bruised neck, but snuck a quick look at Minerva as she curtsied before the king and slipped out of the room.  Cassius caught the stern look on his father's face and hurried out of the room, too.  He'd rarely been disciplined by his father before.  Between the three princely brothers, it was usually Gladius that acted up and angered the king...which was one reason why he was probably sent off to foster in Fatlantis for a while.  Cassius did not care for being grounded for a WHOLE MONTH by his father one bit!  However, he did admit that he had gotten carried away.  His hormones had gotten the better of him, and he could still hardly believe that he'd had the audacity to actually make love to the beautiful Lady Minerva.  Even now, his groin twitched in remembrance of being held in her tight heat, making him moan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassius caught sight of Minerva's slight form walking down the hallway back towards her room, and he sighed longingly.  He put a fist up to his breastbone and rubbed at the slight ache he had there.  He cared for her, and the emotion seemed to have crept up on him without him realizing it.  Despite Minerva being very pretty, with silky hair and creamy skin and full lips, she was also very sweet.  She had a shyness to her, but he also admired her spunkiness that allowed her to stand up to her overprotective brothers and hold her own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thought of Minerva's brothers, particularly Fortis, made Cassius shudder and massage his neck.  He also discreetly palmed himself, grimacing in remembrance of how Fortis had nearly emasculated him!  Despite his father's reprimand of not having any access to any friends and visitors, including Minerva, for a month, Cassius knew that Fortis's punishment for having been with the earl's sister would be much worse...if he ever saw Cassius again, that is!  Cassius would steer clear of Fortis for the foreseeable future!  Further, Cassius doubted that Fortis would EVER allow the prince any further contact with Minerva again!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat thought, however, depressed Cassius more than merely being grounded.  His shoulders hunched in dejection as he began the long trudge to his room.  He barely acknowledged all the servants that bowed or curtsied to him as he traversed the many corridors of his family's home.  All his attention was on how he had royally screwed up and ruined the only chance he had to get to know and spend time with--and potentially court--the lovely, delicate, and absolutely delightful Lady Minerva Vanderstorm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhy couldn't he have kept it in his pants?  After all, he'd never been with a girl before!  Couldn't he have waited a few more months, maybe even a few more years?  Or tried his skills out on some servant girl first?  However, the thought that he'd lost his virginity to Minerva made a small smile appear on his handsome face.  The smile was replaced with a frown almost as quickly, though, upon remembering that the same couldn't be said for Minerva.  He sighed again and dug his fists into the pockets of his pants at the thought of Vergallen.  Cassius really was no better than that awful man with how he had treated Minerva.  At least Minerva had stuck up for him in front of his father.  But it was going to be a long month with no sight or even correspondence from her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassius finally reached his room and went inside.  He went to his large, canopied bed and flopped down on it, covering his eyes with his arm.  He just wanted to forget everything that had happened over the past day and a half.  Well...<i>almost</i> everything....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Cassius!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hrrmmm?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was an insistent nudging on his shoulder, but he batted it away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA delightful giggle sounded near his ear.  \"Caaaaaaaasssssssssie!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Grr!  Don't call me Cassie!  *yawwwwwwnnnn!*  Momma called me that when I was little.  Not little anymore....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're cute when you're sleepy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*growl!*  I'll show YOU who's sleepy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe rolled over to pin down the person who dared to wake him up, only to smirk upon feeling a small body full of delightful curves pressed firmly against his.  \"Well, well,...what do we have here?  Looks like an alluring pixie who decided to disturb my nap!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer face blushed prettily, but she gave him a small smile and giggled again.  \"Well, I couldn't help it!  You were snoring!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe snorted.  \"I was not!  Princes do NOT snore!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, yes, you do!  I heard you!  *SSSSSNNNNRRRRRRRRRKKKKK-shoooooooooo*!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why, you...!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe began to tickle her mercilessly, making her laugh uncontrollably.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cassie!  I...hahahaha!  Cassie, please!  Heheehehee!  Oh, oh!  I...haha!  Alright!  I...hahahaha!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did I say about calling me 'Cassie'?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shrieked with laughter and kept trying to roll away to escape his fingers viciously digging into her sides, but he was too quick!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, okay!  Heheheeehee!  I give, I give!  Hahaha!  UNCLE!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe ceased his tickling, only to snuggle up behind her, holding her tightly in his arms.  He nuzzled his face into her sweet-smelling hair.  \"I missed you, Minnie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe caught her breath and wriggled in his warm, comfortable embrace.  \"I missed you, too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If my papa or your brother catches you in here, we'll both get in trouble.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know.  But I don't care.  It's not fair!  It's not your fault!  I agreed to what we did together.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe moaned.  She wriggled her behind more snugly against his front, making a certain part of him wake up and take notice.  He slid a hand to her hip to hold in place.  \"Unless you're wanting a repeat performance,\" he said huskily, \"I recommend you stop moving against me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, she smirked and kept pressing her bottom against his hardening member.  He groaned and tightened his arms around her.  \"Maybe,\" she said softly, \"I...do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do...what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Want a repeat performance.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe gasped as all the blood left his brain.  \"Minnie, we...we can't!  We shouldn't!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because...um....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, Cassius....  It felt so nice the last time.  And you were so sweet and caring and warm.  And you made me feel things I'd never felt before.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis heart was thundering, he was breathing as fast as a running horse, and his cock was now hard as stone.  He couldn't help rocking it in the lovely crease of her buttocks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please,\" she whispered, turning her head to look at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe moaned and leaned his head in to kiss her.  He wanted her...desperately!  And she was practically begging him to take her!  How could he resist?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe turned her over in his arms as he continued to kiss her, stroking her sweetly curved body and gradually raising her skirts up her legs.  She in turn was shyly exploring him, too, and was even so bold as to unlace and pull down his pants and smalls.  He kissed her cheek and her neck, sucking on her skin, as he delicately palmed her.  She moaned in response.  He lined himself up and was about to plunge into her, when....<br>\r\n</i><br>\r\n<b>KNOCK!  KNOCK!  KNOCK!</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassius instantly sat up in his bed!  He moaned when he realized he had been dreaming...and that his hand was currently in his pants, clenched tightly around his throbbing member.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who...who is it?\" he hollered gruffly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's Triton!  Can I come in and play with you?  I'm bored!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassius groaned.  \"Not...right now!  I'll play with you later!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awww...please, big brother?  Please, please, please, please, please?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassius sighed, knowing that Triton wouldn't wear down easily.  \"Alright!  But give me a few minutes!  I'll...meet you down in your room!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright!  Thanks, Cassie!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And don't call me 'Cassie'!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTriton's laughter rang through the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassius hunkered back down on his bed and gripped his still hard cock tightly.  He let his mind pick up where his dream left off.  He could just imagine what it would feel like to be inside Minerva again, to feel her sheath tightly gripping him as he thrust inside her.  He'd be gentle at first, with short, shallow thrusts.  But he knew he wouldn't be able to keep that up and that he would soon be plunging into her with abandon, bringing them both to the heights of ecstasy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis hand raced over his cock, his thumb swiping over the sensitive head.  He bit his lip as he came, shuddering and groaning, with Minerva's name falling from his lips over and over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassius sighed as he eventually got off his bed and changed his undershorts and pants.  It looked like fantasies and his own hand would be his only company for the next several weeks.  Though still a bit depressed, Cassius left his room and headed down to Triton's.  Cassius didn't figure his grounding would include ignoring his little brother.  Heaven knew Triton needed more than the usual amount of attention, especially since Gladius wasn't here anymore to play with him.</span></div></div>",

It was typically dark and heavy, even in the daytime, and the chambers and halls could sometimes seem cold and dark and unforgiving. She opened a door and entered a large room. A boy of ten sat on the floor, playing with blocks and a... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinerva shrieked! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh get it off me! Bad lizard!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe small, blond-haired boy jumped up and hurried over to Minerva! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry Lady Minnie! HEY COME BACK HERE!...Bad dragon! Naughty Brimstone!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that yours!?\" Minerva gasped. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is Brimstone. And this is Fyre\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fyre and Brimstone, adorable...\" Minerva said, when the boy held up two baby dragons to her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne sneezed and a fireball shot out. She petted them gingerly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Might you have some pets which are a little less...flammable?\" she asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I have lots of pets!\" said Triton, \"There's Hopkins...\" he pointed to a fat, white bunny who bounced across the floor, in hot pursuit of a carrot that was rolling away from him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...and that's Cookies...\" he pointed to a cat that was sleeping on the window-sill. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...and this is Buckley!\" he said. A bouncy, golden-retriever puppy yipped and yapped and yupped, and scampered over! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooh!\" said Minerva, \"Oh he's a friendly fellow! Hello Buckley!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And this is Mortimer!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe diminutive prince held up what looked like a brown pin-cushion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awww, it's a...a...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's a hedgehog!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awwwwwwww!!!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinerva reached out and petted the hedgehog gingerly. To her surprise, the spines were not so sharp. It was like stroking a very, very prickly, fuzzy brush. The hedgehog shuffled slightly and blinked its tiny eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awwww...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, the door opened. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright Triton, I'm here! Now what do you wanna...MINNIE!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinerva jumped!...and let out a squeal of surprise when she accidentally squeezed the hedgehog too hard! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh yeah, best not to try fresh-squeezed hedgehog-juice. It's very painful\", said Cassius, reaching for the hedgehog in her hands, \"Go on, Morty! Scuttle on now...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hedgehog toddled off. It had spotted ants around a lump of sugar in his little hutch, and was hungry for them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing here?\" Cassius asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I came to play with your brother! What are you doing here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...I came to play with MY brother!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Could we play with your brother together?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two teenagers stared at each other. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhhh...\"<br>\r\n\"Hmmm...\" <br>\r\n\"Well...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Minnie! Look! This is Chirpy!\" Triton burst out, holding up a fat, yellow canary. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The royal zookeeper demands that we pay attention to his menagerie\", Cassius said, flatly. Minerva laughed! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And this is Stuart!\" said Triton, holding up a pure, white mouse. Minerva gasped! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh Tritey, I don't think Minerva likes mice...\" said Cassius. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She doesn't have to eat them!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No I mean I don't think she likes mice!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...Oh...okay...How about bunnies? Here Hopkins! This is Hopkins!\" he said, picking up a fat, white rabbit, \"Do you like bunnies?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I love bunnies!\" said Minerva. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Especially jugged, and served with sauce...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"CASSIUS!! Not in front of Bunny!\" Triton wailed. He covered the rabbit's impressive ears, \"You'll scare him...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassius sighed, \"See, usually it's Gladius who plays with Triton...but he's off doing bodyguard stuff so..yeah...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinerva giggled. \"I think he's cute!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gladius!? Puh-leese!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I mean Triton! And how much he loves you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh!...Yeah!

Of course, your majesty!  I'll just keep track of all these for you, and I'll be waiting for you when you get back!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeviathan sighed.  \"Valerius, what I meant to say is that I'm done for the day.  Nothing in those piles of papers is so important or imminent that they can't wait until tomorrow.  Go ahead and finish your filing and enjoy the rest of your evening.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young page grinned widely at the king.  \"Thank you, your majesty!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeviathan chuckled as Valerius filed and stacked everything neatly on his own small desk and hurried out of the room before the king could say, \"Mountania!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe king wearily left his office and began his sedate walk down the corridors of his family home.  He initially thought he'd head to the drawing room to spend some time with his family, but then he remembered that he'd grounded Cassius and opted instead to swing by the family wing and make sure his son was keeping in line with his grounding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeviathan shook his head at the thought of his eldest son's recent actions.  Leviathan had to so rarely punish Cassius that he was still a bit surprised by everything that had taken place over the past couple of days!  The king had never relished the thought of dealing with any of his sons' emerging, er, hormonal proclivities, but he had always figured it would be his often-disgruntled middle son Gladius that would be the first to engage in questionable acts with a girl.  At least Cassius had confessed to using protection when he had taken Lady Minerva; otherwise, Leviathan's punishment would have been MUCH more severe!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe king reached the Crown Prince's bedroom and knocked on the door.  \"Cassius?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he was greeted with silence, he frowned and knocked again.  \"CASSIUS!  It's your father!  Answer this door!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeviathan opened the door himself and went inside.  He scoured through the entire apartment, getting steadily angrier.  \"Did I or did I not explicitly tell the boy to come to his room and remain here for the rest of the day as the initial part of his punishment and grounding?!  When I find that boy, I will whip his hide so raw he won't be able to sit for a week!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe king then stormed out of his son's room and marched down the corridor, trying to puzzle through where Cassius would have gone.  However, loud voices and laughing coming from his youngest son's room had him pausing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww, Minnie, there's no reason to be afraid of Creepy!\" came Triton's voice through the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a...it's a...SNAKE!\"  That was definitely Lady Minerva's voice!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, Leviathan heard Cassius's distinctive laugh and gritted his teeth.  \"Min, this snake is completely harmless!  He's not venomous or anything!  He's just a common garden snake!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But he's so...eeurgh!  Scaly!  And slimy looking!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww, but he's not slimy at all, Minnie!\" said Triton.  \"See?  If you pet him along his back here, he closes his eyes and looks like he's purring!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Er, well,....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassius laughed again.  \"Bro, I don't think you'll convince Minerva about Creepy.  You know that all girls are scared of snakes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not scared of him!\" Minerva said indignantly.  \"I just don't, er, um....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay, Minnie!  Here!  How about Shelly?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeviathan opened the door to Triton's room and watched his ten-year-old son place a curly-q shell on Minerva Vanderstorm's hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's just a pretty shell, Triton,\" said Minerva gently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Shelly's just shy.\"  Triton tapped the shell and suddenly several crab-legs emerged and tapped the palm of her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinerva shrieked and flung the hermit crab up into the air!  Cassius laughed uproariously, and even Leviathan had to hold back his laughter at Minerva's reaction.  Triton meanwhile ran hurriedly to catch the flying hermit crab before it could land on the floor and be hurt or its shell damaged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shelly!  Are you okay?\"  Triton gently ran his fingers over the delicate shell, and eventually the small, thin crab-legs re-emerged.  Triton breathed a sigh of relief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cassius!  That wasn't funny!\"  Minerva turned glaring eyes to the Crown Prince, her hands on her hips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassius just grinned at her unapologetically.  \"Yes, it was!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinerva rolled her eyes at the prince, and a small smile crept on her face.  \"Oh, alright.  It probably was pretty funny to see.  But, please, Triton!  No more surprises!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tri, do you even HAVE any more pets to show her?\" asked Cassius with a frown.  He'd never taken stock of exactly how many pets his brother had before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm,\" said the diminutive prince thoughtfully, putting Shelly back in its glass cage.  \"Well, there's my frog Warty, and my tarantula Octo, and then there's all my larger pets that are kept in the barn outside!  Like my baboon Butts, and my white wolf Snow, and my miniature pony Dwarf, and--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassius held up his hands and laughed.  \"Okay, okay!  I think we get the idea.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinerva's eyes went wide, and she looked around the room with a frightened look on her face.  She sidled closer to Cassius and grabbed his arm like a lifeline.  \"Did he just say he had a...pet <i>tarantula</i>?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassius smiled down at her gently and patted her hand reassuringly.  \"Don't worry, Minnie.  Even though Octo's poisonous, he's never bit anyone.  And he's kept securely locked up in his glass case over there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinerva looked to where Cassius was pointing across the room and breathed a sigh of relief, grateful to not even be near the tarantula case!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you wanna go down to the barn and see my other animals?\" Triton asked excitedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassius sighed unenthusiastically, but looked at Minerva.  \"My lady?  I will leave the decision up to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinerva looked at Triton's eager face and couldn't find it in her to turn him down.  \"Sure, Triton.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright!  Come on, guys!  Follow me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the three children entered the hallway, they ran into the king.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassius gulped at the firm look on his father's face.  Whoops!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeviathan crossed his strong arms over his chest and looked intimidatingly at his oldest son.  \"Cassius, I see you decided to ignore your punishment and leave your room to instead spend time with your brother and with Lady Minerva, whom I expressly forbade you to see.  What do you have to say for yourself?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite his fear of further punishment and being thoroughly embarrassed in front of Minerva, Cassius decided to own up to his behavior.  He straightened up to his full height and threw his shoulders back, looking his father straight in the eye.  \"I admit, Father,\" he said in a slow, even tone, \"that I did indeed disobey you and left my room.  Triton asked me to play with him, and I couldn't in good conscience ignore his request.  Lady Minerva just happened to come play with him, as well.  I swear to you that nothing untoward or unseemly happened between us with Triton as a chaperone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeviathan was impressed at his son's words and nodded his head.  \"Good.  Now, Triton, I believe you were going to show these two the rest of your animals?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean...I am allowed to accompany Lady Minerva down to the barns?\" Cassius sad in disbelief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes.  As long as you have Triton or another person in your company when you are with Lady Minerva, I will allow you to spend time with her for the remainder that she is here visiting the castle.  However, once she leaves with her family, you will still be forbidden from any correspondence with her for a month.  Is that clear?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Sir!  Thanks, Papa!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeviathan smiled.  \"Go on, now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh boy!  Come on, Minnie!  You're gonna love seeing the rest of my animals!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTriton insistently tugged on Cassius's and Minerva's hands and began to practically drag them down the hallways towards the palace grounds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeviathan just shook his head and chuckled at his youngest son's antics.  He began to head back down to the drawing room where he knew his wife Athena would be waiting for him with a refreshing mug of Mountanian ale.  Seeing Cassius interact and play with Triton and Minerva made him realize that he had been a bit harsh in his son's punishment.  However, if Cassius treated his leniency with complete disregard, the boy would definitely be in for a whipping!</span></div></div>",

Minerva felt herself heat up! The prince had declared his love for HER! How dare they try and...and steal...HER prince!? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey come on!\" Triton called from the end of a corridor, \"You wanna see the ponies or not!? Dwarf and Midget won't wait forever!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinerva entered the corridor. She watched as the prince's adoring posse slowly melted away. </span></div></div>",

Suddenly, he was five years old again, crying over his pet kitty. He took it to its creator and handed it to her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Granny...fix Mortimer\", Fortis said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooooh my poor darling\", said Athena. Fortis knelt at his grandmother's feet and she rested a hand on his massive, muscular shoulder. \"There now...I tell you what I'll do. You give me Mortimer, and I'll pull him apart...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NO!!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Shhh! And I'll find some cloth, and I'll make you a NEW Mortimer!

Well, I need SOMETHING to keep me busy!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks granny...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awwww...Now give nanny a hug...OOOOOH!!!...Okay! Okay Fortis! N-n-not so hard!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? Oh sorry gramma...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter breakfast, Athena gathered up the kitten and went to find her sewing-supplies. She would make a trip to the local cloth-merchant and buy the fabric needed for a new kitty. Minerva followed granny into town. Eldonia handed Fortis the baby, with instructions to take him upstairs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeo was crying about losing the kitty! He could see that papa was angry with him! Fortis sighed. That raggedy old toy had been falling apart for YEARS. And it's not like Fortis treated it any better than Leo had! He guessed such destruction was inevitable. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay little fellah. Granny's gonna make us a new Mortimer!\" said Fortis. \"Now sshhhhh! It's alright...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis walked the baby around the various bedrooms, calming him down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis entered his own room. The housemaids had turned down the bed and drawn the curtains back. Sunlight flooded in. The light made Leo happy! He giggled and pointed to all the pretty sparkly patterns on the windows. Fortis chuckled and gave his son a squeeze and a kiss. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh, you like that, huh?\" Fortis said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe light revealed things to Leo that he hadn't previously noticed in papa's bedroom...things like... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoooooooo!!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeo leaned dangerously out of his father's arms! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah! Woah! Careful there!\" said Fortis, trying to catch his son as he wriggled in his arms! \"Leo stop it! Leo!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Fortis saw that the baby was so interested in! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeo was trying to get a better look at a handsome, wooden rack in the corner of the room. Stacked on it were swords, daggers, knives, spears, javelins, and in the middle, a huge shield with Fortis's coat of arms on it. Leo giggled! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh! You like that, huh?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis carried the baby over. Leo tried to reach out and touch, but Fortis pulled him back! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah-aaah! This is for BIG boys! You're too small for these things, Leo. And they're VERY very sharp! You don't wanna get hurt, huh?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis kissed his son, and gave him a tour of his collection. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See, this is papa's coat of arms...and this here are my two daggers...and these are my swords...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeo started making faces at the shiny sword-blades. He giggled joyously! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis put the baby on his bed and took down one of the heavy swords. It was almost the same size as its owner, and weighed nearly a half-ton! You needed REAL Mountanian strength to wield something like this with any kind of skill at all! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis whirled the sword through the air, pretending he was fighting off a horde of Vladian mercenaries! Leo sat on the bed, watching this imaginary battle! He giggled and thrashed his hands around, clapping loudly! Eldonia came in and smiled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww! Hahaha! He likes it!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis lowered his sword and put it back on the rack. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look after the baby, huh?\" Fortis said, \"There's something I wanna do\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia picked up the baby and Fortis left the room. Leo's fascination with all the weapons and metalwork had given Fortis an idea... </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The three brothers arrived at a secluded camp in the mountains around sunrise, led there by the many other young mountanian men in arms. The camp was hidden in the thick forests of \u00a0an isolated valley, where a clearing had been cut for a place to camp. Tents were arranged in a circle around a large bonfire, and on a bench in front of the fire was the famous captain Martinus, a 12 foot, aged giant who had led the Mountanians to victory against the Vladians in the last great war against them. Next to him sat two of his six sons, Marcus and Valor, famed generals in their own right who had grown up to their father's legacy, both figuratively and literally. Cannius, Jupiter and Fortis lined up with several hundred other soldiers in front of the aged giant. Martinus's booming voice carried over the entire crowd.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs many of you know, the Mille Electi Reges has once again been called to action in response to the Vladian threat. However, this elite force is not destined for the front lines. My son, Valor, shall explain further.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt those words, many murmurs ran through the crowd.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Men, I know it is the greatest honor to fight on the front lines. However, we can no longer afford to sacrifice a tactical advantage for the sake of honor. For centuries, the Vladians have thrown their hordes at our borders, and for centuries we have sent our own boys to defend. These wars have always been destructive and have always ended inconclusively. I wish to end this meaningless slaughter. We shall no longer attack the Vladian's strongest point seeking honor in battle like fools, but instead we shall attack them at their heart. Instead of fighting their armies, we shall pull them out by the roots. We shall destroy their supply lines and attack theit capitol. We won't just defeat Vladia this time, we will end them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Fortis became filled with rage at Valor's suggestion of the king's chosen thousand being used for underhanded tactics, and bellowed<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You dare suggest that we use dirty tactics! We'd be just the same as the Vladians. The king would never disgrace his elite by having us raid the Vladian countryside like thugs. You are a disgrace to your father's<br>\r\n<br>\r\nname.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis's words were meat by many cheers of agreement, until Martinus began talking once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You dare attack my son like that Fortis! Do you not know what the Vladians have been doing? They have raided our villages and have sent assassins throughout our land. They killed my granddaughter! Respect my son, he is right! If we don't kill them, the Vladians will kill us. Imagine, men, think about them killing your daughters, sons, wives. We shall not stand by and let this happen! Do not dare insult my name like that again, Fortis!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Fortis sat down in shame, biting his tongue, and the crowd calmed down with him. Valor resumed speaking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Mille Electi Reges shall move stealthily through the wilderness from now on. We shall move north towards Vladia. Our goal is to capture the Vladian capitol of Brochka with a surprise attack in the night. Knowledge of our plans must be hidden from the Vladians in order for us to succeed. This may be the last time you contact your families for many months, and once we set out, noone may turn back. We will be living off the land. Shall you go?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aye!\" resounded every one of the thousand elite soldiers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good! I would advise you write to your families now, this is the last chance. We have a trusted courier who will get the letters to them safely. Dismissed!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The three brothers began setting up their tent in an open spot in the clearing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What if those thugs that killed father were actually Vladians?\" said jupiter, \u00a0\"How is Minerva going to be safe without against them?\"\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah if those thugs could kill father, there's no way that Minerva could stand up to them.\" added Cannius.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Brothers, I think it is time we stop worrying about Minerva. It is time we trust her to take care of herself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis forced out those words, he really was the most worried of the three, but he figured that Minerva was going to have to be on her own eventually anyway, and there wasn't really anything Fortis could do about it while he was gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lets get some breakfast. We can't protect anyone on an empty stomach.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The three boys walked to the bonfire, where many deer, mountain goats, birds, rabbits, and other local wildlife were being roasted, and grabbed a share proportionate to their large sizes. Fortis got a deer leg, while Cannius and Jupiter piled up on pheasants and rabbits. While he ate, Fortis got a quill and ink out of his pack, and began writing a letter to Minerva.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 We are sorry, Minerva, but we won't be abled to write to you while we are gone (it's top secret). Anyway, with your bros gone, you'll have to run the house yourself. There's rumors of assassins going around, so don't spend to much time in public. Anyways, we all miss ya, and we won't be coming back for a few months.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSincerely, Fortis, Jupiter, Cannius<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nP.S. don't go through \u00a0our stuff while we're gone!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis folded up the letter and placed it on the courier's table.

She opened the door to meet a courier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ms. Vanderstorm, I have news from Lord Vanderstorm.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinerva grabbed the letter and ran inside, shouting \"Athena, Athena, their letter finally arrived! Come down quick!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm coming!\" was the response as Athena climbed downstairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinerva excitedly read off the letter, but her excitement turned to panic as she read its contents.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Assasins, stay out of public? We're going to be killed!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinerva began to mumble nervously while Athena tried to calm her down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know how your brothers are, Minerva!

We can take care of ourselves.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How are you not worried about this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Child, when you're as old as I am you don't get worried about hardly anything. Now could you go down to the market and get us some more soap? We just ran out this morning.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Minerva got some baskets and also put a cloak on. Just because she wasn't supposed to worry didn't mean she shouldn't be cautious. With the baskets she walked down the road. Minerva made sure to pull the cloak over her head, to ensure that she wouldn't be easily recognized. In the distance Minerva noticed something quite odd. Meandering through the fields was a large convoy of carriages, chariots and soldiers. They looked to be military, but even from this distance something seemed off. Remembering being told not to worry, Minerva continued down to the village.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 The village was the centerpiece of the small fiefdom that Fortis was Duke of. Minerva had been down here many times before, and knew exaclty which one of the stands in the bustling marketplace she was looking for.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Could I have 10 pounds of soap?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, that'll be an ounce of silver.\" answered the man running the stand. He looked at her closely, trying to peer under her hood. Minerva hid her head deeper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why Ms. Vanderstorm, is that you? What are you in disguise for?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It doesn't matter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinerva handed him the silver, and he weighed it on a scale to make sure it was the right amount, and then handed her the blocks of soap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I bet it's your brothers, isn't it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinerva ignored his comment and started to walk back home. However, she, and the rest of the village, paused when the military convoy arrived in the center of the market. A young woman led the convoy. Behind her were soldiers and chariots. The soldiers did not bear the arms of Mountania, but instead a flag that consisted of a sprig of wheat crossed over a sword with a green, white, and blue horizontally striped background. Behind the military were hundreds horse drawn carriages filled with grains, livestock, and oddly enough, live plants. The livestock were unusually large and the live plants unusually abundant, and they looked to be imported from fatlantis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The young woman in the front was the first to speak. Her voice was quite loud and attention grabbing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \"People of the Vanderstorm dukedom, we come to you from Denox to show you the future!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0At her gesture, some of the livestock and live plants were carried over to the front by porters.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \"These plants and animals before you were not imported from Fatlantis, but instead were grown on the harsh slopes of the Denokkian mountains!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 This elicited some gasps from the villagers. Denox was the most westerly provice of mountania, and had the harshest climate and most rugged terrain.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah right.\" called a villager from the crowd. \"Those were obviously imported from Fatlantis, there's no way those could even survive in Denox.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We understand your disbelief, but you must understand, these are no ordinary plants and animals. They were bred by our leader, Marina, to survive in the harsh mountanian climate. We come here to offer you these new crops.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0At those words, the porters carried a basket full of freshly baked bread and gestured for the villagers to come forward and take it. The man that had expressed disbelief was the first to try a piece, and his expression changed from one of doubt to one of delight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's right! This isn't fatlantean grain, it's something even better!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 With his confirmation, the other villagers rushed forward to grab some bread, including Minerva. The bread was indeed some of the most delicious bread she had ever tasted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Villagers, with these new crops and livestock, you shall never go hungry again! We shall no longer be dependant on Fatlantis for food, and the nobility will no longer grow strong off of the cream of the crop while you get the leftovers!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer announcement was met with cheers by the villagers. Minerva felt almost hypnotized by her words, she was throwing the whole marketplace into a stupor! Worried about the increasing excitement of<br>\r\n<br>\r\nthe villagers over the woman's words about \"The nobility growing strong off of the cream of the crop.\" Minerva began to stealthily escape the crowd.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The nobility grows tall and strong \u00a0from Your crops, and they use that strength to extort even more of Your crops! It is a vicious cycle, and today you shall finally be Free! And to celebrate your freedom we shall hold a feast! And we offer you now the seeds to these new plants and the best of our new animals!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crowd shouted louder, and erupted in applause. The carriages were unloaded of seed and livestock as the crowd surged forward. A sack each of every type of crop was offered to every villager<br>\r\n<br>\r\nand in addition everyone got a pair of<br>\r\n<br>\r\nlivestock. As minerva slipped out of the crowd, she noticed that even the \u00a0soapseller was cheering for their \"freedom\", despite acting comcerned for Minerva mere minutes. Once she escaped the crowd, Minerva ran back to the Vanderstorm castle to warn Athena.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 As Minerva burst in the door ragged and breathless, Athena immediately ran downstairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Child, what happned to you? It looks like you got chased here by a pack of wolves.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Grandma...\" she wheazed, pausing for breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's people.... that came to the village..... with a bunch of soldiers...... and food. Their leader..... she was this girl...... she was really good at talking...... and she got..... everyone..... in a stupor.... about being free..... from us!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold on, Minerva. You're saying that some random girl got everyone in a tizzy about being free, of us!, with some food. The Vanderstorms have ruled this dukedom for centuries with nothing but justice and kindness. You really think the serfs would turn on us so quickly?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't get it grandma!\" Minerva shouted, having finally caught her breath. \"That woman, she was from Denox, and she, she, well when she talked, it was almost like you were being hypnotized. I don't get how, but somehow she's managing to get them angry over nothing. I think she's been going from village to village trying to get the whole province riled up. What if she was sent by the Vladians to tear Mountania apart? They're going to kill us!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Calm down child. I'm sure this is all a misunderstanding. And even if it isn't, this castle is strong and secure. We have nothing o worry about.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>One of the things Fortis never got used to seeving in the mille electi was the fact that he didn't tower over everyone like he did at home.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mille electi reges were, as the name suggested, a legion of the most elite soldiers of Mountania, hand picked by king Leviathan himself. Among them, Fortis's 10 foot frame wasn't even average height, the typical electus was around 11 feet tall, all giants legendary for their strength, ferocity and cunning. The three brothers had all proven their worth to the king in the great barracks of Ferremount, however, in the legion Jupiter and Cannius were often looked down upon, being seen as riding on the coattails of their older brother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the first meeting, the different centuria had split up, each centurion giving their soldiers orders specific from Valor himself. The leader of the 8th century, Centurion Gregorium, a heavyset, 11 and a half foot tall man with an unusual<br>\r\n<br>\r\nvoice that warbled in constant anticpation, was currently giving orders to all the Decani of century XIII.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One thing you must all understand, men, is that above all, this is a mission of stealth. Our spies have indicated to us that the capitol of Vladia, Brochka, is mostly undefended at the moment. If our movements our not detected, it should stay that way. For this reason, we shall make our way through the mountains of Tozhgova.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGregorium pointed to the map.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Tozhgova mountains are some of the most rugged mountains in the world, and they run from where we are now all the way up to the center of Vladia. The mountains are so rugged that it would be suicide to send an ordinary army through them<br>\r\n<br>\r\nto get to the Vladian capitol, so the mountains are completely unefended. Of course, we are no ordinary men, we are the strongest men of Mountania!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aye!\" resounded the Decani.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And no mere mountains shall stand in our way. Your orders for the moment are to split up into your Contubernia and make your way to the valley of Pyolt by tommorow night.\" He pointed to the map.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And await further instruction. For the purpouse of stealth, you are not to wear armor, nor anything that gives you away as Mountainian. The goal is to look like armed thugs to outsiders. Dismissed.\"\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Decani split up to go to the tents of their own Contubernia. While Fortis was walking, he was almost knokced over by a powerful slap on his back, and he turned around in rage, only to back down as he looked up to the 12'3\" frame of Darius, the third Decanus, his enormous muscles puting even Fortis's to shame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We hope tou don't get lost in the wilderness, Greenie. There's no turning back for stragglers, you know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis walked into his Contubernium's tent in shame. He thought to himself\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So this must be what it feels like to be an ordinary person around me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the tent were all 9 of the soldiers under Fortis's command, who Fortis had been trying to get to know. there was Cato, a lanky, swift scout, Max, an oversized 18-year old who was the freshest of them, Calus, an archer who was rumored to be able to fire an arrow over a mile with his 9 foot longbow, Jonas and Temeritas, twins Fortis could not remember much about, other than them not seeming to take much seriously, Verres, the oldest of their group, who would've been Decanus had he not turned the offer down, and Jason, a reclusive man who seemed to spend most of his time brooding about one thing or another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's get moving, men, orders from Greg are that we need to get to Pyolt by tommorow night, and they aren't waiting for stragglers. Let's go, pack up! Cato, you scout ahead for a path!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCato dashed off at the order, while the others moved out of the tent to dissasemble it. Max rather awkwardly fumbled with the tent poles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Max, you're doing it wrong.\" said Fortis, quickly unthreading the pole and folding in in his hands.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Max resumed dissasembling the tent the correct way, Fortis piled his equipment into his pack alongside Verres.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kid, if you wanna make your pack look like it ain't full of swords and armor, you've gotta wad the blankets around it like this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVerres took the pack from him and stuffed the blankets around his stuff in a messy but calculated way. When he was done, the pack, once bulging with sword tips and armor now looked to merely be stuffed full of floursacks. Of course, the illusion wouldn't hold for anyone who tried to pick it up, as the thing weighed nearly 200 pounds. Verres helped Jonas and Temeritas with their packs while Fortis finished cleaning up.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why did you turn down the position as Decanus, Verres?\" asked Fortis, curious. \"You're the only one of us that's experienced, and you know what they say about greenies leading greenies, the blind leading the blind and all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just don't have the conviction. You might be inexperienced, kid, but I know that we can count on you for guidance when the rest of us are panicked. You don't seem like the kind of guy that loses sense in the heat of battle. Most of the Electi get bloodlust in the heat of battle, they need guys like you to tell them what to do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn his head, Fortis still didn't get why Verres turned down the promotion, as he didn't seem like<br>\r\n<br>\r\nthe kind of guy that got bloodlust, but questioned no further.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time Cato came sprinting back. the men were packed an ready to go, with Max being stuck with the tent, as he was both strongest and clumsiest. The men sprinted to keep up with Cato as he swiftly darted along a path only he could see. After about 15 minutes of running, the men stopped at a stream, getting a quick drink of water before moving on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose I'm going to have to show you boys how to hunt.\" said Verres as they stopped by the stream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're not going to see the rest of the century for another day, so we're going to have to come up with lunch on our own. Calus, I'm pretty sure you're fine, but the rest of ya look like the only wildlife you've hunted are the tame ones back at home. This is Tozhgova, the animals here are tough and hard to get, it's a whole new world compared to the hunting you've done at home.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 The eight contuberni \u00a0men were currently closely following the lead of Verres and Cato, carefully treading through a field of boulders surrounding a blindinlgly bright glacier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You see, men, the animals of tozhgova are far smarter than the dumb deer which wander around in the woods back home.\" said Verres<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\"Down in the forest, the noise of our approach would scare off everything long before we could see it, so we must hunt the mountain goats from a distance instead. Show them, Calus.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Calus extended the string of his enormous 9-foot bow and let loose an arrow with a loud twang. The arrow flew to its target, a mountain goat so far off that it was merely a distant white blur in Fortis's eye. His shot flew true, and the distant white blur tumbled downwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"It will be difficult to get enough food for the eight of us. An Electi Reges eats for 10 anyways.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I call dibs on the goat.\" shouted Maximus. \"I don't know about you guys, but I can't go without 5 meals a day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \"How'd a fatlantean get in the Mille electi? I beat you outate Gregorium at that banquet and he was so shocked he signed you up.\" joked Jonas, high-fiving his twin Temeritas as they laughed at their own joke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm still growing, you know. A big man needs a big meal.\" said the 12'3\" soldier, indignantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The contubernium continued treadig towards the fallen goat, being careful to not let their feet slip on the rocks. After Max draped it over his shoulders, they climbed down from the boulders into a thickly wooded valley, cut off on both ends by barren, icy slopes. The hair on the back of Fortis's neck stood on end as the entered the forest. The trees and undergrowth were far too thick, so much that the men could barely even slip their thick chests between the tree trunks. All of the undergrowth was covered in thorns, tearing through their calves. Most of all, it was utterly silent apart from them, not even a skittering bug breaking the heavy air. Only a few yards into the forest, the bright midday sunlight was replaced with green darkness, as dark as a new moon night. None of the men spoke as they crawled through, the heavy air sank into their lungs and bade them quiet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Cato continued to confidently lead the way, and the other 7 men followed, holding hands as not to seperate. Fortis, who was closest to Cato, whispered<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure we shoudln't have walked around? It feels like we're desecrating a graveyard.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a 5 mile detour around this forest, through boulders and glaciers.\" whispered<br>\r\n<br>\r\nback Cato, \u00a0\"This way is much faster.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 The men heard a faint rustling that came from something other than them, and froze, staring at where the noise had come from.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Keep going, men!\" prodded Cato<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But where did that come from?\" whispered Temeritas worriedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It probably just came from us. Keep going, we have no time to lose!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe men continued forward cautiously, huddling closer and closer in fear of the dark, silent woods around them. Once again, a rustling came from outside the group. This time, however, it was closer, but somehow quieter, like whatever had made it was deliberately trying to remain unheard. The men froze once again, even Cato. For several tense moments, nothing happened. No noise, no light, and a faint, musky smell was all there was this deep in the forest. Suddenly, a loud smack was heard and Jason shreiked in pure horror, violently torn away from the group by an enormous, black paw that emerged from between the trees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get Jason!\" shouted Verres.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe men ran after the spot in the trees the paw had come out of, tripping over the undergrowth. Fortis had the air knocked out of him as a black paw smacked his chest and dug into his flesh as it pulled him towards his owner. Fortis came face to face with a 16 foot tall bear with fur so black it could hardly be distinguished from the forest around it. Fortis began fumbling with his sword and stabbed the enormous paw with it, put its grip didn't loosen, and the bear instead slammed Fortis into a tree, crushing Fortis's chet until his ribs started to snap. But the bear's grip loosened as the other men began to ditract it. Maximus wrestled with it, wrapping his enormous arms around the beast's neck, while Jonas and Temeritas mindelessly sliced into its legs. Calus fired arrows deep into the giant bear's eyes as Verres slit its throat, ending the fight as the beast's blood gushed out onto all of them. Cato helped fortis up, and wrapped his bleeding chest with cloth from his pack. He then ran over to Jason, who was bleeding profusely. Everyone breathed a sigh of releif as the writhing beast finally went still, blood still dripping from its neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you talk, Jason?\" asked Cato.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes.\" he breathed weakly. \"Cato, I could tell that sound came from something following us, it grabbed me because it knew I could tell it was there. You should've stopped.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, I didn't think there would be anything that could survive in this silent forest, there's no prey.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think that giant bear was the reason this place is silent.\" said Verres. His words gave all of them shivers. Jonas tried to lighten them all up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I doubt there's room for two giant beasts in such a cramped forest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And think about how much meat there is on that thing.\" added Temeritas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And there won't be any maggots to spoil the meat.\" said Calus, \"No flies could fly over all those glaciers to get here, and there's nothing for them to live on in this empty forest anyways.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe men nodded in agreement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, lads, lets get this thing up to the glaciers, we need the beat frozen before it spoils. Jason, Fortis, you can hang back, of course.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I can still help.\"\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis tried to help them lift the<br>\r\n<br>\r\n4 ton beast, but winced in pain as his broken rib stabbed his lungs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Never mind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe men awkwardly struggled to carry the giant corpse trough the thick woods. The way out was far shorter than the way in, with the heavy tension out of the air, Fortis realized it had only taken them half an hour to get through the forest not counting the bear, the cove was only half a mile across, it was just impossible to tell from the inside. Once the men were out of the silent woods, they climbed up the bouldery slopes to reach the glaciers, and set the enormous beast onto the ice. Fortis, unabled to help carry the bear, had instead grabbed as many sticks and branches as he could for a fire. \u00a0He started the fire going with some flint as Jonas and Temeritas went back to the woods for more. Cato continued to care for Jason's wounds, while Calus, Max, and Verres began cutting up the enormous beast. Verres extracted the most valuable internal organs to<br>\r\n<br>\r\nand tenderest portion of the meat to cook and eat for the night, while Max and Calus cut up the majority of the beast and the mountain goat into tiny strips, salting them and laying them out in the ice and sun to make impromptu jerky. By the time the sun was low in the sky, their meal was nearly ready.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why'd you keep the offal and cook it, Verres?\" complained Temeritas, \u00a0\"I'm not eating like a barbarian.\"\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Quit whining, boy. Don't you know the offal is the most filling part?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Full of shit, is what it is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Soon the meal was sizzling in pots, pans, helmets, shields, and other makeshift cooking utensils over the fire. Fortis dug into the beast's heart, which was nearly as large as his head, while Maximus hoarded the intestines, slurping up the beast's small intestines, which were over a 100 feet long, like thy were noodles. Jonas and Temeritas only pecked at their food, not trusting it, while Calus and Verres split the liver between them. Cato<br>\r\n<br>\r\nmethodically fed the injured jason peices of the tender meat of the giant bear's flank, which Jonas and Temeritas stared at enviously. Cato also busied himself making bear grease out of the fat around its kidneys, drinking some of it for himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, never thought I'd say this, but I am full!\" boomed Maximus, the oversized rookie patting his newly round belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyone want some?\" he asked, offering up a shield filled with the leftover intestine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do!\" shouted Fortis, as he took the shield from Max.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Could you get me some if that too?\"said Verres. Fortis scraped some of the offal into Verres's helmet, and then dug in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Soon, all that remained in the sky was a halfmoon and the stars. Fortis layed out his 12 by 12 foot sleeping roll and wrapped himself tightly against the freezing Tozhgovan night, quickly falling asleepfrom his overlyfull stomach against the snores of his already sleeping comrades.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The freezing nights of the glacier filled peaks would kill most men, but the enormous, thick and muscular Electi slept through the below zero night with only thin sleeping rolls, their prodigious body heat doing the rest. Cato was the first to get up, blowing a small bugle to arouse the others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, lets go, we need to get to get to Pyolt before sunrise! Jupiter, Cannius, Maximus, start collecting the bear jerky in your packs. Everyone else, go help them, we need to move quickly!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis groaned as he stretched out his enormous body and rubbed his eyes clear, and then walked over to where the makeshift jerkey had been left out to dry. The sun and the ice had freeze dried the jerkey over the day and night, and now the 10 men had over 4 tons of rubbery bear meat to take back with them. Of course, no mountainian man would mind the flavor, meat was still meat to the voracious, musular giants.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 With the enormous pile of jerkey finally collected, the mountainian men set out for Pyolt, each of them carrying over 900 pounds of the jerkey with them, enough to exhaust even the toughest of the king's chosen.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Cato, of course, was exempted from meat bearing duty. His job was to navigate the men over the shifting fields of boulders and ice that surrounded the hidden valley of pyolt, making steady progress until the mid afternoon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, men, keep going!\" urged Verres, leading the pack of lumbering, panting giants behind Cato.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Remember, we get to eat once we reach Pyolt, so get your asses moving!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe panting men made a half assed attempt to pick up the pace, cracking the crusty layer of frozen sweat collecting on their bodies, but soon slowed down to a snail's pace obce more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Fortis heard the crunch of reaking ice and a shout from behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJupiter was trapped waist deep in a crevasse withing the ice, swearing as loud as he could in an attempt to ignore the pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damnit, Jupiter!\" shouted Cassius, \"We don't have time to be clumsy. Can someone get the fuck over here and help me get him out?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0The men crowded around Jupiter, using all of their strength to pop him out. Fortis winced as his broken ribs dug into his chest at the strain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Jupiter finally slipped out, but the angle his leg was twisted was a dead indicator of his inablity to walk right further. He attempted to put his weight on the twisted leg, but retracted it in pain the moment it touched the ground. Jupiter fumbled for a solution to keep hinself upright, grabbing his longsword and using it as an impromptu walking stick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Hours later, as the sun began to dip below the horizon, the men reached the pyolt valley. Pyolt, like the valley of the silent forest they'd killed the bear in, was completely isolated from the outside world by mountains and glaciers, an ideal place for an private masse meet up of Mountainia's most elite soldiers many miles within Vladian territory. Smoke was rising from the forests beloe from countless small pits as the army camped out spread everywhere. The camp's were split up by century, so Fortis's troops stumbled into the circle of tents where the imposing figure of centurion Gregorium stood in the center.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No surprise, the greenies are late. It looks like they've already have 3 casualties, and we haven't even had a single battle.\" jabbed Darius. His words were met with laughs from his comrades.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, we had a battle all right. With a giant bear taller than any of you.\" boomed Fortis, taking the beast's head out of his pack. The other men dropped their overloaded sattles full of bear jerky to the ground. The other men of the century could only look in shock at the fearsome thing cradles between Fortis's thick arms. The bear's head was as thick as Fortis's chest, an impressive feat considering that the 10 foot hunk's chest was larger by itself than the entire body of most mountanians.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dinner's courtesy of us tonight. A lot better than a couple of skinny mountain goats, eh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0A few minutes later, all of the men of the 8th century were gathered around Gregorium.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Valor has ordered that the different centuries not know of eachother's battle plans lest one get caught and reveal all the others.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who cares what valor says.\" cried a soldier sitting to Darius's left. \"Martinus would have us fighting the Vladians in direct combat, not sneaking around like weasels.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aye!\" resounded the men around him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did we not already disuss this? There is to be no insubordination! Valor may be a bit unscrupulous but from what I've heard he's a tactical genius. I expect precise obedience to his commands!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe men murmured apology.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now where were we? Ah, yes. Century VIII's job is to masquerade as a foreign merchant caravan and wander through the Vladian countryside until we reach Brochka. Our goal is to get inside the city without suspicion and to attack warlord Dmitri's stronghold in the heart of the city while the Vladian's are distracted by the remainder of the Mille electi when they arrive to attack the walls. This is the most forward and dangerous role in the army. Whatever happens, we must not get caught. Are we ready, men?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aye!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith their breifing done, the men began to eat their dinner, Max passing out the bear jerky to anyone who wanted some, there being more than enough to go around. Darius and his contubernium shamefully refused the meat, having been upstaged by Fortis's men.</span></div></div>",

We hope to see you again when things quiet down\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Minerva hailed off Mr. Tibbs as he departed the mansion for the last time. He was the last of the Vanderstorm's servants to quit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 For the last three weeks, ever since the Denokkian woman and her convoy had shown up in town, the villagers had changed from being friendly to hostile. The woman riled them up, and now they openly decried the Vanderstorm name and had harassed their servants when they came downto market. So far, no one had actually tried to attack the mansion itself, but Minerva feared it was only a matter of time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0 \"I can't believe the villagers would do that!\"Cried Minerva to her grandmother. \"Attacking a harmless little man just for working for us! Why do they hate us so much! What is wrong with them! My borther Fortis has kept his dukedom wealthy and secure, and this is their reward?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Minerva, my girl, calm down.\" Consoled Athena, in the most maternal tonr she could manage.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know they are not doing this out of their hearts. That woman in the marketplace speaks with an underlying and persuasive evil to her voice. It feels like Valleyan magic is enhancing her words, but something's off about it, I can't put my finger on it. Well, no matter, with no servants to go to the marketplace for food, you'll have to do it yourself. I'm afraid there's nothing we can do about it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Minerva groaned and went in her room to put on her poor person disguise. Almost a month holed up in a mansion had already taken the life out of Minerva's face, but she needed a tattered robe to finish the ensemble of a refugee. As Minerva had two weeks ago cut her long, raven hair into a messy black mane, with this disguise, she was nearly unrecognizable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Down the path to the village Minerva went. She made sure to approach the marketplace from a different direction than the path to the Vanderstorm mansion, so people would think she was yet another refugee coming from the North.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Today, there was something new in the marketplace. The woman was still babbling on about how the villagers were mobilizing for some war, the villagers staring at her entranced, but next to her convoy was a squad of six fearsome looking soldiers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \"Those guys sure weren't here yesterday.\" thought Minerva, Nearly drooling as she stared at them. They loomed as tall, even taller, than her titanic brother Fortis, but unlike Fortis, who stood tall, proud, and strong, these men had darting eyes and nervouse postures, ready to dart any minute. They bore scars all over their bodies, and their muscles were sinewy, knotted and battle tempered. She quickly turned around when one of them looked back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Hey, look at that girl over there! A sight to sore eyes.\" Said one of the soldiers gruffly, elbowing one of his comrades.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I could have some of her.\" commented another. \"Blanca hasn't let us have any fun on the way here. This might be our last chance, boys!\"\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Minerva darted, trying to hide in the crowd, but her hood was grabbed by a large, outstretched hand before she could escape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can't leave until we have our fun, now.\" her captor chortled, his strong hands preventing her escape despite desperate struggle. But his grip loosened as Minerva heard a loud cry of pain right behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nivos, what is wrong with you!\" shouted the largest and toughest looking of the men, most likely their captain, who had just given Nivos a strong fist to the face. \"And the rest of you too! I can't believe you'd take advantage of an innocent refugee like that. Could you imagine what it's been like for her, a young girl travelig alone without anyone to protect her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \"Yes, Commander Spes.\" they all replied, guilty looks on their faces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \"Remember what Marina told us, men. She said we are fighting this war to end the tyranny of our monarchy, and to bring a new era of hope and change to mountania, and defeat the Vladians. Raping innocent girls will do nothing to this end!\" Spes scolded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \"Now, is there anything we can do to repay you?\" said Spes, turning to Minerva and using a much softer tone of voice.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \"No, I'm fine. I'm just heading to my uncle's place in Fantasmia.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Don't lie like that. Your a young girl traveling by herself in the countryside. And you're all skin and bones too. At the very least we can offer you a place to stay for the night. I doubt you are sleeping in inns every night.\" The towering soldier asked, his deep and soothing voice almost impossible to say no to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \"No, I really need to get going.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you really have to.\" He replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Minerva scurried away from the men and into the stalls of the marketplace. She got all the bread, food, and meat they needed for the week, thankfully not getting recognized, and scurried back to the Vanderstorm mansion under a midday sun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0When Minerva entered the estate, she was met with a surprise. Two children, a girl and a boy, both looking to be around ten, were running around in the entrance hall, and Athena and some other, younger looking woman were talking in the dining room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Grannie, who are they?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Child, don't be so rude! This is duchess Lieben and her kids, don't you remember seeing her when you were little?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Athena turned to Mrs. Lieben.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, this is my granddaughter Minerva, the one i was talking about. I'm sorry she was so rude. I swear, that child has no manners. I think her older brothers are rubbing off on her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, its nothing. I'd be surprised if she wasn't tense after all of this.\" Lieben replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, its time I gave you two a proper introduction.\" said Athena. \"Minerva, this is duchess Lieben, she'll be staying with us untilthis thing blows over. Her husband was called off to war, and her castle was sacked by rebelling villagers, so she's under a lot of stress right now. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 And those kids running in the hall are Daphnia and Angelos.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Minerva stared around the house. The handsome wood paneling lit up by candles and oil-lamps. Here and there, handsome, brightly-polished suits of armour stood on stands. On the walls hung large portraits of dashing knights, warriors and men. A glimpse into the family's past as a branch of Mountania's proud military aristocracy, which protected the peasantry and commonfolk, in return for land and money and favours from the king and his family. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinerva headed upstairs, her beautiful gown fluttering on the stairs. She held a lamp in one hand, while candles burning against the walls lit the way ahead. She stopped at the top of the landing to look at all the doors. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the far end, the Master's bedroom. A heavy black mourning-curtain was hung over the doors. Fortis had not yet taken up residence here. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNear to the master's bedroom was Fortis's bedroom, then Cannius's, then Jupiter's, then Minerva's. And then on the other side of the corridor, dressing-rooms, store-rooms and guest bedrooms. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough Minerva knew that her brothers adored her and doted on her and treasured her and protected her and loved her and were always happy to do anything to please her...there was always one big payment that she always had to make. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was never allowed in her brothers' bedrooms except in an emergency. She was never exactly afraid of her brothers, for all their strength and size, but she never dared to tempt fate and cross them! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut now the house was empty! She wanted to explore! It was just her grandmother, the maids and her friend Eldonia at home. And by the sounds downstairs, Eldonia had discovered the harpsichord in the front parlour. Minerva opened her brother Jupiter's bedroom and tiptoed in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe lit the candles and stared around. The furniture was old, dark and heavy-looking. In the corner, she could see his work-table. Jupiter loved making models. He built houses and castles and all kinds of things. When she was younger, he'd built her a massive doll's house modeled after their real house! Minerva always found it funny that someone like Jupiter was able to do such delicate cutting, measuring, gluing and nailing. He was usually a bit of a klutz! But she supposed, alone, by himself, in a quiet little sanctuary, he could relax and indulge his passions. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinerva then tried Cannius's bedroom. Here, she could see sketches for metal parts that her brother was hoping to make. Cannius loved metalwork. He had all these sketches on his desk about what he was going to build and hammer and bend and heat and shape. But the room that Minerva was most interested in was that of her oldest brother. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortis was now lord of the manor. Lord of the estate. Lord of the entire county. An entire slice of the kingdom belonged...in theory...to him. And it remained his so long as he was able to govern it as the king's local representative. One look in Fortis's room made Minerva think that her brother would not be having any issues with this. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe entire room was all about size and strength. As the oldest and tallest and largest of her brothers, the bed was massive. It had to accommodate his entire body, stretched out, so it was over a dozen feet long. The ceilings, as everywhere else in the house, were high and lofty. His wardrobe was extensive and here and there were weapons-racks and frames holding suits of armour. Most of these were now, of course, empty, having being called into service. Minerva stood in the middle of the room, taking it all in... </span></div></div>",

Lady Eldonia curtsied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My looooordy-lordy-lordy...\" she said, staring up at his colossal frame. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well!\" said Fortis. \"Nice to meet you too\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldonia straightened up. \"Lady Eldonia, my lord\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fortis.

She had a thing for big mountain men. Minerva sighed. Watching her older brother show off was nauseating. Minerva had been surrounded...literally and figuratively, by big hulking Mountanians her whole life...Perhaps she got sick of it? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it did make her want more from someone than just muscles and bulk. Perhaps that's why she found the Crown Prince so attractive? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Minnie, why don'tcha go find somethin' to do, huh?\" Fortis called out. \"Lady Eldonia here wants me to um...help her with stuff...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure Fortis...\" Minerva sighed. She left the room and closed the door behind her. As she headed away, she heard a muffled squeal coming from behind the door and the creaking of bedsprings as they settled under her older brother's significant bulk. Great. Another night of passion... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinerva wandered through the castle. </span></div></div>",

He had dark, dirty-blond hair and dark blue eyes. He was small compared to his father, but large compared with other boys his own age. Despite being on the cusp of his teenage years, he was already six feet tall and was beginning to grow handsome musculature from his extensive training.

For a number of reasons. And it's important that you spend time with these people and use your abilities to protect them, help them, befriend them and show that you are a polite, understanding, responsible and capable member of the blood royal\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh-huh...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeviathan sighed. Then he just said it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Son, your mother and your grandfather and I are...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The holy trinity, I know\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...ARE SENDING YOU...\" said Leviathan, getting frustrated with his son's attitude, \"To Fatlantis!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT!?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGladius sat up in bed, staring at his father. \"YOU'RE DOING WHAT!?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are GOING there and that's final!\" said the king. \"And you'll stay there and you'll learn and you'll appreciate and you'll like it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No I won't!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You will if I say you will, boy!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! Wh-what am I gonna DO there?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have been chosen to fulfil a very important historical and diplomatic post in the king's court in Regis City\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What post!?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bodyguard to the Royal Princes\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh...WHAT!? No I won't!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yes you will. It is a longstanding and honoured position to be raised within the royal court of the Fatlantean kings in return for the protection and safety of their offspring. And you WILL be going there and you WILL fulfil your post of royal bodyguard! Do you understand me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way! I won't do it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YES WAY, YOU'LL PACK AND LEAVE TOMORROW MORNING!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT!? No!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why don't you want to go?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh...Geez pops! What do I have to do? Spell it out?\"<br>\r\n\"Humor me\". <br>\r\n\"I'm not going! I won't be some babysitter to some stupid, fat, rich, pampered, spoilt, overfed, gluttonous, greedy, disgusting blob-whales who can hardly touch their own...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yes you will!\" said Leviathan. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why!?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because it is an excellent opportunity for you to improve on your courtly etiquette, it will teach you civility, humility, strength, respect, obedience, how to respond to persons of authority, how to use your strength and your abilities in positive and helpful ways...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can do all that here without having to babysit...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guard, son. Not babysit! Guard. You are their BODYGUARD. Besides, the princes will have their own servant-boys to care for them\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y...yeah?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeviathan nodded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And think about it son...You'll be in a big, luxurious palace. Lots of good food. Big rooms. Sunlight. Fresh air. Lots of space to go horse-riding, hunting, jousting, fencing, wrestling, do your weight-training...And I'm reliably informed that they'll have plenty of heavy work for you to do\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like what?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shovelling coal, chopping wood, doing laundry...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Laundry is NOT heavy work. I'm not gonna blow my guns and pecs folding tea-towels!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeviathan laughed. \"You might be called on by the servant-girls who work in the royal laundry to help carry some of the heavier loads of washing...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Seeerrrvant girls...huh...?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you'll keep yourself chaste and clean at all times!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awww...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you'll be the biggest, strongest boy there\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGladius raised an eyebrow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh-huh. No Cassius around, showing off. No Triton trying to compete with you. You'll be the strongest, most physically powerful boy there\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened to BIG?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, with the Fatlantean princes around, I don't think you'll be considered THAT big...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGladius smirked. Yeah. He guessed not. Still...<i>Sweeeet</i>...</span></div></div>",

I promise!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If it is, I'm gonna come back here and rip your magical head off your shoulders!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMerlin vanished and reappeared at the other side of Gladius's bedroom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gotta catch me first, Muscles!\" Merlin chuckled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGladius scowled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on!\" said Merlin, \"I'm supposed to be sending off to the palace now! Hurry up!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright alright...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young warrior prince, a knight-in-training officially, stared at a large mirror that hung near his bed. A tall, handsome warrior prince, a rebel and troublemaker at heart, with dirty brown-blond hair, a tan and dark eyes stared back at him. The reflection sighed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hell...Alright let's do it...\" said Gladius. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMerlin grabbed Gladius's travelling-trunk with all the other luggage for his extended stay in the kingdom of lard stacked on top, with one hand and indicated that Gladius had to take hold of his other arm with his own hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ouch!\" Merlin winced. \"Gladdy! I said HOLD! Not break!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith his free hand, Merlin flicked his wand. A bright flash of blue light engulfed the room! When the light vanished, the two young teens found themselves in an enormous, cavernous foyer with a massive fountain which bubbled lemonade. Sunlight streamed through large windows set above a pair of enormous, high doors. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow!\" said Gladius. His voice echoed around the vast chamber. \"This is some palace!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I sent a note ahead saying to expect you\", Merlin said. \"I'm sure someone will be here in a couple of minutes to greet you. I gotta go, big guy. I'll see you later!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey wait!\" Gladius said. But in another blinding blue flash, the boy wizard, and Gladius's only granule of familiarity in this alien kingdom was gone! Gladius stared around the enormous chamber. He didn't have to leave this room to know that the entire palace would be just as enormous. Just as vast. Just as opulent, rich, expensive, expansive and amazing! The palace at Ferramount was just a large, to be sure. But it had none of this grandeur. None of the huge windows and the light. None of the creamy marble or the glittering fountains. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGladius sighed. </span></div></div>",

He had his writing-case. He had his book-case, he had boxes and bags for shoes and weapons and knives and all kinds of miscellaneous objects. He sighed. He was gonna be here for a VERY long stay. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HELLO!?\" he called out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere wasn't any answer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HELLO!!\" he yelled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill no answer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing, Gladius opened a long, wooden case with handsome brass edges. Inside, resting in rich, dark red velvet were two daggers, two shortswords and a broadsword. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, Gladius lifted out the largest of the blades and then stood perfectly still. Then, he started shadow-sparring! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe heavy blade whistled and thrummed through the air was he swiped, stabbed, slashed, hacked and sliced! He shifted, thrust, engaged, disengaged, blocked and whirled around to fight off two imaginary opponents at once! If there was at least one thing that Queen Athena and King Leviathan agreed on, it was that their second son was a formidable and skilled swordsman and all-round fighter. Not as advanced in his training as his older brother, perhaps, but still plenty talented, and certainly enough to give anyone a good run for their money. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGladius continued to slice and hack at invisible enemies! He whirled around until he was facing a ramp that led up to a long cross hall that ran past the throne-room doors. He stopped when he realised that eyes were looking at him! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho was staring at him? </span></div></div>",

En garde you disgusting barbarians! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yaaah!\" Gladius shouted as he swung his sword around! Then he froze. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe prince stared at a warped reflection in the blade of his sword. He twisted around, sword out, to face whatever dared to sneak up behind him! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was when he saw them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeeking out behind a large pillar were two round, chubby faces. One with dark blond hair and one with a lighter blond hair, slightly darker than Merlin's. The brown-blond Mountain prince stared at the two new additions to the population of the room and frowned. The two faces belonged to two boys. The faces were round, fat and full, with blue and green eyes respectively. One boy waddled slowly out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-hello?\" the boy said nervously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGladius's eyes narrowed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who are you?\" he asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who are you?\" the boy asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGladius swung his sword in a wide arc and then slid it smartly back into his scabboard. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Gladius. Prince Gladius...um...from Mountania...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...\" said the boy. \"Oh you must be the one that father was talking about\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah?\" Gladius asked. \"And who are you?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...um...I'm...I'm Cameron and um...this is my brother Edmund\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCameron stared at the alien being. He was tall. About a head taller than himself. He also looked older. His skin was about the same tone, but it was tight, muscular and well-formed. He had impressive muscles and dirty blond-brown hair and dark, green eyes. His hair was kinda longish, too, and swept back. He looked mean! His shoulders were broad. Arms muscular. Chest insanely well-developed, and he posessed a tight set of abdominal muscles. His face was angular and handsome. He looked like a troubled, trouble-seeking kind of boy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGladius stared at the two enormous princes! They were truly stupendous! Their faces were round and full and they had massive jowls and cheeks. Their chins folded down, one over the other in three sloping rolls, their jowls, cheeks and chins melting into their round, broad, soft shoulders and their wide, heavy, sagging chests with enormous sagging, full boy-breasts that jiggled and bounced when they moved. Their arms were wide and chubby and very soft, with rolls of fat segmenting them like the sections of extremely fat catapillars. Their hands looked smallish by comparison, and were chubby and plump! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir enormous bellies sagged down and were roughly spherical in shape and size. These too, jiggled and wobbled heavily as they plodded slowly towards this intruder on their home. Their huge legs rubbed together and their large, fat feet shuffled across the smooth, cool marble. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you must be our new bodyguard\", Cameron ventured. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGladius shrugged an impressive shoulder. \"I guess so\", he said. \"Um...yeah nice to um...meet you...\" he added. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey slowly and carefully shook hands. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is uh...this is...some place you got here...\" Gladius said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks!\" said Cameron. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So how old are you?\" Edmund asked, speaking for the first time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thirteen!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're awfully BIG for 13!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well how old are you?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm twelve! And Cameron's 13 too!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you guys are awful big too!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww thanks...We try...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah I can see that\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGladius packed his sword away and then picked up the huge pile of luggage. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...Where's my room?\" </span></div></div>",

They could barely waddle! How could they possibly help him carry his luggage!? With a grunt, he hefted his trunks and boxes and bags up in his arms. The pile of luggage was so high he could only JUST see over the top!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay...\" said Cameron, a little taken aback at Gladius's strength! \"...Um...Follow us!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt once, Gladius could see why Cameron and Edmund would require a bodyguard. To begin with, they were enormously fat! Real targets for assassins or molesters, assaulters, cutpurses, robbers and other lowlifes. But very soon afterwards, Gladius saw the other reason why they needed a bodyguard! They moved like snails! Even though each prince carried an ornate walking-stick with them to take some of the weight off their feet, they waddled along at a, at least to Gladius's eyes, agonisingly slow pace! Cameron's belly sloshed and jiggled as he panted and plodded along. It swayed from side to side and his generous buttocks quivered and rippled as his huge thighs and calves shifted to move him ponderously ahead. Gladius couldn't say with any certainty that Edmund moved much faster! Gladius wasn't complaining too much, though. With all his luggage, Gladius wasn't able to do much more than a slow power-walk! He was beginning to regret refusing whatever assistance it was that Cameron and his brother were thinking of offering him! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they headed down the corridors, past flaming torches and candles, Gladius stopped and stared at multitudes of portraits that hung from the walls, pausing every few feet to look at the subjects and to read the shiny brass plaques hammered onto the picture-frames. He recognised a few names from his studies of foreign kingdoms. King Daniel the Great. King Chandler the Kind. Darius the Grand. Jacob the Small. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGladius stopped in front of one portrait. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey who's that?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCameron halted and shuffled slowly around. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who?...Oh! That's Prince Javelin. He was one of your ancestors, I bet. That's him after he defeated Lord Malevous, who was torching villages and burning crops...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cool...\" said Gladius. \"I wonder how we're related?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's probably your Great...something...Uncle\", Cameron pondered. \"Come on!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter more doorways, corridors, occasional pauses for breath, interruptions from portrait-watching and Gladius stopping to pick up boxes that slid and fell off the top of the tower of luggage that he was carrying, they finally reached the royal family's private chambers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCameron started pointing out the doors to the enormous private apartments. Each person who slept here had not only his own bedroom, but his own bathroom, dining-room, living-room, storage-room, closets and even private sleeping-quarters for their personal servants! They weren't really bedrooms, they were more like miniature houses built into the palace compound! Gladius was impressed! Back home, his room wasn't exactly spartan, but it wasn't anywhere near this opulent! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's father's room\", Cameron said, pointing to one enormous set of doors. \"...And this one here belongs to mother. This suite here is actually the royal nursery...It's empty right now. This suite here is my room! And over here is Eddie's. Your private apartment will be this one here, down the corridor\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCameron waddled up to a crossroads in the corridors and pointed to the right. \"That's your room\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks!\" said Gladius. He shuffled towards it and Cameron unlocked the doors and handed Gladius the keys to his bedroom on a long chain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Mountain prince entered his new domain and with a grunt, he clunked the trunks down at the foot of his bed. He got up and slowly stretched his back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooooooooh man!\" he groaned. He stared around the room and started exploring it. There was a dining-nook in the corner by the windows, a large fireplace, armchairs and a couch and a low table in front of the hearth, a large wardrobe, a private bathing-chamber and toiletries room, and a storage-room fitted with shelves and cupboards. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Servants will clean the room for you each day at noon\", Cameron explained. \"When you'll be having luncheon with our family. If you want anything special done, just leave a note here on your desk. Like having a bath drawn or building, lighting or fueling the fire. They'll do stuff like change the bed-linen, replace candles, fill up lamps, replace wicks, sweep the hearth, gather clothing...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do I do!?\" Gladius asked. Although he was a prince, Gladius was never one for being waited on hand and foot! In Mountania, such sloth and laziness was strongly discouraged! And especially for a member of the royal family! Gladius's grandfather, Old King Hercules always maintained that keeping clean and active was just another way to build muscles and strengthen the body. Looking at Cameron and Edmund, Gladius doubted that they'd ever lifted a single finger in work their entire lives! Gladius was sometimes even used to splitting his own firewood! He doubted Cameron or Edmund had ever seen an axe! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well the job of the princely bodyguard is to guard the bodies of the princes...or princesses...only we don't have any sisters\", said Cameron. <br>\r\n\"Well duh!\" said Gladius, \"I mean, what ELSE do I do? I mean I can't imagine you guys go out very often!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCameron and Edmund looked hurt! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGladius bowed his head. \"Sorry...Father complains my tongue moves too freely at times\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCameron nodded in a \"<i>suuure it does</i>\", kind of way. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well apart from that, your job will be to maintain order among the underservants\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The what?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The underservants. All the servant-children who work in the palace\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have child-servants?\" Gladius asked. He was surprised. In the Mountanian court, where work was usually a lot more strenuous, most servants were teenaged or older! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well most of the work isn't that hard\", Cameron said. \"And besides, a lot of them are homeless children. We adopt them from poorhouses and orphanages and put them to work in the palace\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That doesn't sound very nice\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, it's either starving in the streets, being locked up in a poorhouse or working in service\", Cameron said, his voice sounding rather hot, \"And if they work here then at least they get some skills and learn something, and they get food and clothes and a home and...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're right!\" said Gladius, holding up a hand. \"You're right...I'm sorry...again\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGuessing that Cameron and Edmund both probably had small armies of servant-boys to attend to their every single want and need that could possibly ever arise, Gladius surmised that it probably wasn't such a surprise that they were so enormously fat! The prince was about to get confirmation of his suspicions when four boys appeared. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boys all looked about the same age. Gladius would find out later that all four boys were twelve. The boys were very short. Gladius at six feet tall, must've looked like a giant to them! Cameron and Edmund stood a few inches taller than the boys and from the way the boys were acting, Gladius suspected that these were the prince's personal servants. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boys wore a uniform of sorts. White short pants that went down to just below their knees, and white, button-down, short-sleeved tops, with lashings of gold along the shoulders, sleeves, cuffs, seams, pocket-edges and handsome, shiny brass buttons. Despite their obvious status as servants, Gladius could see that the boys were fell-fed, their gold and white tunics failing to hide their delightfully round pot-bellies, nor their shorts hiding their chubby thighs or buttocks. Each boy had a double-chin in various stages of development, from a full double-crease and almost no sign of a neck, to just a soft fullness to the face. Their arms and hands also, were chubby, doubtless from dozens of good meals served and eaten in the royal servants' quarters. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe four boys made their obediences and bowed at once to their royal masters. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gladius, I want you to meet our servant-boys\", Cameron said. \"Gladius, this is...Ryan, Ethan,...Samson and Jeremy. Ryan and Ethan are my servants. Samson and Jeremy serve my brother Edmund. Boys, this is Prince Gladius. He'll be living in the palace now as our bodyguard, companion and Keeper of the King's Peace for the Underservantry. You're to treat him with every respect you give anyone else of royal station and you will address him accordingly\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe four boys nodded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good!\" said Cameron. \"So Gladius, what do you want to do first?\" </span></div></div>",

Walk with me\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Master Cameron\".<br>\r\n\"As you wish, my lord\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdmund dismissed his servants and prepared to follow his older brother around their palatial dwelling. With Ryan in-tow, the three princes started walking...very slowly...around the palace. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is the king's study, his secretary's study, the library, the map-room, the archives...\" Cameron said. \"This is the Queen's Parlour. Along here and through these doors are various courtiers' offices and meeting-rooms and so-forth. This here is the East Drawing Room. We spend most of our time at night in here after dinner\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGladius opened a massive pair of double doors. He stuck his head in and marvelled at the enormous and grand chamber beyond, with a massive fireplace and huge, towering windows all along one wall. He whistled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's SOME room!\" he said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCameron blushed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This rampway leads up to the second storey. There's courtiers' suites up here with their own private servants' quarters, and more offices and storage-rooms and so-forth. Then this is the gallery over the foyer. That's the foyer down there...and these doors and those over there lead into the Stranger's Gallery...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The what?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's where commoners can gather to view the throne-room beyond, when the palace is open to the public\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I see the throne-room?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You haven't already? Oh okay...Come on! This way\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCameron led Gladius downstairs. Gladius was surprised that two such obese princes could waddle so far! But then he reasoned that their legs were probably immensely strong from carrying them around everywhere all the time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ryan, open the door\", Cameron said. Ryan pushed open a pair of gigantic double doors into a huge chamber beyond which was all light marble and red carpets and clean, cool-coloured walls. At the far end was an immense, massive dias the size of a theatre-stage! On it, under a large canopy were enormous thrones and foot-stools for the members of the royal family. Sitting on their thrones were the king and queen, apparently eating luncheon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aaah!\" said an enormously fat man. A gigantic blob who had to weigh three tons at least! He shuffled in his throne, his dark blond, bearded face smiling as the boys approached. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YOU must be Prince Gladius!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...\" Gladius began. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's papa\", Cameron whispered, \"King David the Vast, people call him\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...yeah!\" said Gladius. \"I...I mean 'Yes sir!...Yes your Majesty...um...Majesties\", he added. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGladius bowed awkwardly. 'Majesty' was certainly a title well-deserved! These people were TREMENDOUS! Queen Isobel was a vast woman with large, bountiful breasts and long, slightly curly, wheat-coloured hair. She smiled sweetly at Gladius, who blushed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Showing him around the palace, boys?\" the Queen asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, mother!\" said Edmund brightly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good! Good! It's important he knows where EVERYTHING is!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes mother!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Boys\", said King David. \"You should take Gladius to see...\" <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Yeah...good point!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, Gladius\", said Cameron. \"We'll show you where it is\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe princes led their new bodyguard through the palace and down a long, low ramp that went down to the servants' quarters. They showed him the kitchens and the dormitories, the store-rooms, the servants' quarters and countless other chambers and offices, store-cupboards, rooms and passageways. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"These doors lead into the servants' hall\", said Edmund. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyan, Prince Cameron's servant-boy, opened the doors and the princes waddled in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt once, the hundreds of servants who filled the hall stopped everything that they were doing and stood up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry for the interruption\", said Crown Prince Cameron, \"But we thought that this was important and that we should tell you when you were all in one place, to save time\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is Prince Gladius of Mountania\", said Prince Edmund. He waddled slowly aside and Gladius smiled and nodded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!\" he said simply. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Prince Gladius has been posted to the royal court as our bodyguard and as a token of goodwill between the Kingdoms of Mountania and Fatlantis\", Prince Cameron said. \"I hope that everyone here will treat him with kindness, friendship, good service and due obedience\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone started chatting and whispering. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That will be all\", said Prince Cameron. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well hold on!\" said Gladius. Without his goody-two-shoes brother Cassius around, Gladius could at last look like a proper Mountanian prince without being measured against his saintly brother. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We are not here to interrupt the servants' meal\", said Cameron. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah, woah, woah...We're here to introduce ME...the biggest...strongest...hottest...handsomest...of the Mountanian princes, sons of His Majesty, the great King Leviathan...to the servants...\" said Gladius. \"Would you deny them the chance to get to know such an excellent specimen of my country's physicality as I? Do not be so heartless, your Royal Highness...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGladius swaggered through the rows of tables and benches, saying \"Hey\" and \"Hi there\" to as many servants as he could touch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So where do you keep all the servant-girls around here...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Prince Gladius, relations with the palace servant-girls are not allowed!\" said Cameron. <br>\r\n\"Yeah but a prince has gotta have a mistress right?...Or...three or four...huh girls?\" <br>\r\n\"Your Royal Highness!\" said Cameron sharply, \"You can't have a...a...companion for your bedchamber until you're of age!\"<br>\r\n\"Correction. I can't have...\" Gladius paused to try and find the right word. \"...experiences with a companion of my bedchamber until I'm of age. But that's not gonna stop me from finding such a companion...What's your name?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stared at a plump, giggling girl with chestnut hair.

He knew that he'd been sent on it purely to keep him out of his father's hair, but still... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young prince continued to explore the palace. He found the palace bakery, butchery, chocolate-maker's, library, the various reception-rooms, and a huge old dusty chamber down in the servants' quarters. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe chamber was vast and dark and accessed by a pair of impressive-looking wood doors. He opened them and headed inside, waving a torch around to see what was what. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey boy!\" Gladius called out to a passing servant-boy, \"What is this place?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's the ol' Smithy!\" the boy said, and kept on waddling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Smithy...huh?\" Gladius mused. He headed inside and started lighting candles. When the room was sufficiently brightened, he was able to look around. He could see the fireplaces, the forges, the racks of old instruments and tools, the anvils, the blocks, the moulds, the benches, the burn-marks, quenching-troughs, water-pumps, wood-piles...None of this looked like it had been used in decades! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerhaps, if King David allowed it, Gladius could turn this into a sort of work-room...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally bored with exploring the palace, Gladius returned to his private apartment where he broke the seal on a large envelope given to him by his father before he left Mountania. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Dear Gladius, <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI write to you now, in the hopes that in writing, I shall say everything in competeness. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mother, grandfather and I, have agreed with King David and Queen Isobel, to send you to the royal court at Fatlantis in Regis City. Here, you will carry out the office of Princely Bodyguard. It will be your job to ensure the safety of the king and queen's two sons, who are not generally capable of ensuring safety of their personages on their own... </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nGladius snorted! He wondered WHY? They had to weigh a thousand pounds each! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"...this is a great and honourable position which you have been selected for.

We expect you to be civil, polite, protective and friendly to them and to make friends with them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith love, <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour father. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeviathan, King of Mountania\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nGladius sighed.

He groaned and just lay in bed on his stomach, comatose and bored... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Clonk-clonk-clonk!!!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hurrrrrgghhh...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Clonk-clonk-clonk!!!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh come in! Come in...What do you want?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doors swung open and Prince Edmund waddled into the room. Gladius rolled over in bed and made a face! The sight of the prince revolted and disgusted him! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe prince was a year younger than he was, but easily three times his weight! He looked barely mobile as he waddled slowly over the threshold and towards the bed, supporting himself with an expensive-looking walking-stick. His blond hair was neat and brushed, and his fat, round face had three chins! His entire body was fat and soft and buttery. It quivered and swayed as he waddled ponderously towards the bed. Gladius noticed an enormous, quadruple-decker burger clutched in a chubby right hand. It was a mess of bread, lettuce, beef and bacon. It oozed melted cheese, ketchup, mustard and barbecue sauce. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey...G-g-Gladius!\" Edmund panted. He waddled slowly into the room. The space between the door and the bed was only a few yards...Gladius's room not being as large, or as grand as other royal bedrooms...but the prince was so awesomely fat that he had to stop halfway to catch his breath, during which he took several large bites out of the monstrous burger in his hand! Gladius watched as Edmund opened his mouth, forced as much of the burger into it as he could, chomped down on it and started chewing, melted cheese, oil, grease, fat and the various sauces and dressings squirting and dribbling down his face. They ran down his jowls and cheeks and over his chins and across the vast, soft, squishy expanse of his chest. He kept chomping on the burger, fat and grease splattering onto the soft, supple curves of his belly. Just eating seemed to be a huge effort for him, because he was gasping and panting the whole time! He finally let out a long, heavy belch, which made his belly quiver. He took another few gasping breaths, and then plodded slowly towards the bed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe collapsed on the bed, which creaked ominously. He groaned and dropped his walking-stick, which hit the floor with a 'clatter!' and rolled away from his feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O...o....ooooooh man...\" he groaned. He sank into the mattress and massaged his bloated, aching belly. \"Oooh dude...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe started rubbing his vast, greasy, sweating belly, belching richly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...\" said Gladius. He was a bit dumbstruck by this overt display of royal sloth and laziness. \"C-c-can I...get you a wash-cloth or a towel or something?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-y-yyeah...\" Edmund gasped. He seemed barely able to breathe! \"T-t-thanks..\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGladius rolled off his bed and headed over to his washstand. He picked up a towel, dipped it in water, wrung it out and then brought it back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C-c-can you...w-wipe me down?\" Edmund gasped. He let out another horrific belch! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What!?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I d-don-don't think I...I can m-move my...my arms!\" Edmund wheezed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGladius knelt down and started rubbing Edmund's belly clean...and his arms...his face...his chest...his chins...his jowls and his chubby hands and fingers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man\", said Gladius, rubbing, patting and wobbling Edmund's belly. He could tell from the warmth and the heavy, stretched feeling that the prince had only just finished what must've been just one of several enormous meals. The prince belched for a third time! He groaned and slumped back against a pile of pillows. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O--o--o--ohhh...\" he groaned. \"D-d-don't...BLURRRRCH!...s-s-stop! Oooh so fuuuuull!\" he whimpered! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGladius slowly started massaging the colossal boy, gradually getting over his shock and alarm! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh man\", he said. \"This is WEIRD!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"B-b-...HIC!...you d-don't h-have t---BUURRP!...'is...i-in m-Mount-tan-tania...\" Edmund struggled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Noooo way man!\" said Gladius. \"Duuude you are HUGE! How can you let yourself GET so fat!?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo Gladius, the IDEA of being this stupendously obese was shocking! He would NEVER allow himself to get to this state! But for a Fatlantean prince... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I..i-it's r-royal d-duty...\" Edmund gasped. He breathed deeply, slowly getting his composure back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Duty!?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Th-the royal f-family h-has to be the f-fattest f-family in the kingdom...\" Edmund panted. \"It's their legitimacy as the right to rule...\" he explained. \"And the royal princes must al-always be the f-fattest...BELCH!...boys in the...k-kingdom. T-To secure the c-continuation of the royal succession an-and to secure a bride and fatter babies...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man...\" said Gladius. This whole idea was totally alien to him! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShifting his massive butt, Edmund sat up and grunted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"T-t-thanks for the...belly rub\", he groaned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what're you doing here?\" Gladius asked, standing up and getting the crick out of his back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I...I heard you...um...You sounded kinda grouchy\", said Edmund, now over his initial bloating enough to talk properly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?...Ooooh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dunno! I've never DONE this before!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rubbed down a fat kid?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ye...well that too! But...I never had to do anything like this! Never had to do bodyguarding stuff or anything!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Papa said it's some sort of longstanding tradition. I think your grandpa was my papa's bodyguard when they were youngsters\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...Well pops didn't tell ME that. I mean I don't even know what I have to DO!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-it's easy!\" said Edmund. \"You gotta protect us when we go out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what exactly does that mean?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, ward off muggers, kidnappers, stuff like that...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HUH! I'd like to see someone try kidnap a fat cow like you!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdmund blushed with pride. \"Thanks!\" he said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what else?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just usual stuff. Keep muggers and kidnappers away, anyone who we ain't comfortable with, watching out for us...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm NOT a servant\", said Gladius, \"I am a PRINCE!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We know that!\" said Edmund. \"We've got SIX servants to look after us! We don't need YOU too!...But you might be called on to help us move around and stuff...you know...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGladius gulped. He nodded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Gladius...\" Edmund asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, perhaps, would you like to...\" </span></div></div>",

Come to think of it, he hadn't seen Edmund's bedroom...or Cameron's for that matter! Since he was their bodyguard, he should probably familiarise himself with them... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great!\" said Edmund, \"Pick up my walking-stick for me\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGladius stared. The handsome, brass-headed walking-stick was probably two feet from where Edmund was sitting on Gladius's bed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...You want me to pick up your stick for you?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I can't do it myself!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You...You can't pick up a stick!?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way, man!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGladius stared at Edmund in shock! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My servants do that kind of stuff for me\", Edmund declared. Gladius sighed. He got down and picked up the stick and handed it to Edmund. He grasped it, leaned on it, and with a grunt, using the weight of his belly to pull himself forwards, he got to his feet. He stumbled a bit, but then stood upright. The bed creaked and slowly reformed its original shape. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man you are FAT!\" said Gladius. Edmund blushed bright red. Realising at last that this was no insult to a fat, royal prince, Gladius kept his mouth shut. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So where's your room?\" Gladius asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Down the corridor a way's\", said Edmund, \"Follow me\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was hardly a difficult thing to do. Edmund, like almost everyone else in the palace who wasn't a servant, seemed to move at a snail's pace! Edmund's walk, like almost everyone else's, was a slow, swaying waddle, throwing his weight forward, shifting one foot forward, leaning back to one side, shifting his other foot forward, and then repeating the process. The result was a pig-like waddle, and a cconstant undulation and quivering of his hundreds of pounds of blubber. It was a fascinating sight and Gladius had never seen anything like it before! So much had he never seen anything like it before, that he couldn't stop staring at it! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man, do you ever stop wiggling around?\" Gladius asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-no\", Edmund panted. They'd only gone a few feet and he was already beginning to break a sweat! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man...\" Gladius said again. It was only his first day here! He was gonna have to get used to a LOT of things! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe prince reached his bedroom and opened the doors and panted his way inside. Gladius followed and whistled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is some room!\" he said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bedroom was enormous! Sunlight streamed in through massive leadlight windows. At one end was a huge canopy bed. There were expensive rugs on the floors, paintings on the walls, expensive-looking furniture, a huge dining-table, chairs, closets, and doors that led off to store-rooms, bathrooms, the prince's personal guest bedroom, and of course, the bedrooms for his personal servant-boys, who jumped up at his entrance and bowed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Master\", one of them said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gladius, this is Samson and...and this is Jeremy\", Edmund said, \"Boys, this is Prince Gladius of Mountania. I think you met him already. The new bodyguard?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes master\", said the boy named Jeremy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm just showing him my room\", said Edmund. \"Come on, G-Gladius...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boys bowed to the new prince.

Merlin suddenly looked worried. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's Timmy...\" Merlin whispered into Edmund's ear, so that Gladius couldn't hear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdmund frowned. \"And?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMerlin took a deep breath and slowly hissed three words: \"...It didn't work...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdmund frowned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...He's very weak.

How was I to know...Oh come on!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdmund started waddling towards the doors, but Merlin grabbed him by the hand and with a flick of his wand, both boys vanished! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGladius stared in shock. What on EARTH was going on!? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrying to ignore the fact that a 1,200 pound boy had just vanished in front of his eyes like a soap-bubble, the young buck stared around the room. As he expected, everything here was literally king-sized. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling bored, he left the prince's bedroom and headed down a corridor towards a huge office on the right hand side. He knocked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come in!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGladius opened the door and entered. Sitting behind an enormous and ornate antique desk in an equally enormous wrought iron chair with lots of padding and cushions on it, was King David. A huge fat arm rested on the desk while the other held a wax stamp. He splodged it down into a pool of blood-red wax on an envelope and handed it to a chubby younger man standing nearby. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cedric, see that goes off at once, won't you?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes your Majesty!\" he said. He bowed, took the envelope and waddled out of the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What can I do for you, young Master Gladius?\" the king asked. \"I trust that you're settling in? Finding your room sufficiently spacious?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...Yeah\", said Gladius, \"Yeah totally, um, very much so\", he said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good! Very good. And my sons? You're getting along well?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I, I really only met them today...but...Eddie...um...Prince Edmund...seems nice\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good! Very good! And what of the Crown Prince, Cameron?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I haven't had a chance yet to really speak to him...him always being hungry and all...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe king let out a hearty laugh. \"Yes! Yes he is that, he IS that! Aah. Such a good boy. You will take to them soon, I hope. Both of them. And be their friend and protector. That is what you are here for\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes sir\", said Gladius. \"Um...I wanted to ask you about a room\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Room? I know nearly every room in this palace. What room?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, it's down in the servants quarters. You go down the last ramp, and you turn right, and it's these two big doors on your left...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Down...right...Oh! Hahaha. Yes that...that hasn't been used in a while. Inside there's fireplaces and benches and stuff...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah that's it!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes! That's the old forge-room. We haven't used it in years! It was built specially for any Mountanian guests who might come to the palace, back when the palace was new. You're the first Mountanian to hold the post of Princely Bodyguard since your grandfather...so it hasn't been used since he became king, and goodness, that was so long ago. I suppose you want to use it?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well. Find some servants who aren't doing anything, and get them to help you clean it out. There's plenty of old scrap metal and whatnot lying around, which you can heat and beat and shape to make new things\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks!\" said Gladius. \"I didn't know Lord Merlin was a friend of your sons...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aaah. His family goes back centuries!\" said the king, \"I think that lad is a friend with the children of every person worth knowing. Cheeky young rascal, but he has his uses...Well run along, Gladius\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGladius bowed, and headed downstairs. He came prepared this time, and brought candles. He fitted them into the wall-sconces, lit them, and then started cleaning out the old forge himself. With all the rich, fattening food around here, he was going to need every last bit of exertion he could get if he expected to keep his perfect princely figure... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe swept, dusted, brushed, gathered, beat, blew, scrubbed, rubbed and shook until he'd gotten the place as clean as he could. Hanging on the walls were various antique tools. Tongs, clamps, hammers, punches...all of various sizes to accomplish various tasks. He polished and cleaned everything, and then went searching for stocks of charcoal, paper, rags and wood. He was at it all day, and by the time he'd done, the forge was back to being hot, smelly, steamy and warm, just like it used to be. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first thing that Gladius had to do was make chains. He'd broken the original chain that hooked to the damper of the forge's chimney, and without a new one, he wouldn't be able to close the damper to stop wind and rain and other things coming down when he didn't want it to. He spent most of his time breaking up the old links and began forging new ones, beating, hammering, shaping and warping. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he worked, he wondered what it'd be like if he saw Cameron or Edmund trying to do this! It was so funny that he laughed, lost concentration, and nearly burnt his arm on the anvil! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter several hours of pounding, hammering and quenching, most of the chain was finished. He'd do the rest the next day. Right now, he had to get to bed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGladius blew out the candles, picked up a five-socket candelabrum, and started upstairs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was very late. By now, the palace was dark and cold. Most of the candles had been blown out and fires left to die in their grates. Gladius shivered. He wrapped his cloak around him tighter. Bloody hell it was cold! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe kept moving, from one room the other. Everything was so weird this late at night! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe entered the enormous East Drawing Room and stared around. There were tables, chairs and all manner of things everywhere. At the far end was a huge fireplace that towered nine feet up! Gladius approached it and whistled. He looked at the large, low tables near the fireplace, and picked up a handsome, gold-framed hand-mirror. He held it up to his face and smiled at himself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFuck, he was a haaaaaaandsome son of a bitch... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Gladius stood there making faces, stroking his hair and wondering how he could possibly be any more gorgeous, he didn't notice the doors behind him swing open. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then, he saw something. It was in the mirror! He opened his mouth in shock! It was... </span></div></div>",

Another one! And behind the last candle was... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was thin, very thin, and pale, and sickly-looking. And with light blond hair. And cold blue eyes! If this was Merlin's idea of a joke, it was a very bad one. But Gladius knew at once that it wasn't Merlin! Merlin never showed up anywhere unless he was either summoned, or came for some important reason. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGladius whirled around! He put down the mirror and rushed to the door! There was no-one there. He peeked out into the corridor and looked left. Then right. He saw it! The face illuminated by the candle! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!\" he called out. Quick as a flash, the face was gone! Gladius sprinted down the corridor, leaving five whispy smoke-trails behind him! Although Gladius could run like a cheetah, he couldn't catch the face, who was always just out of reach! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWas this old palace HAUNTED? It probably could be, it was centuries old, but then, stranger things had happened! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter running around the whole palace, Gladius was exhausted! He would have to go back to his room and sleep. Plus, he was probably waking everyone up!

They were busy massaging their respective master's groaning bellies as their fellow princely servant-boys, Samson and Ethan, fed the princes massive bowls of porridge with sugar, cream and honey mixed into them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hurrrgghmmm...\" Cameron groaned, stretching out on his seat, as if eating was such an extremely strenuous activity. He glanced across the table and looked around. At one end at an enormous throne was their father, King David, who was chomping down on sausages and eggs. At the other end, their mother nibbled daintily on exquisite-looking pastries. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGladius poked moodily at his breakfast. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong, Prince Gladius?\" Cameron asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now son\", said David, \"We expect you to be friends with him.

Oh...um...uh...hmmm...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You look terrible!\" said Edmund, looking at Gladius's grimy eyes, messy hair and groggy expression. \"Did you stay up ALL night?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huhwwwuuuuh?\" Gladius gasped, jerking upwards. \"What? No! I...I...I got to bed...about...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"About when, dawn?\" Cameron asked. Edmund giggled. Queen Isobel shushed him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is this palace haunted?\" Gladius asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awww, a big Mountain muscle-boy scardededed of a few widdul goasties...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"SHUT UP!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCameron laughed and his belly heaved and jiggled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now sons\", said David. \"What did you see last night, Gladius?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I dunno, I saw this...boy in white wandering around the corridors...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Probably one of the servants\", the king said, \"They sometimes like to wander around at night when it's not so noisy\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No it wasn't a servant\", said Gladius, \"He was really skinny!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Skinny?\" Edmund asked, \"...What's...'skinny'?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bony! Thin! Emaciated!\" Gladius said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh!...Um...yeah...Never seen that around the palace...You Cam?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCameron shook his head, \"Nope!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was...it was one of the servants\", said Queen Isobel, \"I'm sure it was!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGladius nodded. He wasn't convinced. No royal servants that he'd seen were THAT skinny! Most of them were fat and round, or at least chubby. Some were thin, but what he'd seen last night was beyond thin! It was almost skeletal! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gladius, you have to follow us today\", Edmund said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Follow you...Oh...Yeah...why?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because it's your job\", Cameron said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!

It is your duty to follow them and see that no harm shall befall them, whenever they go out, and whenever they are at home, amongst crowds\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGladius nodded, \"Yes sir\", he said. </span></div></div>",

Their bellies sloshed and bounced, slapping against each other and their boobs jiggled and quivered with each rotation of the wheels. It was mesmerising! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the carriage reached the city, people swarmed around, reaching in and shaking hands and squeezing soft royal blubber. The princes waved and smiled.

Beyond the gate was the River Skripp, the main river that flowed down from the Mountanian Alps, several hundred miles to the north. Beyond the gate was a large wood-and-stone drawbridge. Away from the city, along a road and up a low, sloping hill was a huge stone structure with massive walls that towered several feet into the air. The main entrance to the compound beyond was a huge pair of wooden doors which were open. The carriage rumbled up the driveway towards the gates. As they got closer and closer, Gladius could see a huge, carved stone sign above the doorway. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><i><b>\"The Royal Regis Home for Destitute Children\"</b></i></div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe carriage rumbled under the doorway and into the grounds of the home. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe moment the carriage stopped, children, boys and girls, rushed out of the front doors and fought to open the carriage doors to help its occupants out! Gladius climbed out after the princes and Edmund introduced him as Prince Gladius of Mountania, their new 'companion'...he didn't want to say 'bodyguard', in case the children got scared! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boys and girls almost dragged the princes inside. Gladius slowly took in the grandeur of the children's home. In the huge foyer there was a massive statue cast of brass. It depicted a figure sitting on a throne. The figure was that of a boy. An extremely fat, round-faced boy with a comely, friendly, inviting and cheerful face, with neat hair and eyes with...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...are those REAL sapphires?\" Gladius whispered. Edmund nodded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe very fat boy sitting on the throne had a happy-looking smile on his chubby face and his hands rested comfortably on his throne. At his feet was a large, shiny copper cauldron. Gladius glanced in to see it was full of coins. A plaque next to the cauldron read: <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><i><b>\"All Donations Go Towards the Improvement of the Lives of All who Enter our Doors\"</b></i></div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two princes waddled heavily up to the cauldron and tipped pouches of gold coins into it. They stared up at the boy sitting on the throne and, to Gladius's surprise, they bowed! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they finally waddled away, Gladius stepped forward and noticed a large brass plaque riveted to the base of the statue:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><i><b>\"This Statue is Erected By the Children of this Institution in Memory of <br>\r\nHis Royal Highness, the Prince Tristan. <br>\r\nPatron and Founder\"</b></i></div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nGladius also tossed some coins into the cauldron at the prince's feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We come here once a month to visit the children and give donations and alms\", Cameron explained. \"This is the local children's home. It was set up by the prince over a hundred years ago and it takes in all the really poor children\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe gestured towards the various boys and girls who were all looking at them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Those that don't have homes, or families, or who live in the streets. The home looks after them\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGladius stared at all the children. They certainly appeared to be well looked-after! Apart from two or three, most of them were chubby or pleasantly plump in size, cheerful and happy. Most of them looked very young. The youngest was probably two or three years old. The older ones were probably around sixteen. They all bowed to the three princes as they passed by, meeting and greeting. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNone of the children here looked anything like the skeletal form that Gladius had seen during his night-time walk around the palace, though! This was getting scary...It was as if the figure he'd seen was something in his imagination! Something that just didn't exist in this land of fat, happy people... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGladius met the home's cook, doctor, nurse, wetnurse, and a fat, balding man with a kindly disposition, whom the princes introduced as Abbot Mortimer, the head of the Children's Home. The abbot led Gladius all over the vast complex, explaining the Home's mission and purpose. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they reassembled in the foyer, Cameron and Edmund reached up to the statue of Prince Tristan and their chubby hands rubbed against his round, exposed belly, which, Gladius noticed, was considerably shinier than the rest of the statue! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a tradition to rub Tristan's belly to bring good luck\", Edmund explained. </span></div></div>",

The king laughed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe king reached into a pocket of his massive robes and pulled out a long chain with lots of keys on the end of it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gladius, this is for you. It is a set of the master-keys to the palace\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah, thanks!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I expect you to use these with care, and not to lose them, or abuse them\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, yeah! Thanks...wow!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Also, I have a duty which I want you to perform for me\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Every night after lights out, you're to ensure the security of the perimeter\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm supposed to do what?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Walk around and lock all the windows and doors\", Edmund explained. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can do that, can't you?\" King David asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? Oh, yeah, yeah, absolutely! And I'll pound the life out of any pesky trespassers, too!\" said Gladius, showing off his arms and chest. The queen giggled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aah, and here's dessert!\" said the king. Edmund and Cameron fidgeted as servant-boys laid huge chocolate mud-cakes in front of their bellies... </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After dinner, Gladius helped the princes back to their rooms. At first he really hated the idea of having to babysit the princes, but he soon realised that it was their servants who did most of the work...and gladly! All Gladius had to do was follow them around. And there was something strangely attractive about the princes. Not that Gladius was homosexual, or anything...but perhaps because they were so fat, and immense and blubbery and beefy and heavy, and because nothing like that existed in Mountania...he found them curious and wanted to know more? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhatever it was, Gladius started liking the princes more and more. They did have some really excellent qualities. They were friendly and cheerful, always happy, polite, kind to everyone...and were always delighted whenever Gladius teased them about how huge they were...which they seemed to enjoy! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe clock in the drawing room struck eleven-thirty and the prince of purity began wandering around, locking everything up. He bolted shutters, checked doors, turned keys, locked gates and turned down lamps and blew out candles where-ever he found them still burning. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe headed downstairs and began checking that everything was safe and secure. The store-rooms were secure, the candles were doused...If Gladius had realised how big the palace was, he might not have agreed to this job! But at least he got a good walk and got the privilege of seeing the palace at night, when it was quiet, dark and peaceful. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGladius headed back upstairs and crossed the foyer. In the middle was the towering magical fountain that burbled ice-cold lemonade. The prince picked up one of the magical goblets that stood around the edge of the fountain and gulped down a few good mouthfuls. The cold, sweet, fizzy drink rushed down inside him and made him feel all tingly and cool. Just what he needed! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young Mountain prince took another long pull of lemonade before he decided that his thirst was sufficiently quenched. He gasped, lowered the goblet down and then yawned and stretched. He stared slowly around. One corridor led to the offices...another led to the bedrooms...another led to the state reception-rooms...there was a lot of passages that Gladius would have to get used to around here! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGee, everything looked kinda spooky... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGladius raised his candelabrum and stared around. Then he stopped. At the end of a corridor, he was sure he could see a figure...a face! A face illuminated by a single candle! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey you!\" Gladius shouted! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe face vanished! Gladius took off down the corridor, chasing after the light! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey come back here!\" Gladius shouted. He reached the end of the corridor and saw the light halfway down another corridor. He jogged after it, but again, was <i>just</i> too slow to catch it! He skidded around a corner and stopped...it was a dead end! There was just a pair of double doors at the end of this corridor...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright you...\" said Gladius. He raised his light and pulled out his sword...a birthday present from his father...and advanced on the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGladius stood in front of the door, shifting his weight from one foot to the other...and back again...then he threw himself against the doors! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGladius didn't look like it, perhaps, but he was a solidly built boy with a bit of weight behind him, mostly from muscles. He smashed himself against the door until he managed to crack the bolt and throw the doors open! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright you little scamp...\" Gladius rumbled. He put down his candelabrum and entered the room, sword drawn. He stopped. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe room was surprisingly large. Not enormous, but still sizable. There was a bed, a chest of drawers, a closet, table, chairs, a desk and a few other things. Candles burned on the desk, the bedside tables and the main table in the middle of the room, so it was actually pretty bright. Gladius pushed the doors shut and started looking around the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mon you little rat! Runnin' around the palace at night like a RAT! Where are yah!?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe pulled open the closet and...there was...nothing there. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe opened another door that revealed a surprisingly comfortable-looking bathroom with a large, wall-sized mirror. Gladius stared at his reflection for a bit, then turned back towards the room. Slowly, he squatted down and peeked under the bed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aaaah...GOTCHA!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGladius reached in with one hand, grabbed at something under the bed, hauled it out and threw it down roughly onto the mattress, he swung his sword down, stopping it barely an inch from the figure's neck! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was him! It was the boy! He caught him at last! He found him! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy had thin blond hair, flaxen-coloured, and pale skin and cold blue eyes. He was incredibly thin! He had no fat on his body at all! His arms, legs, ribs, collarbone, cheekbones...everything were clearly defined! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...Who are you!?\" Gladius shouted! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout any warning, the boy suddenly burst into tears! He sniffled and wailed and cried! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! No don't hurt me! No! No! Leave me alone!!\" the boy tried pathetically to wriggle away from Gladius's iron grip! He kicked and cried and sobbed. Gladius dropped his sword with a loud 'clang!' <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah, woah!\" said Gladius. He might act tough, but he wasn't mean! \"Hey! Calm down, buddy...w-what's wrong? Who are you?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy sniffled, stared at the young Mountain teen who towered over him and went back to crying! He rolled over, buried his face in his bed and sobbed, trying to pretend that the big scary boy wasn't there anymore! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, Gladius sat down on the bed, and took a deep, slow breath. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's your name?\" Gladius asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Mmm-mmm-mee!</i>\" the boy mumbled through his pillow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Mmmmff-mmmthmmee!</i>\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's...\" the boy sniffled, \"It's Timothy\", he gulped. He sniffed again. \"Prince Timothy\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGladius frowned. Then he started laughing! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't laugh!\" the boy sobbed. \"It's not funny!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're PRINCE Timothy?\" Gladius asked. \"As in Prince Timothy. As in His Royal Puny-ness, the Prince Timothy Regis?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YES!\" the boy squeaked with surprising volume! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry...\" said Gladius, \"Man you're so SMALL!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGladius got up and slowly, Timothy got to his feet. Gladius was amazed! The boy was probably about nine or ten years old, and about five feet tall, if that. And probably about fifty pounds with a full suit of clothes! He was absolutely miniscule! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Waaait a minute...\" said Gladius, \"If you're a royal PRINCE, then how come you're so small? Aren't Prince Cameron and Prince Edmund your brothers?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTimothy nodded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're HUGE! How can you be so puny?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was born very weak and small...the doctor said he didn't think I would survive. I've always been so weak and feeble that I was kept away from everyone so I wouldn't get hurt or scare anyone because I was so skinny and small...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's terrible!...But why don't you just eat?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't! I get horrible sick if I do! I just start having tummyaches and I throw up and and I...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...\" said Gladius. \"...can't the doctor do something?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Merlin's trying, but it's taking a long time...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh...I'm Prince Gladius, by the way. I'm from Mountania\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guessed\", said Timothy, looking up at him. \"You must be the new bodyguard for my brothers!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm the PRINCE'S BODYGUARD. You're a prince, ain'tcha?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...I...I think so...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then that includes you\". </span></div></div>",

Here, look...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGladius pulled his shirtfront open to reveal a shining gold medallion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See? This is my coat of arms. See? This is my name. 'Gladius Van Draconis'. I'm a prince of the Mountanian royal family and I'm here as the princely bodyguard. And that includes you\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTimothy nodded.

The doors swung open! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-h-hey T-Timothy\", a voice panted. It sounded heavy and fat. Gladius watched as an enormously obese boy, so fat he could barely waddle, wheezed and sweated his way into the room. The tremendous lardo waddled ponderously around, pushed the doors shut with the sheer size of his bulging abdomen, and collapsed onto the bed, groaning with exhaustion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I thought I'd...c-come and...and see...see how you...Hey!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe prince jerked upwards...or tried to...when he saw Gladius peeking out from the bathroom.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The doors swung open and something heavy and fat waddled inside, leaning heavily on his walking stick. Prince Edmund waddled slowly into the room and sank onto his brother's bed. Timothy smiled and hugged him and gave him a kiss. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi Eddie...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdmund smiled. \"Are you feeling okay?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTimmy shrugged. Edmund smiled. He let his brother play with his body, the closest thing he was likely to get, at this point in time, to being fat and happy himself. Edmund looked up to see Gladius standing behind the door! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi Edmund\", said Gladius, \"I found out about Timmy...I...I was wandering around the palace locking things up and I kinda stumbled across this place...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdmund nodded. Gladius was surprised that Edmund wasn't more angry! Perhaps he figured that Gladius would find out about Timmy sooner or later, anyway, whether or not he tried to keep him hidden? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe waved Gladius over with a huge arm and hand. Gladius strolled up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You must never mention Timmy to anyone\", Edmund explained. \"He's very weak and very sick. He doesn't like big crowds of people and he doesn't like people staring at him. We keep him here where he can be safe. Until he's gained some weight and got some sort of strength in him, he has to stay out of sight\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why's that?\" Gladius asked. Edmund stared at Gladius as if the answer were obvious! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gladius, the people expect the king and queen to be able to father and mother fat, hefty, healthy, heavy, chunky boys! Children of substance and size! Children of mass and weight and bulk! It's their assurance from our parents that the prosperity of the kingdom will continue to thrive! It's like how in Mountania, they expect you to be big, strong boys, to prove you've got the strength and authority to rule the kingdom and protect the people. It's the same thing over here\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh-huh...\" Gladius said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If they all saw Timothy and how runty he is...sorry Timmy...\" Edmund added, hugging his little brother, \"...then they'd all lose faith in us! They'd think that the prosperity of the kingdom will suffer, and that would cause horrible things to happen, like riots and such...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGladius nodded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can visit Timmy if you like, but don't mention him to anyone\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGladius nodded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure Eddie\", he said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir conversation was interrupted by a rattling sound! The three boys looked up. Hobbling towards them was a thin boy with brown hair and simple, white servants' robes. In one hand, he carried a tray with a single hooped handle over the middle. In the other hand, he grasped a simple wooden crutch. He hobbled along, hopping, pausing, hopping, pausing, hopping, pausing and hopping again. The tray rattled with every half-step. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPrince Edmund was a kind, loving, gentle and caring boy who would never mistreat his servants, but he did not so much as lift a finger to help the lad. Mostly because as a prince, he wasn't expected to, and because his great bulk, nearly a thousand pounds in weight, meant that it was just impractical for him to even try! He was there to be served and waited upon, not to serve and wait on others! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!\" said Gladius. He hurried towards the boy who whimpered! He tried to step backwards! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gladius! Don'...\" Edmund began. But the boy stumbled over backwards! The tray dropped from his hand! Quick as a flash, Gladius grabbed it before it hit the ground! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGladius towered over the boy! The boy looked terrified! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Leave him alone!\" Edmund shouted. Gladius stepped back and slowly put the tray and its contents onto a side-table. The boy scrambled to his feet again and got up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr rather, scrambled to his foot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGladius now saw, in the brightness of the room, that the boy had only one leg! His left leg was gone from the knee down! He hobbled in, leaning heavily on an old crutch that looked about ready to break under his minuscule frame! The boy did a sort of stiff, from-the-neck bow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I beg of th'pardon, m'lord Edmund, sir, for...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdmund held up a hand to silence the boy. \"That's enough. It's alright...Go on, sit down...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"SIT...down...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy sat down on the nearest chair at once! He stared nervously at Gladius. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hucky, this is Prince Gladius of Mountania...No! Don't get up, just sit...Gladius, this is Huckleberry. He's Timothy's servant-boy\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGladius stared at Huckleberry. The boy was TINY! He was probably smaller than Timothy! And even that was an impressive feat! He stared at the boy's missing leg. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huckleberry had an accident when he was younger\", Edmund explained. \"He was run over by a horse and plow on his father's farm. The blades sliced his left leg clean off. He wasn't able to do the heavy manual labor in the fields anymore, so my father allowed him to become a house-servant instead\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHuckleberry nodded sadly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He does only very light work\", Edmund explained. \"He delivers letters, he passes messages...he does a few deliveries of food and such...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGladius stared at Huckleberry. The boy was so small and weak and hopelessly defenseless! He looked like an innocent little baby. Just like Timothy, he seemed to be terrified of everything around him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be scared, Huck\", Edmund said, soothingly, \"Gladius here isn't going to hurt you. He's a nice Mountain boy, right Gladius?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh!? Oh yeah...\" said Gladius, \"Yeah! Absolutely, yeah...um...yeah...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe kept staring at the stump on Huckleberry's left leg. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don'tcha have a wooden leg or something?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHuckleberry shook his head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn!...Hell, I'll make you one!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHuckleberry's eyes widened! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See, Huck?\" Timmy said, \"He's not that scary!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHuckleberry nodded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He gave his brother one last, bone-crushing squeeze, Timothy gave Eddie one last affectionate snuggle, and then Timothy crawled under his bedsheets. Eddie leaned on his walking-stick and with a mighty grunt, hoisted his 900-pound bulk into a vaguely standing position. Gladius got up to help him, but Eddie waved him off. Gladius stared at Huckleberry, who hobbled into what looked like a servant's bedroom, next door to Timothy's small, hidden suite. Panting heavily, Eddie began the long, slow process of movement. Every step seemed to tax him as if he'd run a thousand miles! He leaned excessively on his stout walking-stick, and shuffled along. Eddie wasn't sure how his father managed to move like this! The king had once told him something about \"letting the weight do the walking\", but he wasn't quite sure what that meant. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man, Timmy is sad\", said Gladius. He was walking at barely a snail's pace, with Edmund wheezing and sweating behind him, pausing to lean against the wall every few feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-he-he's got a...a -a-a very rare c-condition w-which means his body r-rejects f-food...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But he must eat SOMETHING! Or he'd drop dead by now!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-h-he can eat...\" Edmund gasped as if he'd just come up for air! \"...t-toast and b-butter and w-water...But even then he ca-can't ha-have too much o-or else...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdmund stopped to catch his breath again, \"Or else he gets real sick!\" he spluttered out! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sick?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"BAD SICK!\" Edmund gasped. \"He throws up and..and everything! You don't w-w-wanna see it...It's bad! Merlin and his great-grandfather, Draxon...they're tr-trying t-to make somet-somethin' that means Timmy can keep his food down and eat properly, but...s-so far nothin's happenin'...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGladius stared at Edmund. The boy was so grossly overweight that he could BARELY waddle! His older brother Cameron had to be at least a hundred pounds fatter, but he never seemed to have these issues! Gladius frowned. He supposed that Cameron was used to lugging his fat ass around. Edmund on the other hand, as the second son to the king, and without as many royal duties, probably spent most of his time on his fat, royal ass, being fed by servants who fawned over their master. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about Huckleberry?\" Gladius asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huck's a wonderful guy\", Eddie said. \"You should make friends with him. None of the servants care and he really could do with a friend...I mean the closest friends he really has are me and my brothers. I know it's weird that we made friends with a servant-boy with one leg, but...Hey, we're that kinda people. Especially Timmy. He knows what it's like to be different and left out, so they make really good friends. But just so you know, Huckle scares really easily, so don't do none of your strongman stuff around him, or he might never speak to you again\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGladius nodded. \"Do you think Timmy will ever be cured?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope so\", Eddie says. \"Everyone knows his story, but we don't allow people to see him. And Timmy hates that kind of stuff, anyway. He refuses to go out, and honestly, I don't blame him...but he's really nice...You've got a brother don't you?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Two\", Gladius said. \"Like you I'm the middle boy. There's Cassius and then there's Triton, who's Timmy's age...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I bet Cassius is bigger and stronger and everything, than you are, huh?\" Eddie asked. Gladius grudgingly confirmed all those points. Edmund nodded. \"Yeah. Cam's always been bigger and fatter, heavier, hungrier than I was...But then I don't care. He can have the throne! All I want is the food...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGladius laughed. It was nice that these two brothers didn't have the super-fierce sibling rivalry that he had with Cassius. It made for a more peaceful household... </span></div></div>",

BELCH!...I want some!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NOT for you, Cameron!\" Queen Isobel said sternly. \"You've already had four helpings!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Five!\" Edmund retorted, \"He stole my slice when I was in the bathroom!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah...\" said Cameron. He smirked triumphantly at his little brother. \"Now your shortcake's gonna make me all fat and squishy!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stuck out his tongue at his brother, who glared back at him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Boys!\" King David said. \"Enough!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright\", said Gladius, \"I'll have a little slice\", he said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Queen picked up the knife and made what she considered to be a \"little\" slice. Gladius stared at it in alarm! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah! No no no! Half of that! I'm not that hungry!\" he said. The queen smiled, and sliced the slice in half again. She balanced the new slice on the knife and dropped it onto Gladius's dessert-plate. Gladius started chomping on the soft, crumbly, sweet, strawberry-flavoured cake. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmm!...Oh wow this is good...O this can't be safe for my body...I'm gonna get FAT here...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is kind of the point...\" Edmund said. The king laughed! Nobody noticed that Cameron was now sneaking the leftover slice of cake for himself... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>CRACK!!</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone jumped! Cameron choked and his servant punched him in the back to clear his throat! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ow! Th-thanks!\" Cameron gasped, swallowing his cake. A short, blond boy bowed to the royal table. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, Master Merlin!\" the king said, \"Sit down!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, your Majesty\", Merlin said. \"But I haven't come for dessert. I came to deliver this!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe held up a bottle in his right hand. He shook it slightly. Gladius leaned in his chair, and saw that the contents were fizzling a bit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is our latest serum for Master Timothy\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the Queen's face was full of sadness. She held her hands to her chubby cheeks and sniffled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's alright, my dear\", said King David. \"Bring Timothy here, Merlin, and we'll see what happens\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMerlin put the bottle on the table, and disappeared. Cameron picked up the bottle...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Put it down, boy!\" David snapped. \"That's for your brother's life, not your appetite!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCameron jumped and almost dropped the bottle! Another earsplitting <i>'CRACK!'</i> and Merlin returned with the skeletal, shivering, shaking form of the Prince Timothy. He shuddered forwards, and his older brother Cameron grabbed his arm to stop him falling over! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Timothy...\" the king said. Timothy blinked. The candles and oil lamps made the room so bright! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yes father!\" Timothy said very quietly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Timothy, we've got a new serum for you\", Merlin said kindly, holding up the bottle. \"I want you to drink this\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGladius stared at Timothy. Somehow, he knew that the young prince had gone through ordeals like this before...and before...and before...and before. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTimothy stared skeptically at Merlin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It'll work! I promise!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You said that last time!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! Third time lucky...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is the seventh!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Oh...Um...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The first time I threw up, the second time I got dizzy, the third time, I fainted, the fourth time I had...I won't mention what I had, the fifth time, I dry-retched, the sixth time I a stomach-ache for a week!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But this one's different!\" Merlin insisted, shaking the bottle, \"Try it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh they're all different!\" Timothy grumbled, for the first time, showing something akin to a temper! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Timothy!\" the king scolded. \"I know how you feel, and...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No you don't, father!\" Timothy grumbled. He tried to walk away, but Cameron grabbed him. Timothy could not hope to fight against his brother's great bulk, so he stood where he was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen Timmy, we all feel sorry for y--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OH! So I'm supposed to be...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe queen burst into tears! Timothy gulped. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I'm sorry mother! It's just that...it...NOTHING EVER WORKS!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"SON!\" David barked. \"Merlin and his family have been trying for YEARS! Don't you DARE take that tone with us while Merlin is present in this room!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMerlin grabbed Timothy and stared at him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen Timmy, I know it's hard, but this might finally be the one! You might finally be able to eat properly and hold down food and finally put on some weight! Goodness knows it's time enough for that to happen! Now come on...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTimothy groaned. He stared at the bottle and picked it up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right\", said Merlin. \"Open it, and drink everything\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTimothy popped the cork off the suspicious, green bottle and sniffed the mouth. He frowned, and then gulped down the contents. He made a face! It certainly didn't taste anywhere near as good as the last few, despite their failures! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sit down, Timothy\", King David said, kindly. Timothy slowly sat down. He gulped down the serum as fast as he could, and then shakily put down the bottle. He took a deep breath...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do you feel?\" Merlin asked anxiously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTimothy seemed to be hyperventilating, taking fast, deep, and fast, light breaths, alternating between the two. Suddenly...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><i>BEEEERRRRLLLLCCCHHH!!</i></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nCameron, Edmund, Gladius and Merlin burst out laughing! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do you feel, my sweet one?\" Queen Isobel asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I feel much better now, mother...\" Timothy said, weakly, \"I...I don't feel queasy and sick anymore...I...I feel hungry!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe king let out a tiny smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hungry, hmm?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCameron pushed what remained of the strawberry shortcake towards his littlest brother. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go on, Timmy, try some\", he offered. He cut a large slice and plopped it into a bowl and gave his brother a spoon. Everyone watched as Timmy ate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst one mouthful, then two mouthfuls, three, four, five... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He seems good!\" said Gladius. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not yet, he doesn't\", Merlin warned. \"Whether or not he can EAT is one thing. It's whether or not he throws up...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone watched. Timothy suddenly looked different! His face and mouth contorted slightly...and...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Burp!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! He kept it down!\" said Cameron. He gave his brother Edmund a high-five. Edmund grinned! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTimothy stared at his family, and made a cautious smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well done, Merlin!\" the king said. \"Boy!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA servant-boy rushed to the king's side. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Find the chef and tell him to prepare a private feast for the Prince Timothy in the small West Dining Room. Merlin, you better go with him, and monitor him to see how he eats\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMerlin nodded. \"Alright, Uncle David\", he said. \"Come on, Timmy!\" </span></div></div>",

He'd never experienced a royal feeding before, and he reckoned this was going to be fun! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh hah-hah-hah, Gladius. It's MERLIN\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, that's what I said! Marilyn!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...\" Merlin just sighed, \"Come on!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two princes and their magical friend headed towards a smallish dining-room that Gladius had not seen before. It was tiny compared to the main, North Dining Hall, but no less grand for its size. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside was a large table. Loaded on the table was an obscene amount of food! Chickens, beef, sausages, pies, pizza, cake, pasta, cookies, bottles of wine, bottles of beer... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTimothy clutched his bony midriff when he saw the mountain of food! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong, Timmy?\" Merlin asked, \"You're not feeling sick, are you?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I hope not!\" Timmy gasped. \"There's so much FOOD here!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's all for you!\" Merlin said, cheerfully. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For me...\" Timothy whispered. Such a thing had never happened before! He sat down at the head of the table. A dozen servant-boys, six on either side, lined the table, waiting for the prince to start eating. Gladius stood behind the prince, with Merlin standing next to him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You think this'll work?\" Gladius whispered to Merlin. <br>\r\n\"It damn well better\", Merlin mumbled. \"I think he's almost given up hope. I think we all have...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of the servant-boys stepped forward and bowed. He began holding a whispered conversation with Timothy. Judging by the way he was pointing and waving his arms, the boy was explaining what was on the table for the prince to eat. Timothy whispered something back to the boy, and soon, a whole assortment of food was being brought before him! The prince nibbled delicately at pizza, pies, rolls, buns, sausages and all kinds of things. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe prince ate slowly at first, picking, slicing, chewing, poking and sniffing. He seemed to take ages! The twelve servant-boys were not used to feasting at this pace! They were used to moving around and keeping the plates and bowls coming. But Timothy's brothers wolfed down their food with complete royal greed and gluttony, completely unlike the slow, dedicated pace which Timothy ate with. The boys were getting tired from standing, but they weren't allowed to leave without Timothy's permission. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nReading their body-language, Timothy guessed that something was up, and sent away all but two servant-boys, who remained to help serve him and clean him when he made a mess. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of the servants was just explaining how to eat oysters, when the doors swung open. Crown Prince Cameron lumbered into the room, like a starving whale, his great belly gurgling in hunger when it sighted the mountain of food which laid untouched. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How's it going, bro?\" he asked, watching Timothy eagerly slurp down another cold, slippery, slightly salty oyster. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm!\" Timothy said, \"Wonderful! It's all so fantastic!\" he added, reaching for yet another oyster. He stared at his oldest brother, \"Cammy, I can't possibly finish everything. Do you want something to eat after dinner?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crown prince nodded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, that would be great\", he said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two servant-boys set up another place at the table and pulled up an extra large chair. The Crown Prince sat down and began eating. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter another hour or so, Timothy gasped and pushed his chair back from the table. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh gosh!\" he gasped. \"I don't feel so good...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong?\" Merlin asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I feel so heavy and full and my belly feels so tight and painful! Ooooh...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome to your first bellyache, Timmy\", Cameron said, smirking. \"You're officially a prince!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTimothy belched. \"I-i hope so!\" he gasped. \"Ooooh...\" </span></div></div>",

They were having breakfast. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHuckleberry limped over to the sideboard, his every second step being a soft 'clunk!' <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How's the leg, boy?\" Gladius asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's very nice, thank you, my lord Gladius\", Huckleberry said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGladius leaned back to stare at Huckleberry. He'd measured the boy's other leg, and crafted a spring-loaded prosthetic to fix onto his stump-leg on the left. It was crafted out of shiny brass and had a solid base on a spring-loaded shaft, so that it would have some sort of shock-protection for when Huckleberry moved at anything faster than a walking-pace. The shiny brass leg sparkled in the sunlight. Gladius smiled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. Leg-bling...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTimothy and Edmund laughed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doors to the dining-room opened and Ryan entered, carrying a tray. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes Ryan, what is it?\" Cameron asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The post, my lord\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Post...okay...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBreakfast was almost over anyway...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCameron reached for his letters, and Edmund reached for his. There were even a couple for Prince Timothy. One envelope contained a card of a pig on a scale, and the words: \"Happy 200lbs!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTimothy blushed. He needed a few more doses of Merlin's medicine, but his body was now well on the mend, and was accompanied by a healthy appetite. Nowhere near as big as his brothers, but impressive enough in its own right. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And uh, there's one for you, your Royal Highness\", Ryan said, stopping next to Gladius. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"ME?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGladius picked up the letter. It was sealed with red wax with a dragon on it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooooh boy...\" he groaned. He broke the seal and opened the letter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dear Gladius, hope you're well and that everything is above board...Timothy feeling better, nice to see that...yadda yadda yadda...WHAT!?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong?\" Cameron asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...We're coming tomorrow for a visit of undetermined length!

Yeah!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get back to your packing, boy!\" Leviathan shouted after his youngest son. He sighed. That BOY!... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKing Hercules entered his son's office. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Something wrong, lad?\" he asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Triton, the royal zookeeper, insists on taking his entire menagerie with him when we go visit King David...\" Leviathan sighed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe old king chuckled. \"I'll go have a word with him\", he said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe old king left the room and headed upstairs to his grandson's bedroom. He paused outside the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Be a good kitty, Munchies, and there'll be a lot of fat yummy mice! And you can eat them all! Now sit still...that's a good kitty...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKing Hercules knocked on the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! Come in!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe king opened the door and stopped short. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe entire floor was covered with animals! Two, incredibly fat rabbits hopped lazily across the bedroom floor. By the fireplace, a grey and white wolf slept. A hedgehog shuffled across the floor and two salamanders, Fire and Brimstone, ran around on the hot coals of the fireplace, seemingly chasing each other's tails. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Something wrong, Triton?\" Hercules asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Grandpa!\" Triton said. He sat in his grandfather's lap and hugged him, \"I wanna take...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know what you want to take\", Hercules said. \"But you don't want to, really, do you? You can't! Now what's wrong?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTriton sighed, \"Grandpa I never been to Fatlantis before! What if they don't like me? What if I don't have any friends? What if the princes don't wanna play? And Cas has been telling me all kinds of stories and lies. I don't wanna go!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh son!\" Hercules said, \"Don't ever say that! Fatlantis is a wonderous country! Fantastic weather...except for winter...amazing food, spices, cloth, beautiful craftsmanship, very friendly people, lots of things to do! You'll see street-performers and music and lots of lovely things! The princes are very nice boys, and I'm sure they'll like you too!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTriton wriggled out of his grandfather's arms. He wasn't exactly BIG! He was tiny, actually! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I'm so small!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't you worry about that!\" Hercules said, \"You just be yourself!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Grandpa! Don't tell him that! He'll never shut up, now...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cassius! A civil tongue, lad!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry grandpa...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassius entered the room and Hopper jumped into his arms. He squeezed the fat, over-pampered bunny-rabbit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Regis City is a wonderful place, Tri. And you'll love. Really you will. Now hurry up with the packing! We're leaving tomorrow after breakfast!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you think Munchkin will be alright in the carriage-ride?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What carriage?

Before anyone could say anything...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>FLASH!</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo more figures! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three fat princes surveyed the new arrivals. On the right was a towering giant, about the same size as their father, but all bulk and muscles. He looked powerfully-built and very capable. He had dark blond hair, swept back an dark blue eyes. He wore robes and dress-armour of purple, steel and brass. He bowed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your Majesty\", he said. He had a strong-sounding, deep voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe princes stared at their father, who smiled and nodded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your Majesty\", he replied, \"Welcome to my court\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext to the towering man, who Edmund realised was now King Leviathan, was a tall, handsome-looking boy with blond hair and blue eyes and a slim, athletic build. He smiled and Edmund grinned. The boy bowed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd last but not least...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Munchies come here!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA boy snatched up the cat and held it protectively in his arms. He then realised that everyone was staring at him, and quickly bowed! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis, Edmund gathered, was Prince Triton. He looked like a smaller version of his older brother. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome to our court!\" Queen Isobel said. King Leviathan smiled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, ma'am\", he said. \"I thought it would be an excuse to see Gladius...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGladius stepped forward. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Father\", he said stiffly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...and see how things are going\", he added. \"And Cassius wanted to come, and this was Triton's first visit here\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're very welcome, all of you!\" Queen Isobel said. Cassius, dressed in white and gold, stepped forward, bowed and kissed the Queen's soft, silky and bejewelled hand. Gladius groaned inwardly. Always the PERFECT prince...it was sickening! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Queen tittered! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>FLASH!!</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-hi! S-sorry I'm l-late!

He smiled weakly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi!\" he said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good afternoon, Master Merlin\", King David said. \"You're not late\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C-cool!\" he gasped. \"I was transporting all their luggage to their guest-rooms...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perhaps\", the Queen said, \"My dear, the king and us two should retire to the drawing room where we might talk in privacy\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe got slowly to her feet, \"And the children can occupy this room and get to know each other better?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeviathan nodded, \"Isobel, that's a good idea!\" he said. \"Come on\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, the three adults shuffled out of the massive throne-room. When they were gone, introductions began. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everyone, this is Cassius, Cassius, this is...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We DO know who he is\", Cameron said, \"This isn't his first time here\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassius chuckled. \"Hi Cameron\", he said. \"Eddie\", he added. \"And THIS must be...Thomas?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Timothy!\" the smallest prince corrected him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! Right...Hi! I heard you got better...You look much fatter and plumper now! I remember you used to be so...well...small\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He still is!\" Cameron said, rubbing his belly proudly. Timothy scowled and Cassius laughed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is our little fellah...C'mere!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTriton stepped forward, squeezing the life out of his pet cat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is Triton\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi!\" said Edmund. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow! You're all so big!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTriton turned to Cassius, \"Look at them, Cas! They're like enormous fat piggies!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Triton! Don't be rude!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCameron burst out laughing! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Relax, Cassius. He's NOT being rude! I bet you've never seen boys as big as us, huh Triton?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTriton shook his head violently! NEVER! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh, take your time man\", Cameron smirked, \"Take it all in...\" he said slowly, and stretched and yawned extravagantly, making his belly heave and quiver... </span></div></div>",

Following their cue, Cassius shrugged off his tunic to reveal his lean, chiseled, muscular physique and dazzling good looks...the symbols of his authority. With the two youngest princes out playing, they all felt that they could let their hair down a bit. Cassius carried over a chair and sat down, sticking his feet up onto the royal dais to relax. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So\", he said. \"I guess Gladius has been a good little boy, huh?\" he asked Cameron. Cameron nodded. \"He's been no trouble\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good...very good...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh shut UP, Cas...\" Gladius groaned. He sat down on the steps of the dais, \"I am *so* being good! I'm SO *so* being good that everyone thinks I'm fucking awesome! Right!?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...yeah...\" said Edmund, in such a hesitant manner, that both Cassius and Cameron burst out laughing, and Gladius scowled with anger! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassius sat back in his chair. He stared at the two fat princes in front of him. They were both hovering around the half-ton, 1,000 pound mark. Which was incredible considering that they were only 13 and 12 years old each! Cassius had never seen boys this incredibly fat before in his life. In Mountania, this would've been considered tantamount to a crime against nature. In Fatlantis, it was seen as nothing less than a sign of prosperity, wealth and wellbeing. Anyone who had attained sufficient poundage...or tonnage...was assured of wealth, privilege, servants, money, a large house and a life of sloth, laze, leisure and lethargy. A life of complete freedom and enjoyment...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich was alright for those who wanted that kind of thing, but for Cassius...and Gladius...they'd get too bored sitting around just eating and having their servants grovel at their feet day and night. They had to get up and around and move and burn off energy! Of course, it went without saying that Cameron and Edmund didn't have much energy to burn, so it never bothered them! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassius stared over the two obese boys and smiled as he watched and admired every shelf, every soft tender roll, every bulge, every rotund protuberance, every curvaceous cushion of chubbiness...In his mind, Cassius was living out his deepest, darkest, most depraved fat-loving, fat-touching, fat-groping fantasies that he had ever had...and which were impossible to fulfil in Mountania, for obvious reasons...but which could be carried out here...when the conditions were right... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm bored!\" said Gladius. \"I think I'll go for a swim or something...\" he said, getting up and leaving the room... </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Nice of you to join us, Gladius\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGladius sat down between the two princes, who sat opposite their parents. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good evening King David, Queen Isobel, ma'am\", Gladius said, stiffly. He relaxed in his seat and stared around the table. There were plates and bowls, forks, knives, spoons, chalices, candles, salt-cellars, spice-boxes...but no actual FOOD! He frowned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA pair of doors opened and two buglers in white uniforms tootled off a bright, brass flourish. A fat man with a neat blond beard entered the room, wearing a puffy toque blanc, the traditional headgear of the master chef. Behind him, followed two lines of fat, well-fed servant-boys, carrying trays, tureens, platters, bowls, or pushing trolleys and carts. In Mountania, the visible servants were mostly girls. This was because they were expected to do the lighter work, where the heavier work, more demanding to the body, was done by boys and men. Gladius stared at the procession of servants in wonderment. The oldest couldn't be any more than about 15. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Once they reach 16, they can either leave service with a certificate of completion, and find work elsewhere, or they stay in their post until an opening as a footman shows up\", Crown Prince Cameron whispered into Gladius's ear. Gladius nodded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boys lined up their trolleys and left, while the boys with platters and plates laid them on the table before leaving. Then, right at the back of the procession was a fat, round boy with brown hair. He looked about 500 or 600 pounds. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good evening, Master Roland\", King David said. The boy bowed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Roland is Chef Blakely's son\", Cameron explained. \"He's the Royal Food Taster. He tests everything for poison...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGladius's eyebrows rose!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh it's a harmless job...\" said Cameron, \"...it's mostly ceremonial. But it is useful. In case there's a dish that isn't prepared properly and it slipped through by accident for some reason...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGladius watched as Roland waddled from dish to dish, taking spoonful, a scoop, a forkful, a mouthful, of everything there. He was taking just the SMALLEST amounts of food, but with the number of dishes and courses to be had, Gladius was amazed this boy wasn't as fat as the princes! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he was done, Roland bowed to the king and queen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your Majesties\", he said. He turned to the three princes. \"My lord Cameron, Prince Edmund, sir\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You find everything satisfactory?\" the king asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes sir!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, Roland\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy and his father backed away, bowed, and left the room. Gladius watched as everyone charged in! Their servants kept up a steady stream of food while the two porcine princes glugged and gobbled and snatched and slurped and belched and burped and bore down and binged! The king and queen ate with considerably more decorum, but with only a smidgeon less speed! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My little DARLINGS!\" Queen Isobel crooned, \"Such sweet little apples!\" she smiled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the initial edge of their hunger dulled, the princes relaxed into a steady gorging process, where their plates were steadily filled with food every few minutes, to be emptied of food a few minutes later, only to be refilled again...and again...and again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe king belched and coughed, wiping his mouth. \"Gladius...ahem...Tomorrow is an important day...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's so important?\" Gladius asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tomorrow, my two sons are going into town\", said the king. \"They are attending their monthly weigh-in. It is customary for the assurance of our subjects that the princes be weighed IN PUBLIC once each month, to ensure to them, the security of our dynasty and the prosperity of our kingdom. You will accompany them to this event. And afterwards, you will accompany them to the Regis House for Destitute Children...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah, I think I went there once before...\" said Gladius. \"Um...the...uh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Most people call it the 'Tristan House', after our noble ancestor who caused its establishment under the rule of his older brother, the King Darius...\" King David explained. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooh yeah...THAT place. I remember...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They are going there to open a new residential wing\", the king explained. \"New dormitories, dining-hall and kitchen. You will accompany them there and see that everything goes smoothly. I would go myself, but I have a meeting with the city council, and the Queen must attend her women's charity group meeting. It will be simple. They will go there, they will make a short speech, a donation, cut the ribbon, sign autographs, meet people, shake hands, rub-blubb with the rich and famous, meet the children, stay for food and drinks...It'll be like a party!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah I...I could do that!\" said Gladius. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good!\" said the king, \"Wonderful! You will leave tomorrow after breakfast, all three of you. First into town for your weighing-in, and then to the ribbon-cutting at the Tristan House!\" </span></div></div>",

Now HURRY UP!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will yah hold ON!? I'm COMING already! Sheesh!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGladius stood waiting in the foyer of the palace. He wore a steel helmet, a silk vest and a steel breastplate and backplate. He had his belt around his waist, with his dagger and sword strapped securely onto it. He was wearing minimal armour and weaponry because he didn't want to look too intimidating. It was just a ribbon-cutting and a weigh-in, anyway! It wasn't like they were going on some cross-country journey to the Deepest Darkest Wilds of the mystical kingdom of Wherethafukawi? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe watched as the two enormously fat princes waddled into view. He stared at them in wonderment. He'd been here nearly a month or so now, and he still couldn't believe how fat they were! How they even managed to MOVE was a mystery to him. They waddled ponderously into view, panting and gasping from the effort of just balancing their bellies and moving their feet. They leaned on sturdy-looking walking-sticks, while they waddled forwards. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEach prince had two servants each. One holding their long capes, the other acting as a sort of human crutch. They waddled slowly forwards, pausing every two or three steps. Gladius recognised the boys: Ryan and Ethan were Cameron's servants. Samson and Jeremy served his younger brother, Prince Edmund. Apparently only one boy from each staff would be going. So Ethan and Samson stayed back, while Ryan and Jeremy followed on with their masters. Gladius followed them out of the palace and into a huge, sturdy-looking carriage with four white horses harnessed at the front. Gladius climbed in after the boys and a stable-boy closed the doors. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heeyaaah!\" the coachman barked. He shook the reins and cracked a whip! The carriage creaked and then rumbled off down the road, through the gatehouse and out into the world of the common man. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe princes were both wearing near-identical outfits. Red and blue capes done up with gold hooks and buttons around their chests. baggy silk shorts that reached down to their knees, expensive-looking leather sandals, made of Mountanian cowhide with flashy brass buckles. Large, colorful sashes strapped around their shoulders and bellies. They were also adorned with the usual array of trappings that came with being princes of the kingdom of fat...expensive rings, bracelets, and solid gold belly-chains that were held in-place around them purely by virtue of their own bulk and youthful girth! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n The carriage drove through town. People cheered and waved and the princes waved back. Gladius stared around, left and right, taking in everything. His father had been training him since the age of six, how to be a knight. This was all supposed to be part of his training - knowing how to protect people. How to spot danger. This included such things as observations, deductions, inferences, reading body-language...Gladius had shown a knack for all these little games...perhaps that's why he was chosen to become the princely bodyguard? He shrugged. He kept watching. He saw that a lot of people had turned out for this event. The monthly weigh-in must be some sort of fancy schmancy ceremony around here. There were people lining the street, people in the square, people up on rooftops and leaning out of windows... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUp on the rooftops of the shophouses and buildings around the main square were some children. They were peering down at the square from the roof of a baker's shop. Mr. Roundley waddled up the back stairs to the top floor of his bakery with a basket filled with buns and rolls. He chuckled at the gaggle of youngsters, all leaning on the wall around the top of his shop, staring down at the square. The were five boys and a girl. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Susie! I told you to bring the glass!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I forgot!\" the little girl wailed. \"We were all in a hurry! YOU said we'd get here on TIME! So I didn't think we'd NEED IT! I thought we'd get better seats for the weighing-in! Instead we're stuck up here on...the roof of the best bakehouse in town! Uh, h-hi Mr. Roundley!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. Roundley smiled at the children. Timothy and Susie, and their friends, Bobby, Tommy, Jake, and Eric. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe children were all tiny. Skinny, or chubby, thin and bony. They were all orphans. He knew that. Their parents had all died, or were drunk homeless deadbeats. Or were simply too poor to house them. As a result, all six children were residents of the Tristan House, as most people called it. The big, old monastery a few miles outside of town, over the river and down the way, up the hill and around again... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were attended to by the Brothers and Sisters of the Order of Prince Tristan, a charity organisation established in the name of Prince Tristan, the generous prince of once-upon-a-time, who established a charity house for poor children under the rule of his father, and who expanded it so very much, under the rule of his brother Darius. The children were all wearing their house-clothes - Brown, hooded habits and tunics with rope belts and cheap leather sandals. Susie, as a girl, wore a simple sack-dress. Nothing fancy, but it served its purpose. She also wore a large shawl which she had draped over her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Tristan House was for all homeless or otherwise destitute children. At the home, they could have three square meals a day, a clean bed, a safe room, and caring and attentive adults to look after them. They were free to come and go as they pleased, to find work, or visit their parents or friends and family...Timmy and Susie did odd jobs for Mr. and Mrs. Roundley. In return, they gave them food baskets. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. Roundley smiled at the two children and their friends. The brother and sister reminded him of the child that he and his wife had once had...once upon a time...stupid wells... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aren't you staying to watch, Mr. Roundley?\" Eric asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Watch for what?\" Roundley asked. \"I've seen that ceremony dozens of times with plenty of young princes! And princesses! I don't need to see it again!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shhhh!!\" Timothy hissed, \"They're starting!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt started with the ceremonial disrobing. Edmund went first. He hated this! Sure he wasn't ashamed of his size, but he wished that he didn't have to show it off in front of the ENTIRE KINGDOM! His servants, his family, his brother, his parents, his friends...but not complete strangers!! He sat down on a large bench and the mainspring on a scale creaked down, the needle on a huge dial spun around...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Twelve hundred pounds!\" the mayor called out. There were loud woops and cheers! Edmund heaved himself off the seat with Jeremy's help, and quickly threw his cape back around his body! His inspection at the meat-market was OVER! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awww!\" Jake groaned, \"I couldn't see it! Susie you should've brought the glass ANYWAY!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I DIDN'T!..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"SHUT UP!\" Bobby hissed, \"We're gonna miss the other one!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCameron heaved his way up onto the platform, panting and wheezing, his buttocks wobbling and smashing together, his belly swaying and heaving so much, it looked like he would lose his balance and fall over at any moment! He sat down on the bench and the whole thing creaked! The crowd gasped! Cameron slumped there, wheezing for breath! The lord mayor watched the needle on the scale, and waited for it to stop vibrating! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fifteen hundred pounds!\" he cried out triumphantly! \"The princes are doing well in their duties to our fair and prosperous kingdom!\" he announced. The crowd cheered! Up on the roof of the bakery, the children screamed and wooped! They clapped and danced around excitedly! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on!\" said Timothy, snatching up the basket of buns and rolls, \"Don't just STAND there! We gotta get back home before the princes get to the House! Or else we'll miss out on them again! Thanks for the food, Mr. Roundley! We'll bring back the basket next week!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Lots of fat and obese nobility and visitors were milling around outside or filing slowly into the children's home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe six kids snuck inside through a little used side door.  Timothy crept down to the kitchen to drop off their basket full of baked goods, courtesy of Mr. Roundley.  The other five kids climbed up to the balcony overlooking the large foyer of the House where everyone was congregating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So,\" said Timothy when he finally joined back up with the others.  \"Are we all set for our plan?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know, Timmy,\" said Susie, biting her lip.  \"Do you think it will work?  Those two princes are sooooo big and heavy and huge!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's exactly WHY we want to do this, though!\" said Timothy.  He frowned at his sister.  \"Are you a member of the RSPCA or not?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusie sighed.  She was the youngest of their little group and so was the newest member inducted into the Royal Society of Princely Corpulent Advancement.  Every single one of them was amazed and obsessed with the Fatlantean princes, Cameron and Edmund.  They relished every single opportunity they had to see and spy on the princes when they were out and about.  They drooled over the round, rolling, corpulent bodies of the princes.  They would watch and follow them as the princes would slowly waddle and wander around the town square, eating and gorging themselves into a stupor, making their round, wobbling bellies distended and stretched with food.  The six children would also willingly do any menial task for the princes to try and get close enough to brush by or cop a feel of all that heavenly royal blubber the princes had by the half-ton-full.  And yet, all this was never enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTherefore, they had planned and schemed for weeks when they heard of the princes coming to dedicate the new wing of the Tristan House.  The princes coming here to their own home provided them with an unprecedented opportunity.  The single biggest, fondest dream of each child in the RSPCA was to stuff and feed the princes, to rub and massage their growing, engorging stomachs, and to help add that much more soft, wonderful fat on the princes' bodies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, if they could only find the right opportunity to put their plan into action....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm a member, Timmy,\" Susie said in a hurt voice.  \"You know I want to see the princes as fat and large as possible.  I just...I don't know how the plan's going to work!  The princes are always surrounded by people!  And they have that new bodyguard!  Look, look!  There they are!  See?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusie pointed down to the foyer as a couple buglers played a royal fanfare.  The crowd of dignitaries cheered and clapped as Prince Cameron and Prince Edmund slowly and sedately waddled up a couple steps onto a large, reinforced platform set up for them at the front of the room directly underneath a picture of their ancestor, Prince Tristan.  Following directly behind them, his hands on the pommels of his sword and dagger and his eyes continually scanning the room at all times, was Prince Gladius.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBobby sighed in concern.  \"How are we going to get passed...that?!\" he said, indicating Gladius.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTimothy groaned.  \"I didn't count on them having a bodyguard!  Alright, everyone!  Think!  We don't have a lot of time!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe kids racked their brains and whispered ideas back and forth before they finally come up with something they thought would work.  Susie, however, crossed her arms over her chest.  \"I can't believe you want me to do...that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, come on, Sis!\" said Timothy, putting his arm around his kid sister's shoulders.  \"This will really prove how dedicated you are to the RSPCA!  Besides, I've seen you sneaking looks at that bodyguard!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusie blushed and couldn't help stealing another glance at Gladius.  Even though he was thin, he was muscular and handsome.  He looked like he'd be more than capable of protecting anyone under his care.  What would it be like if SHE were under his care?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe children listened intently as the head of the Tristan House, Brother Porkenstein, got everyone's attention and introduced the princes.  Then, Prince Cameron and Prince Edmund stepped forward to the front of the platform.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCameron cleared his throat.  \"Thank you all for coming here today.  My brother and I are grateful to have this chance to continue and support the legacy our ancestor Prince Tristan started a long time ago.  We dedicate the new Cameron-Edmund wing of the Tristan House to all the needy children who still need a place to call home here in Regis City.  May they always have a safe and warm bed to sleep in, a dry roof over their heads, and plenty of good, healthy food to eat here in the Tristan House.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdmund took a ceremonial pair of scissors from Brother Porkenstein and cut a long blue ribbon stretching in front of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crowd erupted into cheers and applause.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrother Porkenstein held up his hands and said, \"Thank you, ladies and gentlemen!  If you will all follow me, I will give you a brief tour of the new wing.  Refreshments will be served in the new and expanded kitchen afterwards.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is it, guys,\" Timothy said under his breath.  \"You all know what to do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other five children nodded their heads.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I managed to grab the supplies from the infirmary after I dropped off the basket,\" Timothy added, patting his bulging pockets.  \"Alright.  Let's get to it.  Susie, you're on!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusie blushed, but eagerly stood up from her perch on the balcony and hurried down to the foyer.  The other boys followed her down to the foyer, but hid out of sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Timothy,\" Jake hissed.  \"Did you manage to get the glass?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTimothy grinned at his friend and drew the glass from one of his pockets.  \"Yep!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe five boys took turns spying through the glass, watching and waiting for the perfect opportunity to make their dreams come true.</span></div></div>",

Just go over there and butter him up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't have any butter!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He means you need to distract him!\" Timothy explained to his sister. \"I mean look at him! He's a Mountain Prince! I bet he's gotta have a HUGE...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"TIMOTHY!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...I was gonna say 'ego'...and he'll probably be real flattered if a sweetie like you came up to him...pleeeeaaase?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusie giggled. She gave her brother a kiss. \"Oh alright!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusie scratched her head. Wondering. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When they go inside...then the princes will be all busy with the guests...I can find Prince Gladius then and chat to him and keep him busy...uh...Then you guys can keep bringing the princes glasses of water or something. Sooner or later they're gonna have to answer um...calls of nature...so when they go to the bathroom, you can corner them and...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey that's a good idea!\" said Jakie. \"'Cause not even their SERVANTS are gonna follow them into the wash-house!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusie blushed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See?\" said Timmy, \"And YOU guys didn't want me to bring her into the group. I told you she was smart! Now go on!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusie peeked down at the crowd in the foyer. Bit by bit, they waddled into the new wing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, come on!\" she said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey rushed downstairs and into the new wing. The wing had a huge central dining and assembly hall, with corridors leading off it, to bathrooms, kitchens, smaller rooms for meetings and offices and classrooms, and then rows and rows of dormitories. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boys headed to the kitchen. A fat, bald man, Friar Tuck, smiled at them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good afternoon, young masters!\" he said. Friar Tuck was the head chef at the Tristan House. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Friar Tuck\", said Bobby. \"Please friar, can we have some water?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Certainly! The pump and sink are over there, and there's glasses on the shelves...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No we want water JUGS\", Timothy explained. \"We thought we could um...well...serve drinks during the party...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooooh...That is a good idea!\" said the friar, smiling. \"Yes! Alright. There's trolleys over there...and there's the glasses. I'll get the jugs...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fat cook waddled away and came back later with several enormous pewter jugs which he filled with freezing cold water from the pump in the kitchen. He loaded each jug onto the trolleys with their glasses and the boys left the kitchen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You come back here and fill up the jugs when you have to, won't you boys?\" the cook called after them,\"I need to sort out the sandwiches...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusie watched her brother and her friends milling around the hall pushing their drinks trolleys. While they watered down the guests, she moved towards Prince Gladius. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGladius was TALL for 13! He was about six feet, with brown hair and a tan and impressive muscles. He didn't have the bulky, hunky look that most girls prized, but he was nonetheless, attractive and powerfully built. Susie curtsied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good afternoon my lord Gladius...\" she said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?...Oh...Hey!\" said Gladius. \"You're cute...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusie smiled. \"Thank you, my lord. His Royal Highness is the princes' new bodyguard...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah that's right\", said Gladius. \"Nice to meet you\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am Susette, or 'Susie' as my friends call me\", said Susie. She gulped, and then started off with... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...His Royal Highness is so strong and handsome...\" she crooned. She was shorter than Gladius, and she used this to her advantage, moving closer to him so that he would realise that he was taller and bigger and stronger than her. Something else to feed his ego... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...with such beautiful hair!\" she added. Rubbing it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...\" said Gladius. \"Thank you. You're sweet...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusie examined Gladius's minimal armour and his weapons. She looked at his sword. \"Is this your weapon?\" she asked. \"Oh I'd love to see it!\" she said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh sure!\" said Gladius. Anything for a pretty girl...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...and that was JUST what Susie was counting on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Gladius pulled out his sword, Susie dropped a coin on the ground. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh!\" she gasped. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me!\" said Gladius. He knelt and picked it up. Susie took the momentary distraction to search for the two fat princes...not that searching for boys the size of cows was ever going to take very long! Ah, there they were, at the far end of the hall...and her brother Timothy and his friend Bobby nearby... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCameron and Edmund were not used to this much exercise, walking around the hall and greeting people. They had become silently thankful of the fact that two of the home-boys seemed to be following them around constantly, supplying them with glasses of water, and generous refills. When Timothy ran out of water, Jakie would take over. When he did, Tommy took over. When he did, Eric took over. When he did, then Bobby took over...it was a constant relay of water to keep the princes hydrated. After all...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The health of their royal highnesses is very important to us...\" Timothy said, when Edmund commented on their constant presence. Timothy bowed submissively. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How MUCH do these guys DRINK!?\" said Tommy as he passed Jake in the hall. \"They're still going!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well look at them! They probably sweat out half what they drink in, so I bet it's a lot! And how much water do you think they have to fill those huge bellies, anyway?\" he asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two boys stared at the princes water-filled bellies, which sloshed and wobbled and gurgled with every gentle movement that they made. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good point! But this is my fifth trip back!\" Tommy said. \"And this jug holds a gallon! So that's six gallons! And there's five of us, so...so...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So that means that they'll be going to piddle pretty soon!\" Timothy interrupted them. \"So go and get ready!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTimothy opened a bottle and tipped its contents into the jug of water that he had. The water would dilute the colour of the bottle's contents, and in the yellow light of candles, the slight tinge in the water would be barely noticeable. He filled up two LARGE glasses with this 'water' and went to find his sister. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You're missing the big event!\" he hissed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Big event? Wh...oooooh...\" Susie said softly. Timothy gave a BARELY imperceptible nod, and gestured for his sister to follow him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe new public bathrooms in the new wing of the house had two entrances. One from inside, and one from the outside. The six friends watched as the two princes waddled towards the bathroom. Their servants relieved them of their cloaks, exposing even MORE of their great bellies, and waited for them to come out again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the meantime, the boys hurried into the bathroom and went out the other side, through the exterior door into the garden. Tools and equipment left by the builders were everywhere. Including two large wheelbarrows and several empty sacks and ropes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTimothy entered the bathroom with his trolley. The two massive princes were standing next to each other in front of an extra large urinal-stand. Both boys were sweating heavily from their LONG waddle from the door to the urinal. A grand distance of about nine feet, past the sinks and water-pumps... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd it was now that they realised that without their servants, the princes would need someone else to help them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey boy!\" Cameron gasped. \"Come here. You were the one who was following us around everywhere, weren'tcha?\" he asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTimothy gulped! Did they suspect their plan!? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh..y-yes your Royal Highness!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Givin' us all that water, huh. What did you want, a tip?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"'Cause all that stuff's gone right through us...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCameron dug into the sweaty pockets of his expensive silk shorts, Supersize-5-sized, and tugged out a gold sovereign. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is yours if you help us piss\", he said. Timothy almost SNATCHED the coin out of Cameron's hands, and helped them pull down their shorts, and prepare them for the operation ahead. Two heavy streams splattered into the trough and the princes leaned against the wall, and each other, in relief! Once they were done, Timothy pulled up their shorts for them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Their Royal Highnesses must be thirsty!\" Timothy said. He held up the two massive glasses of tainted water. The two princes stared at each other. They WERE pretty thirsty...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks boy...\" said Edmund. They reached for the glasses and glugged them down. They stopped, handed the glasses back and gasped. They NEEDED that!! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two princes were about to waddle back out, when they suddenly felt dizzy! What was going on!? What was IN that water!? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe outside doors to the bathroom opened and the boys came in, pushing the wheelbarrows. Timothy watched as the huge whales flopped backwards! The barrows were nearly flipped upside down! It took two boys holding onto the handles of both barrows to stop them from losing their centers of balance and dumping the princes onto the floor! They covered the princes heads with sacks, and then tied their arms and legs together with ropes! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on! Quick!\" said Timothy! The six young conspirators, three to a prince, started wheeling them out of the bathroom and across the garden. The high windows of the new dining-hall meant that nobody could see out into the grounds to witness their getaway!...By the time anyone noticed that the princes were missing, they would be long gone! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get onto the road, quick!\" Bobby gasped, \"These barrow-wheels are digging into the ground! They'll tell everyone where we took them!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey steered the severely overloaded wheelbarrows to the main road that ran past the Tristan House and pushed them along...UPHILL! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-w--w-who tho-though f-f-f-fat pr-pr-princes *cough!* cou-could be s-so HEAVY!?\" Susette wheezed! \"H-how m-much fu-further to this h-hiiii-hideout *wheeze!* t-that you p-pick-picked out, b-brother!?\" she gasped. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay I didn't think it would be THIS hard!\" Timothy gasped. \"But come on! We gotta get moving before anyone spots us!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShoving the wheelbarrows along was very difficult. The princes' bellies and huge thighs and legs and arms sagged over the lips of the barrows, and their boy-boobs and rolls wobbled and sloshed around everytime the wheels bumped or jolted on an uneven paving-stone. Sadly, the children were too busy pushing the barrows, pulling the barrows, watching the road and checking for followers to appreciate the gentle, hypnotic jiggling of royal flesh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-h-HOW much FURTHER!?\" Bobby gasped, after they'd been going for nearly two hours! \"And what did you PUT in that drink, anyway!?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's just laudanum!\" said Timothy, \"That stuff which the doctor gives us when we got aches and pains! A whole bottle of the stuff! I wanted to knock them out proper!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You certainly did that!\" said Jake, \"I'm startin' to get winded!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just over there!\" said Timothy. He pointed far in the distance. It was an old, abandoned farm and mill, built near a river. \"That's where we've been stockpiling all the food for the past three months!\" </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After much pushing and panting and wheezing and gasping, the children reached their destination several miles up the road. It was Timothy and Jake who found the place, several miles off the main road, hidden in trees near a stream - an old farm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe farm had a combination farmhouse and mill, built into the banks of a river, it had a farmyard, an old stable-block, an animal-barn, and a much larger storage-barn built of stone and shingles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In here!\" Timothy panted. He pushed one of the wheelbarrows into the barn. The barn was made up of five massive chambers. A central store-room with stairs and balconies and rafters, ropes and pulleys everywhere, for storing, hoisting and carrying grain and food, and four large storage-rooms, two on either side, one on top of the other. The barn was very very dark. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wheelbarrows were wheeled into the center of the huge main chamber, and then the princes were dumped into a pair of massive, old birthing-chairs, which the boys had smuggled out of the basement of the Tristan House. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe birthing-chairs were slightly reclined armchairs with built-in footrests and a cutout in the front of the seat, which made them look suspiciously like lavatory-chairs! The cutout was, of course, for the passage of new life. There wasn't going to be any new life around here, but they were the only chairs that the children could find that would be big, strong and sturdy enough for their purposes! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe princes were dumped into the chairs, back-to-back, and their arms and legs were tied to the armrests and footrests of the chairs with scraps of cloth!...Timothy didn't want to use rope or string because he didn't dare give the princes rope-burn! The chairs were designed so that the occupant could be easily tied down...Nobody wanted an expectant mother to trash around in a chair while giving birth, and potentially harming the baby!...and it was this feature that the children took advantage of. </span></div></div>",

When they slowly opened their eyes, they realised that they weren't in the Tristan House anymore! What happened!? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey went to the bathroom...they had a drink...and then...then it was a complete blank! Cameron panted as his headache slowly went away. He stared around and saw that the room was dimly lit by four, spaced out candles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eddie!?\" he called out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cam!\" Edmund shouted. They realised now that they were tied to large, wooden chairs, back to back, in the middle of a huge room with a stone floor. The room was so huge that they couldn't see the walls around them! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cammie where are we!?\" Edmund blubbered, \"Cammie I'm scared!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dunno!\" Cameron said. He sniffed the air. He could smell straw...he guessed they were in a barn or something! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\"Welcome!\" </b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two princes jumped! Their chairs creaked from the sudden movement! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who said that!?\" Edmund cried out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\"We have aspyed you from afar for years\",</b> the voice continued. It was deep and loud, magnified in some manner. It echoed and reverberated around the huge room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who are you!?\" Cameron shouted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe voice laughed, deep and scary-sounding! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\"Who we are is not important. What is important is who YOU are...\"</b> the voice replied. <b>\"...and what you represent!\"</b> <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-w-what do you mean!?\" Edmund whimpered! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\"Your size! Your WEIGHT! Your GIRTH! Your heft! Your sheer OBESITY represents the prosperity of your kingdom and the opulence and wealth of your family\",</b> the voice continued. <b>\"Your weight means EVERYTHING to you. Your appetites, your diets, your sizes are your life and death!\"</b> the voice added. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomewhere up above, something made of wood, creaked softly. The two princes tried to stare up into the gloom above, but couldn't see anything! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who's there!?\" Cameron shouted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\"We have watched you. We have seen you. We have followed you for months and years\",</b> the voice continued. <b>\"We have seen you in public every time. We watch as you move around the market-squares, past bakeries and butcheries, and restaurants and coffeehouses and cake-shops, gorging and bloating yourselves on the works of others!\" </b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two boys were getting REALLY scared now! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\"We have watched you grow day, by day, week, by week, year after year, into the bloated, lumbering slobs you are\",</b> the voice continued. <b>\"But that is not enough to satisfy our needs and desires\". </b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two princes didn't like the sound of this! What was going to happen!? Were they going to be slaughtered and fed to some horrible beast!? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\"You have displeased us\",</b> the voice continued, <b>\"And we have brought you here so that you may fulfill your ultimate destinies...\" </b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let us GO!\" Edmund whimpered, \"We-we've n-never hurt nobody!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\"We do not wish you harm...\"</b> the voice began again. <b>\"We are a secret society of royal watchers...\"</b> it continued. <b>\"And we have watched you for years. But watching has gone far enough and it is now time for action. You will be our prisoners and will submit to our will. Do this and you will not be harmed. It is our desire that you should be safe, comfortable and cared for during your stay here. Do not be afraid!\"  </b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nTHIS only made the princes even MORE terrified! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, they saw figures moving in the gloom! They were coming downstairs! They were each holding a lamp in their hands. The figures were all dressed in brown, monkish habits, with simple cloth belts tied around their middles, with the hoods up, covering their faces, and the lamps hanging between their fingers, their sleeves closed up in front. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe six figures surrounded the chairs, two on each side, and one at either end. Cameron and Edmund couldn't see the figures, but they could tell that they were now kneeling, on both knees. Their heads bowed down, touching the ground. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hail Cameron, Prince of Fatlantis, future king and ruler. Hail Edmund, Prince of Fatlantis, of prodigious and expansive appetite\", the voices all said at once. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two boys gulped! They felt as if they were in some sort of CULT! They wanted OUT!...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut at the same time...this was all rather fascinating...It was like some sort of...fan-club...or something. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who are you people!?\" Cameron demanded. \"My name is Cameron Regis, Crown Prince of this Kingdom! And your actions are tantamount to TREASON! If my father finds out about this, you'll ALL BE EXECUTED!\" he shouted. \"In the king's name I DEMAND that you RELEASE US BOTH AT ONCE!

They surrounded their princes now, on all sides, and their dizzy, dumpling, doughy, dimpled darlings were now their guests...in a manner of speaking... to whom they could do as they pleased!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey didn't bother to rush. They took their time examining the princes. Cameron, the older and fatter one, was already over 1,500 pounds, and only 13! His younger brother, Prince Edmund, was 12, but already well over a half-ton, despite his young age! The children of the Society marveled and ogled at their captives, taking this time to drink in their sheer size and girth for the first time in their lives, without ever, possibly being interrupted or called away! A dream come true!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let us go!\" Cameron demanded! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdmund and Cameron were usually fat, hungry, jolly boys. Their upbringing of sloth, greed, gluttony and incomparable, almost obscene luxury, did little to kill their cheerful, gentle, kind and charitable personalities. They gave generously to the poor, stopped for autographs, shook hands, rubbed bellies, and let others rub their vast bodies for good luck, but right now, they felt neither charity, kindness, gentility or good cheer! They just wanted to be OUT OF HERE!! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"His Royal Highness must restrain himself!\" a young, concerned-sounding voice said. Cameron tried to see who had spoken, but the half-light of the old barn and the hooded robes that their captors wore, made it impossible for him to identify the speaker! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We are not here to harm you\", another voice said. They were now circling the princes in a sort of strange ritual, which was actually to give each member a chance to see each prince in his entirety. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We are your most humble and loyal and obedient subjects, my lord\", the voice continued. \"We are here only as your servants. How is it that we may pleasure your Royal Highnesses?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCameron and Edmund took a few minutes to process this information! <b>WHAT!??!!??</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nCameron took a deep breath. He could guess what was going on. They were a group of eager young children who had kidnapped them to spend time with them. Some sort of informal 'Princely Fan Club'. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe guessed he could understand that...After all, they WERE extremely popular...And he didn't want to DENY these poor children the chance to meet ROYALTY...eh?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well alright...\" said Cameron, \"Um...You can uh...um...You can rub our bellies for us and massage our feet!\" he said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Are you mad!?\"</i> Edmund whisper-hissed to his brother. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What've we got to lose!?\" Cameron whispered back, \"Let's just play along...\" </span></div></div>",

He's six feet, six inches tall with a light tan and medium, ear-length golden blond hair and blue eyes. For his age and size, he has impressively large muscles which still mask the superhuman strength with which he is naturally endowed in his genes. Cassius is King Leviathan and Queen Athena's 'Golden Boy' prince. Intelligent, handsome, strong, powerful, athletic, smart, friendly, sexy, capable, chivalrous and youthful. He is in many ways, the perfect embodiment of a young, youthful Mountanian royal prince. Cassius is an expert hunter, warrior and swordsman. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Prince Gladius</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nPrince Gladius has darker, dirty brown-blond hair. He's only six feet tall and 13 years old. Like his brother Cassius, his body has impressive and large muscles for his age and they too, hide the superhuman strength with which he is endowed. Gladius is the rebellious, grumpy, uncontrollable middle-child. He acts out, fights, grumbles, complains and is generally a troublemaker. There is an intense sibling-rivaly between him and his older brother Cassius. Although he loves Cassius, it's not something that Gladius would admit openly and they fight on a regular basis. Gladius likes smithing, forging and metalwork. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Prince Triton</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe youngest and smallest prince. Triton is 10 years old, a much smaller version of Cassius. Not having hit puberty, Triton is nowhere near as tall, strong or as fully-developed as his brothers. He shares Cassius's intelligence and good looks, but none of the strength, agility, power and stamina. Triton has a fondness for animals, reading, writing and sports. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll three princes started military training at a young age and are being raised to become full and proper knights. Training for knighthood was broken into three stages: <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom the age of 7 to 14 - A boy trained as a page. He assisted his master (a fully-qualified knight) in daily duties and acted as a servant. He learnt the ways of the knight and was taught courtly manners and chivalry. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom the age of 14 to 21 - A boy trained as a squire. He was now officially a knight-in-training. He learnt how to wear and fight and move in full armour. He learnt how to ride a horse. He larnt how to use a sword and how to attack, defend and counterattack against the enemy. Since a full suit of armour could weigh upwards of 100+ pounds (or more, if the squire was taller), bodily strength and stamina were extremely important. The 100-odd pounds does not include the sword, the scabbard, the shield, the woolen undergarments OR the additional chainmail, which together would've added several more pounds of weight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich prince will you follow?</span></div></div>",

He was pleased with what he saw, since all the strong, young men were working hard to win their matches. One match was especially interesting to the mighty, Mountanian King; that of his youngest son: Prince Triton.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTriton walked on to the mat facing Octavius, one of his best friends. Both boys were ten years old, they were about the same height and weight, and they had known each other since they met in the first day of school. They had been in every single class together, and they knew each other's likes and dislikes very well. Octavius was the eighth son in a large prominent family of miners and metal workers in Ferramount, and he had hoped to become one of the servants in the Royal Court.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth boys wore their shirts, their sweat pants, and socks, as they faced each other in a painted circle on a thick mat. The first boy who was able to bring the other down and hold him during a three-second count, would win the match.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOctavius reached out with both arms and grabbed hold of Triton's shoulders, pushing him back slightly. Triton stepped back and broke loose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, man! Easy!\" Triton protested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Easy, nothing! I wanna win!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOctavius reached out a second time, and locked on to Triton, pressing down on the prince with every ounce of strength that he could muster. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately for Triton, Octavius had more upper-body strength than him, and he forced Triton to come down on to his knees!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, Triton! You gotta fight!\" Octavius said, as he continued to push the prince down on to the mat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... I'm... trying.... You're... too... strong!\" Triton groaned, as he ended up with his back on the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTriton was exhausted. Octavius had worn him out. Triton just didn't have the strength to push him back. Not only did Octavius force him down, but he held him down long enough for him to win the three-count as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One... Two... Three! I win!\" Octavius cheered, as he got up, allowing Triton to stand up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You always win at this....\" Triton grumbled, as Octavius extended a hand to help him up. \"I hate wrestling. It reminds me of how weak I am...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, King Leviathan was sitting in his chair, looking on. Next to him, was Lord Blackspear, one of the richest Mountanian land owners.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that your youngest, Prince Triton?\" he asked the King.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, as a matter of fact, it is...\" Leviathan replied, feeling somewhat disappointed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He looks like he's struggling a bit...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, it certainly appears that way! Triton has been struggling at these games for a while now...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, don't worry, Your Majesty! Eventually, he will become big and strong! Then, he'll beat everyone! Some day, Triton will be a mighty Mountanian warrior, like his brothers!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope so, Lord Blackspear! I certainly do hope so...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The tall, thin boy with dirty blond hair wore his usual brown tunic with a brown rope around his waist and his long, brown sleeves and brown boots on his feet. Lastly, he always had a chain with a medallion hanging around his neck and his white wand in his right hand. His wand had a blue sapphire diamond at its tip, which always emitted a bright, blue glow of light whenever he used it.

Come, my young wizard, I must ask your assistance in a matter of the utmost importance!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMerlin sat down on one of three large, comfortable chairs placed right in front of the large oak desk that the mighty Mountanian King worked from.

Not only that, but all the other Mountanian dignitaries see that, too. It is very important to me that members of the Mountanian Royal family grow up to become strong and respected members of this Kingdom! They cannot be seen as weak and timid!\" Leviathan hissed. \"I hate seeing my son as a weakling.... he needs to be made STRONGER! How can he be made stronger, Merlin?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahem... Your Majesty... Prince Triton can go into a stricter regiment of training... But to gain strength takes time, and the Prince is still very young...\" Merlin reasoned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It bothers me seeing my son, the Prince, lose to other boys in wrestling, or any other form of competition... I hate it... Even if he is the youngest, he must be the strongest, right NOW, not later!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My liege.... If that is your wish... I can create a serum which will increase the Prince's physical strength... My only concern is whether or not the Prince will be able to handle his new strength?\" the wizard replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course he will be able to handle it! He's a Mountanian!\" Leviathan shouted. \"He's my son! Do it, Merlin! Create the serum and see to it that Triton consumes it at once!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm.... Your Majesty.... How strong do you want him to be? I can give him the strength of two adult men, five men, eight men, or ten men?\" Merlin asked his king.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The maximum! Ten men!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It shall be done, Your Majesty!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMerlin stood up and bowed before the King. Then he waved his wand, causing a gust of wind to make his long, black cape to blow, before the teenage wizard vanished in a flash of bright, blue light!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>...Or perhaps your interests lie in the activities of the men of the royal Mountanian family.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOld King Hercules, while still healthy and strong, decided to abdicate so that he could enjoy life and his family without the intense work of being king.  He has three sons.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Prince Lucius</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nPrince Lucius, age 38, is actually Hercules's oldest son, but the crown instead went to Hercules's middle son, Leviathan.  There's definitely a story there--one that isn't really talked about in the upper echelons of Mountanian society, let alone in the palace in Ferramount.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Lucius doesn't mind not being king.  He never had any desire to run the Kingdom of Mountania, anyway.  Standing nine feet, six inches tall (the shortest of the brothers), with dark brown hair and friendly chocolate brown eyes, Lucius is as strong and muscular as any Mountanian male, having gone through intense training in combat and metal forging since he could crawl.  However, Lucius is more easy-going and carefree.  He was always more compassionate and loving of all of Hercules's sons.  He didn't quite have the warrior's heart to be as ruthless as he would need to be as king.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHercules's succession was determined long ago, and therefore Lucius was installed as Lord of Laceton in Fatlantis many years before Leviathan was crowned King of Mountania.  Over 100 years ago, the city of Laceton was designated a kind of Mountanian outpost in Fatlantis, and a Mountanian of noble or royal birth has always been given the Earldom of the city by the reigning King of Fatlantis to serve as an emissary between the two distinguished nations.  Lucius was fostered in Fatlantis when he was a teenager, serving as bodyguard to then Crown Prince David and David's siblings.  When Lucius turned 18, David's father graciously named Lucius the new Mountanian Earl of Laceton, in agreement with Hercules.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat exactly is Lucius's story?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>King Leviathan</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite technically being the middle son, Leviathan never showed the typical middle son personality, unlike his own son, Gladius.  Hercules had accepted and thought of Leviathan as his true eldest son for a long time, and Leviathan certainly lived up the expectations of an eldest son.  Leviathan was always more aggressive, more eager to compete and prove himself a capable warrior.  He readily read and absorbed any of his schooling involving battles long since past, as well as battle strategy.  He still spends much of his free time reading up on Mountanian battle history.  He excels in chess and has proven himself an apt commander and leader over Mountania's fighting men.  Having seen Leviathan's formidable calculating mind and unwavering strength, the men of Mountania would follow their king into battle--and to the death--without question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeviathan, while being ruthless on the battlefield, is a very loving and caring husband and father at home in Ferramount.  He rides tough on his sons at times, but he knows better than anyone that the rough Mountanian people only serve those who are rougher and tougher than they are.  Leviathan is 36, has neat sandy-blond hair, intense blue eyes, stands a staggering ten feet tall, and is the burliest, strongest, most muscular Mountanian one is likely to meet.  Hercules made a wise decision in having Leviathan become his successor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWonder what a typical (or atypical) day is for the reigning monarch of Mountania?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Prince Achilles</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAchilles, age 30, is Hercules's youngest son.  Achilles was always the joker and prankster among his brothers, knowing he could get away with a lot more since Hercules never needed to ride rough-shod over him as much as his two older brothers.  Achilles stands at an impressive nine feet, ten inches tall, has mischievous green eyes, and flaming red hair.  His hair tends to curl when it's short, much to his dislike, so he tends to wear it rather long, keeping it in a pony-tail most of the time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAchilles's boyhood best friend was Mordred, Merlin's father, and Mordred convinced Achilles to foster down in his home country of Fantasmia.  So, Achilles served as the bodyguard to then Crown Prince Reginald, and the two princes became fast friends, getting up to all sorts of hi-jinks together, much to the consternation of Reginald's father.  When Reginald became king upon his father's untimely death, Reginald kindly asked Achilles to stay on as his royal bodyguard, and Achilles readily accepted.  Despite living so far away in the southern kingdom of Fantasmia (which is even further south than Fatlantis!), Achilles can always get back home to help out his older brother Leviathan quickly and easily, as Fantasmia is a country filled with wizards and magic.  Furthermore, all Achilles has to do is twist his magic ring, a gift from his best friend Mordred, and Mordred can teleport right to him and take him anywhere he needs to go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat sort of mischief is Achilles getting up to now down in the mysterious country of Fantasmia?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, which of these three brothers would you like to follow?</span></div></div>",

The stick was long, solid, and very much a lethal weapon. A shaft was weighted with lead at one end, and concealed a sword within it. A quick twist and pull and several feet of lethally sharp steel was brought into play. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe old king limped along, the result of an old hunting-accident. He watched as the palace slowly came to life. A beautiful young lady in her late teens skittered past. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning, Lady Godiva...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young lady blushed and curtised, \"My lord Hercules\", she said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where are you going?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To see the king, your Majesty. The Queen is awakened from her sleep, my lord\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see. Carry on...But don't linger, hmm?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHercules raised his walking-stick and tugged up the straps on her dress to a more acceptable, less revealing level. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe blushed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The king is a married man\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, your Majesty!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He requires no attentions from young ladies\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, your Majesty. Although...he may desire them...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe king frowned, \"I don't think so. You are one of the Queen's ladies in waiting, and you will conduct yourself accordingly!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, your majesty!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At any rate, the Crown Prince is surely closer to your age...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl put a hand to her mouth!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your Majesty!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You youngsters can hardly keep your corsets and codpieces together! But if they are to come apart, at least do it in the presence of someone more age-appropriate!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, your Majesty...\" she said. She curtsied, and scuttled off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe king sighed. Girls! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young Lady Godiva hurried into an enormous bedchamber, done all over with dark wood panelling, a huge fireplace, solid, wooden furniture and large windows with thick, red curtains everywhere. She drew back the curtains and hurried up to the four-poster canopy-bed. Slowly, she drew back the curtains around the bed and stared at the figure lying there. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tugged down her dress slightly and bent over the slumbering figure. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning, your Majesty...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmmmm...Mmmmm...Ooooooh...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKing Leviathan opened his eyes to the exquisite sight before him. He let out a grin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My dear Lady Godiva. Does your mother know you're doing this?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She said I should aim towards the top, my lord\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am the top, but the top's taken. You should aim for the next rung down. The Crown Prince is currently unattached. So perhaps you should display your natural goodness before his eyes before you display before me...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe courtesan huffed! She straightened up, tugged up the straps on her dress and pulled the bodice up over her chest! The wasted effort!...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe king chuckled. What a marvellously attractive girl she was! Although far too young for him. She was only...fifteen? Much too young. He preferred an altogether different type of girl...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, the king rose from bed and stretched and yawned. Someone knocked on the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come in!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your hot water, your ma-AAAAAAH!!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lady Candice, really!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do beg your pardon, your majesty!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You should be used to seeing me out of bed in the morning...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes your majesty! But...well...I never seen you from the front before!...Is it always that big?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not suggesting that you want to find out, do you?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, m'lord! I mean no, m'lord! I mean...I mean...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Candice that's enough! Be off with you before you drop it everywhere!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nQueen Athena entered the king's bedchamber and took the bucket of hot water from the lady's hands. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes your majesty! Right away, ma'am!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My dear! How many times have I told you not to whip it out in front of the younger girls? It scares them when they haven't seen something as...healthy...as yours...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKing Leviathan chuckled. He tugged on his smalls and laid down in his chair. The Queen began lathering her husband for his morning shave. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you sleep well last night?\" she whispered, splashing hot water over his face and swilling the shaving-brush around. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmmm...Did you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I did not\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why not?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was not sent to my slumber in my usual manner, my lord...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe king sighed, \"You know I would, darling, but things have been so BUSY these last few days...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, my dear!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe queen opened an enormous steel straight-razor, and began the shave. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't sneeze\", she said. Leviathan snorted! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't say that or I'll laugh, and that'd be even worse!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe queen laughed and began to take long, slow, determined strokes, kissing her husband on his shaved cheek. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, everything was done and the king decided that he was ready for the day's events. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shall we have breakfast, my dear?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. On the northern terrace, I think\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe king got to his feet and put his arm over his wife's shoulder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nQueen Athena was a tall, stately woman...but nowhere near as tall as her husband. Her oldest son, Cassius, was already taller than her by six inches, and showed no signs of stopping. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that where the boys are having breakfast?\" the King asked. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Ooooh,\" Prince Lucius groaned, pushing his plate away.  He put his hand on his full belly and rubbed its rounded curve, encouraging a few good belches.  \"That was an excellent dinner, Eileen.  Give Chef Joseph my compliments.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA young maid curtsied before the Lord of Laceton.  \"Yes, my lord.  Right away, my lord.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucius sighed and slowly got to his feet.  He leisurely strolled through his manor house to his private study and sank down into a large, comfortable chair by the fire.  He poured himself a short glass of Mountanian whiskey from the always full decanter sitting on a side table next to his chair and quickly threw the drink back, enjoying the burn of the rich liquor as it blazed a trail down his throat and into his full stomach.  He poured himself another drink, but left it sitting on the table as he closed his eyes and enjoyed his solitude.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only problem with solitude, though, was that it made his mind wander and brood.  He frowned when his thoughts inevitably went to events of twenty years past--events that caused a rift between him and his family, events that made him a virtual pariah to the Mountanian people.  Thank goodness Fatlanteans were more forgiving and understanding, allowing him to have a place to live here in Laceton and still have some contact with his family as emissary; otherwise, he might be in Vladia of all places, trying to forge out a life with those greedy, awful slave-traders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucius sighed again and ran his hands over his belly.  He had been strong and fit as a teenager before he came to foster in Fatlantis.  He had always had a good appetite, eating whatever and how much he wanted and never gaining an ounce.  However, the food here in Fatlantis wasn't the same as the food he had in Mountania.  The food here was richer, more fattening, and was always given in huge servings at least two or three times what was usually given in Mountania.  Despite the amount of intense training he had been disciplined into doing every day, it couldn't make up for the huge amount of calories he found himself consuming at every meal.  And the servants at the palace in Regis City didn't help, either.  As soon as his plate was empty, more food would be piled on.  Despite his protests at being full, he was always cajoled into eating more, seeing as he was a healthy, strong, growing Mountanian boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucius snorted.  Growing was right.  Before he knew it, he had a round pot-belly that wouldn't go away, clothes that wouldn't fit him anymore, and he had to forge himself new armor that would fit around his rounder, larger paunch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis father Hercules had chastised him severely for his weight gain and had admonished him to \"lose it or else.\"  Lucius had tried, honestly he had.  But he had grown to savor and enjoy the rich Fatlantean foods, even the feel of his stomach expanding and swelling when he ate more than he should.  Plus, while his muscles had gained him a lot of attention from the maids and washerwomen in the Fatlantean palace, his rounding waistline had garnered him the attention from...someone else entirely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucius shifted in his seat at his remembrance.  He should have thrown off her advances.  He shouldn't have been so flattered by her desire to watch him train out in the courtyard with his swords and knives--going shirtless in the sweltering heat of the Fatlantean summer, sweat running down his chest and his exposed, rounded belly.  He shouldn't have gone on leisurely strolls with her around the palace courtyard.  He shouldn't have let her feed him from a picnic basket until he thought he would explode from fullness.  He shouldn't have allowed her to touch and rub his belly afterwards.  He shouldn't have kissed her out in a secluded alcove in the palace flower gardens.  He shouldn't have....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucius swallowed hard.  His youthful indiscretions with the lovely Lady Danielle cost him everything by the time he was sixteen years old.  Not that Lucius really had any desire to be king.  He'd always known he didn't really have the temperament for it.  Leviathan had always been more king material than he was.  But to be denied returning home to his beloved Mountania except when specifically requested, to essentially being exiled in Fatlantis and denied contact with his family,....  Those were the hardest things Lucius still had to deal with.  He missed seeing Leviathan's coronation, his nephews being born and growing up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Lucius still trained hard and regularly to keep up his muscle strength, his loneliness and discomfort with his depressive feelings had him seek solace in food--an ever present comfort here in Fatlantis.  As a result, after twenty years, Lucius was quite portly, with a round gut that extended more than a foot in front of him to rest heavily on his thighs.  His face was more rounded, and he had a slight double chin.  However, despite the rounding of his body, he still looked Mountanian, with his height and impressive muscles.  He still attracted attention from the opposite sex, like any hot-blooded Mountanian male tended to do; however, he steered clear of women these days.  He'd learned his lesson long ago that women were trouble...and tended to get him in trouble, as he had a tendency to lose his head around them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucius closed his eyes, and his mind was filled with the image of his teenage love.  Danielle had had lovely, long, curly blond hair, sparkling brown eyes, and freckles on her nose.  She had been eighteen to his fifteen at the time, and while she was the daughter of a Fatlantean earl, she hadn't been horribly chubby.  However, she had all the aspects of a woman that had drawn Lucius's eye to her.  She had been vibrant, witty, and full of life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, when she had discovered she was with child, she took her own life instead of having to face her father and the King of Mountania, let alone all of Fatlantean and Mountanian society with her indignity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the truth came out about why she had committed suicide, Hercules's justice had come swiftly.  If it weren't for the fact that Lucius had made a favorable impact upon the royal Fatlantean court during his fostering, Lucius doubted he would have been made Lord of Laceton.  However, the then king of Fatlantis was willing to show some compassion on the young Mountanian prince, though Lucius had been watched over closely as he continued as bodyguard to Prince David until he came of age to accept his Earldom in Laceton.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucius sighed.  Despite everything, he'd had a good life here in Laceton, though it been a bit boring lately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA knock came on his study door, interrupting his maudlin thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come in,\" he said pleasantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEileen the maid entered and curtsied.  \"A missive has come for you, my lord.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, thank you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEileen handed him the letter, curtsied, and left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucius's eyes widened in surprise and delight at spying the coat-of-arms stamped into the red wax seal on the letter.  He unrolled it and read it eagerly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho was the letter from?</span></div></div>",

Lucius smiled as he eagerly opened the letter.  He had always been on friendly terms with the young king of Fantasmia, and Lucius could only hope that Reginald wanted him to do something that would take him out of the boring state of affairs in Laceton these days.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To Prince Lucius, Lord of Laceton in Fatlantis,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreetings and Salutations to you, my friend!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI have a request of you in your services as Emissary to Mountania.  My top counselor in wizard affairs has informed me that are becoming desperately low in our reserves of Douglas Pine wood.  This is one of the heartiest woods out of which we make our wooden wands and has become more and more popular these days for its ability to retain its magical properties over many years of constant use.  Unfortunately, my predecessors thought nothing of chopping down all of our Douglas Pine forests here in Fantasmia, putting us in quite a quandary of how to obtain more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, I have recently been informed that Mountania is literally <i>covered</i> in Douglas Pine forests on its numerous mountain ranges.  Therefore, I ask of you, dear friend, to please bring our need for Douglas Pine wood before your brother, King Leviathan of Mountania.  We in Fantasmia would be more than willing to offer nearly anything in exchange, as we find ourselves to be most desperate in our requirement of such a commodity.  I ask, in all fairness, that you negotiate reasonably for our sakes, as we are willing to go as high as 100 sovereigns (or such equivalent in other commodities Mountania could use, such as mushrooms, potions, strawberries, or other such exotic and hard to find foods or materials) per board-foot of Douglas Pine wood, though we would much rather pay 25 sovereigns per board-foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI understand with the past history with your family, things might be rather...difficult...in your travels and negotiations with King Leviathan; however, I have sent someone along with this missive that should prove helpful in your efforts of persuasion with your brother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMuch luck and many thanks in your endeavors,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReginald \"Reggie\" Magus<br>\r\nKing of Fantasmia\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucius was excited!  He had never brokered a trade deal between Fantasmia and Mountania before.  This was just the sort of thing to get him out of his doldrums.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Lucius re-read the last line of the letter before letting it roll back up into a scroll.  Reggie sent someone to help Lucius in brokering this trade deal?  If so, then where were they?  Who were they?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door to Lucius's study suddenly swung open with a crash, making Lucius leap up with a shout, grabbing a dagger out of his boot, and entering into a defensive stance in two seconds flat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sound of laughter and the reality of just who had startled him, made Lucius frown and shake his head.  He gently replaced his dagger and crossed his arms over his chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I might have known Reggie would send <i>you</i> to help me broker a deal with Levi.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho was sent to help Lucius with the trade deal?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"I might have known Reggie would send <i>you</i> to help me broker a deal with Levi,\" Lucius said with a shake of his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAchilles laughed and swung his long red pony-tail over his shoulder. \"Well, who else did you expect Reggie to send, bro?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Lucius felt himself being lifted off the ground and his torso having the stuffing squeezed out of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A-achilles!\" Lucius gasped, pounding his brother on the shoulders. \"Let me...down! Can't...breathe!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAchilles laughed again and put his slightly shorter, yet older, brother back down on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What, am I not allowed to say \"Hello!\" to my favorite older brother, whom I haven't seen in a long time?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Favorite?\" Lucius said with an eyebrow raised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, one of my favorites,\" Achilles said with a grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucius just rolled his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAchilles eyed his brother up and down before slapping Lucius on his large belly. \"Seems you've gained a bit of weight since the last time I saw you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucius scowled and swatted at Achilles's hand. \"Stop that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, a bit sensitive about that, huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucius rubbed a hand on the side of his full stomach and said, \"Look, are you here to insult me or help me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAchilles laughed again. He went over to a sideboard filled with numerous spirits, poured himself a short glass of Lucian port, and flopped unceremoniously in Lucius's chair, all the while with Lucius scowling at him. \"Oh, please,\" Lucius said sarcastically, \"help yourself to my liquor collection and have a seat in MY comfortable chair.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, brother! I appreciate your hospitality!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucius rolled his eyes and settled himself down in the chair across from Achilles. He had forgotten how unrepentant and down-right annoying his younger brother could be at times. However, Lucius relished the company of the only family that had <i>chosen</i> to associate with him over the years. Achilles had never held Lucius's teenage misdeeds against him, unlike their father and Leviathan. Perhaps it was because Achilles had been too young at the time to really understand the situation and its complications, or perhaps it was because Achilles was too easy-going and playful. Achilles had always gotten along famously with anyone and everyone, making him a very likeable and enjoyable member of the Mountanian royal family. Lucius had always been grateful that at least someone in his family was still willing to associate with him, even though duties and responsibilities made it not very often.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, other than enjoying the food here in Fatlantis as you always have,\" said Achilles, with a sparkle in his green eyes, \"how have you been, Luci?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucius growled. \"How many times have I asked you NOT to call me that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAchilles merely chuckled. \"You know I only say it to get a reaction from you, and it always works! But seriously, how have you been? Any women in your life?\" Achilles wiggled his eyebrows suggestively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucius sighed and shifted in his seat uncomfortably. \"No. You know there's been no one since....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAchilles became serious for a moment. \"Sorry, bro. I didn't mean to bring up bad memories. But, dude, it's been twenty years! You should have four or five kids running around by now, and you haven't even been married!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Achilles, don't start! Not again! Besides, since Levi's king and he has three sons to carry on the line, it doesn't matter if I have children or a wife or not.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe not, but I can see for myself how lonely you are.\" Achilles got a wicked grin on his face. \"Maybe this trip home to Mountania is just what you need, Lu! It'll give you a chance to meet all the eligible noble women who would kill to get a piece of hot, royal Mountanian flesh like you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, right!\" Lucius snorted. He rubbed his hands over the long arc of his belly. \"THIS won't garner me ANY attention at home, I assure you! Fatlanteans and Fantasmians, maybe, but Mountanians? I don't think so.\" Desperate to change this rather uncomfortable topic, Lucius said, \"Well, enough about me! How about you! I still haven't had a chance to meet your wife and children, you know!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAchilles got a goofy smile on his face at the mention of his family. \"Yeah, I wish I could have brought them. They haven't been home since last year's Mountanian games. But I figured this trip would be too tense and political and short-lived to try and bring them along. That, and Livia hasn't been feeling well lately.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucius frowned in concern at the mention of his brother's wife being ill. \"I'm sorry to hear that. Is she alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAchilles grin widened in masculine pride. \"We don't know for certain, yet, but I have a feeling she's pregnant again!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, then, congratulations!\" Lucius said, holding up his glass to his brother as they both toasted the possible arrival of another little prince or princess into their family. As Lucius knocked back his drink, he swallowed down his envy. Despite his nonchalance earlier, a large part of him longed to have a son of his own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are Troy and Paris looking forward to having a new sibling?\" Troy was Achilles's oldest son, at eight years old, while Paris was five.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We haven't told them yet, since we don't know for sure ourselves, but they love playing with Reggie's young children, so I bet they will be.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two men paused to sip at their drinks. \"Well,\" said Achilles, \"enough small talk. How about this mission Reggie's sending us on? Isn't it ironic that a resource they are completely out of and in high demand for we have in spades in Mountania?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucius shook his head. \"I think it's horrible that past generations in Fantasmia had no thought of cutting down all their Douglas Pine forests without planting any new to replenish it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I agree,\" said Achilles with a nod. \"Such disrespect for the land would never have taken place in Mountania with the Valleyans always in residence.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Valleyans were a nomadic gypsy people who had the freedom to roam and live as they wished off the lowlands of Mountania. Their way of life had been protected for centuries by the Mountanian royalty. The Mountanians, in turn, respected the Valleyans' beliefs in keeping the ground, flora, and fauna of Mountania sacred and protected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, how much do you think Levi will agree to sell the Douglas Pine wood for?\" asked Achilles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucius shook his head again. \"I really don't know. I'll try to make the deal as favorable for the Fantasmians as possible, but I doubt Levi will go any lower than 50 sovereigns per board-foot, especially since he knows Fantasmia is desperate for it. Ultimately, however, I have a feeling that most of the negotiations are going to be determined by Epimetheus.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEpimetheus was the current leader of the Valleyans, and as such would have the most vested interest in the trading of Douglas Pine trees between Mountania and Fantasmia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAchilles nodded his head. \"I think you're right on that account, brother, but have you had to deal personally with Old 'Metheus before?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucius grinned in remembrance of the aged, but wise leader. \"I have, actually, numerous times. Epimetheus and I get along quite well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Valleyans never condemned Lucius for what had happened with Danielle. The Valleyans have a much more open mind when it came to sexual expression and freedom, and they actually encourage their young people to experiment before they marry. Epimetheus had told Lucius that while it had been unfortunate that Danielle had conceived and had ultimately taken her own life, the Valleyans would merely have encouraged them to marry to make the child legitimate. It wouldn't have been the huge, explosive situation that Hercules had made it into.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, yes,\" Achilles mock-sighed. \"Too bad we weren't born royal Valleyans, Lu. We could have experimented to our randy hearts' content when we were teenagers, as long as we took precautions, instead of the awful celibacy Ol' Pops forced on us. Unnatural is what that was!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucius sighed. It seemed no matter how the conversation turned, it always led back to events twenty years gone. He shifted in his chair and blushed a bit. While he had certainly been irresponsible in letting his hormones get away from him with Danielle...it was only the one time. Lucius had been so mortified that he let the situation get so out of hand, that he had never been with Danielle or any woman again. His virtual exile from Mountania only solidified his stance of celibacy, despite the yearnings of his prime, teenaged body at the time...and the many long years since. Lucius was sure his brothers would consider him practically a virgin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAchilles yawned and stretched his long arms over his head. \"Listen, bro, it's been great chatting and all, but I've had a long drive from Fantasmia, and we have another long drive ahead of us tomorrow. I think I'm gonna go ahead and turn in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, Acky.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"ACKY?!\" Achilles rolled his eyes as he stood up. \"Okay, I'll take that as payback for calling you \"Luci\" earlier. You know the nickname I prefer.\" He gave Lucius a large grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucius sighed and shook his head as he also stood up from his chair. \"Yeah, as if I'd go around calling you \"Kill.\" Some poor Fatlantean woman would probably die of a heart attack.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah, she'd just swoon in wonder!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucius laughed and patted his brother on the back as they headed down the hallways to prepare for bed. This journey to Mountania would certainly be interesting!</span></div></div>",

They were nearly at their destination anyway. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they approached the walls of Regis City, the cart rumbled over a bridge, along a road, under a massive archway and into the city. Towering in the distance on a hill and plateau above the rest of the city was the enormous palace of Regis City. Achilles steered the cart towards it and over the drawbridge towards the palace's perimeter walls. Guards waved to them and then hoisted up the heavy portcullises. The cart rumbled inside and they climbed out, carrying their luggage while a stableboy led the horse and cart away to the mews to rest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We can stay here for the day and night and then leave tomorrow after lunch\", Achilles said. \"Come on.

It's the Lord of Laceton and his brother Achilles!\" The maid squealed in delight. \"Have you gained weight Lord Lucius? If you keep up the weight gain you'll be one the most handsome men in Fatlantis.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucius blushes with embarrassment. Achilles and the maid start laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on Luci, don't get embarrassed. She was only trying to cheer you up.\" Achilles said while chuckling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I bet you nice lords are here to visit His Royal Loftiness and his family would love to have you stay for while. Currently Merlin from White Castle is also visiting to test his new products. For a kid he's by far the smartest that I met. He even tutors the young lords. Follow me to the dining room. My Master and his family are about to begin breakfast. I know you two might have important business but feel free to stay here as long as necessary.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hefty maid curtsies and starts walking at a rather fast pace for someone her size, but it's not difficult for the brothers to keep up with her. As she walked her red hair, which was tied into a bun, bounced with as much enthusiasm that she had while she walked. The maid leads Lucius and Achilles to a large door. The maid starts knocking on the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who is it?\" Asked a jolly and booming voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's Honey m'lord. Two more surprise visitors are here to see you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who are they?\" David asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They are Lucius Lord of Laceton and Lord Achilles sire.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let them in. They always make a family meal more lively.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As you wish Master.\" Honey said as she opened the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the door opened four large people were seated at a large table. King David was about the same height as Leviathan, Lucius's middle brother and obviously his father's son. He had fiery red hair contrasted with his cool blue eyes. The six ton king hoisted himself up and walked over to the two Mountainian lords. Surprising ly King David moved rather gracefully for a man of his size, but that was due to the workout habits that he developed thanks to Lucius and it was also the sole reason why he weighed so much combined with his love for Fatlantean Sumo Wrestling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What brings you here my good friend. I see your position as ambassador has been doing wonder, yet I was hoping you would of gotten a bit bigger.\" Davids said as he playfully teased Lucius about his weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I guess the King of Jokesters hasn't lost his touch.\" Lucius countered in a fake mocking tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid gives a short belly laugh before he continues the conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now that's my dear friend that I know. Have you found a lover yet?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucius flinches as he remembers the series of events with Danielle. David realizes that he might have pried into an old wound that hasn't fully healed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're still not over that? I guess it doesn't help that the royal records are extremely inconsistent from that unfortunate day, but please take a seat and join us for a meal. Honey, can you play us a tune that can help brighten the mood? I'm afraid I have accidentally reminded him of a painful memory.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As you wish Your Majesty.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHoney retrieves her violin and starts playing a beautiful Fatlantean tune. Now Queen Isobel stood eight feet tall and weighed significantly less than her husband at only half his weight. David's two 15 year old boys, weighed merely five pounds over half a ton and stood seven feet high thus making them taller than previous princes in the Fatlantean royal family for their age. Lucius talked to the royal family and the young talented Merlin during the duration of breakfast and also ate his fill if not more.</span></div></div>",

I wish dessert was ready so I can be able to eat.\" Cameron groaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me to bro.\" Edmund yawned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like I'll have to provide a solution. I've been meaning to give this new custard I made a try, but I need the perfect test subject.\" Merlin whispered to the heavy princes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that weight gain custard. The sooner I reach a ton the better.\" Cameron whispered as stared at the dark brown bottle that Merlin conjured up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I won't you or your father try it yet. I was hoping for a different subject. Someone from a culture that isn't focused on weight gain.\" Merlin whispered as a mischievious smile appeared as he looked at Lucius.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Lord of Laceton? I'm not sure if he'll want to do it if you inform him that it is weight gain custard.\" Edmund whispered to Merlin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually I wasn't planning on telling him.\" Merlin whispered before a small grin appeared on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe youngsters are disrupted as a few maids and butlers came in carrying a several pies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Forgive us your majesty for we did not have any chocolate sauce to go with the cream pie. We had some last night, but I think someone ran off with the bottle and drank it all up.\" a butler said as he did a short bow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I have just the thing. I happened to bring some chocolate with me from home.\" Merlin said as he tried to refrain from laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid raises an eyebrow with suspicion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Izzy, I think that may be weight gain custard.\" David whispered as he glanced at the dark brown bottle that Merlin was holding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How lovely, I've been meaning to put on some weight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think he's going to give us some yet and I think Achilles can see through this obvious prank.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What makes you think it's a prank?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do I have to mention the kids. Just look at them looking at the bottle in anticipation. I think they're going to attempt to give it to Lucius.\" David whispered as Merlin walked over to the Lord of Laceton.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Should we do something dear?\" Isobel whispered with concern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not at all, I'll anxiously watch to see if their scheme blows up in their faces. If it succeeds then I may have a little prank of my own to pull. Sometimes it is better to give someone a taste of their own medicine.\" David said as a naughty smile formed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid whispers his plan. They then make out and watch as they pretend to be unaware of the prank.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lord Lucius would you like some chocolate sauce with your cream pie. It's a rich dark chocolate sauce that will set taste buds on fire.\" Merlin said while holding onto the bottle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, I love dark chocolate.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMerlin pours some of the custard to the cream pie that was in front of Lucius.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Does anybody else want some?\" Merlin asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe others say no since they know it is a prank. Lucius takes a bite out of the cream pie. A burst of flavor dances in his mouth. Lucius starts to experience a rush of adrenaline flow through his body before he clutches his stomach as a hunger pain took over. His stomach started to growl loudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was delicious, but why do I feel so hungry. Can I have some more pie?\" Lucius said as he started drooling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucius starts grabbing a few more pies and starts applying more of the weight gain custard to them. Merlin stops laughing as he realizes that Lucius was consuming more custard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um guys, I think I miscalculated the side effects of the custard and its potency.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" Cameron asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, bro.? Remember we were complaining about not getting dessert. I think the Lord of Laceton just ate every pie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Fatlantean princes look on in disappointment as Lucius starts chugging the last of the custard. They then notice their father laughing hysterically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think we're busted. I can't believe we jipped ourselves of dessert and father will probably leave us here while he and mother go out for icecream.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please Ed, don't remind me. Father usually let's us punish ourselves. It's so embarrassing when he does.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm... I'm sorry Lucius but I think Merlin and my boys tricked you into consuming weight gain custard.\" David says as he tries to stop laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That explains the hunger, but not the adrenaline rush. Is there more food. I feel like I haven't eaten in months.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well there goes staying only one day. Hey Merlin how long will the effects last? My brother needs to broker a deal in Fantasmia and my bro. Levi is a very impatient man when it comes to trade agreements.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Unfortunately I don't know. This was a new type of custard all together. I was expecting him to literally down the whole bottle. I'll need to document the effects it has on Mountainians before I can make some to be sold in Fatlantis.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, then I guess we'll have to take you along with us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's go out for some ice cream. There's a new dessert buffet where the dessert magically replenishes itself.\" David said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can we go father?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not until you clean the dishes and clean your rooms.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? But, isn't that why we have maids and butlers?\" The fatlantean princes ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, but I just gave them all an hour break just now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But it will be lunch by the time we get done!\" the princes moaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You should of thought of that before you conspired with Merlin to pull a practical joke on Lucius. If you get done then maybe you can have dessert.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucius and his friends leave for the dessert buffet while Cameron, Edmund, and Merlin are left to do cleanup duty.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A large black carriage marked with the Mountanian royal seal sped along the gravel, dirt roads of Fatlantis, pulled by four muscular, black, snorting stallions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile King Reginald had not said that he wanted the trade negotiations with Mountania to happen as soon as possible, Lucius got the impression from Reggie's letter that since Fantasmia was in dire need of Douglas Pine wood, the sooner he and Achilles got to Mountania and worked out an agreement with Levi, the better.  Therefore, their carriage stopped as little as possible, merely for food and rest breaks and for exchanging the horses at inns along the way.  They didn't even stop at night, as they had the drivers swap each other out in shifts while Lucius and Achilles made themselves as comfortable as they could and slept inside the speeding carriage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really, brother, the White Castle is practically in Mountania and only a few hours away from Ferramount!\" said Achilles.  His usual joking mood was waning in the light of Lucius's insistence on getting to Mountania as soon as possible.  \"My body is tired from sitting in this carriage for three whole days without stopping!  Besides, we'll be driving RIGHT BY the White Castle.  What would Mordred think if his good friends, the princes of Mountania, are in such a hurry to commence with a trade deal concerning HIS OWN COUNTRY that they can't be bothered to even come in and visit with him for an evening?  I would think he'd consider it a slight, wouldn't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucius sighed and shifted his own tired buttocks on the carriage seat he had been sitting on for too many hours straight.  Achilles had a point...well, many of them.  \"Alright, alright!  We'll stop in and see Mordred and his family.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAchilles gave Lucius a blinding smile, leaned over to the other side of the carriage, and give his brother a smart kiss on the lips!  \"MUAH!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eeeeeew!  Achilles!\"  Lucius dug out his handkerchief and wiped his lips, scowling at his brother the whole time.  However, Achilles was already excitedly leaning out the carriage door window to speak to the drivers about stopping at the White Castle for the night.  Lucius couldn't possibly miss the enthusiastic cheers of the four men.  He grimaced at himself.  Had he really driven everyone so hard in his eagerness to get to Mountania and out of the boredom his life had become?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Achilles settled back in his seat, still grinning like a loon, Lucius cleared his throat.  \"I'm...sorry, Achilles.  I didn't mean to drive everyone so hard!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, nothing to worry about!  The men know you're excited to go home after having been away for so long!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin the hour, the carriage was pulling up to a large, imposing castle made completely of white blocks of stone.  It gleamed in the late afternoon sunlight.  Lucius had seen the castle several times before, but never this close up.  It was absolutely beautiful.  Occasionally, a rainbow of colors would wave over the castle from top to bottom, just emphasizing the beauty, majesty, and magical nature of the castle and its residents.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the carriage moved over the drawbridge into the castle proper, Lucius shivered as he felt like his body had just moved through an inch of freezing cold water!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAchilles laughed.  \"I forgot to tell you about that!  Those were their protection wards we just passed under.  It keeps anybody with evil intent out of the castle.  It chills you right down to the bone for a second as you pass through them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, they merely have magic protecting their castle?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course not!  If you look closer, you'll see all manner of defenses and guards and bowmen positioned around the castle battlements.  But since they have magic at their disposal, why not use it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe carriage went through a large courtyard and stopped at the far side.  Five people were already standing by the large double doors of the castle waiting to greet them, all dressed in wizarding robes that had various celestial bodies imprinted on the fabric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAchilles, grinning from ear to ear, leapt from the carriage before it was completely stopped and laughed as he engulfed a tall man with shoulder-length black hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mordred, old friend!  How are you?  It's so good to see you!  It's been far too long since you've last been down in Fantasmia!\" Achilles gushed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMordred laughed and pounded his friend on the back.  \"Achilles, I was just there last week!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See?  Far too long!  A day is too long without having you around to play pranks on our old friend, Reggie!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucius hesitated coming down as he saw how easily Achilles got along with everyone.  Would he receive the same warm welcome, despite everything he'd done?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucius took a deep breath and slowly descended from the carriage.  He stood awkwardly in front of Mordred's family, but they were all smiling at him.  Mordred stepped forward and bowed.  \"Your royal highness!  I'm so glad you decided to stop here and visit with us!  It has been a long time, my friend!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucius immediately felt more at ease and smiled back at the shorter man.  He took Mordred's hand and shook it with a strong handshake.  \"It's a pleasure to see you!  Achilles was begging me to stop here for the night, and I'm glad that we did.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, you were getting just as tired of being in that carriage as I was!\" said Achilles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't believe you've met all of my family, your highness,\" said Mordred.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, call me Lucius.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lucius,\" Mordred said with a nod of his head.  He moved to a lovely woman with long, straight brown hair, who had her arm linked with Achilles's.  \"This is my wife, Viviane.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pleased to meet you, Lucius,\" Viviane said, holding out her hand to Lucius, who kissed the air above it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Next to her is my son, Merlin.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi!\" said Merlin with a wave of his hand.  \"I didn't know Cassius, Gladius, and Triton had another uncle!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucius sighed, and Mordred looked at Merlin sharply.  \"Merlin, we don't speak of things that upset other people!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMerlin frowned.  \"But how was I supposed to know it would upset Lucius?  Besides, I've seen Achilles loads of times, and he never mentioned Lucius, either!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Merlin, you will--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mordred,\" said Lucius softly, laying his hand on Mordred's arm.  \"It's okay.\"  Turning to Merlin, Lucius said, \"I did some things when I was young that I'm not very proud of, and my family is still angry at me for them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But, why--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Merlin, that's enough!\" said Mordred.  \"You've embarrassed our guest enough for tonight!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMerlin flushed and looked down at his feet.  \"Sorry, Papa.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMordred shook his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucius felt a tugging on his pants, and he looked down to see a lovely blond girl about seven years old.  Lucius smiled and squatted down so he was eye level with her.  \"Hi.  I'm Lucius.  What's your name?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Igraine,\" the girl said softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a pretty name...for a pretty girl.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl blushed sweetly, then bravely put her hand on Lucius's bicep, feeling the strength of the muscles in his arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you really strong?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I certainly try to be.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have you ever found a Luck Dragon before?  I bet you could find one and not get hurt....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Igraine!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucius looked up to see a woman with long black hair swoop down to her daughter.  The little girl curled up in her mother's arms and began to cry softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucius had no idea what had just happened.  \"I'm...I'm so sorry!\" he said helplessly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman looked back up at Lucius, and Lucius had to catch his breath.  This woman was breath-takingly beautiful, from her dark blue, soul-deep eyes, long oval-shaped face, high cheekbones, ivory skin, and a bounteous bosom to which she was holding Igraine.  Lucius hadn't been so taken with such a lovely looking woman in a long time.  He quickly stood up, a blush suffusing his cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not your fault, your highness,\" said the woman, as she gently stood up as well, still clutching Igraine to her.  \"My husband, Lancelot, passed away recently when he and several others were on an expedition to find a Mountanian Luck Dragon.  Unfortunately, luck was not with him as the dragon crept up behind him.  Igraine is still taking her father's death rather hard, even though it was several months ago, now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMordred leaned in and whispered to Lucius, \"Lancelot barely turned in time with his wand in hand, but the dragon had already blown a great plume of fire at him.  Burned him to a crisp.  We barely had any remains to bury for poor Morgaine and Igraine.  They had no other place to stay, so I have invited them to live here with me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgaine.  That was the lovely woman's name.  Lucius couldn't conceal his horror at learning of Lancelot's awful death, however.  \"Morgaine, I am so sorry for your loss!  How awful for you and your daughter!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgaine nodded her head.  \"Thank you for your condolences, Sir.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I don't know about you, brother,\" Achilles broke in, hoping to ease the tense atmosphere, \"but that long carriage ride made me famished!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucius rubbed a hand on his large, round belly, blushing a bit as it growled.  Everyone chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come, my friends,\" said Mordred.  \"Let us dine together this eve and enjoy fellowship like old times.\"  Mordred held out an arm in invitation, and everyone entered the White Castle for supper.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"I'll be just a minute, Papa,\" Merlin said as everyone was heading to the main dining hall. \"There's something I forgot up in my rooms.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMordred frowned at his son, but nodded his head. \"Alright. But be quick about it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMerlin took his wand out of his robe pocket, swished it over his body, and he instantly vanished from the main hallway only to reappear a second later in his rooms. He went over into a small, well-ventilated room off his bedroom that he used strictly as his potions laboratory. Learning to produce good quality potions from books, as well as design new ones, was a technique taught to all wizards-in-training. Merlin had always had a fair hand at potion-making, and he had come up with several that he thought might make good pranking material. His father had regaled him since he was little with stories about all the hi-jinks he and Achilles got up to with King Reginald down in Fantasmia. Well, Merlin wanted to make his mark on the pranking scene and see if he could measure up to his father's and Achilles's standards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving just met Prince Lucius and feeling the prince was rather uncomfortable in his interactions with Merlin's family, Merlin knew better than to try anything on Achilles's oldest brother. Achilles and his father, Mordred, however, were fair game!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMerlin opened his cupboard where he stored his already made potions. There were so many good ones to choose from! Which would be best for his father, and which would be best for Achilles? Merlin eventually decided on the two potions he wanted to use, closed up his cupboard, waved his wand, and in a flash of blue light, he appeared just outside the dining hall doors. He peeked inside to see everyone sitting at the table, talking and enjoying their first course of appetizers. Merlin smiled. Perfect! He held the first bottle of potion in his left hand, muttered a few words, tapped the bottom of the bottle with his wand, and the level of liquid in the bottle fell about an inch. He did the same to the second bottle before stowing them both in a pocket of his robes and then proceeding into the dining hall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, Merlin!\" his father said as he approached the table. \"There you are! Did you find what you were looking for?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Papa, I sure did,\" Merlin responded with a smile that bordered on a smirk. He noted with satisfaction that both Mordred and Achilles were taking several sips from their goblets of ale, neither the wiser that they were now drinking a potion-laced beverage. Merlin took his seat between his mother and Igraine, and a servant promptly placed a plate filled with food in front of him. His father was at the head of the table, with Achilles on his right and Lucius next to him. Morgaine, as his father's younger sister, sat at the opposite end of the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What would the young master care to drink this evening?\" asked the servant at his elbow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Some lemonade would be just fine for me, thank you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure you want lemonade, Merlin?\" asked Achilles from across the table. \"Surely you're old enough now to enjoy some mead or ale.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMerlin merely smiled and accepted his goblet of 'children's drink.' \"Of course, Uncle Achilles. I just feel like lemonade tonight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAchilles smiled at him in return, but the twinkle in his green eyes made Merlin wonder. \"Suit yourself,\" Achilles said with a shrug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, Reggie's sending you both to Mountania for a trade negotiation, hmm?\" asked Mordred, as the second dinner course was being served.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" said Lucius, as he plowed through his plate as if he were starving. \"Apparently, Fantasmia is in desperate need of Douglas Pine wood for wand-making.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMordred sighed, shaking his head. \"That doesn't surprise me in the least.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nor I, brother,\" said Morgaine with a sad look on her face. \"How our ancestors could have been so careless with such a precious natural resource astounds me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. However, I'm also disheartened that so much stock is being put in Douglas Pine wood as THE WOOD for wand-crafting. There are so many excellent woods out there for making wands, and they all have their advantages and disadvantages. This pressure of everyone wanting a Douglas Pine wand is just a fad, mark my words! In a year's time, it will be a different wood that everyone will be clamoring to have their wands made of. This whole thing is utter rubbish!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I quite agree, brother,\" said Morgaine. \"However, I know Lancelot had a Douglas Pine wand, and I can certainly see why it's being touted so highly right now. My own wand, though, is made of cherry and performs much better for me than Lancelot's ever did.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, let me get this STRAIGHT!\" Achilles frowned. His voice suddenly squeaked really high. Merlin swallowed a chuckle and dabbed his mouth with his napkin to hide his grin. Achilles cleared his throat and said, \"This trade deal with Mountania will probably only be needed for a couple years at MOST?!\" Achilles rubbed his throat and took a long quaff of ale as his voice squeaked again. It was like going through puberty again!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you alright, Achilles?\" Lucius asked as he finished off his second plate of the second course.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I think so.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMordred gave Merlin a stern look, but Merlin gave his very convincing innocent look to his father in return. Mordred turned back to Achilles and said, \"I doubt the trade deal with only last a couple years. Since Fantasmia has no Douglas Pine forests left, even if we began planting trees again, it will take at least fifty years before a tree is of sufficient age to harvest its wood for wand-making. This will definitely be a long-term trade agreement between our two countries, though the amount of wood asked for in the trade will probably vary from year to year based on demand.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mordred, are you feeling okay?\" asked Achilles. Mordred's face had taken on a lighter and lighter hue as he spoke until his face now looked pale and wan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I feel fine. Why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You just look a bit PALE THAT'S...CAW, CAW, CAW!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAchilles's eyes widened. Everyone at the table watched as Achilles's face slowly morphed from having a nose and mouth, to having a long, yellow beak! Merlin couldn't contain his laughter anymore, though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hahahahahaha! HAHAHA, HAHA-HON-KEY, HON-KEY! RIB-BIT, CROAK, RIB-BIT! SQUEAK, SQUEAK, SQUEAK, SQUEAK, SQUEAK!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the sounds coming out of his mouth, just made Merlin laugh harder. Achilles and/or his father must have spiked his own drink! Then, when he saw his father's face and hair turn a disgusting puke-green, he practically doubled over in laughter! Mordred summoned a mirror to see just what his son had done to him, and couldn't help smirking and chuckling himself at how horrid he looked with pasty green skin and hair! Achilles was already in a similar state as his son, holding his stomach as he laughed and laughed, well, cawed and cawed!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore long, the rest of the table soon joined in, and the whole table spent several minutes chortling with glee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, Mordred,\" said Lucius, giving another laugh and wiping his eyes, \"your son seems to have picked up your and Achilles's penchant for mischief-making!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"CAW, CAW, CAW!\" agreed Achilles with a violent nod of his head, his eyes sparkling with amusement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, well, Achilles figured Merlin would try something on us, so he convinced me to put a potion in his drink tonight. Looks like the prank's on all three of us!\" Turning to Merlin, he patted his son on the back with pride and said, \"Those were ingenious potions, Son. I'm proud of you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the table watched as Mordred's face and hair slowly turned from its sickly green color to a bright fuchsia, and Achilles's face morphed again from a bird's beak to a pig's snout! Merlin doubled over with laughter again, continuing to make multiple animal noises as he laughed. \"OINK, OINK, OINK, SNOOOOOORT! MOOOOOOO-HOO-HOO-HOO! CHIRP, CHIRP, CHIRP, TWEET, TWEET!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" Mordred finally said as the third course was being served, and he and Achilles had gone through two more changes: red and orange plaid, then pink polka-dots, and an alligator nose and an elephant trunk, respectively. \"If this keeps up, we'll be laughing too hard to eat the rest of this marvelous dinner our kitchen staff has prepared.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMordred had placed his black wand on the table near his silverware when he had sat down to dinner. It had a brilliant white diamond at its tip. \"Restituo!\" he said, waving his wand in a pattern over Achilles, himself, and then his son.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Phew!\" Achilles said, running his hands over his restored face. \"Thanks, Mor! I was afraid I'd be changing into all sorts of animals all night long!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIgraine gave a cute little giggle, and Achilles gave her a wide smile. \"I bet you liked all those animal faces, didn't you, Igraine?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIgraine nodded her head and gave Achilles a shy smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it was all worth it, then,\" said Merlin, turning to his cousin and running his hand over Igraine's shiny blond hair. His little cousin hadn't smiled much since her father was killed, and he made it his quest every day to try and coax a smile or a laugh out of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know about the rest of you, but I say it's time for dessert!\" said Mordred, waving his hand for the servants to clear the plates so that dessert could be served.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucius stifled a sigh as he still felt rather hungry. He was used to much larger meals with a minimum of six courses. Perhaps he could find a snack later on.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Lucius looked around in awe at the White Castle as Mordred led everyone down several hallways to the dining hall.  The large, white stone blocks were polished and shone brilliantly as numerous torches lit the way along the corridors.  Portraits of Mordred's family lined one of the hallways.  Several ancestors appeared stern and almost disapproving, but most appeared friendly with smiles or mischievous smirks on their faces.  Lucius had to do a double-take at one of the more recent portraits.  He could have sworn he saw the man in portrait wink at him!  Lucius peered closer at the nameplate underneath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, Draxon Osric Canticum,\" Lucius muttered to himself.  He looked back up at the slightly pudgy wizard with dirty blond hair and quickly took a step back, his eyes wide.  It wasn't his imagination:  the portrait winked at him again!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M-mordred!\" Lucius hissed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMordred quickly came over to Lucius's side, a concerned look on his face.  \"Are you alright, Lucius?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That...that portrait winked at me!  TWICE!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMordred looked at the portrait and began laughing.  \"Lucius, that's just Grandfather Draxon!  He magicked his portrait before he died so that his likeness would do something different for everyone.  See what it does for me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMordred stepped close, and the portrait raised a hand and waved at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do any of the other portraits move?\" asked Lucius suspiciously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMordred laughed.  \"A few do, but it's nothing to worry about.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucius shook his head.  Despite the obvious grandeur of this Castle, which reminded him with a pang in his heart of his former home in Ferramount, Lucius was sure he'd be reminded at every turn that this was a palace inhabited by wizards and magic.  Nothing would be as it seemed here, he was sure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they got to the dining hall, everyone began to gather around their usual chairs at the main table.  Mordred was at the head with Merlin and Viviane on his left and right, respectively.  Achilles was next to Viviane, Igraine next to Merlin, and Morgaine at the foot of the table.  Lucius, however, hung back, uncertain where exactly he was supposed to sit, until little Igraine walked slowly up to him.  She hesitantly held out an arm to him, and Lucius squatted down and grasped her hand gently in his.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would you...sit next to me, Uh...Uncle Lu-siss?\" she said quietly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucius gulped and smiled kindly at her.  While he'd always loved being around children, he'd never had one take a liking to him so quickly.  \"I would love to, if....\"  He looked up to see everyone else looking at them.  \"...If it's alright with everyone else.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgaine smiled at him, making the breath catch in his throat.  \"I usually sit at the foot of the table opposite my brother, but how about you sit at the foot of the table, instead, and that way you can sit between Igraine and me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucius cleared his throat, then stood up and smiled crookedly.  \"Sitting between two lovely ladies?  How could I refuse?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAchilles laughed as everyone took their seats at the table.  \"There's the charming brother I know and love!  How can any Mountanian resist the attentions of a woman, even one as small and beautiful as Igraine?\"  Achilles winked at the girl across the table, and she giggled at his antics.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucius rolled his eyes at his brother as servants came and began placing plates filled with salad and bowls of soup on the table in front of everyone, as well as filling goblets with ale, wine, or lemonade.  Lucius eagerly dug into this first course of the meal, anxious to fill his empty, growling stomach.  The meals they had eaten on their three-day trip from Laceton had been hasty and hardly filling, so Lucius reveled in the delicious food provided by his wizardly friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe conversation during the several course meal flowed freely and was filled with talk of the upcoming trade agreement between Mountania and Fantasmia, catching everyone up on happenings in their families, and the current political climates of Mountania and Fatlantis, with plenty of jokes and laughing to make the entire affair quite pleasant and enjoyable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucius enjoyed eating several plates of each course, moaning in delight when a particularly delectable dish met his tongue.  He began to get a bit uncomfortable, however, when he noticed the beautiful lady on his left eying his hands as he ate.  When he grabbed his goblet and slowly brought it to his lips, her eyes followed his hand's movement.  Wondering if his hands were dirty or bleeding or something, he surreptitiously put them in his lap, wiped them with his napkin, and subtly looked them over.  They seemed perfectly normal to him.  However, when he resumed eating, Morgaine was watching his hands again, with a longing look in her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, Lucius was so discomfited, he cleared his throat and asked her softly, \"Lady Morgaine,...is there something wrong with my hands?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgaine shook her head as if coming out of a daze and raised her wide eyes to his face.  She brought her hand to her throat.  \"I'm...so sorry, Prince Lucius.  Was I staring at your hands?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes.  Did you not realize?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgaine's cheeks turned pink.  \"I didn't.  Forgive me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mama,\" said Igraine softly.  \"Uncle Lu-siss has big hands.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgaine sighed, and Lucius turned to the young girl, only now realizing that Igraine had also been looking at his hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, he does, Sweetheart, but we mustn't--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Morgaine, Igraine, not this again!\" sighed Mordred.  Despite the low tone of their conversation at the foot of the table, everyone else at the table had overheard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, but can someone tell me what this is all about?\" Lucius asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMordred and Morgaine had a silent conversation with their eyes, and then Morgaine turned back to Lucius.  \"It all began with our maternal grandmother,\" Morgaine explained.  \"She was a Valleyan.  She had a certain degree of innate gypsy magic in her that initially attracted our grandfather.  She was quite gifted at reading palms and Seeing hints of a person's future.  Her magic seemed to have skipped a generation with our mother, but I inherited some of her Seer's abilities, as has Igraine.  Whenever we are introduced to a person for the first time, it's as if our natures clamor for us to have a look at their palms and read their future.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, yeah!  I forgot about that!\" said Achilles.  \"You did the same thing to me when we were kids.  Freaked me out a bit, but it was cool to have you tell me about my future.  I still remember this one line you said:  \"Achilles, you are very fortunate to have no branches off your love line.  You will love once and completely your whole life, and that love will be wholly returned to you.\"  And let me tell you, as soon as I met Livia, it was the truth!  I loved her from the beginning, and I always will!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, but I wasn't completely accurate, as I remember,\" Morgaine said with a smile.  \"I also predicted you'd have three children by the time you were 30.  You only have two.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" Achilles said with a sparkle in his eyes, \"I think Livia is actually expecting our third; we just have yet to confirm it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?  That's wonderful!  Congratulations, my friend,\" said Mordred.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone raised their goblet at the news of Achilles's possible impending child.  Then, Igraine said, \"Uncle Lu-siss?  May I...read your palm?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucius put his goblet down and looked at Achilles, uncertain.  Achilles shook his head and chuckled.  \"Go ahead, Lu.  Indulge the girl.  It doesn't hurt, I swear it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, it doesn't hurt,\" said Morgaine, \"but an accurate reading reveals both the highs and the lows, the good and the bad in one's future.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucius frowned.  \"So, you're saying that everything in my future you can tell from merely looking at the lines on my palms?  Forgive me if I don't quite buy that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgaine shook her head.  \"Not everything.  Only hints, shadows, possibilities.  Our hands change as we grow older.  Our past and our present shapes the lines on our palms, and so our futures change as we experience life.  For example, my own palms have changed since Lancelot died.  No one anticipated that he would die long before his time.  There is now a distinct break in my love line that wasn't there before, indicating that while my previous love has passed on, I may yet experience love in the future.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Lucius hesitated, Achilles said, \"Ah, come on, bro!  Give it a try!  You don't wanna break a young girl's heart, now, do you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucius looked into Igraine's lovely dark blue eyes--the same as her mother's--and sighed, knowing he would give in.  Yet, still sensing his reluctance, Morgaine said, \"If it would be more comfortable for you, and since Igraine is still pretty new at this, how about she read your right hand, while I read your left?  In general, the two hands reveal the same information for a person, and you can be more confident of your reading, as two people are telling it to you independently.  Would that be alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucius looked at the eager faces of everyone at the table and sighed.  Despite feeling a bit boxed in, he figured it really wouldn't hurt.  \"Alright,\" he said with a nod.</span></div></div>",

I have modified it to suit my own purposes in the chapter.*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, goody!\" said Igraine, as she eagerly reached for Lucius's right hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgaine laughed at her daughter's excitement.  It was so good to see Igraine acting more like her beloved, precocious little girl, instead of the wary, somber reflection of the person she usually was.  Morgaine reached for Lucius's left hand and gasped as a jolt of energy went through her body.  This man was different, she could already sense that.  But to experience THIS kind of connection....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucius squirmed in his seat a bit as Igraine's little fingers running over his palm felt a bit ticklish.  Igraine was peering very closely at his hand, making him feel a bit self-conscious.  No one had paid particular attention to his hands in a long time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can never get over how different the hands are of you Mountanian royalty,\" said Morgaine softly.  \"I have read the palms of the entire royal family of Fatlantis and Fantasmia, and their hands are all soft and chubby and smooth.  But Mountanian hands are rough with calluses and nicked and scarred.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, what do you expect, Sweetheart,\" said Achilles, \"when we Mountanians are always hard at work?  We wield swords, guns, hammers, bellows, picks, axes, saws, any manner of tool or weapon, you name it!  Even though we're royalty, we work and work-out just as hard as the rest of our people, if not harder!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow!\" said Igraine, running a finger along one of the lines on Lucius's hand.  \"Your life line is very long, Uncle Lu-siss!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgaine chuckled.  \"Indeed it is!  I estimate you'll live well into your nineties, your highness!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow!  Ninety!\" said Achilles.  He grinned at his brother.  \"I'm only expected to live into my eighties!  Way to go, bro!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucius squirmed in his seat again, uncertain how to answer.  He was surprised to hear he might outlive his younger brother.  He looked down at his large belly, sitting heavily on his thighs, contentedly full from their scrumptious dinner.  How could someone as overweight as he live such a long life?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pppfffft!\" said Mordred in dismissal.  \"Ninety is nothing!  We wizards typically live past one hundred!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Except you!\" Achilles teased.  \"I remember when Morgaine read your palm, Mor!  You'll live no longer that I will!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the two friends continued bantering back and forth, Igraine wrinkled her brow and said, \"Mama, I don't understand.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Understand what, Darling?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lu-siss's love line, Mama.  It's...hard to follow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah.  That's because there's a long break in it.  See where it starts right below his index finger?  There is a very short line there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I see that,\" said Igraine, moving her fingers lightly over Lucius's palm.  He squirmed again as the gentle sensation tickled.  He didn't know how much more of this he could withstand without rubbing his hands furiously on his pants to override the tickling feeling!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now,\" Morgaine continued, \"move across his palm to just under his ring finger.  The line starts up again and continues clear across to the end of his palm, marking quite deeply, with several branches.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooooooh!\"  Igraine then bit her lip as she kept running a finger over the stretch of palm that had no love line.  She looked up into Lucius's face, and Lucius was concerned to see tears in the girl's eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Igraine?\" he asked softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucius was completely surprised when Igraine dropped his hand, got out of her seat, and scrambled up into his lap.  She put her arms around his neck and held onto him in a tight hug.  Lucius looked at Morgaine with wide eyes, but Morgaine seemed just as astonished at her daughter's behavior.  Not knowing what else to do, Lucius put his arms around the little girl and held her close.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm so sorry, Uncle Lu-siss,\" Igraine said quietly into his shoulder.  \"No one should live without love!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucius gulped and closed his eyes, putting his cheek down on Igraine's soft, blond hair.  He relished in the comfort her warm little body gave him.  This seven-year-old girl was one of the few who had given him comfort over the many years since Danielle's death.  Everyone seemed so quick to blame him for her death, for his misdeeds, and no one acknowledged that he felt her loss and the loss of their unborn child.  He'd not really been allowed to grieve, and the pain of their loss hit him anew as Igraine poured out her compassion for him by holding him close.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe let a few tears escape his eyes in remembrance of his teenage love and the child that had never been.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The rest of the table was silent as they watched Igraine give Lucius a comforting hug.  All present except Merlin knew of Lucius's past.  Mordred and Achilles were both acutely aware that Lucius had kept to himself for the past twenty years, out of fear of losing someone else that he was close to, of losing his head and doing something else to dishonor his family.  Achilles knew that Lucius kept himself so tightly in control (with the exception of his eating--his one vice), that Lucius was almost more honorable than anyone in his family, including himself!  But to hear it so baldly stated that Lucius had not dared to love anyone since Danielle....  Achilles's heart ached for his brother, and it made him more determined to try and find someone with whom Lucius could learn to love again.  Lucius was too good a man to live the rest of his life alone and lonely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgaine, meanwhile, was utterly touched.  Her daughter rarely took to strangers, but from the moment Lucius had stepped from the carriage, Igraine had taken an instant liking to him.  Morgaine could easily see why.  He had an unassuming, friendly air about him, with just enough wariness and caution to pique a woman's interest.  He obviously enjoyed his food, but Morgaine didn't mind a belly on a man, as it proclaimed he enjoyed overindulging.  Morgaine knew that when a man had a passion for food, he often had passions for...other things.  Combine that with his tall, muscular figure, his neat brown hair and deep brown eyes, and the strong, rugged looks that proclaimed him a Mountanian warrior, and Morgaine had felt her heart flutter when she first saw him.  That had surprised her, for it was still soon for her to be showing an interest in a man when her husband had been gone for only three months.  However, the jolt she had felt when she had touched his hand, plus the interesting configuration of his love line, had her looking at him in wonder.  Could she find love again with this lonely man, whom her daughter had already formed a bond with so quickly?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAchilles cleared his throat and said, \"So, Morgaine, what can you deduce about my brother's love life, hmm?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, the resumption of the line indicates he'll find love again, and I'd wager it will be within the coming year.  It branches off three different times, indicating he'll love three different women.  Be warned, though, your highness:  I See ambition and betrayal with one of your loves.  Be careful whom you fall in love with.  However, on a happy note, the third time you experience love, it will be completely and for the rest of your life.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, intriguing!\u201d said Achilles.  \u201cYou hear that, bro?  You'll fall in love three times before you find the right woman to settle down with!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I heard, Achilles,\" Lucius said softly.  He couldn't really believe it.  He'd kept himself from women for so long, and hearing he'd fall in love again, no less than three times in the next year, seemed absurd.  He especially didn't like that one woman would betray him.  Lucius snorted.  As if he'd let a woman close enough to him for <i>that</i> to happen!  Still, a small part of him longed for what Morgaine said, that he'd find his...soulmate within a year.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIgraine suddenly pulled away from him and looked up in his face with a big smile.  \"And you wanna know the best part, Uncle Lu-siss?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucius smiled and ran a hand over Igraine's long blond hair.  \"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're gonna be a Papa!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucius swallowed hard.  Children.  If the impossible happened, and he found love, would he then finally experience the joy of fatherhood, as well?  \"Oh, will I?\" he tried to say as nonchalantly as he could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIgraine nodded her eagerly, her grin widening.  \"Yep!  And you'll have lots!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"May I see your hand again, Lucius?\" Morgaine asked him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucius dumbly extended his left hand to her again, and Morgaine inspected it closely.  Her eyes widened with a gasp.  \"It's true!  I didn't see that before!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See what before?\" Achilles asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgaine chuckled.  \"Your brother will be...er...quite prolific.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, yeah?\" Achilles said with a grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucius's face turned red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see at least five children, if not more.  There are so many little lines underneath his little finger, the exact number is hard to count.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFive children?!  Lucius's eyes were wide.  He could only hope to be so blessed so late in his life!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgaine meanwhile put a hand to her belly.  If Lucius were to be her future intended...she would be the one bearing him those five or more children!  Morgaine didn't have an easy time carrying Igraine and did not truly relish carrying anymore.  However,....  Her cheeks flushed, and she reached for her goblet of wine to wet her parched throat.  The thought of what would go into making all those children had warmth blooming in her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I come and play with your babies, Uncle Lu-siss?\" asked Igraine.  \"I like babies.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucius gave a nervous chuckle.  \"Of course!  I'm sure, when...if the time comes, I...we...er...could use all the help we can get.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIgraine gave Lucius another quick hug and then scrambled down from his lap to go sit in her chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" said Mordred after a pause, wiping the remains of his chocolate cake from his lips, \"let's withdraw to the drawing room for the evening, shall we?  Lucius, I'm looking forward to playing a game of chess with you.  Achilles, here, hadn't presented much of a challenge to me recently, and I hear you're quite the player.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!\" said Achilles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucius chuckled as everyone rose from their seats.  \"I'd be delighted,\" he said.  Anything to get his mind off the rather interesting palm reading he just received!</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Lucius rubbed his sweaty palms on his trousers for the fifth time in so many minutes.  He hadn't been back to Mountania or Ferramount for three years, not since the last time he had been commissioned to broker a trade deal between his brother King Leviathan and King David of Fatlantis.  While Lucius missed his home with all his heart and relished any opportunity to see his beloved country and the palace he grew up in,...his relationships with his father Hercules and his brother Levi were still very strained.  Despite more than twenty years having gone by since Danielle's death and his appointment as Lord of Laceton, his father had yet to truly forgive him for the disgrace he had brought to the royal family.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeviathan was another matter.  Lucius and Leviathan had always had an intense brotherly rivalry, being only two years apart in age.  They were always pitted against each other in contests, competitions, races, school studies.  Levi took every defeat to heart and became that much more earnest to best his older and, when they were children, slightly taller and stronger brother.  It didn't help that their personalities were so different.  Levi relished attention and being around people.  He was a natural-born leader, and people were easily drawn into his sphere of influence.  He was forever going on hunts with the sons of most of Mountania's nobility, hiking and camping and practicing their fighting and survival skills together in the mountainous highlands.  Lucius, however, preferred a smaller circle of friends and enjoyed more quiet pursuits, such as reading and writing.  He enjoyed architecture, sculpture, and music.  Despite his obvious love of food, he also trained rigorously and religiously...just never to the point of obsession that Levi was wont to at times.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucius sighed as he saw the magnificent castle and city of Ferramount looming in the distance outside of his carriage window.  Hercules had always favored Levi's dominant personality, but because Lucius was his firstborn, Hercules pushed him that much harder to try and measure up to Levi's obvious worth as kingly material.  Lucius never seemed to measure up, though, no matter how hard he tried to please their father.  Lucius couldn't help but wonder if Hercules was glad when the mess with Danielle came to light, allowing Hercules to change the line of succession and make his more favored son his primary heir.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLevi never treated Lucius the same after that, even though Lucius had been only sixteen and Levi fourteen at the time.  Of course, Levi had always been closest to their father and idolized him.  While Lucius and Levi had never quite gotten along, as brothers were wont to do, Lucius had always thought there was a brotherly love between them, as well.  Any love that might have existed between them seemed to have disappeared after Lucius was deposed.  If Levi had merely been aping their father's opinion of Lucius, surely such feelings would have decreased over time.  However, Levi was just as unforgiving and barely tolerant of Lucius's presence as their father, no matter how well Lucius had kept himself out of trouble or how well he performed his duties to his country and family as emissary in Laceton.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucius sighed again and rubbed his wet palms one more time on his pants in his nervousness.  When he had received Reggie's letter, he had been so thrilled to have a chance to get out of Laceton for a while that he had temporarily forgotten the type of welcome he was sure to receive in Ferramount.  Now, he just wanted to get this trade deal presented and over with so that he could deal with his brother and father as little as possible.  Even with Achilles' mediatory and joking presence to serve as a buffer, Lucius doubted Levi would be that much more amenable to suffering Lucius's presence longer than a few hours at most.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bro, calm down,\" said Achilles with a shake of his head.  He had watched Lucius's nervous fidgeting for the past fifteen miles and was saddened to see his normally easy-going brother so on edge.  \"It's only Levi!  I thought you were looking forward to being home again!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am!\" Lucius said hoarsely.  \"It's just...all these memories....  And it's not 'only Levi,' as you say.  You know how both he and Father still regard me.  I can never do right in either of their eyes.  The best I can do is just try and make the best negotiation for Reggie and appeal to Levi's sense of trade and fair-play.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAchilles sighed as Lucius looked out the window again, gulped, and rubbed his hands one more time on his thighs.  Achilles didn't know himself why Levi and their father were still so harsh with Lucius.  Achilles got along well with everyone; he just couldn't understand how one little misdeed that happened when Lucius was a stupid teenager should still be ruining relationships in their family twenty years later!  Lucius was a great guy--the epitome of Mountanian strength, courage, and loyalty.  How could their father and Levi not see that?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you're not here all by yourself,\" Achilles said.  \"Remember that I'm here to help and run any interference for you, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucius chuckled.  \"I don't need you to fight my battles for me, Achilles.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know you don't, but what could it hurt to have another fighter in your corner?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucius gave his younger brother a small smile.  \"Thanks, Achilles.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAchilles grinned and leaned over to punch his brother in the shoulder.  \"Anytime, Lu!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucius tried desperately to not let his nerves get the best of him, but when the carriage drove over the massive moat that surrounded the enormous palace of Ferramount, Lucius couldn't help a hard gulp.  As the carriage drove past a large patch of green grass, he watched two teenaged boys viciously practice their sword-fighting.  They had quite an audience watching, and Lucius wondered with the boys' sandy blond hair and tall statures if they were Levi's oldest two sons, Cassius and Gladius.  Lucius had barely met the boys, but he knew that Levi was quite proud of his three sons and that they were shaping up to be good, strong Mountanian warriors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the carriage parked in front of a large set of heavy, wooden doors, Lucius closed his eyes and took a deep breath.  Achilles was right.  He could do this.  He HAD to do this!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAchilles leaped out of the carriage, and Lucius followed him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Cygnus!\" said Achilles, slapping a brown-haired manservant on the shoulder.  \"How have you been?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCygnus was the palace chamberlain.  When the royal guards on the wall surrounding the city spied a carriage marked with the royal seal, they had sent a messenger to the palace to inform them a royal visitor would be arriving shortly, and therefore Cygnus had been patiently waiting for them outside the royal palace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have been very well, your royal highness,\" the man said with a small bow and a smile.  Cygnus's smile faded and his eyes widened when he spied Lucius, but he bowed again.  \"A...pleasure to see you again, as well, your royal highness.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, Cygnus,\" said Lucius kindly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I take it Levi is waiting for us,\" Achilles said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCygnus nodded, then waved to several servant boys who had been waiting behind him to begin taking the princes's luggage off the carriage.  \"Yes, he's waiting for you in the throne-room, your highness.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry about the luggage, boys,\" said Lucius, \"Achilles and I can take care of it all ourselves.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAchilles sighed and swung an arm around Lucius's shoulders.  \"You forget you're in Ferramount, Bro.  Let the boys do their work.  How else are they gonna learn and build muscle?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry,\" said Lucius with a bit of a blush as Achilles led him into the palace, following Cygnus.  \"I guess I'm just too used to being in Laceton, with so few servants around to take care of everything for me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucius took a deep breath and sighed in delight as they entered the large foyer of the immense stone and granite castle of Ferramount.  The numerous Corinthian and round columns, wide sweeping staircases, and ornate balustrades had lines of lovely colors running all through them as they had been hewn and carved and polished out of numerous different native granite mountains--a testament to the diversity yet unity of Mountania's people and land.  THIS was what Lucius had missed living in the lowlands and prairies of Fatlantis for so long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAchilles and he wandered up one of the long, sloping staircases to the second level and walked a ways down a wide hallway before coming to another set of tall, enormous wooden doors:  the throne-room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Lucius's nerves all came back.  Sweat began beading on his forehead, and he wiped his now-sweaty palms again on his trouser legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Lu,\" said Achilles softly.  \"It'll be alright.  Trust me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucius took a deep breath and nodded before the two of them knocked on the doors.  A pair of strong guards opened the doors and bowed before the two princes.  Lucius and Achilles walked up to the doorway, then bowed before...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Lucius and Achilles bowed before their brother, King Leviathan, who sat upon a beautiful, ornately carved granite throne at the other end of the throne-room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAchilles,\u201d said Levi across the room, \u201chow many times have I told you to not stand on ceremony?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAchilles straightened back up and grinned at his brother as he walked quickly down the red runner that ran from the throne-room doors to his brother's throne. \u201cSorry, Levi. I felt such a dignified room deserved that I showed you the proper respect!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLevi chuckled, got down from his throne, and engulfed his younger brother in a quick, tight hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucius, meanwhile, began a meandering pace towards his brothers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLevi pulled back and tugged on Achilles's long red pony-tail. \u201cStill have this thing, huh?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAchilles grinned. \u201cYou know how badly it curls when it's short. Besides, Livia thinks it makes me look dashing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLevi chuckled again, but the gaiety on his face dissolved when Lucius came into view behind Achilles. \u201cYou,\u201d he said simply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucius took a deep breath and nodded his head. \u201cHello, Levi. You're looking well.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLevi sneered. \u201c<i>You</i> are looking fatter than ever.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, take it easy, Levi,\u201d said Achilles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLevi spared Achilles a glance, then focused back on Lucius. \u201cWhy are you here? I have not summoned you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucius presented a scroll with the Fantasmian royal seal on it to his brother. \u201cI'm here by request of King Reginald of Fantasmia. He asked me to personally oversee a possible trade negotiation between his country and ours.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLevi took the proffered scroll and read the brief missive. \u201cDouglas Pine wood? For wand-crafting?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes. Apparently, Douglas Pine wands are all the rage in Fantasmia these days.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, this is just a fad? You honestly want me to negotiate a trade for a commodity that will only be needed for a short period of time?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course not. When Achilles and I journeyed here, we stopped briefly at the White Castle, and Mordred and Morgaine believe that since Fantasmia has no Douglas Pine forests left, they will always have a need for a steady supply of this wood from Mountania.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeviathan went back up to sit on his throne and ponder through this negotiation. \u201cAnd what would they give in return?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, King Reginald is willing to pay mightily for the wood, in upwards of a hundred gold sovereigns per board-foot.\u201d Lucius held back that Reggie was willing to pay twice that amount.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLevi whistled. \u201cThat's quite a lot of gold for a mere board-foot of wood. They must be desperate. However, with our own wealth, we have little need for more gold.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucius nodded. He had already thought of that. \u201cYes, therefore, I was thinking a trade for one of their commodities would be better.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhich commodity? There is little we need from Fantasmia.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh? Did you know that one of Fantasmia's premiere sorcerers has developed a potion to combat mining sickness?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMountania's miners had been dying from mining sickness for as long as anyone could remember. Everyone knew it was a dangerous profession, but the mining industry was a strong staple of Mountanian life, and mining families had grown used to the fact that their loved ones would lead short lives.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Levi's and Achilles's eyes widened. \u201cReally?\u201d asked Achilles. \u201cI hadn't heard that!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cApparently the king of Lucia commissioned the sorcerer to find a cure for the sickness their miners were succumbing to. The sorcerer discovered the sickness was caused by a particular mineral present in the dust the miners breathed in during their excavation. The sorcerer was able to develop a potion to isolate this mineral in the miners' blood and expunge it from their bodies, allowing them to heal and return to work.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLevi leaned forward excitedly. \u201cSuch a cure would be a great boon to our people!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes. In fact, I have already made inquiries about the potion. Apparently, the contaminant in the Lucian rock is the same as what we have here in Mountania that makes our own miners sick. The curative potion is rather simple to make, and I bet if we asked the Valleyans or Mordred, they would be more than willing to make it for us.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don't understand. Why have the Valleyans or Mordred make the potion? Why not trade the Douglas Pine wood for the potion from Fantasmia?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBecause the potion is not effective for longer than twelve hours after brewing. We would need to make the potion here in Mountania for our people to take. What we need to trade the Douglas Pine wood for would be the key ingredient in the potion: feathered ferns.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeviathan sighed. \u201cIt would figure that the main ingredient would be a plant that cannot grow in the arid highlands of Mountania.\u201d Indeed, feathered ferns only grew along the humid southern coastline of Fantasmia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo,\u201d continued Levi, \u201cyou propose we trade our prevalent Douglas Pine wood for Fantasmia's feathered ferns. Interesting and lucrative. I must admit, Lucius, you surprise me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucius shrugged. \u201cI take my responsibilities seriously.\u201d Leviathan had no idea how dedicated Lucius was to his role as emissary. Lucius gathered any and all information he could about the goings on of Mountania, Fatlantis, Fantasmia, Lucia, Obesitan, and any other country that Mountania did or could have dealings with. He was forever having messengers come and go from his manor house in Laceton, bringing him books or scrolls. He was always reading and making notes, coming up with ideas of possible trade deals between Mountanian, Fatlantis, and their surrounding neighbors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow much wood would Fantasmia need every year?\u201d Levi asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, the exact amount will vary from year to year based on demand, but right now, they require a minimum of ten thousand board-feet of wood.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat's a lot of wood they are asking for! And while Mountania is covered in Douglas Pine forests, I am not sure we can sustain such a large demand over the next ten or so years without significant depletion.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI agree, which is why I would like to bring Epimetheus into these negotiations. He knows best how much wood can be cut from our forests and new trees planted and re-grown to keep the tree-levels stable.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLevi's eyes widened slightly in surprise. \u201cYes, that would be a good idea. He and the Valleyans will all be here tomorrow for my annual birthday celebration, and we could speak to him about this matter then.\u201d Levi then gave a small smirk. \u201cYou and Achilles shall both attend, of course. It wouldn't do for members of my family to be present at the castle and not attend such a grand event.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucius gulped. He would have to stay in Ferramount for at least a couple more days, now, and he would have to attend his brother's annual birthday gala. How could he have forgotten the date of Levi's birthday? Levi always held a huge party to honor the occasion, and every courtier and noble family attended the large soiree.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, I forgot tomorrow was your birthday, Bro,\u201d said Achilles with a smile. \u201cIt's been a long time since I've been to one of your birthday parties. Do you still hold a series of competitions and offer roast Mountain goat at dinner?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLevi laughed. \u201cOf course! In fact, Cassius and Gladius came in third and fourth place year in the decathlon last year. I'm hoping they will be even better this year!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt's been a long time since I've been in a competition.\u201d Achilles flexed his impressive arm muscles and grinned at his brother. \u201cThink there's a spot for me in the arm-wrestling competition?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLevi grinned back. \u201cOh, I think we can make room. Though I have to warn you: I have been the winner of that competition for the past ten years.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, then, I'll have to make sure and give you a decent run for your money. Hey, Lu! Which competition do you think you'd want to enter?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucius sighed as Levi's smile faded. Just like that, the civility of the trade negotiations was gone. \u201cWe don't have an eating competition,\u201d Levi sneered. \u201cIf we did, I'm sure you'd be the winner, Lucius.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucius's patience was beginning to stretch thin. \u201cLook, Levi, I do more than eat. I train every day, I'll have you know!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh? You could have fooled me. Seems the only training you get is lifting a fork to your mouth.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on, Levi,\u201d said Achilles. \u201cLook at Lucius's arms. You can't maintain that kind of musculature by sitting around doing nothing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLevi eyed his brother up and down. \u201cAll I see is a fat gut and flabby arms and legs couched in blubber.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucius narrowed his eyes. \u201cLook, Levi,\u201d he said softly. \u201cI don't care what you see. I don't have to prove myself to you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon't you? You want to keep your beloved post in Laceton? Then, I dare you to compete in one of the competitions tomorrow. In fact, I dare you to compete in the other competition I have always won: weight-lifting. Let's see just what those flabby arms and legs of yours can do.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucius clenched his fists and grit his teeth. \u201cFine! If that's what you want, I'll show you I'm not useless weakling!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI look forward to it! Cygnus!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe chamberlain scurried forward and bowed. \u201cMy liege?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShow my brothers to their quarters.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, my lord! Follow me, your highnesses.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, Achilles and Lucius followed the servant out of the throne-room.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Your rooms, your royal highnesses,\" said Cygnus with a bow, indicating two large doors situated next to each other in the family wing of the Mountanian royal palace. \"Dinner will be served at six.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, Cygnus!\" said Achilles with a smile and a pat on the servant's back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Cygnus left down the long, stone hallway, Achilles turned back to his oldest brother. \"So, which room do you want, Lu?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucius rolled his eyes. \"It doesn't matter, Achilles. I'll just take this one on the right, though if I find your luggage in it, I'll trade you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAchilles laughed.  \"Alright. I'll leave you to settle in, then. And, hey: don't let Levi get to you. He may not realize just how strong and trained you are, but I do. Personally, even though I know I shouldn't pick favorites between my brothers, I'm rooting for you to win against him in that weight-lifting contest tomorrow. I'm gonna go unpack, and them I'm going down to the weight room. You wanna join me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucius sighed. While he wanted to do some training himself, he didn't want to be in the palace weight room, where anyone in the palace could come in and watch him sweat,...and see how his shirt would mold to the rounded curve of his belly as he trained. \"Thanks, but no, Achilles. I think I'll do my training outside in the arena, instead.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAchilles shrugged a shoulder. \"As you wish. Catch you at dinner?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, see you then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAchilles went into his room to unpack, but Lucius opted to just go ahead and train. He didn't want to give Levi any quarter. He had no idea how strong his kingly brother was these days, but he wanted to give himself as much of a work-out as he could today to make sure he even had a chance at beating Levi. So, Lucius hurried down the hallways and stairs to a large Olympic-sized track outside the back of the palace that the royal family used for running and training. Situated in the middle of the large, five-mile track was an enormous grassy area with sections carved out for different pursuits: high jump, long jump, pole vault, discus, and shot put; a matted and tiled section for martial arts or wrestling practice; an area with targets and numerous bows and arrows for archery; another area with guns, pistols, and gun targets; and lastly, in the very middle, was a bricked area filled with weights and weight-lifting benches, suspended bars for chin-ups, as well as mats for crunches, sit-ups, and jump roping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was to this middle section that Lucius headed, shedding his tunic in deference to the heat of the day. Plus, he didn't figure there would be too many people or servants hanging about to watch him train. Despite being somewhat comfortable in his skin, he didn't relish the thought of anyone spying him shirtless, with his large belly on display.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Lucius began a rigorous routine, challenging the bulging muscles of his arms and legs with thousands of pounds of weight on the barbells and hand weights, he didn't realize that nobles from all over Mountania and dignitaries from some surrounding countries were beginning to arrive at the palace for tomorrow's celebration of Leviathan's birthday. Many of the guests were arriving early and staying in the palace for the next couple of nights. While most of the arriving guests had already done most of their training and preparation for tomorrow's games at home and merely wanted a good night's sleep, a few ventured down to train with Achilles in the palace weight room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne Duke, however, peered out the large window of his second-floor bedroom and looked on in interest at the sight of Prince Lucius training vigorously, shirtless, and all alone in the royal outdoor weight area. At first, the Duke was confused who the tall, muscular, brown-haired figure could be. However, when the man outside turned to the side, showcasing his large stomach, the Duke's eyes widened in surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It couldn't be,...could it?\" the Duke murmured to himself. He stroked a thumb across his goatee'd chin in consideration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJupiter, the Duke of Valeropetra, had not seen Prince Lucius since he was Crown Prince Lucius, more than twenty years ago. Of course, everyone knew the rumors and speculation surrounding the change in succession and Lucius's subsequent posting to Laceton in Fatlantis. Jupiter wondered at Lucius's unusual presence back here in Ferramount and could only figure it had to do with the king's birthday gala tomorrow,...though Lucius had never attended one before. Regardless, Jupiter might be able to use Lucius's presence here to his advantage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn evil smile slowly curved the Duke's dark mustachioed face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA knock on his open door followed by a \"Father, are you ready for dinner?\" only made Jupiter's smile widen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Almost, my dear,\" he said to his daughter, beckoning her to come join him by the window.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJuno was the Duke's only child and, at 22 years old, was still unmarried. However, Jupiter had been waiting for the right man to marry off his pride and joy. Juno's mother had died when Juno was five, giving birth to her younger brother, who also didn't survive the birth. Jupiter had had no desire to marry again, and so had poured all his devotion and affection on his daughter. Being one of the wealthiest noblemen in Mountania and being possessed of a rather ambitious and cunning nature, which he had passed down to Juno, Jupiter wasn't about to marry off his daughter to just anyone, especially since Jupiter planned on granting his Dukedom to the first son that would come from his daughter's union.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot that Juno didn't attract suitors, because she did--in droves! Juno was tall for a woman, at nearly six feet in height, and possessed a lithe, athletic figure that was rounded in just the right places. She had silky black hair that fell in a long sheet down to her bottom, an oval face with flawless, creamy skin and high cheekbones, and bright, almond-shaped green eyes. She was just as choosy as her father when considering a potential husband: she only wanted the best and wealthiest, strongest and tallest, with the best connections and titles. She wouldn't settle for just any firstborn son of the nobility, and both she and her father were anxious for her to actually marry into royalty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it, Father?\" she asked as she came up to his side, slipping her arm around his trim waist and placing a chaste kiss on his cheek. Despite the fact the Duke had gray in the dark hair at his temples, he still appeared young and spry enough that many mistook him for her older brother than her father.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whom do you see out there training in the courtyard\" Jupiter asked, pointing out the window.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJuno squinted a bit in the late afternoon sunlight. \"I see a fat man training, Father,\" she said with a wrinkle of her nose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, but that's not just any fat man, Juno, it's a very <i>special</i> fat man, if my thinking is correct.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJuno turned to look in her father's brown eyes, at equal height to her own. \"Who is he that I should be concerned with him?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I believe that to be Prince Lucius.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJuno's eyes widened in surprise, and she turned back to lean forward against the window. She gasped when she saw the tall, muscular, yet chubby prince effortlessly heave a two-ton barbell onto its stand, then begin to move back toward the castle, apparently done with his weight training for the time being. His arm and leg muscles bulged and flexed as he moved, making Juno's mouth run dry. Despite his thick waist, the deposed prince had the most impressive form she had seen in a long time,...and considering all the men and boys who had tried for her hand over the past six years, that was saying something!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I believe you are right!\" Juno said softly, upon getting a better view of said prince as he grabbed his tunic and roughly pulled it on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned calculating eyes to her father, and Jupiter smirked, delighted that her thoughts obviously mirrored his own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is he as yet unmarried?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not certain. I have not heard anything about him having a wife or children; however, such information is easily obtained.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He obviously has lived in Fatlantis for too long,\" she said with a sneer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aye, but I'm sure you can curb his appetite once he's wrapped around your finger.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJuno stepped away from her father to begin pacing his room. Jupiter leaned against the wall, crossing his arms over his developed chest, smiling as he watched his daughter's mind work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"His scandal was more than twenty years ago, correct?\" she asked as she moved her hands in front of her as she considered possibilities.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. He was approximately sixteen and got some Fatlantean girl with child. The rumors are that she took her own life rather than deal with the consequences of her actions.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJuno stopped in her pacing to face her father. \"He was exiled to Fatlantis for a teenage scandal that never truly amounted to anything? Are you serious?\" she asked incredulously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJupiter shrugged. \"Such deeds warranted tougher consequences twenty years ago. I think the girl's death caused more outrage against Prince Lucius than if she had lived. However, I have heard he has kept his nose spotlessly clean since then. I have even heard from some of the other nobles that, despite the infrequent use our king makes of him, Prince Lucius has been one of the best emissaries Mountania has ever had.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that can only serve to our advantage, then, can't it, Father?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJuno grinned at her father, who grinned just as widely back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Indeed, Juno. Indeed.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Lucius slid down into the steaming hot bath water, groaning as the warmth soothed his well-worked muscles. He had planned on taking a bath after his work-out and before dinner, anyway. However, he hadn't realized that so many of the guests for Levi's birthday gala would be arriving at the palace early and staying overnight. Lucius had been more than a little self-conscious as he entered the palace after his training to find the corridors filled with elegantly dressed guests and servants bustling about performing their pre-dinner or pre-gala preparations. He had been merely wearing his old trousers and shirt, which had begun clinging to his rounded body due to his copious amounts of sweat. He had said a few polite greetings to some of the nobles who hadn't looked at him in total disgust, and had quickly made his way to his room to clean up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucius dipped his head under the water before lathering up his hair. When he had been the Crown Prince more than twenty years ago, his father had given him a personal servant boy who had attended to his needs, including his baths. However, after the scandal with Danielle and his subsequent posting to Laceton, there were much fewer servants around, and Lucius began to rely on himself more. Besides, he had begun to gain quite a bit of weight around that time, and the thought of a servant cleaning his steadily expanding girth would have just made him that much more self-conscious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucius's thoughts caused an unbidden memory to fill his mind. He remembered the time when Danielle had come upon him in his bath. He had tried to convince her that she shouldn't see him without any clothes on and covered as much of his expanding body (in more ways than one at her presence) as he could. However, his pleas had fallen on deaf ears as she had lathered up a sponge and had begun to run it sensually over his skin. She had caressed the bulging muscles of his arms and his firm pecs before drifting lower and stroking the skin of his round belly. Lucius had let his arms fall to his sides and dropped his head back, moaning, as she soaped off his strong thighs. But his legs had begun to shake as she timidly touched his rock-hard cock. Overcome with arousal, Lucius had then dragged Danielle into his bath fully clothed, making her yelp in surprise. He then held her soft, curvy body close to his as he frantically rubbed himself to completion against her. Two days later, he had taken her fully out in the Fatlantean palace gardens.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucius groaned as his memories made blood pool in his groin. He soaped his hands and began to rub his round belly. He slid his hands down his love-handles and around to his sloping front. He hefted its weight and let it fall back down gently into the water, causing the lower part of his stomach to rub and bump against the head of his cock. Keeping one hand on his belly to caress and rub, he moved his other hand to his erection, encircling and squeezing it. He bit his lip and panted through his nose as he let himself remember his only time with a woman: how her full breasts had filled his palms; how sweet the skin of her neck had tasted; how her hot, wet sheath had held him so tightly, quivering and caressing him as he brought them both to the brink. Lucius tugged on himself an embarrassing three times before moaning and shuddering his release.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucius shook his head and stood up from the cooling bathwater. He grabbed a towel and began to roughly rub his hair dry. He felt guilty that his only wanking material was a single experience he had more than twenty years ago with a teenage girl he had adored and from whom he had stolen her innocence. For the millionth time, he berated himself for having given in to his teenage hormones. He should have taken things slowly, courted her properly, and then asked her father for her hand in marriage. Instead, he had let his \"little head\" do the thinking, ultimately resulting in the deaths of both Danielle and his unborn child and setting into motion the events that would affect the rest of his life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter toweling himself dry, Lucius walked naked from his bathroom into his bedroom. While his thoughts of Danielle were filled with youthful exploration and love, they always left him feeling depressed and lonely. He picked a Lucian silk shirt and a pair of Fantasmian wool trousers out of his closet to wear for dinner. Lucius snorted to himself as he dragged his shirt over his head. Morgaine had predicted that he'd fall in love with three woman--three!--within a year. What woman would want a nearly forty-year-old, overweight, deposed prince for a husband? Lucius tied the waistband of his pants under his belly before looking at himself in the mirror. He sighed and smoothed his hands over his almost too-small tunic. As much as he would love to find someone like Danielle to spend the rest of his life with, after all this time, he was loathe to get his hopes up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe royal Mountanian dining hall was filled with the noise and clatter of cutlery on plates and dozens of different conversations when Lucius arrived. Since there were more people eating in the dining hall than usual, the Head Chef of the palace had set up a large buffet against one long wall of the room. The rest of the dining hall was filled with numerous tables for guests to sit and eat, as well as plenty of chairs, and even an open space to merely stand and talk or drink. The dining hall opened onto a large stone patio that was surrounded by torches, and many guests were meandering outside to enjoy the coolness of the early Mountanian evening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucius stood nervously in the doorway of the large room for a bit, looking around and trying to identify anyone he knew. What he mostly found were sneers or grimaces, subtle shaking of heads, or downright flabbergasted stares. A couple nobles or dignitaries nodded their heads at him and gave him a brief smile, but those were few and far between. As hard as he had worked to be the best ambassador for Mountania he could be, as well as keep himself out of trouble for the last twenty years, his father and his brother appeared to still be maligning his character here at home. So, feeling mostly unwanted and uncertain in the large crowd, Lucius did what he always did to stuff down his uncomfortable feelings: he ate. Lucius parked himself at a deserted part of the buffet and steadily plowed through several plates of food. Whenever he looked out and saw an unkind face, he would turn back around and pile more food on his plate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAcross the room, Achilles watched his brother with a sigh. He saw Lucius chug down an entire mugful of ale, belch into his hand, and then pat his belly. However, he noticed Lucius grimace and look down at himself. That was Achilles's cue to begin heading through the crowd toward his oldest brother. In the fifteen minutes Lucius had been at the buffet, he'd already eaten ten plates of food, and his shirt was riding up his bloated belly to expose several inches of skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, bro,\u201d said Achilles, when he finally reached Lucius. \u201cSlow down a little! There's plenty of food here for you to eat.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucius sighed. \u201cSorry, Achilles. I tend to eat when I'm nervous.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTough crowd?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucius took another large bite of meat pie and said, \u201cDah worsht!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAchilles looked around, grinning at all the people he made eye-contact with. Everyone smiled back at him enthusiastically. However, the gaiety left their faces when their eyes slid to his brother, turning to looks of contempt or derision. Lucius was a great guy! What did all these people have against him, really? Though Achilles had to admit that his brother's eating wasn't helping matters any.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe you should take a break for a while,\u201d Achilles said, taking the half-empty plate of food from Lucius's hands. \u201cGo get some fresh air out on the patio.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucius swallowed and nodded. Getting out of the hot, crushing atmosphere of the dining hall sounded like a good idea. Lucius made his way outside and moved along the edge of the patio to the green grassy area just beyond. He enjoyed the gentle breeze ruffling his hair, the sight of the large, yellow full moon hanging low in the evening sky, and watched the trees in the distance swaying in the breeze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA sultry laughed filtered through the air, and the sound made the hairs on the back of his neck stand up. Lucius turned to his right and had to take a step back at the sight that met his eyes. Other than the dark color of her hair and the thinness of her figure, the woman could pass for Danielle's twin! She turned toward him and gave him a large, charming smile. Lucius swallowed hard. Her eyes were a bright, lovely green instead of deep blue, and she had no freckles on her flawless, creamy skin, but her face had the same shape and features as his teenage love. Was this some sort of apparition? Was his mind playing tricks on him? The woman and the goatee'd man she was standing with began the short walk towards him, and Lucius wiped his sweaty palms on his trousers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPrince, Lucius, I presume?\u201d the dark haired man said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes,\u201d Lucius said with a nod.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man bowed and said, \u201cJupiter, Duke of Valeropetra.\u201d He straightened and held out his arm to the woman, who curtsied. \u201cMy daughter, Juno. It's a pleasure to make your acquaintance, your royal highness.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA pleasure to make his acquaintance? Lucius could hardly believe the kindness and gentility he was being shown. He smiled and, remembering his manners, took Juno's hand and kissed the air above it. He looked into her eyes, getting lost in their lovely depths and the memories they evoked, before saying in a husky voice, \u201cThe pleasure is all mine.\u201d</span></div></div>",

As much as he preferred the more formal address of \u201cFather,\u201d his sons never did call him that.  Well, except Lucius, he thought with a sneer.  His oldest son always cowed to his wishes, when Hercules would rather he had more of a backbone and called him \u201cPops\u201d as Leviathan and Achilles always did.  Lucius never did have the strength and character to stand up to him, let alone be High King.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, Pops!  Long time, no see!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAchilles!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHercules laughed in delight as his youngest son squeezed him in a tight hug.  Hercules held Achilles at arms length, letting his eyes rake over his slightly taller son.  He tsked and shook his head in mock dismay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStill have your hair too long, I see.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAchilles merely laughed and rolled his eyes.  \u201cNot this argument again!  The boys love it!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow are my grandsons?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTroy is eight, and Paris is five.  Both growing like weeds.  They're forever getting into trouble, especially with Reggie's kids.  You'll have to come down to Fantasmia some time for a visit.  I know the boys and Livia would love it.  Reggie would love a courtly visit, too.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh, yes, King Reginald.  I've heard nothing but good things coming out of Fantasmia these days with Reginald at the helm.  Perhaps I should go down and visit soon.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know Reggie would always welcome you, Pops.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, what brings you back home, Son?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReggie's wanting to open a trade deal for some Douglas Pine wood.  Apparently wands made of Douglas Pine are all the rage in Fantasmia these days.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHercules's brow furrowed.  \u201cHe sent you here to broker this deal, then?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, I'm only here to help.  He actually asked--\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWHAT IN ALL OF MOUNTANIA IS <i>HE</i> DOING HERE UNINVITED?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Achilles and Leviathan winced and withheld rubbing their hands over their abused ears.  Their father always did have a loud, booming voice when he was angry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPops!\u201d Achilles tried to say, but Hercules was already half-way across the room, his long strides taking him outside to the grassy area beyond the patio.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know,\u201d Achilles said, turning to Levi and giving him an uncharacteristic scowl, \u201cyou could have told him Lucius was here.  Now, he's going to completely embarrass him in front of everyone!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLevi shrugged carelessly.  \u201cLucius does plenty to embarrass himself.  He doesn't me to do that for him.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhen will you ever get your head out of your butt and open your eyes, Levi?  If you really took a good look at Lucius, you'd see just what a good man he is, instead of this false picture that you and Pops have been painting him as all these years.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLevi snorted, and Achilles turned to stalk off.  Achilles decided he needed to let loose some steam, and the palace weight room was calling his name again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Lucius stared aghast as his father bellowed and then quickly came to his side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLucius,\u201d Hercules growled, \u201cyou were not called.  Why are you here without permission?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucius gulped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you remember nothing I taught you, boy?!  Stand up straight when you look at me!  How can you expect to be any kind of a soldier with such sloppy posture?  And speak when I ask you a question!  WHY ARE YOU HERE?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucius quickly stood up straight and tall, his feet shoulder-width apart, and pushed his shoulders back.  He looked straight into his father's eyes and said softly but confidently, \u201cI am here on the request of King Reginald of Fantasmia, Father.  He asked me to personally broker a trade deal between his country and Mountania for--\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDouglas Pine wood.  Yes, yes, Achilles told me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHercules scowled at his son, his eyes raking over Lucius's body.  He sneered when his eyes landed on Lucius's swollen gut.  Lucius's current posture made his belly stick out even worse than usual.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStill haven't learned any self-control, I see,\u201d Hercules scoffed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour highness,\u201d came a soft, deep voice off to the side.  \u201cIf I may be so bold, perhaps this is not the best venue for you to air your grievances with your son?  Might I recommend a more private location for your...conversation?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHercules turned with surprised eyes to see the Duke of Valeropetra and his lovely daughter standing near Lucius.  In his ire, he had not even noticed the two Mountanian nobles.  Hercules then looked further and realized that everyone on the patio was staring at him and Lucius with wide, eager eyes and that all conversations outside had practically ceased.  When the guests realized they were being caught staring, they quickly averted their gazes and began talking again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHercules did not like the fact that the Duke had the audacity to speak to him in such a way.  However, the king grudgingly conceded that the noble was right\u2014if he wanted to berate Lucius, he should do so indoors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou are correct, Jupiter,\u201d Hercules said through gritted teeth.  \u201cHowever, speak to me in such a manner again, and I will give your title over to someone more deserving!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJupiter bowed low before the king and said, \u201cThank you, your majesty.  I will try to have better control over my tongue in the future.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHercules nodded at the Duke, glared at Lucius, then spun on his heel and left.  He had no more to say to his son as the present time and had no more desire to be in his company, either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucius looked at the Duke in awe.  He was completely surprised that the Duke had come to his rescue and actually defended him in front of his father.  The only other person who had ever done that for him before was Achilles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Duke straightened from his bow and grimaced.  \u201cNo offense, your highness, but I think your father is a fool to not take pride in the man you have become.  No one deserves to be spoken to like that in public.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucius offered his hand to the Duke, which the Duke took gratefully, and the two shook hands.  \u201cThank you, your grace.  I appreciate the assistance.  To be honest, I have rarely received such in my life.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo thanks are necessary, your highness, and it's Jupiter, if you will.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJupiter, then.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, the night may be young,\u201d said Jupiter with a mock yawn, \u201cbut we had a long ride today, and I'm knackered.\u201d  He kissed his daughter on the cheek and said, \u201cPlease, stay and enjoy yourself, my dear.  I'll see you in the morning before the games.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood night, Papa,\u201d Juno said, kissing him back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Jupiter left, Juno and Lucius looked at each other.  Silence stretched between them for a bit.  Lucius was embarrassed that she had seen how awfully he was treated by his own family and didn't know what to say to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt's a...lovely night,\u201d Juno said softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes.  Yes, it is.  There's a pleasant breeze, and the moon is bright and full.\u201d  Lucius rolled his eyes at himself and his horrible banter.  He had no idea how to speak to a woman!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoft music began to filter out through the dining hall, as the palace musicians began playing a popular Mountanian folk ballad.  Several couples began dancing in the open space inside as well as on the patio.  Lucius saw the longing in Juno's eyes, and he swallowed hard.  He hadn't danced since he was a teenager.  He'd probably end up stepping all over her feet.  However, he'd do just about anything to stay in this captivating woman's presence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWould you...care to dance?\u201d Lucius asked, offering her his hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJuno looked up at him in delight, but saw the uncertainty on his face.</span></div></div>",

She didn't relish the thought of getting her feet stepped on if Lucius were rather unsure of his dancing abilities. So, instead, she smiled softly at him and laid a hand on the bulging muscles of his forearm. She sucked in a quick breath as she slowly ran her hand up and down a bit on his arm, taking stock of just how firm and thick his muscles were. He truly did have a magnificently built form...minus his overlarge belly. However, if she were to ultimately achieve what she wanted, perhaps she would be wise to encourage his vices for now. If he felt good about himself, he'd be more likely to be susceptible to her suggestions later on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know,\" she said, looking alluringly up at him through her lowered lashes, noting that the look made him gulp, \"I think I'll pass on the dancing. However, I wouldn't mind a plate from the buffet. I haven't had much to eat yet this evening. I bet you're still hungry, as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJuno swallowed down her disgust and moved her hand from Lucius's forearm to the front of his belly, giving it a couple delicate pats. She smiled at his resulting blush. She figured he was either embarrassed at her blatant touching of his person, or he was ashamed at the size of his stomach. Either way, it fell well into her plans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucius cleared his throat. \"I had...quite a bit to eat earlier.\" He futilely tried to tug down his shirt over his swollen midsection. \"But may I lead you to the sideboards so you can get a plate of food?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Certainly! I'm sure you can suggest some of the better dishes to eat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucius smiled at her and held out his arm. \"That I can help you with.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJuno chuckled and wrapped her arm around his before he slowly led her across the patio, through several gaily dancing couples, and then back into the warm dining hall. Juno smiled smugly to herself when she heard whispered conversations erupt after their passing. A bit of gossip at this stage never hurt. It might even improve everyone's outlook on the deposed prince, as well as increase her own standing in people's eyes, to have the two of them talked about as a couple. Despite everything, Lucius was still a prince, and though he lived and worked in Fatlantis, he was still quite the prize for any woman to catch. Even though he had quite a gut on him, he had the rugged good looks, bulky muscular build, and air of royalty about him. Juno knew that they would look quite the handsome couple standing together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they got to the sideboards, Lucius was about to take a plate, when Juno stayed his hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let one of the servants come over and dish up a plate for me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucius's face reddened again. \"Sorry, my lady. I'm not used to having a lot of servants around to do everything for me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucius waved a hand at one of the servant boys, who scurried over and bowed to the couple. \"May I serve you, your highness, my lady?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Juno proceeded to tell the boy which of the delicious dishes she'd like a portion of, she noticed out of the corner of eye that Lucius was eying several of the dishes with longing and even licked his lips a few times.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you might want to try the roast pork, my lady,\" Lucius said. \"It's cooked to perfection this evening.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJuno smiled and indicated the dish to the serving boy. \"Are you sure you don't want anymore of the pork yourself, your highness, since you said yourself it was so tasty?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucius groaned and put a hand on his belly. \"I...really shouldn't.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJuno stepped forward and put the front of her body within a few mere inches of his. She saw him gasp, and she could feel a low tug in her belly at the amount of heat pouring off his strong body. There was definite chemistry between them. She placed her hand on the exposed side of his belly that his shirt couldn't cover and that was out of sight from the rest of the room. Even though she thought his fat was disgusting, the skin on his belly was warm and smooth. She gave it a brief rub. He bit his lip, but he couldn't completely keep in the low moan her touch elicited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe kept her voice low and husky and looked directly into his eyes when she said, \"A big, strong prince like you must have quite the appetite. You need lots of...,\" she licked her lips and saw his eyes follow her tongue's movement, \"fuel for all those muscles of yours.\" She slowly moved her hand up from the side of his belly to his firm, enormous pectoral muscle, feathering her fingers over the nub of his nipple as she did so, making him shiver in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucius began panting, and sweat began beading on his forehead. Her subtle seductions were having noticeable effects on him. He's never been around a mature, attractive woman with such...wiles before. He was nearly powerless against her skill.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...m-m...my lady, wha--...er....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing that she had made him speechless, Juno stepped back a little and withdrew her hand from his body, but not before she had gotten a good idea of just how large and broad his chest was. If he participated in the games tomorrow, she was definitely going to root for him. With his apparent strength, he could probably beat the king at any game! ...Which was exactly what she was looking for in a husband.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe demurely placed a fingertip against his lips, making his eyes widen. \"Shh, my lord. I'll have the boy fill up several plates of food for you. You must be obviously hungry. And, please, call me Juno.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJuno was delighted when Lucius placed a small kiss on Juno's fingertip before grasping her hand delicately and kissing the back of it. Juno smiled at this sign that he would return her affections. She hoped he would be a passionate, yet tender lover...when the time came, of course.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Juno,\" he said huskily. \"And I am Lucius to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith her eyes still on Lucius's, Juno commanded the servant boy to finish preparing her plate of food and to fill four plates full for her new princely target.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeviathan scowled as he speared a hunk of Mountanian steak. \"Why did he have to come and ruin my birthday?\" he muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQueen Athena, who was sitting next to him, sighed and took a sip of tea. \"If you're referring to Lucius, I'm sure he didn't realize it was your birthday, Honey. Besides, how could his mere presence ruin your annual celebration?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look at him! He's a fat, disgusting pig with no decorum or manners!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAthena looked across the room at Lucius, and the sight of him with the lovely Lady Juno made her smile into her cup. \"Oh, I doubt very much he that he has no decorum or manners to have attracted the attention of the very choosy Lady Juno.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLevi slammed down his fork and knife and glared across the room at the couple moving away from the sideboards: Juno carrying one plate of food with an arm wrapped around one of Lucius's, her body pressed nearly obscenely close to his side, while Lucius was balancing two plates piled high with food in each hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe king grimaced. \"What in the world would that lovely Mountanian flower see in...in....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...in your handsome, strong, possibly charming, royal older brother?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot having a reply to his wife's observations, Levi glared down at his plate and resumed his eating. If Lady Juno wanted to waste her time on his worthless brother, well, that was her business.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, how did it go?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>*sly grin*</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like taking a rattle from a baby.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How long until he proposes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Two months, tops.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That long?\" <i>*chuckle*</i> \"I doubt it will take longer than four weeks, my dear. Claudius reported to me the effects you had on him after I left.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>*pacing towards window*</i> \"With our connections to the crown, do you really think we can overturn the succession?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Queen Athena's father was a mere baron. If she has any royal blood in her background, it is from much farther up the family tree than ours.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>*derisive snort*</i> \"Too bad Hephaestus was such a less than stellar member of the royal family.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, let alone the fact that he seduced my great-grandmother. Fortunately, Circe's father had the foresight to have her marry his heir apparent, legitimizing her son, thereby saving her from disgrace and continuing on the ducal line. Who would have thought that keeping our ancestry hushed would eventually serve us well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When the truth comes out, won't people condemn us for being descended from Hephaestus's indiscretions?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was more than a hundred years ago, now, my dear. No one can blame us for the blood that flows in our veins. Besides, it's that blood, that when connected to Prince Lucius's, can convince the rest of the courtiers to petition with us to overturn King Hercules's succession.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>*sigh*</i> \"There's still so much resentment over him, Papa. Did you see all the negative looks he received this evening?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, but Claudius told me how those looks turned to at least indifference when he was paired with you. You make a handsome couple, my dear. And when stories of his positive ambassadorial activities begin to circulate, as well as how little used he's been by the current king, court opinion of him can only improve.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And if he makes a good showing at tomorrow's games...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...well, that will only prove good for us, as well.\"</span></div></div>",

The woman wore a cloak that covered her sad brown eyes. Her nose had several freckles. Her blonde hair peeped out of her hood. Her body was busy and beautiful only being slightly heavier than the average male and stood at 8 feet high. The woman pulled out a locket that was well crafted.  Inside of the locket was a picture of herself and a younger version of Lucius. The woman sighed as she watched the two men lift.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile Lucius was lifting like no tomorrow.

I happen to know the man that runs the joint. He's the current Fatlantean Ambassador to Mountainia. Once he came to Dracoburg he started a chain of restaurants.  He even took to hunting to incorporate Mountainian foods with Mountainian classics.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's amazing. I bet he's pretty strong since coming here.\" Juno cooed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" He's strong but he's a lot fatter than me. I believe he weighs 3500 lbs. He's just too good at hunting.  He catches more game than any man or woman in Dracoburg.  He even breeds animals for the sole intent on serving them in one of his restaurants.\" Lucius said as he liked his lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter 30 minutes of walking Lucius and company arrive at Dukefield Eatery.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello and welcome to my master's restaurant.

Morgaine was going to slip in a truth potion to expose Juno but thought it would be better to let the selfish diva expose herself as the wicked woman that she is. Lucius, however, was busy stuffing his face and relishing the food. It wasn't as addicting as Fatlantean cuisine but it had a nice rich taste.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing is better than eating with company.

These ladies are just friends.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" I see... Maybe the foreign dignitary has caught your eye. She looks like one to be romanced.

How would see know something like that? \" Danielle said concealing the fact. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My wife has the ability to tell where someone has been by glancing at their eyes milady. She is from Shanze, the land of the lost arts. It is  said that a stray group of Valleyens found it and developed their own culture.  The result was a mixed diverse culture.  I believe the only way to get there is by climbing a beanstalk.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" I have heard of such people.  They are beyond Sumotorio.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" You are correct.

One thing that Lucius noticed that out of all of them Zantar and Eric were well toned, while Morton was fatter than the average Fatlantean and Danielle was slightly chubby, but not as much as Lucius.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pardon me miss dignitary, I wasn't expecting into running into you here.

As milady's adviser I must test your skills. Unbeknownst to you milady has taken quite an interest in you. You see milady is our queen's only heir and I must help her in finding a suitable king.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sir Zantar, that isn't necessary. I need more time to think about it. I'm not ready to commit myself to a man.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well, but it is still good for educating those who don't know our sport.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know what you guys are talking about but I haven't decided upon a wife.

She quickly wipes them before Lucius could notice. Lucius and Morton begin their practice match. Lucius was surprised that a man of a Fatlantean build could match his strength. After a few minutes the match ended in a draw. Lucius began panting as sweat ran off his body. He didn't feel so pumped since the weightlifting competition.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was a challenging match. Hopefully your sport receives a warm welcome miss dignitary.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you Lucius, but I have to go.\" Danielle said as she rushed off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile rushing off Danielle accidentally drops her locket. Lucius picks up the locket. Oddly the locket felt familiar. It was like the one he gave to Danielle many years ago. When he opened the locket he realized it was the exact same one. He noticed the picture of himself and Danielle in their teen years.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This can't be... I knew there was something oddly familiar about the dignitary, but to think it was her... I must find Danielle and give this to her. I don't want to rush into a relationship again, but if we can start over as friends then it will help me figure out who I am suppose to marry. To think a former love would be the third woman I fall in love with... Totally ironic. Yet, I must not let anyone know or else father will scold not only me, but her as well.

She had tears running down her face. Lucius could see his own pain reflected in her eyes. What was he going to do?  He wanted to comfort her, but he could only remember the painful memories of her supposed death. Lucius musters his strength to shake off the feeling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know the pain that you feel.

Even though it was clear that Danielle was still alive, the Danielle that Lucius knew was dead. The once perky chubby girl was replaced by a tall hefty woman of great beauty who lived chained to her tragic past. Lucius was at a loss. He didn't want to see Danielle suffer, but he didn't know who he truly loved. It seemed clear until Danielle's rejection. Lucius knew it would be foolhardy to mourn over the dead, but he couldn't let someone like Danielle throw her life away. He felt like it was his responsibility to make things right. Even if she isn't his soul mate he still had to try. All he cared about was mending the wound that he and Danielle shared.</span></div></div>",

He knew his father would just criticize him about his weight, Levi wouldn't give him the light of day, and Achilles would probably say something ridiculous. Lucius went off to the royal garden and spotted Morgaine by the fountain. Morgaine smiles upon seeing him. Morgaine felt her heart skip a beat as Lucius approached.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Greetings Lady Morgaine.

It was apparent that he hasn't made a decision, so helping him with the issue may not seal the deal yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am sorry for her pain. The only advice I have is to follow your heart.

Morgaine felt her life being sucked out of her due to Lucius's strength. Lucius then breaks the hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry about that. I guess I got carried away. Thanks for the advice. I'll see you tonight. The dignitary from Sumotorio is going to be demonstrating her sport tonight. After that I have to get ready to leave for Fantasmia.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgaine sighs as Lucius walks off. Things might work out for her after all. She imagined herself in a wedding dress with Lucius waiting at the end of the aisle. Then her thoughts shifted to the possibility of not marrying Lucius. She dimissed due to not knowing how future events will play out. Lady Juno who had secretly observed the conversation grew jealous. She isn't going to let some mage steal her not yet trophy husband. She conspired a way to using Lucius's code of honor against him. Juno pulled out a vile from out of her cleavage. It was a bottle of Two-way potion. She has seen its effects on men and women and thought to carry some around if she had to use force.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two-way potion often leaves whoever consumes it with a dying hunger. In Fatlanteans it increases muscle by a large degree, while in Fatlanteans it increases fat. She has heard of the weird exception where it causes both but she didn't care. She cared about the part that turned the consumer into a sex hungry animal. While in effect the sexual arousal of both men and women are heightened. If she couldn't have Lucius marry her by the traditional way then her last ditch effort will surely work in her favor. She places the vile back in between her cleavage and walks off.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Later that night after Danielle demonstrated Sumotorio's sport she was sitting at the table with her men. The next morning she was planning to head out for Fantasmia and then go to Fatlantis. However, she was unaware that Lucius and his party were also planning on heading down to Fantasmia as well. She was sitting at the table drinking a glass of water she noticed that Lucius was walking towards her. Danielle tried to conceal her blushing, but some onlookers were already whispering about her being attracted to Lucius.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Greetings Lady Dignitary. Your demonstration of your national sport was amusing.\" Lucius greeted while offering his hand. \"Would you like to dance? Just for old times sake and nothing more.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um... I...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course she would. It would be impolite to reject such a nice gentleman.\" One of her guards said as he nudged her into Lucius.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucius and Danielle both start blushing. Lucius regains his composure and leads the love struck Danielle to the dance floor. The two started dancing. Danielle had one arm wrapped around Lucius's shoulder and the other around his waist. Danielle blushed as she noticed that Lucius's waist was firm, yet soft and warm at the same time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\nAs the dancing continued the rumors about Danielle spread in the ballroom like wildfire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought that Lucius has fallen for Juno. Is he trying to start a harem?\" One noblewoman questioned with a look of disgust on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think he is trying to. I thought he had eyes for that sorceress though.\" A nobleman  responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJuno looked at Danielle with a hint of jealousy. Lucius was supposed to be her man. No one would dare mess with her when she wanted something. It was already a pain trying to find a way to quietly get rid of Morgaine. Now she had another competitor for the man she lusted after. Her father approaches her seeing the current predicament.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see there are others who want to be with Lucius. You're not going to let such a petty thing such as some foreign dignitary get in your way now? I may have some valuable information that you can use to blackmail the dignitary. There have been rumors saying that she may be Lucius's former teenage sweetheart. If that is true than she must have clearly faked her supposed death or somehow miraculously survived the poison that killed her and her child. I suggest that you inform both the king and the former king in private. I will vouch as a witness along with whomever else had known the dignitary before her 'death'. It may be a risky move, but I am confident that you have your own methods for securing Lord Lucius for yourself.\" Duke Jupiter whispered into his daughter's ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry father for I have a secret weapon of my own. For a war of love I'll use any trick that I have. I'm an expert with a bow and good at throwing daggers. If Lucius loves tough women then I'll use my combat skills to woo him over. If not I'll try flirting with him. As a last resort I have a Two-Way potion at my disposal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see that you're willy to go that low. I'll let you do as you fancy, but please consider my suggestion as an extra trump card. If the Two-Way potion fails and he winds up with another woman or openly rejects you, then you may be putting our position on the line.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I understand father, but if he impregnates me he'll have no say but to marry me. Remember not all men have to be willing to agree to a woman's persuasion.\" Juno whispered into her father's ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgaine gasped in shock. Juno was as vile or even worse than she had originally thought. Morgaine was not sure what to do. She was a foreign visitor and Juno was a Mountainian noble. No one would believe what she had heard about Juno. Morgaine decided that she needed more proof before presenting the intentions of both Juno and her dastardly father.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe music died down and a soft song could be heard from the musicians. Each musician played his or her instrument with grace and kept a watchful eye just in case they would have to draw their own weapons in the case of a sudden invasion. Lucius's stomach growled softly, alerting him that he's starving from all the dancing. Danielle giggles slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would you like me to get you something?\" Lucius asked only for his stomach to growl louder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you mi'lord, but I think I should be asking you that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucius blushed only to notice that Danielle still had her arm around his ample waist. Danielle snaps out of her transfiction and quickly removes her arm. A blush appeared on Danielle's face as Lucius gently grasped her hand. Morgaine sighed as she saw the man that she had fallen for walk away with his teenage sweetheart. If Morgaine wasn't the one to marry Lucius then she would rather see him marry the dignitary than the cruel snake who calls herself Lady Juno. But Morgaine knew she still had a chance and opted for the honest approach to win Lucius's heart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKing Leviathan and Queen Athena were sitting on their thrones watching the events. Leviathan was already in a foul mood from being out lifted by his fatter older brother. Now to see Lucius smoothly go between talking to Lady Juno, Morgaine from White Castle, and the oddly familiar foreign dignitary from Sumotorio drobe the king to loathe his \"incompetent brother\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First he beats me and then he flaunts himself with the women. He is seriously boasting about how much more a man he is than myself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hush now Levi. I think your still reeling from that competition. You may have a chance during the this year's games. To me it looks like your brother is proving himself to be quite the gentleman.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLevi grumbles as he watches his older brother strike up a friendly conversation with his eldest and youngest sons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Greetings Uncle Lucius. I see that you're enjoying yourself in Fatlantis.\" Cassius said in a friendly, but joking manner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucius and Danielle chuckle at Cassius's humor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Apparently so. I was surprised that I was able to one up your father in the weight lifting competition.\" Lucius said as he lifted his belly for emphasis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassius, Triton, Achilles, Danielle, and Morgaine burst out laughing. Levi puts his hand to his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He has officially ruined my birthday celebration as always.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on Levi, he's just being witty. You would hate to admit it, but I think that's who Cassius and Triton get there humor from.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLevi sighs and leaves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where are you going dear?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm going to the weight room to blow off some steam. I can't take this humiliation anymore.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mind if I join? The formalities of the party have gotten dull with everyone heading to bed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't care. Just make sure that you find someone to oversee the events.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Levi I think Cassius is already doing that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good. Let's go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLevi and Athena promptly leave for the weight room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ladies and gentlemen, may I have your attention please. In my father's and mother's absence I will oversee the rest of this party. If everyone will please head outside for party games and refreshments that will awesome.\" Cassius said as he led the remaining guests outside. Lucius and the guests...</span></div></div>",

As such everyone is required to form a team, not only to guarantee the safety of everyone, but also as a team building exercise. Every team must have a first aid kit. Within these kits are various items that can cure almost any aliment or injury. The team that finds the most things win. Happy hunting everyone.\" Cassius said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassius then whispers into one of his servants' ears. The servant nods in agreement and Cassius hands the servant a sack of gold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't believe you would actually think of this brother. Normally I would suggest stuff like this. I bet Pops is going to yell at you for a few hours straight.

You know you sound as annoying as Uncle Lucius. You do know that long ago he...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGladdius gets hit in the head by Cassius.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is rude to speak about others behind their backs brother. I swear you believe everything that father and grandfather tell you. It's a shame that he's not king, but he could still become a king. Just not of Mountania. Now pick up a sword so we can defend ourselves while on the scavenger hunt.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone grab a weapon and teamed up Lucius was in a team with Achilles, Morgaine, Danielle and, Juno. Juno was glaring at Danielle and Morgaine while Morgaine was glaring back at Juno. Danielle lets out a sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's see what we need. Looks like we should get some wolf meat.\" Achilles said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah I forgot it was wolf hunting season. It comes every five years.\" Lucius replied<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's wait on the wolf meat. Wolves have keen senses and we would be screwed to tangle with a pack of wolves. Why don't we get some flares. They should be selling them in town. We can also pick up some Brute Root on our way.\" Juno said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm... Brute Root... I believe it's used to relax the mind while boosting energy. I hear it is the ingredient including in almost every Mountainian drink. It also keeps the body strong.\" Danielle said only to realize that she couldn't stop at Lucius.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanielle snaps herself out of her infatuation and finds fresh growing Brute Root by the pond. \"Looks like I found some!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good work lady dignitary. We might as well try to collect some gold. The next item that were looking for is a valuable piece of gold.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sound of wolves can be heard in the distance. Various grunts and whimpers can be heard as the guests slay the wolves. Lucius and co. are attacked by a wolf. Juno gracefully loads an arrow and pieces the canine in its chest. The wolf whimpers in pain as she collapses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like we have wolf meat. Did you see that Lucius darling? Can any other woman use a bow like me?\" Juno bragged as she tried to attract Lucius.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucius blushes and is unable to give an answer. More howls can be heard from nearby. A few wolf cubs approach their dead mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Poor things. We just killed their mother too. I don't think they're old enough to fend for themselves.\" Morgaine said as she picks up the frightened wolf cub.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJuno loads a few more arrows. Just when she was about to shoot she was stopped by Danielle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't kill them. They may help us win this game.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice observation. Wolves make very good hunting dogs. Lucius said as he started petting another frightened wolf cub.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This should work. I used my magic to make some leases for them.

I've heard legends that they kill men and women and abduct children.\" Juno said as she readied an arrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually Luck Dragons love kids. They're known to protect children regardless of species. It seems like this one is hunting for cattle.\" Lucius remarked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgaine is flooded with memories of her late husband.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Could this be the dragon who killed my once beloved Lancelot?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look! Here he comes!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the Luck Dragon descended it was clear he was no ordinary Luck Dragon. Standing over 100 feet tall and having scales that were blue and gold set him apart from his brethren.  A look of anticipation filled Lucius's eyes. He was going to claim the Luck Dragon as his own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't see a beautiful Luck Dragon like that everyday. I'm going to catch him and make him a loyal companion.\" Lucius said as he pulled out some rope.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Luck Dragon raises an eyebrow. \"Fat man say what? Do I look like I want to be captured?\" The Luck Dragon replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did that dragon just talk? How is that possible? None of the books I read ever mentioned this!\" Morgaine exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Luck Dragon rolls his eyes. \"You really didn't know we can speak your tongue? Then why should our kind speak to you anyway? You think we act on primal instincts. We're the most intelligent creatures to roam the skies.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sir Luck Dragon, how about we have a challenge. If I can tie you up before you fly away then you'll be my new partner. If you get away then you're free to go.\" Lucius said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why would I want to fly away. I came here to snag some cattle. Your kind has been over hunting the wildlife that many us had to migrate to new territories in other countries. How about you try defeating me before I knock the living daylights out of you.\" The Luck Dragon said as he swung his tail at Lucius.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucius readies his weapons. He dodges the Luck Dragon's tail. He begins readying his rope into a lasso. The Luck Dragon swipes his claws. Lucius uses his sword to ward off the attack. The Luck Dragon begins to ready a fireball. Lucius quickly uses his rope to lasso the dragon's mouth closed. The Luck Dragon begins to violently thrash. Lucius stands his ground and jumps onto the dragon's back. He then flicks the dragon on the ear. The Luck Dragon yelps as he ear gets hits by Lucius.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Give up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Luck Dragon groans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Luck Dragon refuses to budge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bro., Looks like this Luck Dragon is a sore loser.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's going to have to move if he wants something to eat. There's plenty of food at my brother's palace. Also his scales will help us win this scavenger hunt that Cassius setup. His scales are more valuable then some golden trinket.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanielle sighs as she observes Lucius undo the Luck Dragon's muzzle. Juno was impressed with Lucius's spectacular display of talent without getting nicked. Juno began plotting to seduce Lucius even more and mold him into her ideal husband. Morgaine was speechless and shocked that Lucius caught the creature whose species was responsible for Lancelot's death.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"State your name dragon. You must clearly have one since you speak our language.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The name is Golzure.

I thought the best way to add some more life to the party was through a challenge.

You must still be traumatized after tonight. I'll have to feed you something else. We can't have you being a cannibal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassius picks up Romulus and holds the wolf cub in his arms.

Lady Juno was watching from the crowd hoping to further seduce the prince to her advantage. Morgaine was also present for she had a bad feeling about Lucius being used as Lady Juno's personal boy toy. Unbeknownst to the two women was a third tall woman who was roughly in her late 30s or early 40s. She wore a cloak over her head but her beautiful blonde hair could easily be seen She was quite tall and busty and would attract any man for she looked fairly young for her age. Her expression was of sadness and grief which caused her to regret being so reckless in her youth. The woman pulled out a locket that had a picture of her and what resembled Prince Lucius in his younger days. The woman watched the the two royals put their all into outdoing each other. They then stop exhausted after a few hours of trying to out lift each other. The mysterious woman then sheds a tear guilty for ruining her own life. The woman remembers as a girl drinking poison to end her life. However it was only half successful. For a magician from Fantasmia had quickly revived her only to be exiled to her mother's native land of Sumotorio a kingdom founded over 100 years ago by a Fatlantian prince along with people from Fantasmia and Mountania in order to form a new nation for the prince's older sibling had right to the throne of Fatlantis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSumotorio being a mix of different cultures tends to focus on their national sport and discipline. Most of the residents are actually both buff and fat due to their extensive training. Once the woman arrived years ago to her mother's native country her aunt Queen Natilda scolded the young lass causing her to feel ashamed. Having chosen celibacy her aunt had no heirs until Danielle arrived. Danielle's Aunt Natilda forbade the girl for returning to the other kingdoms until she was ready to apologize to the man whose honor she smeared. This caused Danielle to miss out on her sisters weddings and even her father's funeral 10 years ago. Recently however she's been charged by her aunt to spread the national sport of Sumotorio before being able to be crowned heir. Lucius meanwhile is chatting with Morgaine and is apparently starting to fall for her and out of love with Juno. For Lucius remembered the last time he let a woman manipulate him the pain still fresh in his mind. Danielle also feeling the pain walked away with her men for she had to present herself to King Leviathan tonight to showcase the sport and then leave for Fantasmia the next morning. One of her men was a native Mountanian who had recently lost his memory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe poor man was one of the few to survive pursuing a Luck Dragon but at a terrible cost. After waking up from his serious wounds a Sumotorion healer found him. When the man awoke he had no memory except for the possibility of a slim chance of having a wife and a child whose names he couldn't remember. He was then nursed back to health and traveled with Danielle and her team to promote their sport. Danielle knowing that people might recognize her because of her name fears that she spark a cold reception with the royal family but she has no choice but to hope that no one recognizes her. She then walks to the guest quarters trying to hold back her tears so she can get ready for tonight's event. Later that night she presents her to the royal court noticing Lucius among the nobility with his younger brother, Lady Juno, and Morgaine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who's that woman? I don't recall seeing her around before.\" said Lady Juno in a scoffing tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Supposedly she's from a distant kingdom that was founded over 100 years ago. Appaently they want to introduce a new sport of some kind. I heard that it's a form of wrestling that originated from Fatlantis but modified when the nation of Sumotorio was founded.\" said Morgaine glaring at Lady Juno.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you people of Mountania. I am here on the behalf of my aunt, Queen  Natilda to present Sumotorion wrestling. Originally adapted from sumo wrestling from Fatlantis we are here to prove that it is more than two people body slamming each other. So I'll demonstrate the sport from one of your fellow Mountanians who has some experience. Yet I warn you the man knows not his name for he lost his memory in a terrible accident. Please give it up for our 1st volunteer.\" said Danielle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the volunteer appears she notes that he has a striking resemblance to her late husband but only with longer hair and a a full beard. She then realizes that the man is undoubtedly her husband and is shocked that he was alive. She then feels guilty for turning Prince Lucius on for she had believed her husband to have been dead. Yet she doubts that the man will remember her or his child. Lucius then recognizes the woman. Shocked that it was the same woman who attempted suicide many years ago felt guilty and believed that he had no choice but to make an honest woman out of her. He then rises from his seat to volunteer in hopes of making amends with his teenage sweetheart. Lady Juno noticing the turn of events starts to put two and two together and becomes jealous of the older woman. She then puts together a scheme to reveal to king Hercules that this was the woman that his son had made love with and who apparently tried to kill herself. After the demonstration half of the nobility are impressed while the other half scoffed. Danielle noticing the lukewarm reception heads off to her room trying to avoid looking Lucius in the eye, who was apparently love-struck yet again for the third time.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Later that night Danielle looks at the picture in her locket that was artistically crafted by a talented artist long ago. She then starts sobbing for throwing away the life she could of had. She regrets attempting suicide and wonders what her daughter or son could of been like if he or she was born. She then takes a stroll through the palace to help her forget her terrible past. She then heads to the royal kitchen to fetch herself a glass of water. Normally her aunt's subjects and any suitor would offer to get Danielle whatever she needed only for Danielle to turn them down for she felt that it be best that she do it herself for fear of her aunt catching her alone with a man that she wasn't going to marry and due to her experience with Lucius stating herself if she was meant to get married it would have to be with the very man that she violated for such were the laws of Sumotorion society which her aunt relentlessly ingrained over the years. Upon approaching the kitchen see heard the noise of someone making a sandwich.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tiptoes past Lucius who was eating a midnight snack to settle his stomach, head to the well just on the outer corridor in the royal garden which was just past the kitchen. She then prepares to fill up her canteen and takes a drink. She then prepares the canteens for her men so they can leave as early as possible. She then looks at the stars wondering why cruel fate had brought her back to her former flare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alas cruel fate has yet to scoff at me yet again. As much as I try to run away from my past it always haunts me like a stalking monster. If love is what fate has in store or not can there be a mere hint to ease the pain of my aching heart.\" said Danielle to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry my dear for I may have the answers to your problems.\" said Morgaine who was in the middle of trying to look into her own future to see what is in store.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you madam soothsayer for any answer will do to ease the burden that I carry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgaine then reads Danielle's palm noticing that unlike most women that it was firm and rough from years of exercise and doing chores.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see. Very interesting. It seems to me that during your journey you will find a lost love, however he will be faced to make a decision between you and two others. One of the women however will find a lost loved one that dissuades her from marrying the man. The other woman however will try anything to marry this man for her own personal gain. However, when you arrive in Fatlantis the man will finally chose a wife. The woman he chooses though is from his youth who was thought to dead. I also foresee that you and the man having several children and ruling in a land that is struggling to establish itself among the three kingdoms. Take heed my dear for the journey you are on will be full of strife for many challenges await you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you for clearing that up for me madam. What is your name so I may thank you properly?\" asked Danielle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am Morgaine the Soothsayer of Fantasmia.\" replied Morgaine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you. If you need a favor just let me know and I should repay you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The man who lost his memory. Allow me to help him regain it so he can return to his loved ones.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Consider it done. For you are probably the woman of which you speak who will find her lost loved one. Yet fate isn't set in stone until it occurs, but I will keep your words close if your vision holds true. Goodnight Madam Morgaine for I have I feeling that our paths will cross again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanielle heads back to the guest quarters and has a goodnight's rest.  She then wakes up the next morning and bids farewell to Mountania promising to return when her sport develops more of a favorable reputation. When she is about to leave she notices that Lucius , Achilles and Morgaine were getting ready to go to Fantasmia. She and her men then make arrangements to travel with the noble lord for the road between here and Fantasmia is full of bandits ready to loot any passerby. Despite learning how to use the sword during her exile into Sumotorio she thought it would be best if the two parties join for strength in numbers will deter most crooks. As they left Lady Juno and her men followed them waiting for a chance to whisk Lucius into her clutches. However it turn out that the young Prince Triton with a few guards had decided to take a stroll in the country side so he might add onto to his desire for strength and knowledge for he believed that to understand what it means to be a noble he must understand his countrymen and neighbors. He also looked up to his Uncle Lucius believing that he was the the type of man that he wanted to be kind, gentle, smart and strong.</span></div></div>",

The poor woman is definitely not the harlot that Malice, Ebony, and my mother has painted her to be. Unfortunately, my nephew, Augustus who never took advantage of a woman continues to make a pervert of himself with his warped fantasies of women taking advantage of men to add to them their harem as he calls it. That's why the man needs to grow up and take a wife. But with Lady Valeropetra trying to ensnare Lucius as her toy to later run off with another younger man has me worried. But I believe that Lucius and Danielle will make up for lost time and that Lady Valeropetra would indeed run off with Augustus. For her reaction to his picture was the only sign that proves my theory. But this isn't proper to talk about such things. Hey Achilles I've got word from Livia that you're expecting another child.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right how'd you know Alex?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I write to Livia all the time.

It's all about outsmarting your opponent or else you'll wind up like this!\" said Lucius as he dodges his nephew and pins him to the ground with another training sword.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dang! I'll have to remember that and also think more on my feet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right. For someone who barely used a sword before that's impressive that you were able to pick up so quickly. Yet your father and grandfather can never see that each different individual needs to train differently though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's true. I was only taught how to jab an unresponsive practice dummy which rarely works for someone who needs to learn the basic combat maneuvers. I can see why my brother Cassius talks highly about you for you know how to adapt methods to the given situation.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At least you two aren't the only ones that see me as a responsible role model.

She's concerned that if I don't that Gladius won't be the only one getting yelled at by father. Cool! Is that a Blue-billed parrot. I've never seen one before. Yet these guys originate from those barbaric Vladians. Either they're migratory or this might be a warning that something bad will happen soon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Squawk! Vladians.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Lucius! Want to learn more about Sumotorion wrestling?\" called Danielle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure why not. I was just finishing up Triton's swordplay lessons.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Triton, your Aunt Livia and your cousins are here.\" called Achilles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It seems like Lancelot finally  remembered his first name. Apparently Mordred told him that Arthur was his last name. It's ironic two first names with the other being the family name. So I guess that the Arthurs are glad to be reunited again. Hopefully Lance gets his full memory back though. Yet those burns that he had a few months ago healed nicely and are almost gone. According to our warrior mage Zantar the man was lucky to fall into that hole or else he would of been dead. Yet Zantar was impressed that he was skilled in magic and swordplay though when he found out the family lineage of the Arthurs. Who knew that they were of both Fantasmian and Mountanian blood.\" commented Danielle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right my lady. I thought warrior mages only came from Sumotorio, but I guess the Arthurs are a case of the latter.\" said Zantar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, yet he was barely conscious when Zantar found him and healed him. Yet without a memory Zantar thought it be best to take him to Sumotorio until he was ready to return. I'm sorrow that we couldn't find Mrs. Arthur sooner, but poor Lance had no memory when he woke up when leaving for Sumotorio though. I'm glad that I was able to help him though and teach him something about Sumotorion culture. Now they can return to Draken on the east Fantasmian-Mountanian border. Now Zantar can you explain the rules of Sumotorion wrestling to my friend?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As you wish my lady. Sumotorion Wrestling combines Fatlantean sumo with Mountanian free style. There are three methods to winning: girth, brawn, and brain. Each method is different but can be used. The other night you were using the brawn method of charging in while Lancelot was using the brain method of trying to outsmart you the other night. Great wrestlers specialize in one method, but the best use all three methods. This is important especially for Sumotorion royalty even though they have a preferred method or two. Also the sport allows both men and women. Lady Danielle for example uses both brain and brawn, but her toned bust is considered girth. Girth is not just body weight. It could be height or muscle tone while brawn which is similar is the techniques used and brain is the smoothness of the techniques employed and timing. But I believe it's better to show you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It looks like Lancelot's back from spending the day with his wife and daughter. Hey Sir Lancelot Arthur! Can you do us a favor us a favor and help Zantar demonstrate? said Danielle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem.\" said Lancelot who finally remembers his full name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLancelot and Zantar go over the different techniques and training methods.

Over the past few days he gained an extra 20 lbs. bring him to 870 lbs. with 750 lbs. of that just being his muscle mass. He also ase a fully developed double chin as well, even though Danielle might like this development his father would be furious even though some of the extra weight from the weight gain was also muscle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh come on!

Apparently my nephew Merlin was working on the Excailburs I was trying to create. Once I saw the swords it all came back to me.

Later Lucius.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLancelot then walks away and teleports to the throne room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucius then heads to the throne room and takes a seat on the waiting area part of the throne room next to Danielle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We are here to discuss trade negotiations between Mountainia and Fantasmia.

Yet the only thing I can say is pop the question to her as soon as you're ready for marriage.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you're saying that because I got Danielle on my mind I'm literally sleepwalking and sleep eating.

Yet once you are unable to continue the number of rounds completed will be recorded by Zantar who will oversee your progress through his crystal ball.

Lucius then goes on to clear several more of the challenges that range from archery, wrestling and to what if battle tactics. Lucius then reaches the 200th trial.

The man was clearly fatter than Lucius weighing 1200 lbs. slightly heavier than normal Fatlantean males who reach 1150 lbs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lucius! You're in for a real treat. Given of how many trials you've been through we'll this one the last on for today before we get some grub. I warn you though I'm quite hard to push out of the ring though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't get cocky Sir Morton. You're dealing with royalty and like any other member of my family I'm quite strong. I might not be king of Mountania not that I really care, but I'm just as strong as my younger bro. Levi if not stronger. I know one thing is for sure once me and Danielle get married than I might as well be a king.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Spoken like a true Sumotorion king. A man with such great strength and passion not caring if others hold importance over him. A man truly who serves his country and who is accountable for his actions. That my friend is what we'll look up to if you're king of Sumotorio someday.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucius and Sir Morton engage in Sumotorion wrestling.

Unfortunately both of them and my mother would like nothing to do with me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait a sec. That's it I remember. He used to be a servant when I was a kid.

A Vladian man was on its back. The dragon then make a smokescreen so the bandit could get away. That means that Rosa Flare's father originally owned the dragon. Apparently they were trying to kill the owner of the Luck Dragon to stop the destruction. That Luck Dragon! It's the same one we saw today and probably the one that snuck up on me. But I'm not trying to read my past. Let's see what other mysteries your past holds. Wait a moment a couple finding a baby in a basket after the village was destroyed. It looks like the luck dragon didn't want to hurt you but went against her master's wishes. As a young boy you went to Dragonheart academy due to your advanced skills. Your mentor and headmaster was Colonel Argon he was like a second father to you once your foster parents died from food poisoning. Other than that I can only see what you already told me. If we want to beat Rosa we'll have to beat her luck dragon. If we try going at her head on we'll surely be burned to a crisp. I must warn the others at once.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you sir Arthur for the info. Now I know who was responsible for my parents' deaths. It's a shame we got to kill the luck dragon. They can be good if they are caught. But if that luck dragon has any unhatched eggs I believe you guys should have the eggs. Especially if our friend gets any larger. They take at least 10 years to reach adulthood but they live for hundreds of years and grow throughout there lifespan. Or we can find another Luck Dragon. I believe there's a small colony up ahead in the Draken Caves. There's even rumors of a rare blue and silver Luck Dragon besides the normal gold and red coloration. It cropped up 20 years ago judging by it's age which means it's a young adult. Yet the cave that we go through will get us to Draken in half a day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I doubt the Arthue estate will still be there. I think I remember the whole town getting burnt to a crisp. If we can go through the cave and tame a Luck Dragon or two we should stand a chance. I also remember rumors that the whole population of Draken is nothing but Luck Dragons. If we convince one to join us then we should be able to get a few from the populace to join us. Then maybe I can rebuild Draken. Now that would be fun after the work's done. A whole city that can ride on Luck dragons. Good night Felix. See you in the morning partner.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Same to you kind sir.\"</span></div></div>",

Another reason was because Duke Octavius wasn't in town to sell his armor which meant that the Mountainian Summer Games would begin in two weeks. This made getting the Excailiburs back of high importance so the trade between Fantasmia and Mountania could be reached given that Fantasmia would want to pay a reasonable sovereign for the Douglas pine trees and also add another condition to the bargain. Lucius and co. were walking in the direction of Draken when a 16 year old girl bumped into Lucius.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you alright ma'am?\" said Lucius who was embarrassed that the young woman bumped into his large stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm fine.

Her name was Lady Ariel Crossheart a 15 year old with beautiful strawberry-blonde hair and emerald eyes. Standing at a height of 6'1\" inches she was tall for a girl her age but that was due to her family where everyone is almost as tall as the members of the royal family.

Hopefully Gladius learns from this and grows up for once. Yet Cassius definitely proved victorious over Lady Blackfire today.

It was founded by King Richard who was once a Prince of Fatlantis long ago who decided to find a new land to explore and indulge upon. So with a group from Fatlantis, Fantasmia, and Mountania the first king and people from all three nations settled their. The land of Sumotorio was rich with delacacies enough to help the first king grow in girth. As the years passed the royal bloodline finally mingled Mountanian blood meaning that the kings are not only extremely fat but toned as well. It was this mixing of the nations that the national sport of Sumotorion wrestling developed which was a mix of Fatlantean sumo wrestling, Mountainian free style and the rules developed by Fantasmian study. The current ruler of the nation is Queen Natilda Steel who took a vow of celibacy shortly after her late husband Samson died at the clutches of a luck dragon. Her only heir was her eldest niece Lady Danielle O'Boom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow as a girl Danielle had learned some swordplay and was once engaged to Lucius who was crown prince of Mountainia at the time. Yet it was that very past that she regretted most of all. She regretted the times that she went on those midnight strolls for they eventually led to trouble. She was only 17 at the time and Lucius 16 when she first ruined her life. Lucius was in the middle of taking a bath when she decided to jump in fully clothed. Lucius tried to stop her but she just wanted to let the sparks fly. So she caused him to violate himself by impregnating her. When she found out that she was with child she decided to end it all so she wouldn't have to face both Mountanian and Fatlantean officials so she decided to drink poison. It almost worked when a Fantasmian mage happened to show up right after she drank. The next day after she recovered her mother who was furious decided that since her daughter acted foolishly and didn't want to be part of the family that she decided to disown Danielle. Her middle siblings Malice and Ebony mocked her when they heard this. Her father was upset that he didn't come see his daughter before she left to go off to her Aunt Natilda.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer mother then spread word that Danielle was dead even though the unborn baby was the only person to die. This convinced all three kingdoms of her supposed death even though the O'Boom family left to visit Sumotorio almost yearly. Yet Alexandria being the youngest sister didn't hold Danielle's teenage years against her for she was too young to remember. So over the years Danielle under the strict supervision of her Aunt Natilda was not allowed to leave the country until she was ready to right her wrongs or said otherwise. When first exiled the only thing that Danielle could find solace in was chores. So over the years she became a workaholic which was her only vice other than that she was honored for her good character. Yet at age 39 she had rejected almost every suitor in Sumotorio. She currently resides In Terramount the capital of Sumotorio. Yet it was starting to become known to only a few people in the other kingdoms that she was alive but unfortunately her former flare still believed the story that was woven by the O'Booms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanielle was sitting in front of the fireplace drinking some tea while looking at her locket. She has a strong busty stature and stood at 9' tall being the shortest in her family. Her face had freckles and dazzling but sad blue eyes and long blond hair. She was enjoying her solitude until a servant came in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My dear lady come quickly for Zantar found an unconscious man from Mountainia.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well, I shall see to it at once.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Danielle arrived she was horrified beyond belief. The man was semiconscious but he had terrible burns and scratches which would fortunately heal with the advanced medicine and magic of Sumotorio.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who is this man?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know my lady for when I found him in that hole in on Mount Volosion on the Triple border. He had no memory at all except that he was attacked by a Luck Dragon and that he had a wife and child whose names he doesn't remember. He was seen carrying a Douglas Pine wand and a dagger. By the looks of it he's of both Mountanian and Fantasmian blood. His scratches should heal in a few days but the burns will heal just like new in a few months as long as he uses this powerful medicine I made mixed of the most potent magical ingredients from our land and what I found at the Triple border.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you Zantar. Well let him recover until he's well enough then we'll find his loved ones for I believe that if we return him to his native country.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanielle now pondered if this could be a sign that it was time to let go of the past and make things right. She had heard from his sister that Lucius had out on a lot of weight but kept up with his training and that he was just as lonely as Danielle. But if Danielle was going to the three kingdoms it would be to help this amnesiac and to spread her sport for maybe that can justify her past. If she happened to find love with Lucius again after so long than it shall be. The next day...</span></div></div>",

It had been two years since King Levithan ascended to the throne. The king's eldest son was getting ready for marriage, the Lord of Laceton married into a foreign royal family and had to find a successor. As it turns out the former Lord of Laceton can't rule a kingdom and be an ambassador to Fatlantis. This is where Mercury Slade came in. She had to escort a 13 year old Triton to Fatlantis. Despite his age Triton had got done his schooling five years early. He used his free time to read books and to workout. Triton is no longer as frail as he was two years ago. Stronger than his eldest brother when he was his age the teenager wanted to study as much as possible while conditioning his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't take long for the nations of Fatlantis and Mountania to make an agreement with Sumotorio on how to handle the whole marriage arrangement. So Mercury was eventually hired to escort the young lord to his new place of residence. The only reason why the royal family hired her was due to an increase in Vladdian pirates and bandits and Triton's occasional clumsiness. Mercury sighed as she waited for her client to say his farewells. Triton then eagerly runs to meet his escort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ready kid? I don't have all day. Just do your best to stay alive. I can't afford for you to die on me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't have to worry about me. I can easily maneuver my way out of a situation.\" Triton said with confidence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, now stop wasting my time and move.\" Mercury says in a cold manner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTriton nods before walking forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>How did I get stuck with babysitting this prince? Oh well, at least the pay is good. Lately jobs have been scarce.</i> Mercury thought.</span></div></div>",
