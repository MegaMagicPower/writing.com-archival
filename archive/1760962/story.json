            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Ever since I was born I was different from everyone else in my pack. A regular Growlithe is born they are born with orange coat with black lines across our backs and feet. We also have a cream color fur on our under belly, top of our heads and on our tails. I have two out of three. I have black strips on my body like the others, I have the creamy color on my body just like everyone else but I have one true difference. I don\u2019t have orange fur all over, I have yellow fur. I was able to tell by the differences between me and everyone else in the pack. See us Growlithes and Arcanines stay in packs. Not very large packs but about ten to fifteen other members. As being one of the few females in the pack I don\u2019t get made fun of a lot but I still get insulted here and there. An Arcanine is a Growlithe that I much large, (Growlithes are 2 ft. 4 in, Arcanines are 6 ft. 3 in.) They have the cream color fur all over their face and are better built. In our pack there are the four Arcanines, my dad, leader, track, and the female alpha. Then us Growlithes there is the eight males, Joy, Roy, Leo, Mark, Kyle, James, Will, and Patrick. Then there is us four girls, me, (Rosa), Lisa, Mary, and the spoiled brat Jasmine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe travel over Kanto and some parts of Johto. When we travel we run into other packs of different Pok\u00e9mon and other Growlithes and Arcanines. We share stories with them, have little brawls here and there, or just walk by because we don\u2019t like one or another. No a lot truly happens when travel. Once and awhile we\u2019ll run into a trainer who will catch a Growlithe, because some of them try to challenge an Arcanine and most fail. Some win but that\u2019s when they have nothing but six water types all at once. I\u2019ve seen some of my brothers and a sister be caught but never me and my dad. I know my mom was taken before I could remember, dad told me. Partly because I hide behind my dad, the pack\u2019s hunter, and I\u2019m never seen by them. When they do catch one of us they either leave or try again to catch more of us. When they try to catch more of us we us flamethrower at the person and they always run away. When they catch one and walk away we just let them. It\u2019s all really about honor as a Pok\u00e9mon. They fight us and win so we let them take the loser with no problem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I grew up from being a puppy to a matured dog I knew I was going to be I had lot of hard ships on me. I had to learn how to hunt, fight and survive if I ever got lost from the pack. I also had to learn how to take care of others when they get hurt in fights or on hunting trips, (learning what plants to rub on their wounds.)When I have time to relax is when I\u2019m usually insulted by other Growlithes, usually by the other three girls in the pack. They just make fun of me because of my fur being yellow instead of orange. My dad says \u201cStick and stones can break bones but words shall never hurt me.\u201d What I take from that is just ignore them and they\u2019ll leave sooner or later and it works.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen we travel return to Kanto we found a couple of strange rock. At first we, Growthlithes, didn\u2019t know what they were until one of the males licked on and evolved right in front of everyone. That\u2019s when we knew they were firs stones. (Stones that grow from being super heated in a volcano and take on a fire like color to them. When a Growlithe, or any other Pok\u00e9mon, us it they lose their color and turn into regular rocks.) The seven other males even changing at them trying to evolve but the four adults stopped them and told them \u201cThe first thing we do is evolve some of the girls and then some of the guys.\u201d They looked at the four left and said, \u201cTwo males and two girls shall evolve and become the new Arcanines of the pack.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the boys and girls ran towards the rocks as I just sat back and watch them choose Leo and Mark, the fastest and strongest of the boys, and Lisa and Mary, the best female fighters there are. That night a party was thrown for the new Arcanines as us Growlithes are sent back into the den to rest. Everyone was so ecstatic and hoping they could find a firestone and evolve as well. I didn\u2019t care because my dad told me that when/if I evolve I turn into an Arcanine with yellow fur. I like to stay as a Growlithe with yellow fur because I think I look better like this.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The next morning we continued on to our den in Kanto. We have to go throw a jungle before we are there. As we journey have way throw the jungle a trainer comes up right behind us. He then throws out a ball that released a Maril. The Maril stood about a foot tall and yelled out \u201cFinally fresh air. Boy you have no idea how stuffy it is in there.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy looked at his Maril and then said \u201cYou ready?\u201d He then looked at us trying to find the one he wanted to fight, maybe even catch. He looked through the whole pack and saw me. The boy looked about twelvish, having the lower have of his body in a dark blue color different from the rest of him, (a pair of dark navy blue jeans.) His feet were white and had some strange features that I never took notice till now, (white sneakers.) As for his chest, it was white with nothing to special about it, (a plain white t-shirt.) He had something on his head that cover his eyes from the sun it was blue, (a blue hat.) As for his face he had blue eyes that looked like the sky, he had black hair, if not very dark brown, that went only to his ears, a nose that wasn\u2019t too large or small for the rest of his face. His ears were nice size compared to his head. Head also had a smile on him as if he was playing some game of tag with his friends. He didn\u2019t look dangerous so I let my guard off a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he looked at me he yelled, \u201cMaril use WATER GUN on the shiny Growlithe.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRight away sir,\u201d the Maril said before he shot at me with his water gun. I jumped out of the way and ran at him using TACKLE on the Maril. (Everything in capital is the moves that the Pok\u00e9mon use for thoses that don\u2019t know what they are.) I hit him dead in his gut sending him flying right back at the boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Maril flipped right back to a fighting stance and aid, \u201cYour good, but I\u2019m better.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI doubt that!\u201d I yelled back as I used FLAMETHROWER. The flames were as large as an Arcanine.<br>\r\n\u201cMaril dodge it and use WATER GUN again!\u201d the boy yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u201dAlready on that,\u2019 the Mail said as he ran to the left and shot at me again. I was about to jump out of the way when I saw the flames were heading right at the little boy. I didn\u2019t even think as I ran towards him, dodging the WATER GUN, and pushed him out of the way of my attack. (Growlithes are very fast when they force themselves to be.) As I pushed him out of the way I was now hit with my own attack. Because I\u2019m a fire type the damage doesn\u2019t hurt as much as it should but because I made it so powerful I still had a hard time getting up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy looked at me shocked that I did that his eye widen, hi mouth was open and all. His eyes popped out even further when he saw me get up and try to shack it off. He looked at his aril and said, \u201cMaril that\u2019s enough.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh she can still fight\u2026. Can you?\u201d he asked me a little concern in his voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI try to walk but I feel my legs strain from me even trying to. I collapsed where I stood and I look up at the boy and his Maril. I have lost and he now had the rights to do whatever he pleased with me. He then grabs a ball from his belt and said, \u201cMaril return.\u201d The Mari then turned into a red light that flowed right back into the ball. The boy then walks over to me and picks me up. I look at him as he looks back at my pack, \u201cIs it okay if I keep her as my own?\u201d he asked the pack. I was shocked to say at least. This kid has now told a Pokemon to fight me, for me to almost hurt, if not kill him, and for me to take that blow for him, and he asked her pack\u2026 my DAD if he could keep me?!?!? I looked back at pack and see my dad look at me and shack his head yes. I was now dumbfounded. The Arcanine that has raised me and has kept me safe was now telling this strange being to keep me?!?!? I now started to feel the strain of releasing such a strong FLAME THROWER and I start to black out.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As I awoke I found myself in a very strange room. It was whitish pink on the walls and had a yellow floor that was cut up into tiny squares, (tiles) I saw a window to my left and also saw the boy who beat me was right there asleep in a strange log next to me (chair.)I yawned a little and got up to see what I was sleeping in. I was large and square like but it was soft. I saw that there was something on top of my lower half, (she is on a bed and under a blanket.) I crawled under it to see if there was anything else in the thing on me. There was nothing under there but the strange thing kept falling on me when I pushed it up. I turned to my back and started to kick it and I was starting to have some fun. It lasted for a moment or two. That when I realized that I was completely healed and not a single part of me hurt. I was so happy but confused. Nothing that grew in any of the places I wondered through ever had anything that healed in one day. That\u2019s when I started to wonder how long I was asleep? That\u2019s when I remembered that I\u2019ll never see my dad again. The others I really don\u2019t like but I did care about my dad. That\u2019s when I started to whimper about the whole situation I was in.<br>\r\n\u201cYou okay girl?\u201d said a voice from the other side of the thing I was under. That\u2019s when I saw the thing I was under be removed and the boy was there looking down at me. He had a smile on him that was warm and made me feel al little better about the situation I was in. I nodded to his answer remembering that humans don\u2019t know how to speck Pok\u00e9mon. Another person walked into the room. She had pink hair, had a very beautiful face that couldn\u2019t be forgotten, (Nurse Joy.) She had blue eyes blue sea blue eyes and a very warm smile. As she entered the she had a Chansey right behind her.<br>\r\n\u201cWell it\u2019s good to see that your Growlithe has woken up. She had some pretty burn marks on her,\u201d the woman said, (from here on out I\u2019m going to call them by their names.)<br>\r\n\u201cMy name is Bell.\u201d The Chansey said. \u201cHow did you get so burnt?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI used my flamethrower,\u201d (Lower case when they take about the move.) \u201cand his Maril jumped out of the way making it aim right at the kid and I just jumped in front of it.\u201d I was at this time I was noticing the humans were having a conversation themselves but I didn\u2019t care since I was in the middle of one myself.<br>\r\n\u201cSo what were you thinking when you jumped in front of it?\u201d Belle asked as she put a wet cloth on a burn mark.<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s the thing though I didn\u2019t think I was the flamethrower coming at him and then I just ran in front of it. There was no thought in it.\u201d I said with my head down. \u201cMy name\u2019s Rosa by the way.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cDid the kid name you that or is that your birth name?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cMy birth name.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cDo you want to keep it?\u201d<br>\r\nI knew that the kid would have named me anything he wanted but I just wanted to keep this name so that no matter what I would always remember my dad. So I said, \u201cYes I want to keep my name. But how? Humans don\u2019t understand us.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cDo you know that physic types can talk to their trainer using telepath? I can get one in here and make it so you two can have a little talk.\u201d<br>\r\nI look up at the kid to find he is looking down at me smiling. He then put his hand down on my head and started to pet me. \u201cYes I would.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cOkay I\u2019ll be back in a moment,\u201d and Belle looked up at Nurse Joy and pointed to the clip board she was holding. Nurse Joy looked at it and shook her head yes.<br>\r\n\u201cOh she wants to have a talk with him. Okay let me see if I can get James in here.\u201d They both now walked out of the room leaving me and him alone again.<br>\r\n\u201cWho is James?\u201d the kid asked.<br>\r\nI shrugged my shoulders letting him know I have no idea either.<br>\r\n\u201cWell I guess I should introduce myself to my first Pok\u00e9mon, I\u2019m Tom.\u201d<br>\r\nI looked at him confused and saw his bell that had the strange balls on them, (Pokeballs.)<br>\r\n\u201cOh you\u2019re wondering about the Maril. Well he was my dad\u2019s Pok\u00e9mon and he let me borrow his Pok\u00e9mon so I could catch my first.\u201d Tom said with a smile.<br>\r\nI smiled and walked up into his lap and laid there showing him I trusted him.<br>\r\n\u201cNow you need a name. Hmmm how about\u2026\u201d Tom said.<br>\r\n\u201cNo I have a name.\u201d I said although he didn\u2019t understand me.<br>\r\n\u201cYou don\u2019t want a name?\u201d<br>\r\nI shook my head and saw that Belle and Nurse Joy have come back with an Abra.<br>\r\n\u201cSorry it took so long.\u201d Nurse Joy said.<br>\r\nTom said, \u201cIt\u2019s okay but what\u2019s with the Abra?\u201d<br>\r\n<b>Well I\u2019m James and I was told that your Growlithe wanted to talk with you.</b><br>\r\nMe and Tom were shocked this Abra just told us both what he was doing here and we both understood him. Tom yelled, \u201cThat\u2019s so cool. Where can I catch an Abra?!?!\u201d<br>\r\n<b>Well we\u2019re hard to catch since we\u2019re very shy and teleport way from anyone we come in contact with. Anyway I\u2019m here so both you and your Growlithe can talk.</b><br>\r\n\u201cWait does everyone get this treatment?\u201d Tom asked.<br>\r\n\u201cWell no not really. Unless the Pok\u00e9mon wishes to talk with their train we don\u2019t really do this.\u201d Nurse Joy informed us.<br>\r\n\u201cYou wanted to talk with me?\u201d Tom asked me.<br>\r\n\u201cYes I would.\u201d I said. Then James did something strange. He grabbed me by the throat and made me float in mid air. Then I felt my throat catch on fire and then I feel right back on the bed. I looked right at James ready to kill him when I saw he fell to the ground and started to pant.<br>\r\n\u201cWhy did you do that?!?!\u201d I yelled at the James.<br>\r\nTom gasped as he heard me and I was far too angry to realize that I now spoke human, (English.)<br>\r\n<b>I\u2026\u2026  made it\u2026\u2026.. so that when\u2026\u2026 you talk you\u2026\u2026 spoke English.</b><br>\r\nI was about to look at Tom when he grabbed me and hugged me. \u201cOh thank you James. Thank you.\u201d Tom said. He then looked under the chair and pulled out a bag, after putting me down on the bed again. He then pulled out an Oran berry, (A berry that heals a Pok\u00e9mon that eats It.) and hand it to the James. James ate it and stood right back up and bowed in thanks for the berry.<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019ll leave you two alone so you can talk for a bit.\u201d Nurse Joy informed us.<br>\r\nI looked at James and Belle and said, \u201cThank you.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t thank me thank James he\u2019s the one that did it.\u201d Belle informed me.<br>\r\n<b>No thanks are needed. I like to help when I\u2019m needed.</b> And with that they walked out.<br>\r\n\u201cSo now back to your name.\u201d Tom said.<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s Rosa I would like to keep it so I can remember my past.\u201d I said a little surprised to hear my \u2018new\u2019 voice. It was feminine and a little childish as if I wasn\u2019t a pup anymore but I still had some room to grow.<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s a nice name.\u201d Tom said as he petted my head. \u201cIs there anything else I should know before we leave?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cThat I don\u2019t want to evolve into an Arcanine. I don\u2019t like the idea just yet. I also\u2026. Like being scratched behind the ears.\u201d I say with a faint blush. HE then scratches there and I was enjoying myself. It felt so nice that I ran up his lap and jumped on to his shoulder.<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d Tom asked me.<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m just trying to find your favorite place to be scratched.\u201d I answer him scratching his back with my paws. I was careful not to scratch him with my claws but for him to feel my paws on his back.<br>\r\n\u201cA little to the left.\u201d He instructed me and I reply. He gave a nice long sign before picking me up. \u201cOkay well since I didn\u2019t catch you in a pokeball I might as well get it over with.\u201d He raised a pokeball in the air in front of me.<br>\r\nI had one thing to ask him before he did truly catch me. \u201cCan I not stay in the pokeball?\u201d<br>\r\nHe tossed it softly over my head and said \u201cSure,\u201d and with that I felt my body start to feel strange. It started to feel like my legs very weak and my body was turning into a ditto, (Basically she felt like jell-o.) Then I felt it all start to flow into the pokeball over me and start to fill it in. I closed my eyes not sure what it be like in that tiny thing, (Pokeball is about 5 inches all around, not too big.) I open my eyes when I fell myself stop flowing and I was it was much roomier then I imagined it would be. Some room to move my legs and curl up to sleep in. Then I felt the whole thing shack side to side for a couple times before I heard a ding.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

One that didn\u2019t have me working everyday for my life but maybe once and a while. No one makes fun of me because of my rarity. If anything I get to make more friends because of the newest one I have just made. Maybe Tom catching wasn\u2019t such a bad thing after all.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

(Her pack has traveled near them enough to know what they are but not what\u2019s in them.) I seemed to be such a weird place. There were people walking along not even paying attention to each other. There were some kids playing with their Pok\u00e9mon. A young girl, about five years old, was playing tag with her Bulbasaur, while a boy, about fifteen, was having a fight with his Hitmonchan in the middle of town. Was Tom was walking along  the sidewalk and the boy with his Hitmonchan saw us, \u201cHey where do you think you\u2019re going, kid?\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cHome to tell my parents I\u2019m starting my journey today. I already caught a Growlithe using my dad\u2019s Maril.\u201d Tom said raising me up into the other boy\u2019s face. I had a better look at him and saw that there was nothing about him that seemed nice. He looked like just the average angry man would be. His face was as if it was sculpted out of stone but instead of being warm feeling it gave me a chill. I guess it\u2019s a bad omen. He was incredibly fit for his age compared to others I\u2019ve seen. He had blue eyes that looked like the sea but during a storm. In general he creeped me out.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cHow about a Pok\u00e9mon battle my Hitmonchan versus your Growlithe?\u201d the boy said with a small snicker.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cSure, do you mind Rosa?\u201d Tom asked me. I wasn\u2019t sure what the other boy wanted from this fight but hey I may as well get Tom his first true win with her. Instead of talking I shook my head up and down showing I was ready.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cAlright now you know the true rules of a Pok\u00e9mon battle kid? The one where if you lost you have to give the losing Pok\u00e9mon to your opponent.\u201d He said with a snicker wide across his face.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Me nor Tom could believe this he tricked us and made us bet me versus and the Hitmonchan to see who would win. Tom was in shock and didn\u2019t believe what he heard. \u201cNo I won\u2019t bet Rosa I\u2026.\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cToo bad you agreed and if you forfeit I still get her. One way or another she\u2019s mine.\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<b>\u201cDon\u2019t worry I hate Chad\u2019s guts I won\u2019t let him win,\u201d</b> said the Hitmonchan.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I shook my head showing I understood and was also ready to fight. \u201cLooks like your Pok\u00e9mon is more than ready to be mine.\u201d Chad said in a cold voice.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cAre you sure about this Rosa?\u2019 Tom asked me. I shook my head showing I was more than ready. \u201cAlright then.\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cReady?\u201d Chad said.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cReady.\u201d Tom said with a little doubt in his voice.<br>\r\n<b>\u201cI may let you win but don\u2019t think I\u2019ll go out without a fight.\u201d </b>Hitmonchan said with a smile. I smiled back at him. I\u2019m not sure how to turn off my Pok\u00e9mon to human translation James gave me.<br>\r\n\u201cHitmonchan use FOUCUSE PUNCH.\u201d Chad said. Hitmonchan ran at me with his right fist glowing and ready to strike me.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cRosa dogde and use FLAMETHROWER.\u201d I jumpedto his left making it so he had to turn more if he wanted to hit me and I unleashed the strongest FLAMETHROWER I\u2019ve done in my life. Hitmonchan was put out on Chad\u2019s word of \u2018Go\u2019. I looked at him thinking he was faking. I took a step close to check and he was out. I looked back at Chad and he was speechless. His face said it all. He was angry that Hitmonchan lost but then he let out a big sighed.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cLooks like this pathetic runt is all yours kid.\u201d Chad said tossing Tom Hitmonchan\u2019s poke ball to him. The kid walked away as if nothing happened. If we meet him again I would love to hit him across his face with a good solid kick. I turned to Tom and he smiled at me. He returned Hitmonchan back to his poke ball and picked me up again.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cLooks like we have a new member to the team.\u201d Tom said as he put Hitmonchan\u2019s ball on his belt. The belt looked like it had a falcon claw on it that grabbed the ball and held it there. First time I saw what a trainer\u2019s belt looked like. It was weird but nice to know about it.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI know but was it me or did Chad give you the creeps too?\u201d I asked.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI know he always give me chills just looking at him. If we run into him again it would be too soon.\u201d And with that we walked to Tom\u2019s house. It was nothing special from any other house other then the fact he lived in it. A one story tall, white paint, just a plain house that you don\u2019t think too much about. As Tom walked in we heard two people talking, probably Tom\u2019s parents. He can\u2019t hear them but I could.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cLook I think he\u2019s a little too young to become a Pok\u00e9mon trainer.\u201d said a feminine voice probably his mom.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cWell he needs to go out and explore a little don\u2019t you remember when we did that? In fact isn\u2019t that how we came to be a couple?\u201d said a deeper voice sounding male. Most likely his dad.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0As I was listening I then heard Tom yell, \u201cMom, Dad I\u2019m home and I have some good news!!\u201d Tom was so happy he could hardly contain himself. It was far too easy to read on his face.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cWhat is it dear?\u201d Tom\u2019s mom asked as she walked into the room we were in.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI caught my first Pok\u00e9mon using dad\u2019s!\u201d Tom said with a big smile on his face as he put me on the ground.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYou did! Wait how did you get my Pok\u00e9mon?\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI\u2026uh found them in a drawer and I asked dad if I could play with his Pok\u00e9mon. He said okay so I took Maril and went into the woods. Then\u2026.\u201d Tom said looking at the ground.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYou stole my Pok\u00e9mon?!?! Why would you do that?!\u201d Tom\u2019s dad yelled.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cSo I could show I\u2019m ready to become a trainer!\u201d Tom said still trying to stand tall even though he was doing a bad job. The parents exchanged glances and then looked at Tom again.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cWhat have we told you? You can\u2019t take our Pok\u00e9mon without permission. You know that.\u201d Tom\u2019s mom said. I didn\u2019t want Tom to think he was alone so I walked over to him sat on his foot so he know I stood right next to him. I looked at Tom\u2019s parents and they smiled seeing what I\u2019ve done. \u201cWe\u2019ll talk about your punishment later. Right now I think it would e best if me and your dad had a talk.\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cBut mom you know Chad?\u201d Tom asked.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cThe kid that bully\u2019s everyone?\u201d Tom\u2019s dad asked.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYes me and Rosa,\u201d he said and pointed at me to let his parents know that was my name,\u201d won against his Hitmonchan and he gave him to us. Look.\u201d Tom then took the ball Hitmonchan was in and threw it into the air. He popped up right next to Tom and stood just a tall as Tom too.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<b>\u201c*Yawn* that was a good nap.\u201d </b>Hitmonchan said stretching a bit.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYou did?\u201d they both asked.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYes we did.\u201d I said with a smile. I then saw that not just Tom\u2019s parents looked at me funny but so did the Hitmonchan.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cShe can talk?!\u201d Tom\u2019s mom asked.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYes long story short we were at the Pok\u00e9mon center and an Abra gave me the power to talk English.\u201d I said with a smile.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cWe are so going to have a talk about this later.\u201d Tom\u2019s mom said. \u201cRight now though is that I want the three of you to go into your room and relax. It\u2019s been a big day and it\u2019s about six o clock. I\u2019ll have dinner made and that\u2019s when we talk about this. Okay?\u201d</span></div></div>",

As we walked in this room I took notice that there was a bed in the corner of the room with a strange box next to it. (T.V.) The ground had some weird feeling to it. It was blue but felt like soft grass. (Carpet.) There was a window on the wall and the walls were sky blue. (The average kids room only without the mess of toys.) The three of us sat on Tom\u2019s bed and then sighed. It felt good to sit down and think about what had happened today. As I was about to think about today\u2019s adventures my thoughts were interrupted by Hitmonchan.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<b>\u201cSo you can speak English?\u201d</b><br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYes why?\u201d I asked. Tom was sitting to my left and Hitmonchan to my right. He was watching us talk. I know he doesn\u2019t understand what Hitmonchan was talking about so if asked I\u2019m sure I would be the translator for him.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201c<b>Can you tell the kid my name\u2019s Roy for me?\u201d</b> Roy said with a sound of hope in his voice.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cSure anything else?\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<b>\u201cNothing else except thanks for getting me away from Chad.\u201d</b><br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I looked at Tom knowing he wanted in. \u201cRoy,\u201d I said having a paw point to the Hitmonchan, \u201cSaid thanks for getting him away from Chad.\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Tom looked at Roy and smile. \u201cNo problem.\u201d He raised his fist to Roy and Roy flinched. \u201cIt\u2019s a fist pound. You take your fist and hit mine.\u201d Bad move on Tom\u2019s part because Roy hit the fist a little too hard and shook his hand in pain. \u201cGood, not so hard next time alright?\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<b>\u201cSorry\u201d</b> Roy said putting his head down.

From past memories I guess. \u201cDon\u2019t worry I\u2019ll never do that to you guys at all.

I was a large room that had a huge table in the middle of it. The table had a turkey on it with all other things I could imagine. I\u2019ve never seen or smelled so good food so close before. I took a glance next to the table and saw a couple of bowls filled with poke blocks. (Food for Pok\u00e9mon.) I knew that the food was meant for the human\u2019s but I couldn\u2019t stop thinking how good it would taste.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cOkay well before anything happens I would like to know Rosa what do you and Roy want?\u201d Tom asked us.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<b>\u201cI\u2019m good with the poke blocks.

The fact you feed him is another one.\u201d I said noticing Tom\u2019s frown at the fact that Chad didn\u2019t care about his Pok\u00e9mon. It\u2019s is truly a saddening thought for most but there are those people in the world and it\u2019s just that way sometimes.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cSo what do you want to eat?\u201d Tom asked me. I was in a war be a good Pok\u00e9mon and eat the poke blocks or ask for some human food. I bit my lip and thought for a bit.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I sighed and said, \u201cI\u2019ll have the poke blocks.\u201d Tom looked at me confused but didn\u2019t say anything. As I walked over to the poke blocks I noticed that there were bowls full of different ones. Some bowls had red, blue, yellow, orange, and purple poke blocks. As I walked over I saw the same Maril I fought before with a Ditto, Raichu, and a Charizard. They all walked over to the bowls and all sat down. Roy and I walked over closer to the bowls and sat down as well.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<b>\u201cSo little Tomas caught you guys?\u201d </b>the Ditto asked.

It just matters on how appropriate it is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRules:<br>\r\n1: You can start the story anyway you want. (You were born a Shiny Pokemon, turned into on, anything you want can happen.)<br>\r\n2: I'll let there be sex but keep it controlled. NO OVER DOING IT!!<br>\r\n3: Please watch grammar I'm not too picky but I think we don't need text talk.<br>\r\n4: Try and keep everyone's names right. If you need to write the names do before hand it's okay.<br>\r\n5: CAN\"T KILL THE MAIN CHARACTER!!!<br>\r\n6: Have fun!!<br>\r\n7: Because of so many pokemon I will only let starters, and the first pokemon generation. (First start of pokemon before Johto)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSorry about there being 50 chapters and only 10 chapters that you can read but there are too many pokemon.</td>",
