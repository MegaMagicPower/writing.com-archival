            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The day started simply enough for you, Liam Finn. You roll out of bed at about ten in the morning, do a fairly shoddy job brushing your teeth, and do the few chores your parents set aside for you before becoming one with the couch and zoning out to TV the rest of the day. But something was new today that you hadn't seen before.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the list, Mom stated to \"Clear out the attic space so the vent guys can get up there later this week\".  This was a change due to the fact that you had forgotten your house even had an attic space.  After pulling out the ladder in the empty garage, you, somewhat excitedly, peered into the darkness that was the garage attic... only for it to be rather underwhelming. Two old cardboard boxes. You sighed and pulled both boxes down, one heavy, one light, both unlabeled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou put the ladder away and breathed in deep, letting the crispy autumn air come through the open garage door.  It was tempting to just push the boxes aside and let nature (or your Ma) sort 'em out, but your curiosity got the better of you.  You opened the heavy one first.  Strange looking oddities. Roman strapped sandals, ornate discuses, and the top of an antique trident. No clue who those belonged to.  The second box only had a single vase in it, made out of colorful marbled stone, covered in dust.  It was honestly a beautiful piece, even though you weren't any type of an art critic. You pulled the vase out, and rubbed some of the caked dust off of it.  Arabic symbols covered the side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Ah,\"</i> A voice whispered in the back of your mind. <i>\"You'll do.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt a bizarre fuzzy feeling... then you saw it. The vase was belching colorful red smoke. You attempted to put it down but hands wouldn't drop it. The smoke encircled you, engulfing you entirely, until... you were somewhere else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">*****<br>\r\n</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe room you were in was brightly lit, and covered in beautiful ornate rugs and massive pillows, with a single round bed on the opposite side. It smelled like lilacs and spices, and light poured out of brightly colored windows. Above you, you could see a dark hole where the ceiling should be. You were... confused, to say the least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello?\" You called, as your voice seemed to get eaten by the rugs hanging from the walls. \"Where am I? Mom?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Hello sweet mud-child,\"</i> the same voice from your head called, except it was now spread in this room like there was mounted speakers. The voice was soft, being neither male or female, and had a calming presence regardless of the alarming situation. <i>\"You are most welcome with my capsule. I have been called and shall be known as Cal, the Spirit of the Capsule. I reside within the vessel. You mud-name is Liam Finn, is it not? I have heard your name reverberate among these walls. You seek a greater purpose than what you have been bestowed by Manat and the spirits of fate.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...\" You respond, feeling quite small and not knowing which direction to talk.  \"You... know me? I gotta admit I'm a bit at a disadvantage. You're name is Cal?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Yes, child of the mud,\"</i> Cal responded mysteriously. <i>\"I am an old vessel of the many nights.  I was created by viziers or old to house spirits... much older than they.  Their powers yet reside within this place, the bodies they used to wield, fire, air, water and earth all have lived within, captured by the men of the mud to serve their callings.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm afraid I don't get it, Cal,\" You respond nervously.  \"What is this, where am I?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Ah, yes, I am forgetful,\"</i> Cal tutted at itself. <i>\"You are within the vessel. It is... the urn you held but a moment ago, known in the tongue of your ancestors as the Urn of Remembrance, though this is not its first or true name. It used to hold the djinn of your plane before they retreated to the baser elements.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait.... djinn...\" You took a moment to consider. \"Like a genie?  With the 3 wishes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"No, mud-child, djinn, not a 'gee-knee',\" </i>Cal corrected.<i> \"And you have heard some variation of the tales or old, of the nights long forgotten and re-remembered incorrectly? Yes, there are wishes. Yes, there are generally three.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait... are you a djinn?\" You mutter in amazement. \"Do... do I get 3 wishes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCal let out a short, sharp laugh. <i>\"Haha, no dear mud-child. I am but a created spirit for the housing. Neither ifrit or dao, I cannot conjure the wishes you desire.  This is why I have brought you.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blinked.  \"I don't understand.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"You shall quickly,\"</i> Cal said politely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll at once a short gust of air knocked you off your feet and began to levitate you about a foot off the ground. The rugs and curtains shook with unearthly wind. It was not loud, but it could be felt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"You are to receive power overwhelming, as I bestow on you the aspect of a spirit who came before, a djinn of immense power over reality named Zham. It will not be a painless process. But it will be one to remember. Then, you can continue the tradition of the earthen spirits, and grant the wishes of the mortals who seek your counsel.\"</i> Cal stated plainly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But...\" You attempted to respond.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It... has been decided,\" Cal said without anger or remorse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStones began to fly around you, revealing themselves as part of the wind. The encircled you so much so that you could barely see through them.  Then, they became part of you. Encasing you like a cocoon before sinking into your skin.  This did not hurt. But suddenly you felt invigorated. Your eyes opening wide as if you'd just taken a shot of pure adrenaline. You felt like you could stop a train with your bare hands.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the pain started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt felt like your heart stopped.  The wind tore your clothes to ribbons and cut at your skin, but the worse paid came from inside.  Your body was changing, and changing rapidly. You hands felt the shift in your abdomen like it was happening in real time.  Your belly, soft from the lack of exercise, became hard and firm. You felt each of the ab muscles in sudden shock. Then your arms bulged and spasmed, you lost control of them as they too grew in size to a firm body builders physique. But the nearby mirror, revealing your nakedness, showed your shoulders did not compensate for this change.  The rest of the change began, your chest and groin burned with a terrible sensation, and you watched as... your penis seemed to recede into yourself. You eyes budged in horror as you reached for it, but it was no longer there, replaced by... the opposite.  A labia sat where old junk once did.  Your hips grew and your insides shifted to accommodate the change, being the most painful part of this process so far, as what you could only assume was a set of magical ovaries now laid inside you instead of your trusty testicles.  During all this, you hardly noticed your chest expanding, creating a set of otherworldly breasts, large and unnaturally perky. Then your face hurt. You couldn't keep looking at the mirror as the process continued, as it felt like your head was exploding, but when your eyes opened, you were looking at the face of unnatural beauty and symmetry. Large, soft red lips, long, free flowing red hair, and warm burnt sienna skin. You were enthralled by the beauty in front of you.  But horrified that it seemed to be YOU. The figure in the mirror following your motions, making faces, groping yourself with slender fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cal...\" You stammered in a unfamiliar voice, a husky contralto. \"Wh-what did you do to me?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"I imbued you with the power and spirit of one long gone,\"</i> Cal whispered, sounding tired. <i>\"You are no longer Liam. You are Zhham! Returned to the world so you may grant the wishes of the mud folk. You are both now, and subject to them whims of self and selves... My- my power is waning, and I shall depart you for a time.  But I will leave the guidelines here upon these plaques. I shall... return...\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo large, ornate plaques appeared on the walls, as well as a set of flowing crimson robes and breathable pants upon your naked form.  You sat, awestruck, and read them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>Rules Zhamm must abide.</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. You are Zhham, the name you must give all, and all who hold the lamp are known as Master.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. If the vessel's Master makes a wish, you must interpret that wish and follow it through until you deem it granted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. You cannot effect the will of the Master.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n4. Something cannot be created from nothing. All exchanges; equivalent. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n5. Wealth cannot be created, only stolen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n6. You must go when the Master calls. When not aiding the Master, Zhham shall stay within the vessel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n7. The Master is no longer the Master once the third wish is made. The former Master can no longer hold the vessel. You cannot grant any further wishes for that Master.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n8. A force must always occupy the vessel, from now and moving forward until the Earth turns to dust.</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mind was already buzzing with what this all meant, and how these rules may be used to save you from this predicament. Your eyes traveled to the second plaque.<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><br>\r\n<b>Rules the Master Must Abide.</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. The wishes granted area always 3. No more than 3.  The Master shall be abandoned if each wish is not made in conjunction with another in 7 rotations of the Earth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. No resurrection, as the djinn do not hold domain over death. Life cannot be created from nothin. The djinn shall not be able to harm or kill on behalf of the Master. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n3.The djinn cannot grant power greater than its own.<br>\r\n</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou noticed the immense difference between the amount of rules you had to follow and the amount of rules the \"Master\" had to follow, then you came to a realization.  The clothes were the only thing put on you. Your wrists now help wrist restraints, and, after glancing cautiously in the mirror, you felt one around your neck as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were about to protest when....</span></div></div>",

Those new washboard abs didn't lie. But you were still... not you. You attempted quickly in the mirror to say \"I am Liam\" but what came out of your mouth was<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am Zhham,\" You stammered in an absolutely husky voice, with a light untraceable accent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd all at once, you felt yourself turn into mist, starting with your legs, and you were pulled straight up into the blackened void.  You blink, returning to the garage when you left just moments ago. The florescent lights blown out, the garage was dark sans yourself as you... floated above the urn, your legs made of smoke, then you saw a family member holding the thing, mouth agape. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was...</span></div></div>",

She wasn't one to get out much anymore, and the appearance of a misty buff woman coming out of a magic pot is something that would be sure to disturb her. She was still lightly damp in her bath robe, having just left the show, most likely coming in here to find you. But now 'you' was hardly you, You attempted to communicate to her that her quest was successful, but what came out of your mouth was...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mel Finn, mother of two, woman of the world who I now call my master... I am Zhham, the djinn of the urn... uh... hey, how's it goin'?\" You sultry new voice carried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mother swallowed hard and looked up in awe.  \"Djinn... what's a djinn? Are you an angel?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou let out a hearty, unintentional chuckle. \"Uh... no, sorry Mo... Master, I am no angel.  I am... uh... do you remember watching the film Aladdin?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA beam of recognition arrived on her features. \"Oh! Like... Robin Williams? A genie!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou snapped your fingers and pointed as the affirmative, but you weren't about to break out in any musical numbers. \"Exactly.  Three wishes.  No power over death, no wishing for more wishes, and no asking to be turned into a god. Those are the rules.\" Part of you seemed to rebel against this simplistic instruction... something you would have to verify later. You felt like you weren't alone in your own head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah... I see. I can't... bring someone else back from the dead?\" She asked, looking down at the urn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt a twinge of guilt.  Dad is someone she would definitely bring back.  You missed him every day... but you were glad it wasn't an option. \"Sorry Mo- Sorry, Master, but no.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see... three wishes... and almost anything I could want...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sat silently contemplating for a moment, leaning against a wooden shop table your step-Dad rarely uses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What would... you wish for, Miss Zhham?\" Your mother asked thoughtfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were taken aback for a moment, but this was a very Mom question. She normally thought of others before herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm...\" You mused, lounging in mid air, looking at your form.  \"I... want to understand what my situation is, and how to get out of it. Then, maybe using another wish to enact that plan.  I didn't exactly... sign up to this.\" You were able to answer honestly this time.  Strange.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe nodded thoughtfully. \"No, I imagine it's not something you would want to do for all time, huh? Working only for others and not yourself. This time, though, Zhham, I think I am going to be selfish. And if this works, maybe I will try to help you out with your bind with my second wish?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou unintentionally chuckled lightly, and the back of your mind you heard an intrusive thought.  <i>Doubt.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\"Zhham, I wish that I could be my son's age once again, to have another chance at my youth with the knowledge I have now!\"</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour jaw dropped at the request.  It was probably the most selfish thing you've ever heard your Mother say.  She wanted to... live her life on her own? Leave you and your siblings? Your Stepdad... and just go?  You felt somewhat hurt.  You understood, but...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hand raised, fingers waiting in a snapping position. <i>This would be a tricky one,</i> you thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Granted,\" you boomed, and snapped your fingers with a crash of magic.</span></div></div>",

You know that the loss of your Dad was a huge blow, and she never really got over it.  So... you had to design a situation where she was able to be a young person again, without simply turning back time for her.  But that was the first step.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you snapped you fingers, multicolored lightning soared across the room, striking your mother in the chest.  The blow burst her clothes off her body and the towel from her head, leaving her completely nude, a sight which one part of you was slightly embarrassed to see, but you were too interested in what was about to happen to turn away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I feel... strange...\" Mel murmured, looking at her hands in confusion as she started to shake... or phase, with after images of her appeared whenever she moved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA spectral hourglass appeared above her head, glowing green, with the time in the glass being about half full.  Then, the hourglass turned on it's head, time began to reverse.  You watched your mother for a moment as she began to move backwards in time at the spot she stood.  The faded scars from her C-section began to disappear, the light stretch marks on her hips, her thighs, and her breasts faded backwards in time. Her breasts grew smaller and perkier, moving past their time before the pregnancy.  A scar on her shoulder vanished, caused from a car accident in her mid-twenties. Her hair grew short, shorter than you expected, a pixie cut, and it grew darker in color, being nearer to brunette than red. The lines on her face vanished. She was basically the image of your sister Mila without the freckles and your father's chin. She was incredibly pretty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou snapped you fingers again, your new face genuinely red, and a set of clothes stitched themselves from your mother's bathrobe and tower into a short sundress and covered her naked form.  When the magic finally faded, your mother was shaking still, looking at her hands, missing the fade and wrinkles of time. Tears streamed down her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...\" She sputtered. \"I feel so... good!  I don't feel all of the muscle strain, I feel so young!\" She flexed, and felt her thin stomach under the sundress. She was crying tears of happy joy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mo... Master, it is my pleasure,\" you said sincerely . \"But the wish is not over.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou snapped your fingers and your house members appeared, frozen in time, in front of you.  You stepdad, your stepsister, your aunt, and your sister, your Mom was confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing Miss Zhham?\" She asked inquisitively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded towards the frozen family members. \"In order to complete this illusion, we must change them as well, as well as the memories of all who know you. Otherwise, you will never be able to live in peace.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe nodded, hesitantly, stopping in front of your stepdad with mixed emotions.  \"They won't forget me though?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shook your head, the pigtail flopping behind you, a feeling you were not used to. \"No, I will make sure they maintain similar relationships with you, where possible. This was my thought, Master. Your former husband Bartholomew, he will be your new father, and I shall make you a sibling to Corey.  You shall be stepsibling to Liam and Mila.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour Mom blinked. \"Liam's not here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Liam will be changed, but no, I cannot pull him here at this time.\" You responded, regretting you couldn't seem to tell her the truth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah,\"  she said sadly.  \"What about my sister Sandy?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked at your Aunt, currently with a bottle in her hands.  \"I will remove her addiction to alcohol and give her many of your personality traits, to make her a more pleasing mother figure, and the official mother of your children. She has a lot of personality features equivalent to yours due to similar upbringing.  She will be your new stepmother, married to Bartholomew, and you will now be the child of Bartholomew, younger sibling to Corey. Do you have any changes you see fit, Master?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMel was speechless, contemplating the possibilities.  \"I can... make my own life?\" She choked out. \"I can chose who I want to be? How I want my life to be shaped? How I want my family to be?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Indeed... Master,\" You respond with a slight smile, happy you could do something for your Mom after all this time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTears continued to stream down her face. \"You are... very gracious, Miss Zhham,\" she stated happily, wiping the tears away. \"I'm sure you could have stopped at the youth thing and let me fend for myself, but you're letting me keep my family too? Why are you so nice to me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou got somewhat defensive, not that she could recognize you. \"I... uh, looked into your heart and saw your good intentions. Many who... hold the urn are not so gracious.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe seemed to take this as an affirmative.  \"I want to... I want my sister to have love, and I want Bart to feel true love too. I want to keep my memories, but also have ones of this manufactured life too... and I want Corey and me to have a good relationship, maybe that would help her feel less alone all the time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded.  Your Mom's character shined brightly through. She was a good person, but she wanted another chance at life, but wanted her children to have a chance at life too.  Using the djinn side of your mind, which seemed to have a 'third eye', using her wish making abilities, she could sift through the potential timelines of what this relationship would look like. Your Mom gave a small kiss to the frozen Bartholomew before she became Mel Mable, before reality shifted around her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth you and Mel stood in her new room, the basement, formerly unfinished, was now a suitable room to stay in, with old school band posters like \"KISS\" and new school \"Imagine Dragons,\" the interests your Mom had amplified into the room of a teenaged girl. A small TV and a Nintendo Gamecube, and a nook with knitting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou held the urn in your hands, and getting the feeling it was something you could do, your compressed it into a colorful piece of glass, attached to a chain, and put it on Mel's neck. She examined her surroundings tentatively.  \"I even have my own room!\" She squeaked excitedly. \"This is more than I could possibly ask for! This was four or five wishes at once!\" She hugged you excitedly, and you embraced her yourself with a big grin.  You couldn't help but smiling too, though it felt strange with this stern face you were wearing. \"I could never pay you back enough for this Miss Zhamm.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the hug, she found herself with urn around her neck, in the form of a two inch shard of glass, resplendent of color.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I shall let you grow accustomed to your new surroundings, Master,\" You said with a small bow. \"I shall retreat until you call me.  You must make your second with within seven days, and this jewelry shall return to its urn shape once you have made your third. I shall observe, and wait for your call, oh Master.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMel kissed you lightly on the cheek with a grateful, tearful expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that you retreated into the vase, full of emotion, but happy for the changes your Mom made to her life, a second chance that she would otherwise not have been granted.  Inside, you saw the mirror in your chambers had changed into a looking glass for the outside world, which you were able to see and hear from. You sat on a pillow on the ground and made a sigh of relief as your mother squealed in joy, and tossed a stuff pig into the air.</span></div></div>",

The magic had already left your fingertips before you regretted twisting the wish in the way that you did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe magic leaped fourth from your fingertips and into your Mother's body, her eyes wide open as she let out a sharp gasp before the magic rendered her body inert and ripped her soul from her body. The lightning strike, like a clacker, flipped around and arc into your body as well.  A split second of intense pain later, everything was dark, as you felt the magic tear your soul out of your combined form, separating it from the djinn inhabiting it.  Everything was dark for one more second until the breath filled your lungs once again, and your eyes opened wide. The first thing you could see was a set of supple, lightly stretched mammeries below a familair looking bathrobe. You shakily stood, looking at your soft hands, and looked up at Zhham, starting to wake up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What... what happened?\" Zhham stuttered with a familiar untraceable accent. \"Wha-\" Zhham noticed her body in that moment as well, or rather, your Mother, Mel, noticed that she was wearing Zhham's body. \"What... how...\" She said, stunned at her dark skin and large biceps, but more so by her misty tail which she had instead of legs.  She looked up and the color seemed to drain on her face.  \"Wait... are you... is that Zhham? Am I you? Are you <b>me</b>?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded, and your dark red hair fell in front of your face from the towel turban it was wrapped up in. \"Yes... in a sense. The body your in now is the same age as your children. So I made your wish come true.\" You muttered, somewhat regretfully. \"It's a new path to follow for you to follow. I hope that's what you wanted.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore she could protest, as she was now with a new master, the smoke engulfed her and retreated back into the Urn of Remembrance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou picked up the Urn and made your way towards your room, and not your Mom's, as that was still a bit weird.  You returned the minimally decorated, slightly disorganized bedroom and sat at the bed's edge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are become Mel, mother of three.  You looked at your clean, carefully manicured nails, and then further down, at the full expanse of your new petite form. A moment passed as you stared at your new cleavage, obvious under the bathrobe. Then another moment.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck it,\" you blurted, very un-Mel-like, and you locked your door and threw off your bathrobe. Under it, your Mother was laid almost completely bare.  You were almost getting used to being Zhham for a moment, then this... it was a major out of body experience. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou threw off the tower turban and the only thing remaining clinging to your still slightly damp body was a pair of lacy black panties. You looked back up at your bedroom mirror, your face sharply pink.  \"I'm sorry Mr. Krenshaw,\" you mimicked in a mother tone. \"Liam is just having some trouble after his father passed. Please give him some time, okay?\" The words dripped from your round lips, sickly sweet.  The sensation of being your Mom was different than being yourself or Zhham. The world seemed to be brighter, your skin more sensitive to the cold.  Your mother's old scars from the C-section she had when you had you and your sister, long since faded, sat the the slope of her bare stomach.  You touched them experimentally with your new, soft hands, and started to develop a slight shiver as you did so.  The touch was intimate. These were your hands. Your scars.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou replaced your robe, quickly covering yourself up in embarrassment. You were still curious about how this new body functioned, considering your full life you'd always been a man, but this was, after all, your mother's body, which you had to steal from her mere minutes before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo, perhaps now was the best time to concoct a plan. You could, theoretically, save your Mom from servitude and get your body back. Though you weren't sure you could do it on your own. You would need a plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou thought of your best course of action at this moment, and considered...</span></div></div>",

And you looked back at the mirror.  It was your mother's face, but for right now... it was yours. It was your body. And there was no guilt associated with just... you know, a quick peek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh... fine!\" You said, shedding your robe again and sitting on your unmade bed. Mom's breasts hung lazily on her chest, jiggling with every movement. They were large, with slight stretch make, undoubtedly from when she was pregnant... and breast feeding.  You thought about being on the other end of things, when you were a baby, and where you and your sister used to take your meals, and you felt a metaphorical alarm go off in the back of your mind. You felt a deep yearning to have children again, and soon, as you were so close to never having that chance.  This probably wasn't a woman thing, and just a thing about your Mom that stuck in her subconscious, but it was none the less distracting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jesus,\" you stated, falling onto your bed. \"Okay, well... let's try it then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked up at the ceiling and focused on the feeling, you lightly put your hands across your new, king sized chest and squeezed. You gasped slightly, feeling a spike of endorphins reach your head and send signals to your new pussy.  \"This feels so good, fuck, Mom,\" you seethed. You massaged your nipples and breasts gently, feeling them harden in your fingers until the both poked out from their spot. Your legs writhed, kicking the covers from your bed. The cold was brisk against your bare skin as you continued to rub, all other thoughts leaving you for a moment, before you felt an unfamiliar dampness between your legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou froze for a second, thinking carefully about the next move, before throwing caution to the wind and taking the black panties of your bare legs.  A hearty field of kempt bush flowed down where your dick usually was.  Steadily, your hands moved down your body, until you felt the opening, the skin on your labia. Your fingers brushed against it for just a moment before recoiling, feeling the full effect of the touch on somewhere so private and intimate. The place where your life started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, cautiously, you reached your fingers down again and brushed against this private place.  You felt the dampness at your touch, and another wave of pleasure flew up your neck, blanking your brain for a second, but you persisted. One hand continued to massage your breasts while the other explored your new nethers. Finally, feeling the slick created from your new body's abundant secretions, you stuck a finger in experimentally. Your vaginal muscles clamped down hard, sending signal after signal up to your brain, indicating its enjoyment. You couldn't help but smile and drool, loosing yourself to the constant movement, finding yourself on your belly to get a better angle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Liam,\" you seethed in a voice too sexy to be your Mom's, \"Mommy wants more. Please just r-ram me,\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour fantasy completed the scenario, imagining you own erect dick pegging this vagina, a deviant thought which only was expanded as you slid another finger into your expanding vagina. You pounded and pounded, gasping and squeaking with your Mother's own throat, you finally felt it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wave of pleasure crashed down on the shore of your mind and you were engulfed in a massive malaise of satisfaction hit you, blurring all thoughts and guilt that may have let themselves live in your head.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt only ended when you opened your eyes. You sheets and mouth were covered in messy drool. You wiped them away and saw that you left a damp spot on your sheets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah shit,\" you mused, smelling the musk of your new excretions. \"Looks like I'm going to have to do the laundry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll guilt associated with this decision melted at the moment of orgasm. You confidently stood, pulling your panties up your smooth legs and throwing your robe back on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou knew what you wanted next-</span></div></div>",

Not only was your brain absolutely sex-crazed, but your body seemed to long for it.  You dropped your robe and squeezed your new breasts together, and bit your lip, seeing a different side of your Mom then you ever thought possible.  Well, technically, it never was before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour loins quivered still from the coital excitement, but you were hungry, and you wanted more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou moved into your parents room and instinctively started rummaging through your Mom's undergarments.  Mostly just very bland fair, single colored underwear, only a few lacy garments, and only a single pair of something that could be considered lingerie. But your search came up fruitless.   There wasn't a dildo or any toys in any of Mom's stuff, at least not anywhere obvious. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou fell back on your parents bed and felt the absolute hunger fill you full of feelings of yearning to be filled.

You waiting with anticipation, your heart in your gut, like this was the most stressful thing you've ever done.

You ran to the underwear drawer and grabbed the pair of lacy, red lingerie, taking extra time to figure out how the hell you were supposed to wear a bra.  You looked at the mirror again. You were not the perfectly put together picture of Mel Finn.  You were wearing thin, red lingerie but... there was something definitely unsexy about how disheveled you looked.  Grabbing the brush, you began to comb your mostly dried hair, putting it up into a single pony tail. It was soft and conditioned, with good depth and only a few slightly blonde-grey hairs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked anxiously at the makeup. Mel was plenty attractive without it.  Still, you attempted, putting on some red lipstick, and fucking it up the first time.  At about the fifth time, you had it, but you were running out of time. Grabbing a black blouse and a pair of Mom jeans which hugged you just right, the illusion was complete.  You looked almost exactly like how your Mom would put herself together, barring some blush or mascara, you figured. But you didn't have time for that as you heard a knock on the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou slid on your sandals and flew downstairs. Your heart was near thumping out of your chest as you reached the front door and saw the head a fluffed, blond hair through the opaque glass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou've come this far, how do you play this?</span></div></div>",

You didn't have to tell him anything, and instead play this thing like you were Mel the whole time. If push came to shove, you could always use the Urn to undo any mess you made. It was late in the evening now, and the later it got, the more you seemed to forget about any goals except one...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grabbed the door handle and flung the front door open, greeting Riley with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Mrs. Finn,\" Riley said cheerfully. \"Is Liam around?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou leaned against the doorframe, taking full advantage of your new Mom powers. \"Well well if it isn't Mr. Riley! Please, Mel is fine, like I've told you.  Come on in,\" you invited, pushing the door open with your foot.  \"Liam said he'd be right back, but you could start playing the Nintendo and he would see you soon.\"  You chuckled, knowing full well that you owned a PlayStation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRiley looked confused for just a second, and shrugged. \"Sure thing Mrs. Finn,\" he said, stepping into the house, taking off his shoes, and heading upstairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou watched him in a new light as he walked up the stairs, watching his taught butt in his blue jeans, and feeling an eagerness you never associated with him before.  Closing the door, you made your way to the kitchen and started cutting up an apple, almost shaking as you did so. Making a plate with apples and peanut butter on it, you waited a few minutes to get situated, and then followed him up the stairs, letting your motherly hips sway as you did so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn your room, Riley was sitting on your bed, playing a match of Battlefield. He looked in your direction as you entered the room, and looked momentarily surprised as you came in, shutting the door behind him, holding up the plate triumphantly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, sweet!\" He responded, sitting up, \"Snacks! Thanks Mrs. Finn.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem Riley!\" You responded, putting a hand on your hip. \"But Mel is fine.  What game are you playing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe took the plate and put it on the bedside table. \"Battlefield. Trying to get better but I generally suck,\" He laughed nervously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA scheme was being hatched. \"Could you...should me how to play?\" You said with big puppy dog eyes.  \"I would love to be able to hang out with my son like you do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRiley hesitated. \"Uh... are you sure?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded, plopping yourself down next to him on your bed as he respawned.  \"Oh, for sure. This is what I want.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRiley handed you the controller, and you made absolutely sure you were as initially bad as possible, which was actually pretty hard to do, despite your new, smaller hands.  You died spectacular, getting hit by an enemy players truck.  \"Oh shoot, he got me good,\" you griped. \"Which button is the run button?\" You pushed the controller over to Riley's lap next to you, and he sat up aware.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, here,\" he said, pushing the button for sprint.  You kept your hands on the controller, but your arms leaned over Riley's lap.  You sprinted this time towards the objective, and made a few attempts running at a door, only for it not to open.  \"How about the door Riley? How do I get it open?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe touched the interact button, and you let your hands touch. You glanced at your friend, and saw his eyes wide open, and face slightly pink.  <i>Perfect.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pressed your arms together, mashing your new, beautiful tits together to form a crevasse of cleavage, which easily showed from your bent over position.  After some time of silence, you leaned against him fully, as if perfectly relaxed.  His face was bright red now, but he hadn't made any moves. He barely moved at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smirked, and began to handedly win, going medic and pulling your team to victory.  \"So then, Mr. Nept, is this all you do for fun?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh-\" Riley stammered.  \"No, we s-sometimes...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were obsessed with how he was seemingly melting in your hands. Riley talked a big game, but was terrible with women.  That, however, didn't matter to you. You weren't here to be wooed by him. You were here to get fucked by him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sometimes?\" You repeated. \"Sometimes what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRiley was broken. \"Sometime we-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou let a hand loose from the controller, and touched his knee. \"You sometimes what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRiley's eyes were wide, focused on the television, even though you were currently crouched in a bush, staring at nothing. \"S-sometimes...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour hand moved up Riley's thick thigh, traveling up his pant leg until it made purchase into something throbbing beneath his jeans. You felts your insides tug at you, warming up at the very thought of penetration. \"I can't speak for you,\" You seethed into his ear. \"But when I was young, there was one thing we used to do for fun... I think you young people still do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDexterously, you unbuttoned his jeans, and watched his dick flop out, yearning to be free.  It was long, and thicker than you imagined it would be... and uncut. You moved your other hand off the controller and around his waist as you began stroking his excited, gorged dick. \"But...\" he protested, horny as hell, finally looking at you. \"Your... husband.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smiled, removing himself from him, taking a few steps back towards the door and locking it. \"Staying at work for a few days...\" You responded deviously. \"And... no,\" you said, dramatically turning away. \"You wouldn't want to hear that...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-what?\" Riley quickly protested. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smiled devilishly, looking at yourself in the mirror, admiring this new form and all its privileges. You felt... powerful. You were never good at seduction before, but with these assets... You could apparently turn a man into jelly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou flung off your top and unbuttoned your jeans.  \"Well... this isn't something I want a young man like you to hear... but if you insist.\" Your jeans slid down your shaved legs, revealing your milky thighs beneath.  Standing in your lacy lingerie, you took a step towards him, as he turned, hungrily, to face you.  \"He... hasn't been able to satisfy me.  Not in months.  I have been... yearning for company.  For a man. Are you a man, Riley?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRiley half-nodded. \"But... Liam-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smiled a brilliant white smile, taking another step towards him.  \"He's currently... visiting a friend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were wet and ready. You wanted to jump him now, but instead you took your time.  You pulled his jeans off his legs and let them fall to the floor.  You pulled him close to the edge of the bed, and placed his head between your breasts.  \"You... you want me don't you, Riley? You... want to play with me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt his hot breath on your nearly bare chest, and finally you felt consent, and his rough hands began to message your breasts under your lingerie.  You moaned in consent, and tore his shirt off. You've seen Riley shirtless before, but his bare chest only added to your excitement.  You pushed him back on the bed, the room still full of your smell from earlier, this could only elevate it.  Your friend sat back, watching you from his elbows, as you turned, looking over your shoulder, and slowly dropped your thin red lingerie, showing your shapely ass as you bent, lowering them until they fell to the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, you hunk of a man,\" You stated, hands on your brassier. \"on or off?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe red faced, ecstatic Riley eyed you hungrily.  \"Off,\" he ordered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou complied, unhooking them at the front and letting them fall. You moved toward the bed with vigor, leaping atop of him, hungry for his touch.  He pulled you close and did something unexpected. He kissed you, lightly on the lips.  You moved back, surprised, but allowed yourself to be pulled in for more.  You put your legs around his waist as he stuck his tongue down your throat, and you were... extremely turned on. When you finally came up for air, you couldn't take any more. You grabbed his dick, and lowered yourself onto it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah- Ah- Ahhhhhh,\" You moaned, feeling a slight pinch of pain mixed with the feeling of a single male orgasm from this simple motion. Your hands in the air, his hands on your hips, you continued to lower yourself... fully. Until you were immersed in him. Until he was all of your thoughts.  \"Fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck-\" You murmured, losing yourself to your feelings  You looked at the specimen of man under you in a new light. He was a miracle.  You began to ride his pole, focusing on his tip, watching the veins in his neck bulge from the pressure and the pleasure.  Up and down, up and down, every twitch from his eager dick filling you with ecstasy, your breasts and hair bobbing from the motions. You grabbed onto his strong shoulders and felt his body twitching, his hot breath on your neck and his lightly stubbled cheek rubbing against your clean face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-wait,\" Riley protested in a hissed whisper, \"I'm not wearin-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis only spurned you on, your hungry insides finally being quenched, you gyrated around his sensitive tip, causing him to twitch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh,\" he sputtered. \"Fuuuuuuuck\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'-yeaaaah!\" You continued, horny and excited, as you felt him finally burst, causing you to finally lose it as his hot semen coated your insides. \"Yes! Yes!\" You raised your hair back with your hands and reveled in the sweat, the smell, the feeling. \"What a- what a man-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou collapsed atop him as he still stuck inside you.  He attempted to move, but you didn't allow it. You wanted to feel him inside you for as long as possible...</span></div></div>",

Your touched the soft chest of your fuck-buddy, who was silently holding you in his strong arms as your breathing began to calm. <i>\"And even more fun with a partner,\"</i> You mused inwardly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe adrenaline began to fade and you found yourself exhausted by the raw, animalistic love making, and felt your tired mind drifting...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">*****</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stirred the next morning looking at familiar walls.

So that whole thing wasn't a dream. You really did have mind blowing sex with your best friend while occupying your Mom's body.  Your vaginal muscles clenched around the flaccid dick still inside you. Sometime during the night, you had flipped over and or... had been flipped over, and put into a comfortable spoon. You felt safe, and warm, and needed.  You scooched your body closer to your new paramour, who felt you approach and held you tighter, still wordless.  You had no idea that you could <i>feel</i> this way about your best friend. Riley had always been a close, personal confidant, and you had always gone out of your way to share your woes with each other. But this feeling, the warmth he was providing, it was overwhelming. You tingled at the thought, and you felt yourself get wet simply thinking of the loving antics however many hours ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRiley started to stir not long after, and so did the rest of him. You found yourself looking forward to the morning, thinking back at a lot of your own. Then you felt it. A bit at first, but you felt him wake up... from his morning wood. His dick grew erect... inside of you.  As it reached its full girth, you gasped slightly, and Riley pulled you close and kissed your neck, sending shivers down your spine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning,\" he whispered, his first word to you since his objections from last night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning,\" you whispered back, sinking further into his embrace and feeling him twitch inside of you. \"... great morning,\" you murmured, getting wet against his throbbing member.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hands around you twitched.  You waited in anticipation for him to take the first move. You wanted to be fucked. You wanted him to take you.  Finally, after a few moments of held breath, without another word, he pushed you onto your back, grabbing you from behind by your tits, pushing himself further inside of you. You gasped and squealed with delight, knowing this is exactly what you wanted.  Any sort of age was pushed right out of your as you yelped your first moan, gasping your hands and the sheets and attempting to prop yourself on your knees.  The movements were rough as he pushed you further towards the bed and bit at your neck and ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh lover,\" you hissed, wincing from the pain and pleasure. \"I tried to make you- I tri- I tried to make you mine last night... but... n-now... now you're making me you-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last statement was cut off by how quickly your first orgasm came from this treatment, your body craving to be manhandled.  Your knees buckled and your body began to quake, squirting your insides all over your consort's dick, only providing him a slicker transition as he grabbed your breasts and began to buck. You felt like a sex object and you liked it.  This was the treatment that this body, combined with your mind, seemed to want from your friend Riley Nept.  A moment of calm existed as your breathing and moaning held, the only sound coming from the brilliant man behind you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Missus Finn,\" you heard in your ear, \"you are bad. What would Liam say?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn't help but laugh for a moment before being pulled into your second orgasm, your pussy now spread wide as is it took Riley's whole shaft.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh fuck me, Riley,\" you managed to say, \"fuck Mama-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe obliged and granted you what you were seeking, ramping up the speed of his errant pounding to a steady pace, you still quaking from your second orgasm, he started to lose steam as he shot his load inside you.  Feeling his white hot mist coating your inside pulled you right back over the edge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OooooOooH,\" you moaned, grabbing your body like it was trying to escape you. \"this is- all I- all I- wanted...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sweat trickled down your new brow, as the young Riley's body was spent once again, he tumbled out of you, leaving a trial of his DNA across your bedsheets.  You felt your vaginal muscles quiver tightly, doing their best to keep in all his genetic material, desperately wanted to do something with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a moment, you angled your body around, turning towards your young lover, his square, strapping features being the cornerstone of your thoughts, and how they would look on your child.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou put a hand on his face. He smiled lightly and grabbed it, holding it fast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So... uh... Mel,\" he started, nervously. \"Is this... are we... is this a thing now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well Riley,\" you gave him a teasing look. \"I have never been fucked as good as you've fucked me now. So yes, this is a thing. You've given me a new lease on womanhood, you know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRiley couldn't help but blush. Cute. For a man who just fucked you raw. \"So you're like... my girlfriend now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smiled a the childish notion, one that you would have fallen for only yesterday. \"... Yes, sure, I'll be your... girlfriend. Just as long as you can keep bringing your A-game like you did these past two days...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked across the moon, before a thought crossed his mind. \"But... what about your husband?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, technically <i>I</i> never married him,\" you mused truthfully, though you were wearing the body of the person who did. \"But... I will figure that out.  You and me will keep fucking. Everyone will be happy. Don't you worry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRiley took that as an affirmative, smiled, and got out of bed, putting his jeans and shirt back on.  \"I can't wait to tell Liam... well, probably shouldn't do that, considering my girlfriend.... and where we just fucked.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou laughed again, still buck naked and sweating in bed, your legs made of jello. \"I somehow think he would appreciate it. You've done what tons of thirteen year olds have sworn to do for ages. You <i>fucked his Mom.</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRiley chuckled, kissing you on the forehead and pretty much skipped out the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou lay in bed, staring at the ceiling, conscience of your still quivering and semen covered lower half. This was absolute bliss. You looked over at the urn, which lay inert on your beside table. You could think of a few things you could ask for, but was it still too early?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, your decided...</span></div></div>",

Her blonde hair being blown back by the magical wind, she seemed.... unimpressed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's this supposed to be?\" She sneered, looking around at anything but the floating lady in the air made partially of smoke. \"Liam? Is this a prank?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wanted to tell her yes, it was Liam, but not it wasn't the prank. Instead, what came out of your mouth was;<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am Zhham!\" You voice boomed, pulling her attention. \"This is no jest, Corey Mable, who I now know as M-Master...\" The last term was pulled quite forcefully from your mouth, as it felt very unnatural calling your step-sister Master.  \"I am the djinn of the urn. A force older than natural order, predating the progenitors, created before time organized the world.  I am at your disposal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCorey raised a carefully plucked eyebrow, still with disbelief. \"A wish-granting djinn?  Really? You're not making this any easier to believe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVery classic Corey.  You felt the magic at your fingertips surge. \"Very well,\" you respond, feeling the words come out as if someone else was saying them. \"I am able to take a request.  A small fraction of my power. This will not count against your three wishes. Tell me your request and I may grant it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCorey looked surprised by this willingness and pondered for a moment.  \"How about... hmm... make me three inches taller?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shrugged and snapped, your step-sister waited until the felt her yoga pants begin to run up her leg, as she extended quite painlessly to the height of 5'11''.  She gasped, noticing her midriff on what was a regular sized tank top for her former height.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the fuuuuck?\" She said, looking at her ill fitting clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope that satisfies your curiosity,\" you state plainly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked up at you suspiciously. \"Did you just... make my clothes smaller?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do NOT tempt fate, sister!\" You snapped back with your own personality as your new voice shook the room. \"I am gracious, be thankful I made your proportions the same!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou quickly shut up. allowing you a moment of silence.  You used this moment to see if you could shift things around.  Focusing your energy, the urn stopped spewing the magical smoke and the florescent lights on the ceiling flickered back to life.  Putting great effort into it, and sweating slightly, you reformed the magical smoke that was your legs into the harem pants that Cal gave you earlier. You were now regular sized, which you noticed was still several inches taller than you lengthened step-sister, probably close to 6'5\". You stepsister looked intimidated, which tracks, as she's used to being the prettiest person in the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No... <i>Master</i>\" You smarmed at her, \"What is your first wish?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour stepsister bit her lip. \"So... anything I want?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No wishing for more wishes, you get three,\" you said tritely. \"No brining people back from the dead. No wishing to be a god. Beyond that, yes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, let me start with something easy then,\" she said wryly. \"Zhham, I wish to be the most beautiful person on the planet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou scoffed at the wish.  How very surface it was, and unbecoming. Your stepsister was fine, a beautiful lady already, no even more appealing with the extra three inches of height to her already generous proportions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you realized the implications.

A magic circle appeared at her feet, covered in ancient symbols which one part of your brain recognized, but yours most assuredly did not.  Electric jolts cascaded off the circle, and your step sister Corey began to levitate a few inches off the ground. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah!\" She moaned in excitement.  \"This feels... unreal! I feel so... powerful!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe magic circle flickered to life even stronger, glowing a bright orange, while simultaneously, another appeared at your feet, causing your djinn body to float as well.  A blue light appeared, cascading from every orifice on your and your sister's faces, until a spectral form appeared, a few feet in front of each of your bodies.  It was a strange out of body experience, only seeing, no feelings, and looking at the form you inhabited behind you. Your sister, finally snapping into focus, examined her own spectral form.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah... what is hap- Wait, Liam?!\" She said, looking at the ghostly figure amidst the crackling blue light.  \"Are you-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer thought was cut off as bright golden chains grasped onto her spectral body from behind her, physically piercing her spectral soul.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait-\" She cried in protest. \"No, wait-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe chains exuded from the body of Zhham, the form you inhabited, and, in your opinion, the most beautiful person on the planet.  Corey's soul kicked in mid-air to no avail, as the spectral chains pulled your stepsister's soul into your former body, binding her there.  A sharp magical light blinked, and Zhham's chest was filled with breath once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Liam-\" You heard Zhham's powerful voice protest. \"What did you do-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, almost at once, she was gone, her new body turning into multicolored smoke, and disappearing into urn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe magic circles dropped, and Corey's body fell to the floor. You felt you soul starting to get called to whatever lies beyond and decided it was probably for the best if you did not tarry too long without a body.  Without all of pomp and circumstance of Corey's binding to her new form, you looked at the unconscious body splayed across the floor, and invaded it. The vessel was empty, just as your djinn powers told you it would be a moment ago before you lost them.  All at once, you felt a short, sharp pain as Corey's old body was jolted back to life with the infusion of a new soul.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWobbling as breath returned to your lungs, you got off of your belly and slowly stood. The sensations were entirely different.  The world around you looked more colorful, and smelled different. You body moved in new and mysterious ways. But you figured time to think would be necessary for whatever came next.  You snagged the inert urn, and moved upstairs to your new room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the way, your Mom stopped you briefly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, uh, Corey,\" she said quickly, stopping in her tracks, wearing a bathrobe after freshly showering. \"did you see your brother in the garage? Is the crawlspace clear?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh... yeah,\" your voice cracked, unused to your vocal chords. \"Just some old junk. Only two boxes. The vent guys should have no problem getting up there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, good,\" she conceded, relieved.  \"And your brother?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He uh.... went to visit Sarah,\" you offered up, knowing your neighbor would often hang with you when bored.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, nice,\" Mom said with a smile. \"She's a good influence that Sarah. Thanks, Corey,\" Your Mom offered, as she moved to the laundry room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem Mom,\" You responded quickly while moving towards the stairs.  At this point, you realized that Corey <i>never</i> called Mel 'Mom'.  You looked back at her before heading up the stairs and saw her beaming as she worked at the washer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>She called me Mom,</i>\" she muttered joyously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shook your head as you went upstairs. As long as you were going to be Corey, you were going to make sure she was nicer to your family. Or, you were going to be much nicer to your family.  You weren't sure at this point where Corey stopped and you started, or how long you were going to be like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou entered Corey's room, the second door on the left on the second floor of the house, and shut the door behind you, locking it quickly.  The room, as was her wont, was positively immaculate, albeit a bit colorless. The most colorful thing on the wall was a painting of Paris, the only wall covering that wasn't a hat hook.  The bed was made to perfection, and the clothes were neat and folded or hung exactly where they were supposed to be.  The only thing out of place now was the antique urn, where the actual Corey was no doubt stewing inside.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour sister's face appeared in the vanity nearby, which frightened you for a brief moment, until you realized you were the one wearing it.  You looked, blinked a few times, and finally let out an exasperated \"Wow,\" After touching your supple, unblemished face skin.  She certainly wasn't possessing the unnatural beauty of Zhham, but she was still attractive as hell, even without any makeup.  Your new chest bulged forward a few inches with what you knew to be d cups from all of her laundry that you ended up doing, and her ass filled out the yoga pants she was wearing, as you turned and winked in the vanity.  \"This is so fuckin' weird,\" You laughed, not knowing what other way to feel besides mystified. \"One minute I was a genie, now I'm my wicked stepsister, and she's the one trapped in ceramic.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou laid on her bed, wrinkling the sheets as purposefully as possible. You felt your midriff which showed clearly now, due to the fact that you made this form three inches taller.  You weren't sure how to proceed.  In your left hand, you held your sister's new phone, which she never bothered to set a password.  Near your right hand, on the end table near the bed, is the Urn of Remembrance, which had the power to grant any wish you desired, though you needed to make sure your wording was absolutely perfect, as Corey would no doubt want to sabotage all your wishes as the new Zhham.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDecisions, decisions...</span></div></div>",

Though you would miss your dick, as it wasn't clear how easy it was to get a chick to be all over you. Though with this new body...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grabbed your new d-cup breasts experimentally, feeling their weight, and these new strange feelings gathering around you loins as you did so. You shrugged it off with a chuckle, this new body feeling strange even when you moved.  \"I just...\" You chuckled with your new tenor voice. \"This is so... whacky.  One minute I'm a busty djinn from an Urn and the next I'm my bitch of a step-sister.  I'm goin going to need a hand.... unpacking all of this. Hmmm...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou fingered your new phone for a moment, and sent a message to your best friend, Riley Nept.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Hey man, its Liam. Get over here. Weird shit is happening.</i> You typed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Corey???</i> Riley replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>No, Liam. But kinda Corey, todays been weird. Get here asap and Ill xplain.</i> You replied, looking at your carefully manicured hands with their yellow polish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>??? coming, brt</i> He quickly typed back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou waited for a few moments, making strange faces in the mirror, jumping up and down to feel your breasts held up by your new yellow bra, with white polka dots. You shook your head and peaked under the yoga pants... the panties you wore matched.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour face turned pink as the elastic quickly clapped your trousers back into place against your firm, exercised abdomen. \"Yo what the fuck,\" you muttered, getting more into the shoes of your sister. \"I am a fuckin'; girl. Holy shit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour thoughts started to cloud, your brain truly trying processing the information, when a knock on the front door called your attention.. You nearly ate shit on the stairs as you rushed to the front door, flinging it open. Your shaggy haired friend stood at the door, looking as confused as you did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Riley,\" you spat out, \"thank god, come in quick.\" You said, pulling your confused friend inside. \"Lets go to my room.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhh... okay Corey,\" Riley responded, following you up the stairs, and was doubly confused when you entered into your room, Liam's room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh... kaaaay,\" Riley said uncertainly. \"Uhh... Corey, what's going on? Liam is having trouble?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No,\" You responded. \"Well, yes. <b>I</b> am Liam, and it's been a day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRiley scoffed. \"No, you're not?\" He asked. \"Liam is Liam, you're you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou put your head in your hands and scooped your new blonde locks out of the way. \"No, no, we are NOT doing this sitcom bullshit.\" Your spat back. \"You are going to believe me. I need you to believe me as quickly as possible to get this bullshit out of the way. So, put yourself in the shoes where it may be possible that I'm currently inhabiting the body of my bitch step-sister.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRiley face lost its color.  \"Okay, I'm there. How did it happen?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou took a deep breathe, and explained everything that happened. About Cal, about Zhham, and about Corey and her bogus wish.  Riley sat patiently, listening, until your tale was over. At the end of it, you felt exhausted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, so... you're Liam, then?\" He asked tentatively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yesss,\" You hissed. \"And here's Corey.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou went to the Urn and touched it, releasing the angry djinn from within. The beautiful Zhham filled up your bedroom, filling it with bright lights and colorful smoke. You and Riley were nearly knocked off your feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am Zhham!\" She boomed, looking seriously ticked off. \"I.... YOU-\" She shouted looking towards you on the floor. \"What have you done to me?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were intimidated until you remembered all the rules she had to follow. You stood. \"Nothing, you did it to yourself and you know it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZhham got up in your face in her large form and reached out to strike you, but her massive, muscular arm stopped short of your face, unable to hurt you directly. She growled in frustration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Zhham, what is my name?\" You demanded, looking at the terrified face of your friend Riley.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's... M-M.... M-M... Masteeerrr,\" she responded through gritted teeth, angry her own mouth betrayed her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I give you permission to speak my full name, so speak it, just this once.\" You demanded again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are... Liam... Finn.\" She hissed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Back to your Urn, Zhham We shall summon you if we have a wish,\" You demanded, holding the urn up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Noooooo!\" She howled as she was pulled into the urn outside of her own power.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe smoke and lights dissappeared into the urn along with her, and the only thing remaining was the shift in your curtains and several of your frames falling off your walls. Riley breathed hard, exhaling for the first time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's your proof,\" You said, folding your arms below your breasts. \"I'm me. And that's Corey, or now known as Zhham, a wish granted djinn.  I've got three wishes. And so do you, technically.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRiley stood silently for a moment, mouth agape, staring at the spot Zhham was but a moment ago.  Then he looked at you. And got a big smile on his face. \"Liam!\" He announced, embracing you. \"Damn! You got hot! Look at your tits! Holy shit!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn't help but smile at his stupidity. \"Yep, a small price to pay for freedom.  Sure I don't have my dick for now, but hey, I got a wish making genie and some revenge on my sister's shitty behavior.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow...\" He breathed looking you up and down. \"Have you tried out those tits yet? Have you... ya know...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blinked, not getting his point. \"Oh... oh! Oh, no I haven't really... explored it yet.\" You felt your face turning red at the thought of your own new, naked body.  Before, when you had a dick, Corey's body would be a major turn on, but it was attached with a pretty spiteful woman.  You never thought of her like that. But now, with you at the reigns, you could potentially build a better model of Corey. But that would mean giving up the you that you were before. And also, coming to terms with your... new plumbing. \"I mean, she's hot right? But like... she's Corey.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRiley elbowed you.  \"I could help you, if you wanted,\" he suggested, wiggling his eyebrows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Haha holy shit dude,\" You responded with a laugh. \"I mean- well...\" You chewed on your lip for a minute, actually considering his suggestion.  You shook your head. \"We've got a genie. And three wishes. Technically six, if we work together. But we have to word them as carefully as possible to make sure that the angry djinn won't screw us. So... what would you wish for?\"</span></div></div>",

You filled half the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You called, Master?\"  You queried as you shook your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It worked!\" She responded. \"I'm not crazy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep, not crazy,\" You responded, still baffled.  \"But I do have a purpose.  You have three wishes.  No bringing the dead back. No wishing for more wishes.  No wanting to be a god. Beyond that, you seem to know what's going on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Mila looked up to you with stars in her eyes. \"Are you... always this big? Could you fit in my room better? And turn off the smoke effects?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou focused, realizing that this was a request, and not a wish, you still had small power to grant it.  Focusing hard, the urn stopped spewing smoke and the soft yellow lights of the bedroom returned. Finally, you put your energy into the feeling of having legs, and the harem pants appeared in the smoke that was your lower half, shrinking yourself into relative human proportions. You still towered over your short sister by about a foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow,\" she said with her eyes still wide. \"This is unreal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's real,\" You confirmed again, wanting some serious answers from Cal but ready to get this over with. \"Now... Master, what is your wish?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMila took a moment, shrugged, scratched her head, and sat in an egg chair at the side of her bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ya know, I don't know if I have any right now,\"  she responded hesitantly. \"You just wanna... hang out?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blinked.  Hanging out with your sister wasn't that weird but you don't do it super often. Now she wants to hang out with you... while you were a djinn.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh- Well...\"</span></div></div>",

You examined the thing, red robe, somewhat in the shape of a vest, sat several inches off your new chest.  You have never been this in shape, and these new features... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCautiously, you dropped the robe around your ankles, and audibly gasped.  Your new breasts were huge, and gravity didn't seem to effect them, as they stood to attention.  You didn't hesitate and attempted a quick squeeze.  The feeling was immense and instant as your soft new hands pushed into it, your knees nearly buckling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Flesh... again,\" you whispered, quite unintentionally, as you felt your lower half grow wet from the feeling.

You stood before your shaggy haired best friend, who held up the urn in his hands. You filled up your garage space and towered above him, standing shirtless, you arms covering your pert nipples.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah woah woah,\" Riley stammered. \"What's... what are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wanted to tell him. <i>it's me, Liam!</i> but what came out of your mouth was;<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I a-am... Zhham,\" You nervously boomed, the walls shaking at your voice. \"I am... an earthen djinn bound to this urn.  What's... What's up, man?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tried to explain what happened to you but found yourself at a loss.  A combination of some strange compulsion and your sheer embarrassment made you tongue tied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A djinn,\" Riley repeated, oggling you in awe, admiration, and lust.  \"That means... I get wishes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, the words came to you almost robotically, as if built into your very being. \"Riley Nept,\" you say, outstretching your hands and letting your breasts free making a powerful gesture. \"You have found the Urn of Remembrance, and have acquired wishes three. You may not wish for power over death, power that exceeds mine, and you cannot create something from nothing.\" You spoke with a confidence unbecoming of you, as if this was rehearsed thousands of times over. \"So... simply state, Zhham I wish, and your truest desires. If fates are kind, you shall get what you seek.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRiley took a deep breathe and looked up at you. \"What's the catch?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou paused. You realized that you could easily make a catch, but one he is not aware of. You could be spiteful and mess with his wish, due to the way it was worded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No catch, man,\" You said, crossing your arms, becoming again <i>very</i> aware of your new female assets. \"Whatchu want?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRiley tapped his shaven chin.  \"Okay... I know my first wish.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou raised a well threaded eyebrow. \"Already? Wow, okay, all you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you knew me, and Liam, you would know that we really have one major problem,\" he started, which gave you pause.  \"Zhham, I wish...<b> I wish that all of my intentional flirtations had the consequences I desired.\"</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mouth flew open. I well worded and intentioned wish with little room for interpretation. You held your fingers up, unsure of what would happen.  \"Granted,\" you boomed, and snapped them.</span></div></div>",

With a look of surprise, this strange mist pulled Riley's tongue from out of his mouth, he sat there, dumb founded, as the miasma covered his tongue, causing it to glow for a moment, then settle, looking no different.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRiley retracted his tongue, flicking it around for a moment, and then pulling on it.  \"Well Zhham, I don't feel any different.\" He stated after a moment.  \"How do I know it worked?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shrug. \"It worked, the magic's good.  Have fun man, I'm feelin' drained,\" You said after stretching, as the urn called you back within its walls. You sighed. The magic really did drain you, it seemed, as even doing what this form considered to be a simple spell made you feel tired. You laid on the pillow round mattress and stared at the ceiling.  This was a weird day.  There had got to be a way out of this contract, but you felt too exhausted at this moment to consider that possibility. After your eyes shut the third time, you quickly drifted to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Zhham!\"  You heard, jarring you awake.  You are unsure of how much time has passed, but you quickly jolt up, and the Urn of Remembrance feels it as well, forcing your form into smoke once again, and expelling it into the material plane once more. Your form once again filled up the room... but it wasn't the garage any longer.  You saw the familiar soft yellow light of your friend Riley's room, which you took up at least half off, still not having put on your upper top, with your new form's breasts sticking out forward, unconscious of gravity's influence. The room was moderately sized, having been part of the attic at one point, the strange sloped ceiling made fitting in this room as a giant strange. You nearly bumped your head on the ceiling fan.  In front of you, on his double bed, Riley looked up nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You called, Master?\" You complied, as the word master was forced from your mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yeah,\" Riley responded, fidgeting slightly. \"Are you always this smoky giant? Or can we... talk on my level?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pondered his game for a moment, and then complied, focusing as hard as you could, the feeling of having legs again.  The smoke that was your lower half began to solidify, and form itself into a pair of legs, featuring those harem pants that Cal so graciously provided for you.  From the window outside, it doesn't seem like too much time past.  You shifted your size with some effort to be normal human proportions, but still ended up being a giant still, about six and a half feet tall.  You conceded his request to get on his level, and sat in a cheap wooden chair he kept next to his bed from when the two of you would hang out and play video games on his old CRT television.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Master, has something upset you?\" You asked concerned for your friend,  most of you unsure quite how this magic thing worked. \"Did the spell have some unforeseen consequence?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRiley again shifted uneasily. \"No, no... it's not that. I've just been... too nervous to use it.\" He admitted. Unsurprising. The few times you've seen him attempt a flirt with a girl from school, he struck out hard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou understood. \"Ah, I see... You're looking for advise on how to talk to women then, Master?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRiley looked up from his hands and looked at you. \"No, not exactly... How should I phrase this...\" Riley, nervously, reached out and touched your knee from the sitting position.  \"*ahem*  Come here often?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou chuckled at the inane stupidity of his ancient pickup line, but then your face turned when you realized the implications.  Not only was it a flirtation, but it was a bad flirtation.  It couldn't possibly work on you, the djinn, right?  <i>You weren't so stupid that you forgot to protect yourself against this magic, were you?</i> A thought came up in the back of your mind, not your thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you fell, suddenly, deeply, madly in love with him. You feelings for your friend crashed through the barriers of your heterosexuality, and any perceived worry about ruining your friendship. You face turned bright red, and you attempted to hide your shame behind your hands for a moment, before regaining your composure.  He took this as a sign that his magic worked, and leaned back on the bed.  <i>You idiot.</i> The voice at the back of your head seethed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So... how do you feel?\" Riley asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I feel...\" You stammered. \"I feel... I feel fine, thank you for asking, Master.\" You stammered, enraptured with his voice, his body, his charms. You felt your nipples harden, you felt your nether regions grow moist and hot. You bit your supple lower lip as you opened your legs and relaxed your posture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"May I make a request, instead of a wish?\" Riley asked, putting a pillow over his legs to hide his growing erection. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, Master,\" You responded, leaning forward expectantly. \"Anything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRiley smirked slightly.  \"Dance for me, would you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smiled, using your magic on the request of your Master, the love of your life. Music began to fill the air of a baladi melody, but remixed into the new age as smoke surrounded you and the room expanded outward, creating ample floor space.  Your harem pants grew into a beaded skirt. You pulled the knowledge from a distant place in your mind, and began to dance and intense belly dance, bare chested as you were. Your torso pulsed, causing a pleasant jiggle in your chest, as you approached him from across the room, gyrating your pelvis as you did so.  You came face to face with him, attempting as much allure as you could muster, and his was enraptured. Then your belly dance translated itself into a lap dance, as you gently sat on his lap, throwing away his pillow in the process.  You got close enough to feel his hot breath on your neck and nearly toppled, if you were borrowing from such a trained background. Turning, you grabbed his hands and planted them on your chest. He squeezed, causing a slight gasp and an immediate wetness down below. You grinded against him, vehemently, moving your ass side to side, up and down, waiting in anticipation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe music resumed, and you turned.  \"Master, are you satisfied with your dance?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRiley nearly toppled, breathless, his face bright red and his erection obvious. \"Y-yes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well, Master,\" You said with a smirk, throwing off your skirt to revealed your full, bare form. In the same motion, Riley's clothes vanished from off his body. \"Then I have a request.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sat on the bed and grabbed his hand, using your new strength, you placed him above you, his eager face looking down at your brilliant, beautiful form.  \"I know I am being bold, Master,\" you whispered shyly. \"But I have a wish too... I want you to show me the depth of your love.\" You touched his handsome face, looking down at his brilliantly sculpted body and throbbing member.  You opened your legs.  \"Take me... Master,\" You pleaded.  \"It is my first time.\" You didn't lie, but you doubted it was this body's first time, from the way it moved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRiley nodded speechlessly, and complied. You grabbed his warm erected member and directed it into you.  Already aroused, it took but a moment to feel his heartbeat within you. You wrapped your legs around him and held him close, as he began his motion. Your body spasmed, hard, at every movement, barely holding on to scrutiny, you let him have his way with you, feeling the full depth of his affection.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, M-Master! Yes! Please!\" You shouted in your untraceable accent. \"Please fill me! I-I feel the breadth of your love! Oh!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe continued to thrust into you into as words could no longer hold you. You bit his neck and then felt your first female orgasm. It was power, your vagina tightened around his dick and you held him close as he continued to thrust. You made his movements more difficult as you let out a visceral, animalistic moan, his lips tenderly kissing your neck. You felt his eruption begin and your legs clenched tighter as a deep warmth filled you as Riley let out a satisfied moan, his spasming dick letting out inside of you. You prayed to Allah that his seed would plant itself deep within you, bearing you a beautiful genasi child and sealing your love. Riley did his utmost, but once spent, collapsed on top of you. You held him close to your bosom, the curse of flirtation holding you to his love for what could be forever if you would let it, and keeping him inside of you for as long as his endurance would allow.</span></div></div>",

You wanted to wake him, so that he would show you the breadth of his love once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Do you truly think this is love, you dense fool?</i> The voice spoke in the back of your head once again, this time louder, and more insistent. <i>\"You are under the effect a spell that you wove yourself, and yet you cannot realize it?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou ignored the nagging voice in the back of your head and held the warm body of Riley close. But this time, the voice only grew louder. <i>\"Oh no, I will not be silenced. I have lived thousands of years longer than you Liam, and while my echo only presides because of you... I have returned. That is the body I have crafted you are playing with, which you have let this... <b>youth</b> defile. I have laid with royalty and demigods. Never have I felt his humiliated.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blinked and stared at the ceiling, before your corporeal form melt away into smoke, leaving the snoozing Riley cold and alone in his own bed, and you were seemingly forced back into the Urn of Remembrance. You felt touched the soft, likely ancient carpeting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" You protested. \"Cal, was that you? I was with my love! Return me at once!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"No,\"</i> You heard a voice speak, once familiar to your own lips. <i>\"It was not the spirit of the urn. It was me. It was... you.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmoke gathered at your feet, the ancient oil lamps around the room darkened, and the mirror was brought before you.  You saw a reflection of you... but it actually you. It was yourself, it was Liam, freed from Zhham's form.  But it was behind you. Translucent, floating slightly above you, as if standing on some unseen platform.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have disappointed me, though I did not know what to expect for a child of mud,\" she scowled, wearing her face much better than you could. \"An absolute novice at best.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Zhham, I guess that's who you are? I never asked to be you, to be... combined with you, or whatever,\" you responded in your own familiar voice for the first time in what felt like a while. \"Cal just called me into the urn and filled me with you. I never wanted tits or to lose my dick, but here we are,\" You responded frustrated, crossing your arms. \"But if I have them, I am going to use them... to be with my love, as they are his preference.\" You were absolutely sure of your feelings, that they weren't some trick of magic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Love? Mud boy, you aren't in love,\" Zhham scoffed. \"You are ensorcelled by your own clumsy spell.\" She pulled the smoke from around your feet, and balled it up like a physical object. \"I will undo the spell from here.  If these feelings are true, they will remain.  I will make you immune to this wish from here and moving forward. Otherwise, I am doubtless that he will take advantage of your affection.\" She looked away, briefly, as if remembering something. \"They always do.\" She sneered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe began to manipulate the smoke, pulling shreds of lightning from its make, which fizzled in the air.

So, white of knuckles, you let her work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the practice of a trained seamstress, she pulled small fragments of magic out of what you could only believe was your essence.  Strands of electricity jumped off the round cloud within her hands, and you watched in awe at her speed and proficiency. Zhham pulled the pieces are spell out like unwanted skittles in a bowl of M&amp;M's. Finally, she reached her whole hand to within the cloud to about her shoulder. \"There you are,\" she muttered in triumph.  You felt sick to your stomach as she yanked, pulling a long strand of magic from within.  She manipulated it like taffy, tied off the end, and replaced it.  Clapping the cloud within her hands, it dissipated, and as it did, you felt immediate relief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So,\" she said, exasperated. \"How do you feel now, child of mud?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou searched your feelings as your best friend Riley Nept. You no longer had the deep, throbbing love that you felt for him deep within your chest.  There was still affection... and a little sexual confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I no longer want to jump in front of a car for him but... I still feel something,\" You said concerned.  \"Did you get all of it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smirked slightly. \"Yes, young one, the spell is broken.  Of this I am sure. However, you did spend a night of love and passion with him. These memories will not go away. The spell being unbroken will not undo the things you felt.  It will simply mean you are a slave to them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded, looking at your familiar face with a sense of longing.  \"Dammit Zhham,\" You conceded. \"I never wanted anything like this.  Riley and me had a good relationship, now, even if I get back to normal, and unbind with you somehow... I will always be confused about this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZhham, despite her haughty personality, put a spectral hand on your shoulder.  She wasn't actually behind you, this binding was something happening in your mind, you figured. \"While I am not a human, Liam, I understand these feelings.  I thought, many times before, they bound me with others.  People I thought I cared for. Those I would lay my life down for.  I have made many mistakes. It is a djinn's choice to conceive a child, you know,\" she offered.  \"Those feelings you felt, to bring a genasi, a half-djinn, half-mortal into the world... I envied them, even if they weren't true. I have never felt that way about any before. Not mortal, no demigod, not djinn. Hold tight to those feelings.  You may find them translate themselves into truth with time.  Otherwise, you may find yourself feeling similarly about someone else, with time.  It matters not.\" She leaned on your shoulder. \"For now, we are bound together. You have, inadvertently, returned me to the mortal realm. Before, I was in darkness, and I was alone. Then, Cal, spirit of the Urn, called me back using a small piece of me that was always attached to this place.  I am grateful to experience again.\" She looked at you somberly from her place behind you in the mirror. \"It was dark there, Liam, and I do not wish to go back.  In future, if you are going to grant a wish, feel free to call on me to advise you. I will do my part to make sure you are not ensorcelled by your own magic again. Do we have an accord?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded, still stuck on the passionate, graphic sex you had maybe a half hour before, with someone you considered to be a close personal friend. \"I think that deal's fair.  Then maybe... we can both try and find a way out of this deal?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZhham raised her eyebrows.  \"You're intent to leave, then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded.  \"Being you is actually kind of thrilling. Your strong, beautiful... and you have magic. But this is still servitude. This is still a prison. I have a life, and friends outside of here. I never wanted to be a djinn, even an especially hot one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZhham smirked, wrinkling her brown in confusion.  \"Hot?  I'm not a ifrit, a djinn of fire. I am a dao, a djinn of earth.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blinked. \"Uh.. I mean you are sexy... sexually attractive.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah!\" Zhham's eyes lit up. \"Understood, mud child.  Verbal slang! I haven't spoke to many for a while, you must forgive me.\" She lowered herself and put an arm around you, with her head on your shoulder. \"You are quite 'hot' yourself, you know, in an Alexander the Great kind of way. I am sure you will find many to bear your genasi... your uh... your mud spawn. Children.  You shall surely have a harem of your own some day, and rule the sands as a just and fair sultan. But you are right.\" She clenched a fist as she resumed her place above you. \"The Urn of Remembrance is a prison, and if we are to be free of it, we should come up with a plan. Cal will be awake soon, perhaps you can ask of them more questions, and we together can devise a strategy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded, and the spirit of Zhham entered into you again. The lights brightened, and you found you were Zhham again, peering at yourself in the mirror.  You were naked. You focused your energies and summoned a bath, full of perfumed salts, at the center of the room, and relaxed. You felt her presence with you still, telling you what the best smelling salts were, and her most favored ways of wearing her long, red hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou left the bath and redressed yourself, but decided to it your way.  Zhham insisted that you continue to wear the harem pants, but you dressed a bit more modern this time, in a black, stylish suitcoat with a deep cut v on your blouse, showing off Zhham's assets.  Your hair braided on its own, and finally two large hoop earring completed the repertoire.  You took one final look in the mirror. You looked good, as both sides of you mind attested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Hot,</i> you thought simultaneously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A few moments passed of silence, as you stared into the mirror, waiting for something to happen. You felt warm, you turned quickly to mirror and felt your new red pony tail whip you in the face.  You spat excess hair out of your gaping mouth, and explored the room.  There wasn't much to see, all things considered.  You bare feet touched the soft carpet, the room had a small bed, covered in cushions, and skins of strange purple beasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cal?\" You called, pensively, feeling out your strange new voice.  It was deep and smooth, very uncharacteristic of you. \"Are you... still here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilence was the only answered.  The plaques sat, hanging on the far wall, and a mirror were the most interesting parts of the room besides the colorful rugs and pillows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou took a moment to move over the mirror and examine your new form.  In terms of what you wanted to look like, this... new self. At least not mostly. You examined the washboard abs below your new robes, and flexed experimentally. You biceps BULGED. You had huge arms now.  You blinked, examining the rest of your features.  Your lips with full, and naturally red, your lashes long, and your new nose, sharp and pointed.  Your hair was bright red and long, with a pony tail tall on your head, pulling your hair tight to your head.  You felt that, and... other features.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou bit your lip, steeled your stomach, and looked down.  Two massive breasts were pointed outwards, several inches, covered with the thin vestment wrapped around you.  You dropped the vestment,  and revealed your browned body's pair of unreal breasts.  They weren't the largest you've seen, but they were unbelievably perky, pointing straight forward and outwards. You cupped your breasts and gave them a small squeeze, having never had female breasts before. The feeling was immense as your knees nearly buckled, and your lower regions became warm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-woah,\" You stammered.  \"That is... this is... unreal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt faint, and sat at the edge of the bed, fixated on your new chest, until your eyes dropped lower, to the poofy pants that sat on your new legs. Your ripped the band aid off, and pulled your pants down. The first obvious thing you noticed, is that your dick was completely gone, as were your pubes. As a matter of fact, you were hairless everywhere except your head, a pretty major change.  Your thighs were equally muscular and thicc, with a new natural gap between them. Your eyes flitted back to the missing piece. Your lithe new fingers touched the edges and you began to feel a sensation of want and desire, which erupted from the back of your mind.  You WANTED to be touched. As your fingers rubbed against your tight opening, you began to understand why. The feeling was immensely pleasurable. You gasped lightly, feeling a sudden moisture grow from within you, and your new vagina opened gladly to accept your soft hands rubbing against it.  You felt somewhat guilty, suddenly reasoning that this wasn't your body, but it seemed to push you forward, your excited bits loosening even further as an invitation.  Your fingers drummed, covering themselves with your vital fluids, and you began to writhe, getting your belly to insert your long fingers even further.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh... oh god...\" You breathed, your new voice turning you on further. \"Oh god oh GOD,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt the pleasure reach its peak as your fingers beat a rhythm against your slick insides, and you experienced an explosion of pleasure. Your moans escaped your mouth, and shot the pillows around across the room. You went slack, sweat coated, and flipped over, staring at the dark void that was this room's ceiling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou now understood your body and its wants and desires. You felt ready to go again almost a minute later, but you pulled your teenage mind back, and replaced your clothes.  You figured you main focus should be to get out of here, and bring this power with you so you could decide what to do with your new power.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour magic, this wish granting power, must have a way to give you your power. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm...\" You muttered, replacing your pants somewhat shamefully. \"I... I should make a wish.  Uh... I wish that I was out of this urn.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then snapped your fingers, and a magical spark appeared... but fizzled just as quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, so I can't grant my own wishes...\" You mused. \"That... sucks.  Maybe I can convince someone to wish for me...\"</span></div></div>",
