You're not...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, yes...I ran into someone who mentioned the great Overlord Zetta had been reverted into a book,\" smiled the young man, long brown hair down his back and wings like a dragon.

But I digress...you need a powerful demon to write wishes into your book to restore your Netherworld, correct?\" asked Tarus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't look that strong...but go ahead,\" said Zetta, opening up. Tarus took the talking book into his hands and held out a pen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Strange...why do I get the feeling he's hiding something?\" thought Pram.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does he write?</span></div></div>",
