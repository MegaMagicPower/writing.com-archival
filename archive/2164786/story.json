Something about that name was oddly familiar, but she gave little to no thought about it; at this point, her guts were stronger than her brain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she enters the restaurant, a nice soft jingle played in the background, only obscured by the sound of teenagers yelling and people talking on their sits. Nothing out of the ordinary for these kind of places.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe rushes to one of those electronic kiosks where people are gathered to make her order:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's see... two cheeseburgers, three sets of jumbo fries, two large sodas, ehm... f-five BigFox? Hmmm... maybe this is a little bit too much food, I'm really hungry, but I'm not sure I'll eat all of these.. two sets of chicken nuggets and a cesar salad\" She ended her train of thought with a bit of hesitation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe brought all the food to her table; it looked like she was waiting for some friends to show up to eat for her. It couldn't be farther from the truth. She couldn't wait to dig into the greasy warm food, but she'd look like a pig to the rest of the clients, they were already giving her some weird looks. But, red like a tomato and sweating like his boss, trying not to lose control of her own actions, she can't take it no more and starts to dig into the food. Stuffing burger after burger, helping it go down with the large soda and refilling her mouth with the jumbo fries. Moaning inbetween meals as she feels her stomach fill. She hadn't enjoyed eating that much in a very long time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was about to finish the meal when she was forced to stop by a sudden pressure on her gut; her uniform, it was at it's limit. Her now round belly was being restricted by the tight clothes she was wearing. She came to her senses, turning bright red. Her embarrassment was only fueled by a loud burp that came out of nowhere; and the worst thing, she still wasn't satisfied; she wanted to stuff her face with more food, break her dress and let her stomach spill out</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Haida splayed out on his couch with a sigh. He wasn\u2019t really sure where to begin with this. Just going to a restaurant, throwing himself into his fridge and pantry? That all seemed contradictory to getting in shape. All that stuff was bad for you, right? He turned his head to the TV to relax a bit. After a couple of hours, he was starting to forget the whole idea. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUltra Supplement Market dot com!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe booming voice of an ad jolted him out of indifference. He was paying close attention to the TV now. A shirtless lion with rippling muscles stood tall in the center of television screen, staring Haida down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHave you ever wanted to get into shape but didn\u2019t know where to start?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaida sat up now and leaned closer to the screen. This was the information he needed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHead over to Ultra Supplement Market dot com and find the vitamins and minerals you need to build up your new rockin\u2019 bod!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe camera panned from the lion to a fox that was just as built as the lion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBefore I went to Ultra Supplement Market dot com I was a lanky dork!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA \u201cbefore\u201d picture of the fox flashed on the screen. Haida gasps. That fox used to look almost exactly like him!  And yet that fox was before him now with a washboard stomach and huge biceps. Haida jumped from the couch and took off towards his room to grab his laptop before the commercial ended. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaida quickly started up his laptop and entered the address from the ad. Finding a page that was basically what the address described. A large marketplace of various nutritional powders, vitamins, and mineral capsules. What was he looking for? The fox on TV said something about bulking powders. Haida looked them up to find a lot of them. There were low carb and \u201cmeal replacement\u201d powders that were quite expensive. On the lower end of the price spectrum, there were mixtures of various vitamins and minerals that contained 3,000 calories per serving. This was closer to Haida\u2019s price range.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c3,000 calories\u2026 how many calories were you supposed to get in a day again? Probably less than that\u2026\u201d he thought aloud. \u201cAnd some of them come in flavors like vanilla or chocolate, but that doesn\u2019t seem right. Then again, this is in a fitness store. Eating 3,000 calories of a vitamin and mineral blend is probably different than 3,000 calories worth of microwave noodles.\u201d Satisfied with this justification, Haida placed an order. His order would arrive in two days, just in time for the weekend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next two days of work were uneventful. He came in, did his work, talked with Retsuko and Fenneko, then went home. He never discussed this plan with Fenneko in the meantime. And she just assumed that he had given up another plan to win Retsuko over without really trying once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Haida came home from work that Friday, a box was waiting for him. He cheered to himself and placed the box on the coffee table. Ripping it open to reveal it\u2019s contents, two huge plastic jars filled with the supplement powder. He wrapped his arms around one of the jars and took it to the kitchen. \u201cSo, if I\u2019m understanding correctly. I mix this into a shake to drink after meals. Then once I\u2019ve done this for awhile I start working out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a sizable takeout dinner, Haida returned to the powder in the kitchen. Making a shake as best he could, perhaps using more protein powder than the recommended serving size. Though the shake came out looking pretty sorry, Haida seemed to mostly get it right. \u201cHey, this is actually pretty good!\u201d the hyena said upon taking a sip. He quickly finished the shake up, and felt immensely full. \u201cWell, this might be easier than I thought.\u201d He slept easy after that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day was a typical Saturday for Haida, aside from fitting the shakes into his schedule. He hung out at home most of the time, as he didn\u2019t have a lot of friends outside work. Sunday was largely similar. Though Haida helped himself to an extra shake or two. Finding that they were actually really good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaida woke up on Monday morning, with the weekend having come and gone, he started to prepare for work and found himself having some difficulty with it. First, it took him a bit of going to get his shirt buttons done up. The bottom two just did not seem to want to go through the holes. But without thinking much on it, he sucked his gut in and managed to get buttoned up. Then the button on his pants gave Haida some trouble as well, but not quite as much as the shirt, all it took was a bit of gumption to get that. After a quick breakfast and an after breakfast protein shake, Haida went to the bathroom to brush his teeth and freshen up a bit before work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaida jumped back when he saw himself in the mirror. With a second chin and two soft cheeks staring back at him, it was impossible to ignore that he had gotten fat. He lloked down to see his softer belly hanging over the waistband of his pants and straining against his work shirt, he figured that he had to have gained at least 20 pounds. \u201cAlright\u2026 no big deal. Must be time to start hitting the gym. I\u2019ll just\u2026 get there after work.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Huff!* *Puff!* Haida ran for the train. Perspiration had pooled under his armpits and he found himself gasping to catch his breath while his heart pounded against his chest. But he caught his train at least. Even if it was more crowded than ever before and it wasn\u2019t a pleasant ride. In addition to being cramped, he could practically  feel the eyes of other passengers traveling over him. But Haida knew that this wasn\u2019t going to be the worst part of his work day. That would be getting through the day without Retsuko noticing that he had gained weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Crrrk* the office chair automatically lowered itself when it\u2019s occupants more burdensome weight filled the seat. Fenneko\u2019s laughter filled Haida\u2019s ears. He winced. \u201cWhat\u2019s\u2026 all this?\u201d she asked, clearly still bemused, making a motion as though she were going over the curve of a belly. \u201cI-I\u2019m working out! We talked about this!\u201d Fenneko blinked. \u201cYou\u2019re still doing that?\u201d Haida nodded, his second chin swaying. \u201cOf course\u2026 even if Retsuko doesn\u2019t notice me for the effort, I think I should still try and improve myself.\u201d Fenneko was clearly still amused, but listening. \u201cRight\u2026\u201d Haida continues. \u201cBut still\u2026 could you help me avoid Retsuko. You know, keep her occupied, maybe go somewhere else for lunch.\u201d Fenneko laughs again. \u201cI can try. But  I can\u2019t guarantee she won\u2019t notice all of you.\u201d Haida\u2019s fuller cheeks turned an indignant dark red. He couldn\u2019t find a comeback, so he shut up and started his work. Knowing that Fenneko meant it, even if she joked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the day went on, the plan was going well. Haida kept his distance, and he didn\u2019t run into Retsuko. He kept his head down and poured himself into his work so much that most of his other co-workers didn\u2019t notice either. However, he may have raised a few eyebrows at lunch. When Haida finished his meal and found that he was left unsatisfied, he remembered that he left the protein powder at home. He knew that maybe he should avoid it. But after taking in so many calories, his capacity had increased so much. Haida couldn\u2019t help but head for the vending machines and scrounge up a small fest of snacks. The glutting went surprisingly unnoticed, as everyone mostly kept to their own table. However Haida\u2019s overeating overburdened his already out stretched shirt and he found an oval of soft flab parting the space between two buttons and exposing itself. Haida hurried back to his desk, hoping that no one noticed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that being his only mishap, Haida was feeling pretty good as the end of the day approached. He kept an eye on the clock while finishing up his work and packing up.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He tried to ignore how tight his shirt was getting, and avoiding any contact with anyone as he left. He would die if anyone saw him like this especially Retsuko. He was sure that he would turn this pudgy form into a well-sculpted body... eventually. Lucky no one had seen him he had even evaded nosy Fenneko, thank goodness too he would never get past her if she saw him like this. All he had to do now was break towards the exit. Haida looked over his shoulder one more time to make sure he wasn't being followed, but as he did he ran into someone he noticed whoever it was was pretty soft before Haida bounced back and fell to the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh sorry sorry about that I didn't see you there\", a voice said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry about it I wasn't paying attention either\" Haida replied with. As Haida looked up to see who he had run into he saw a chubby polar bear standing above him. He was dressed in a fancy suit, so Haida wondered if he was one of the higher-ups here in the company. The polar bear offered his hand to Haida and gladly accepted it. \"Thanks, Haida,\" said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't mention it, my name's Shirota\" The polar bear with a smile extending his hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Haida\" Haida replied with shaking Shirota's hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the two shook Shirota's eyes gleaned down to Haida's torso and chuckled. \"Well I can see why you're in such a hurry,\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaida blushed realizing Shirota could see his belly fat poking out from his shirt. \"Oh! yeah!\" Haida didn't know what else to say, he was so embarrassed.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh sorry I didn't mean to make you feel bad,\" Shirota said. He then patted his belly, \"It all starts sneaking up on us eventually. I used to be an athlete when I was younger now look at me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaida smiled, appreciating that Shirota was trying to emphasize with him. Shirota seemed like a really laid back guy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey I got some spare clothes in my car I could let you borrow them so you don't have to walk home in that tight shirt.\" Shirota offered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, thanks... But-\" Haida said with concern in his voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah it's going to be a bit big for you, but you can just tuck it into your pants, no one will notice,\" Shirota said trying to calm Haida's nerves. \"Then maybe we could grab a  drink together?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh sure, yeah, I've got nothing better to do anyway,\" Haida said as he scratched the back of his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great!\" Shirota said excitedly<br>\r\n<br>\r\n****<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What! She airbrushed your photo to make you look more buff!\" Haida shouted. He was wearing Shirota's plaid shirt that he generously loaned to Haida. The two guys had gone to a local bar and were enjoying each other's company after they both had a long day at work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShirota chuckled. \"Yeah she can be so unbelievable at some times, but I know her heart is in the right place, she just wants to make sure I'm happy,\" Shirota said calmly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know but man is that messed up,\" Haida said crossing his arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah... but she's got her heart in the right place, she knows most girls would like a well-muscled sharp guy to go out with\" Shirota said scratching the back of his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Yeah\" Haida said as his ears flattened, thinking about how he started taking that bulking powder to be that image and now he was just chubby\" Haida took another big sip out of his beer trying to numb the pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey don't get so down Haida, I think any girl would be great to have you,\" Shirota said trying to make Haida feel better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaida smiled. \"Thanks\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We should go out again, I'm having a lot of fun,\" Shirota said with a smile.<br>\r\ner<br>\r\n\"Me too\" Haida replied with.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Shirota was an athlete, maybe he could tell him about the power that he bought to bulk up with. \"Hey Shirota\" Haida said getting the bear's attention as he was focused absorbing in the ambiance of the bar. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah what is it Haida?\" Shirota asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I bought from bulking powder, because I've been trying to impress this girl I like, and build some muscle....\" Haida took a big sigh before he continued on, \"but as you can see it hasn't been working out like how I expected it would. Sure I am getting bigger but obviously not the way I wanted to\" Haida admitted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShirota look puzzled, \"Have you been working out while taking the powder?\" He asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaida blushed and avoided making direct eye contact with Shirota. \"Ahhhh... no.....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well there's your problem, you can't just take bulking powder and expect to get buff instantly, bulking powder is meant to build mass while also going to the gym to build up muscle, if you just take the bulking powder.... well I guess you already know what happens, Shirota said as he poked Haida's small belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man I'm in idiot\" Haida said as he lowered his head in shame. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey don't treat yourself so hard, lots of guys make that same mistake, you just gotta learn from it, unless you wanna keep that belly\" Shirota said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What! Why the hell would I keep this!\" Haida said exasperated. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey some people are into that kinda thing you know\" Shirota calmly said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait really?!\" Haida said shocked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah there some people out there that are into that type of stuff seeing people get fatter,\" Shirota said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaida was speechless he wasn't sure what to make out of this, it seemed so strange that there were people out there that wanted to get fatter. \"That's pretty strange... Wait are you-!\" Haida said before cutting himself off realizing that he was starting to sound like a jerk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well not really... To be honest I put most of this weight on after I started playing sports, but it has made me a little curious, seeing that there are people out their that enjoy me a at a larger size, to be honest when I saw you today in that tight shirt I though you might be into getting bigger, I mean no one would be caught dead at work in that tight fitting shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaida felt like he should be freaking out right now but Shirota just had an aura of calmness around him that it put his mind at ease. \"Yeah I guess you're right but man I can't believe I put 20 pounds in a weekend.\" Haida admitted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Shirota said surprised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaida was surprised to see Shirota caught off guard by that, \"Oh is that not normal for a bulking powder?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not really how many calories are in that bulking powder?\" Shirota asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The container said 3,000\" Haida said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And how many are you having daily?\" Shirota asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At least two a day or more, they taste pretty good\" Haidas said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh man, not wonder why you put so much weight on so quickly\" Shirota said letting out a small laugh. Shirota then started giving Haida the proper usage of bulking powder how much to drink each day and when to use it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Fenneko had a feeling that neither did Retsuko.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis worried everyone even more, but there was nothing they could do.

He quitted his job as well, feeling that their was no reason for him to stay there after his crush had left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd now he was sitting out in the rain, his fur and clothes soaked to the bone, shivering in the cold, but he did not care. The only thoughts he had was of Retsuko. Where had she gone? What was she doing now? How was she sustaining herself?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe worry was driving him crazy.
