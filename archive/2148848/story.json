It must have just been the heat\u201d He says giggling slightly. \u201cMaybe some food would help, how about we go to your restaurant Mallow?\u201d Slightly confused, Mallow agrees to the idea, and the group begin to make their way to Mallows restaurant. Along the way, Ash begins acting slightly more femininely, walking with a slight sway to his hips. The girls notice this, though say nothing, assuming it\u2019s to do with the heat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe party arrive back into town, with Ash rushing up the stairs into the restaurant, swinging the doors open. \u201cWe\u2019re back!\u201d He says loudly, causing some odd looks from Mallow\u2019s parents. \u201cOh.. Okay, welcome back Ash?\u201d Says Mallows dad, as he continues to serve customers. \u201cHey Mallow, can you help out for a bit?\u201d As Mallow enters the kitchen, Ash follows her in, not finding it odd that he\u2019s doing this. \u201cUhmm, Ash what are you doing back here\u201d Mallow asks, tying her apron around her back. \u201cI just thought I\u2019d help out a bit, maybe you can show me what to do?\u201d Ash says smiling, which Mallow agrees to. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few hours, service has slowed down, and Lana and Lillie have gone home. Ash, now wearing one of Mallow\u2019s spare aprons, sits down at an empty table, happy with the work he has done. \u201cGee Mallow, that was great today, thanks for teaching me everything!\u201d Ash says with a smile, as he begins to play with his apron. \u201cIt\u2019s no problem Ash, but are you sure you\u2019re feeling okay? You\u2019ve been acting differently all day, you\u2019ve never wanted to cook before?\u201d Looking a little bit embarrassed, Ash stands up and begins taking off his apron. \u201cWell actually, I just wanted to get closer to you, I wanted to see what things were like in your life, I think you\u2019re a really nice, great person\u201d Blushing slightly and looking away from Ash, Mallow seems quite flustered. \u201cWell I-I mean if you felt that way then... I just had no idea... I mean, then of course I have no problem with that, I mean I-I think you\u2019re great too... I just... I...\u201d Mallow trails off, clearly embarrassed by the situation. \u201cI\u2019m sorry if I made you uncomfortable\u201d Ash says, moving over and hugging Mallow, which she awkwardly returns. \u201cI\u2019d hate to ask this Mallow, but it\u2019s quite late, and I\u2019m still feeling a little weak, do you think I could... Stay here tonight? I\u2019d really appreciate it\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlushing more than ever, Mallow doesn\u2019t know how to react. From her perspective, Ash has just confessed his feelings for her and is now asking to stay over with her, something she never would have thought of before. Although she has mixed feelings about the idea, Mallow decides to...</span></div></div>",

I don\u2019t want anything to happen to you on your walk home if you\u2019re not feeling well, so I suppose it should be okay\u201d Mallow says rubbing her head. Overjoyed with her answer, Ash quickly lifts her up in a hug again, squealing with almost feminine joy. \u201cOh thank you so much! We\u2019re going to have so much fun tonight, just you wait! It\u2019ll be just like a slumber party!\u201d Mallow returns the hug, though is highly confused by how Ash is acting, he seems so... girly? But she can\u2019t help but smile along with him, she always loved having slumber parties. Mallow goes into the next room to let her parents know that Ash is staying over, though they seem hesitant at first they relent, knowing that Ash is sick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pair make their way up to Mallows room, with Mallow being somewhat nervous about having Ash staying there with her. \u201cSo, uhmm, we can set up a sleeping bag here? If that\u2019s okay? Sorry, we don\u2019t really have a spare bed\u201d Mallow says, clearly quite awkwardly. \u201cThat\u2019s no problem at all!\u201d Ash says happily \u201cThis room is so cool, everything here is so cute! I love the decorations\u201d he says as he looks around the room, passing by her closet and looking at some of her pictures. \u201cI wish my room was like this\u201d Ash mutters, though Mallow is busy finding a sleeping bag for him and doesn\u2019t notice. Passing by a mirror, Ash gets a good look at himself, and isn\u2019t too happy with what he sees \u201cMan, these clothes sure are boring, and what is the matter with my hair\u201d he says, fidgeting in his outfit, and trying to straighten out his hair. He absentmindedly grabs a band off of Mallows desk, putting it around his wrist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy now Mallow has set up the sleeping bag, and is routing through her closet, pulling out a pair of her pyjamas. \u201cI\u2019ll go ahead and brush my teeth and get changed in the bathroom, you can feel free to change here\u201d Mallow says smiling. \u201cOh thank you, I\u2019ll make sure to do that!\u201d Ash says, still unhappy with his reflection.\u201dWait, she wants me to get changed? Does that mean...\u201d Ash thinks to himself, seeing that Mallows closet is still wide open. \u201cShe probably has some spare pyjamas here I can borrow, she pretty much said that I could\u201d He reasons with himself, misunderstanding what Mallow meant by \u201cchange\u201d. He quickly strips out of his own clothes, leaving his shorts, top and boxers in a neat pile. Pikachu, who had stayed in the room with him seemed confused by the entire situation, but was too tired to try to stop him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I wouldn\u2019t want to go commando in her pyjamas.\u201d Ash says to himself as he pulls out a tight pink, lace pair of panties with floral designs on them. Sliding them up his leg, naturally they\u2019re quite tight on him, though he shrugs it off. \u201cThese are so cute, I hope Mallow doesn\u2019t mind me wearing them\u201d he mutters, as he continues pulling out clothes. He finds a tight pair of pyjama shorts as well as a light pink tank top. He struggles to pull the tight shorts up his legs, finding them to be quite compressing on his crotch, though with the panties he was able to position his genitals in a way that would be the least uncomfortable. Sliding the tank top over his head, Ash returns to the mirror, this time he\u2019s much more comfortable in what he has on. \u201cWow, I can\u2019t believe how great I look in this\u201d he says striking a bit of a pose. \u201cI guess I\u2019ll just wait here until Mallows back\u201d he says as he sits down on her bed, finding it to be soft and comfortable. \u201cMan, I wish this could be my room\u201d Ash trails off, just as Mallow returns to the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey sorry I took so long I-... Ash... What are...\u201d Mallow says looking stunned, as she sees Ash sitting cross legged on her bed, wearing a pair of pyjamas nearly identical to what she is currently wearing now. \u201cWhy... How are... But those are-\u201c Mallow begins to say but Ash cuts her off \u201cI know they\u2019re yours, I don\u2019t know how I fit in them either. When you said I could get changed I thought you were joking at first, but here I am\u201d he says as he waves a hand over himself. \u201cThanks for letting me borrow these by the way, without my own pyjamas here I really appreciate it, plus they\u2019re super cute\u201d Ash finished with a wink. Trying to process all of this, Mallow simply sits down next to Ash, too lost for words. He puts an arm around her and rests his head on her shoulder. \u201cI\u2019m so lucky to have someone like you\u201d Ash says, causing Mallow to blush. \u201cWell I... I\u2019m happy you\u2019re here Ash\u201d she says, putting an arm around him. \u201cBut I didn\u2019t think you\u2019d wear my pyjamas to bed, I\u2019m glad you think they\u2019re cute, but aren\u2019t they a little girly for you?\u201d She asks, a little worried. \u201cWell they\u2019re girly, but I think they\u2019re really comfy, plus they\u2019re soft, and I quite like how tight they are. I like being in your pants\u201d Ash says with a smirk and a wink. This causes Mallow to blush even deeper than before \u201cUh I uhh uhmm.. I mean... Thank-thank you I think, yeah uh thanks uh Ash. I\u2019m glad you... Glad you like it, being in my pants that is. It\u2019s getting a bit late though, don\u2019t you think? Let\u2019s call it a night.\u201d Mallow says, untangling herself from Ash. \u201cI guess you\u2019re right, I just wish I could sleep up here, your bed is super comfy\u201d Ash says.as he climbs off, getting his sleeping bag ready. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he bends over, Mallow can\u2019t help but notice the top of her panties sticking out from the top of the shorts, causing her to blush further. \u201cHe\u2019s wearing my panties? What the heck is going on here\u201d Mallow asks herself, getting more and more weirded out by the situation. \u201cWell I guess I\u2019ll go to sleep now, have a great sleep Mallow\u201d Ash says as he leans up and gives her a peck on the cheek, melting her heart slightly. \u201cOh whatever, he can do what he wants\u201d Mallow thinks to herself, overjoyed by her new found relationship with Ash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning, the pair awaken at the same time, though Mallow could have sworn Ash always slept in late. \u201cGood morning Mallow! Hope you had a great sleep!\u201d Ash says, looking up at her sweetly. \u201cMorning Ash, I slept well thanks. Sorry to rush out, but we\u2019ve got to get ready for school, I\u2019m going to run in and shower\u201d Mallow says, quickly getting out of bed, and heading out the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Ash lays in his sleeping bag, he hears the shower turn on. He stands up and starts to stretch, loving the pyjamas he\u2019s currently wearing. He sees the discarded outfit that he wore yesterday and looks at it with disdain as he strips from Mallows pyjamas. As he reaches down to pick up his outfit, he stops for a second. If Mallow let him borrow her pyjamas, what about the rest of her clothes? Surely she would be alright with him wearing her regular outfit too, right?  Pondering on what to do, Ash knows he\u2019ll have to decide soon before Mallow returns.</span></div></div>",

Adjusting the bra straps so that it fits comfortably, Ash struggles into Mallows light red, sleeveless t-shirt. \u201cI really hope I don\u2019t stretch her clothes too much, they\u2019re so cute I don\u2019t want to damage them\u201d With the top in place, Ash begins to squeeze himself into her tight grey overalls. \u201cOh man I\u2019m going to look so cute in these, Mallow\u2019s going to love it\u201d he says as he adjusts the straps behind his back, finding that the shorts ride up his ass slightly, making it look much tighter, though there is a semi-noticeable bulge coming from him crotch. \u201cHopefully nobody notices that\u201d Ash thinks to himself, slightly disappointed. \u201cIf only I had Mallows figure, this would work out so much better, she really has a great body, I wish I could be more like her\u201d  Ash thinks to himself, absentmindedly tying his hair into very short ponytails. He slips on her socks and manages to fit his larger feet into her tiny shoes. \u201cThere, now I look perfect, I bet everyone will love my new outfit\u201d Ash says as he poses in the mirror, adjusting the too tight shorts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile in the bathroom, Mallow has finished up her shower, when she hears the door close to her front door. \u201cHuh, I wonder who that was...\u201d She returns to her room to find that Ash has gone, but his clothes are laid out on her bed, with a note beside them reading \u201cSorry to run Mallow, I forgot something at home, I\u2019ll meet you at school x,\u201d Blushing slightly upon finishing the note, Mallow turns to get changed, only to find that her outfit is missing as well as one of her bags, with her spare clothes being in the wash. \u201cI could have sworn I still had a pair in... Here...\u201d Mallow trails off as she remembers Ash\u2019s clothes on her bed. \u201cHe wouldn\u2019t be wearing them, would he? I know he wore my pyjamas, but this is ridiculous\u201d She says picking up Ash\u2019s clothes, causing his shard of the stone to fall out of the pocket. As she picks it up, her body glows once again, the stone reacting to her touch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn his way back to Kukui\u2019s house, Ash can\u2019t help but feel slightly self conscious, anybody he walks past seems to give him a funny look, eyeing him up and down before walking on. \u201cWhy is everyone acting so strange, maybe they just think I look really cute!\u201d Ash thinks to himself, with this new boost of confidence causing him to skip home. Upon returning home, he realises that Kukui must have already left for school, so he takes his time getting ready. He adjusts his hair in the mirror, finding it odd that he doesn\u2019t have any hair products available. Opening the bag he had borrowed from Mallow, Ash removes several other articles of clothing, namely her floral bikini, another pair of pyjamas, a dress he found in her closet, and several pairs of bras and panties. \u201cI\u2019m sure she won\u2019t even notice these are gone, she has such a big wardrobe. I should really get going though\u201d Ash says to himself realising the time. He sets off from the house at a run, loving the feeling of the breeze on his skin, and the tightness of his outfit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon arriving at the Pokemon school, Ash can hear some of the students giggling as he rushes by. \u201cMaybe he lost a bet?\u201d \u201cI think he looks cute\u201d \u201cThat would explain what Mallows wearing anyway\u201d he hears as he passes by some of the pupils. Upon entering the classroom, he sees all of his friends are gathered around Mallows desk, and they slowly turn to see him arrive, greeted to mixed reactions. Lillie let\u2019s out a shrill \u201cEep!\u201d As she sees the bulge in the front of his overalls, while Lana simply blushes and turns away. Kiawe and Sophocles however can hardly hold back their laughter. \u201cSo Ash, you\u2019re looking nice today\u201d Kiawe says, choking back a laugh. \u201cI didn\u2019t believe Mallow at first, but I\u2019m glad it\u2019s true\u201d Sophocles says, giggling slightly. \u201cWell thanks guys, I think I look pretty cute like this, it wouldn\u2019t have happened if I didn\u2019t sleep over with Mallow yesterday\u201d The pair go wide eyed upon hearing this \u201cWait... You stayed over at her house? Like, in the same room?\u201d Kiawe asks incredulously. \u201cWell yeah, where is Mallow anyway?\u201d Ash replies, pushing past his friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting at her usual desk, Ash finds Mallow dressed head to toe in his regular outfit. His blue and white shirt hangs loosely on her petite frame, his shorts are hardly staying on her though she seems to be managing. Her hair is pulled roughly through the back of his cap, and his oversized shoes are dangling off of her feet. Seeing the look on her face, Ash can clearly see that she\u2019s...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cOh hey there Ash, you\u2019re looking good today\u201d Mallow says as Ash walks over to her \u201cI hope you don\u2019t mind that I wore your clothes, you didn\u2019t leave me with much choice. Although, I gotta say I like them\u201d she finishes, admiring her outfit. \u201cWell I think you\u2019re looking pretty good yourself, those clothes really suit you\u201d Ash replies, causing both of them to blush. \u201cMaybe we could spend more time together later, how about we head down to the beach?\u201d Mallow says confidently, not usually one to take the initiative like this. \u201cWell how could I say no to that! Though I have a confession to make\u201d Ash lowers his voice to a whisper, \u201cI did borrow a few of your outfits, including one of your bikinis\u201d Ash says blushing. \u201cOh don\u2019t worry about that, I\u2019m sure you\u2019d look better in it than I would, though you\u2019ll have to loan me some of your clothes to make up for it\u201d Mallow says, sticking out her tongue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the pair continue to make their plans for the day, Kukui enters the classroom. \u201cGood morning class, I hope everyone is well\u201d  he pauses briefly seeing Ash and Mallow have swapped outfits \u201cAnd Ash I hope you\u2019re feeling better after yesterday, and I see yourself and Mallow had some fun playing dress up\u201d he jokes, causing the rest of the cast to snicker, while Ash and Mallow blush slightly. The class continues as normal, though Ash and Mallow find their minds wandering, thinking about how lucky they are, finding themselves somewhat jealous of the others lives. Neither had ever really considered it before, but they sermingly feel much more comfortable in each other\u2019s clothes, reasoning that they feel safe knowing they have something of the others around them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe class comes to a close, with the group leaving the school together, Kukui letting Ash know that he\u2019ll be home late tonight, and the rest of the group slowly head home themselves, leaving just Ash and Mallow. \u201cSo, how about this date to the beach?\u201d Ash says coyly, happy to be alone with Mallow. \u201cI know it\u2019s going to be so much fun, I wonder what sort of Pokemon we\u2019ll see there!\u201d Mallow replies \u201cTypical Mallow, always thinking about Pokemon\u201d Ash thinks to himself as the pair continue on. They eventually reach Ash\u2019s home, which is thankfully empty. The pair climb up to Ash\u2019s loft, with Mallow letting Ash go first, taking a good look at his butt as he goes. Routing through his closet, Ash pulls out a swim suit as well as the bikini he borrowed from Mallow. He holds out the bikini for her to take, though he seems reluctant to give it up. \u201cWhy are you giving me that Ash?\u201d She asks smiling \u201cYou\u2019re the one who took them, you\u2019re the one who has to wear it\u201d Ash tries to hide his joy as Mallow takes his swimming shorts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pair split off to separate rooms, as they begin to get changed. Ash changes out of Mallows clothes, discarding the underwear into a clothes hamper. He pulls the green bikini pants up his legs, finding them to be much tighter than he expected, leaving a rather large bulge in the front of the swim suit. He then fastens the top of the bikini around his chest, appreciating the support despite not having breasts, feeling more modest and covered. He exits to the room to find Mallow ready and waiting, though she has nothing covering her chest, her breasts hanging freely. \u201cM-Mallow! What are you doing! Why aren\u2019t you wearing a top!\u201d He covers his eyes, though he can feel a strain in his bikini as his penis becomes erect. \u201cWell by the looks of things, you\u2019re pretty happy to see me\u201d Mallow says flirtatiously, though on the inside she feels more jealous than anything, knowing she could never have that reaction to Ash. Ash on the other hand is having similar thoughts, he\u2019s jealous of Mallow\u2019s slim and feminine figure, wishing he had a body like hers and a pair of breasts to go with it. \u201cIf you really want I can put a top on, but I think we\u2019re both happier with me like this\u201d Mallow says as she pulls Ash into a hug, feeling his erection press into her leg, while Ash is happy for the embrace and to feel her breasts pressed against his chest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pair make their way to the beach in front of Ash and Kukui\u2019s home, holding hands as the chat with one another, finding that the have a lot more in common than they initially knew. Laying out their towels, Mallow offers to apply sunscreen to Ash\u2019s back which he happily accepts. \u201cMan, I\u2019m so lucky to have someone like Mallow here, I\u2019m the luckiest girl in the school\u201d he thinks to himself, not noticing his slip up. Mallow meanwhile is having the time of her life as she caresses Ash\u2019s muscular body, applying sunscreen wherever possible. After a while of relaxing, the pair have some fun in the sea together, splashing one another and playing with a beach ball. Anytime somebody passes by Mallow makes sure to duck under the water, while Ash makes sure that nobody can see his bulging bikini. The pair eventually decide to go back to Ash\u2019s house to change, the now wet bikini Ash\u2019s wearing clinging to his skin, drawing Mallow\u2019s attention to his ass once more, as well as the clearly visible bulge which has yet to diminish. Drying off, the pair prepare to change back, but while they prepare their outfits, the two stone shards fall onto the floor, which the pair pick up. Yet another glow passes over the couple, though as of yet nothing has changed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChanging into each other outfits once again, the pair settle down to watch a movie, with Ash cuddling up to Mallow affectionately. As the movie carries on, the pair eventually lean in and kiss. Mallow proves to be the more dominant of the two, as Ash allows her tongue to enter his mouth. This carries on for several minutes, with Mallows hand briefly brushing over the bulge in Ash\u2019s overalls, causing him to moan lightly. Ash stops them however \u201cI think it\u2019s a little soon for that, I\u2019m sorry Mallow\u201d he says, almost disappointed in himself. \u201cDon\u2019t worry Ash, you\u2019re right, we\u2019ve only been on one date\u201d the pair return to their movie, eventually falling asleep on each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they sleep, the light begins to take effect on the pair, and after an hour of rest they awaken to find...</span></div></div>",

Looking somewhat bemused, Lillie says \u201cAsh maybe this isn\u2019t a great idea, what if something goes wrong?\u201d Hearing this, Ash rolls his eyes, and as he does a smirk crosses his face as he briefly turns pink again, before reforming as Lillie. \u201cI really don\u2019t see what the problem is, I\u2019m just having a bit of fun. Look Lillie, we\u2019re twins!\u201d Ash says while sticking out his tongue. \u201cVery funny Ash, but I don\u2019t want you turning into me, it\u2019s too weird\u201d Lillie replies, looking quite upset. Seeing this Ash feels slightly guilty, \u201c What would Mallow do at a time like this\u201d Ash thinks to himself, as he accidentally turns into Mallow. Realising that he changed, Ash grins slightly as he runs up and hugs Lillie. \u201cOh Lillie don\u2019t be upset! Ash was just playing around! He won\u2019t turn into you anymore\u201d he says as he pulls Lillie in close.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis seems to calm Lillie down, as she relaxes slightly in Ash\u2019s arms, before she pulls away \u201cAsh! I can\u2019t believe you would do that! You clearly can\u2019t control yourself!\u201d She yells, furious at Ash\u2019s childishness. \u201cWhat do you mean I can\u2019t control myself! I know exactly what I\u2019m doing! Watch!\u201d As he says this, Ash rapidly changes his body, looking like Lana, Kiawe, Mallow, Lillie, Pikachu, Sophocles, Kukui, Lillie, Mallow and finally Lana again. \u201cJust because I want to have a bit of fun doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m not in control!\u201d Ash says as he reverts back to his own body, though he\u2019s still wearing Lana\u2019s outfit. \u201cSee?

Or worse, gets stuck as someone...

As he begins to approach the town, he realises that he should probably change how he looks, otherwise people might find it weird that Lillie is wearing his clothes and start asking him questions. Focusing briefly, Ash fades to pink slightly as he reforms his outfit, now wearing Lillie\u2019s regular clothes. He straightens out his skirt as he makes his way into town, slightly unstable in his boots. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaking his way through town, Ash is greeted by various people, many he didn\u2019t recognise. He tried his best to act like Lillie, though a lot of the time he would make an excuse to leave if anybody tried to chat with him. \u201cUgh, maybe this was a bad idea, Lillie\u2019s too well known around here\u201d Ash says to himself as he ducks into an alleyway. \u201cAnd this dress is far too girly for me, I can\u2019t stand it\u201d he says as he once again adjusts the skirt, finding that it blows around a lot as he walks around. \u201cHmm... If I stay as Lillie I\u2019ll have to deal with all of these people talking to me, Mallow\u2019s quite well known because of her family restaurant... Hmm... Oh! That\u2019s it!\u201d As Ash says this, his forms begins to shift again as he makes his way out of the alley.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStepping out from the alley, rather than Lillie is what appears to be Lana. Reasoning that Lana is usually quiet and shy, Ash decided to wander the town as her to see how he is treated. \u201cThis outfit is much easier to walk around in, though her one piece feels so strange, why can\u2019t she just wear normal underwear\u201d Ash mutters to himself as he heads down the street, trying to readjust the one piece that\u2019s beginning to ride up slightly. As he wanders around town, he finds that compared to Lillie, far fewer people try to chat with him. At one point he sees the real Lana with her family, but he narrowly avoids them by slipping down a side street. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting bored with just wandering through town, Ash decides to visit the beach for the rest of his afternoon. After making a quick stop at his and Kukui\u2019s house to pick up a towel, Ash makes his way to a more secluded area of the beach. After laying out his towel, Ash strips out of Lana\u2019s pants and top. Feeling somewhat exposed in nothing but a one piece, Ash runs down the beach and into the sea. As he dives in, he feels much more at home in the water than he ever has. He finds that the sensation of swimming in a girls body is much different than his own, as he feels a lot more buoyant and light. After relaxing in the water for a while, Ash dives under the surface.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRe-emerging a moment later is Mallow, wearing her green floral bikini. Looking over his new body, Ash smiles with a slight blush on his face. Being able to transform his body at will seemed to amuse Ash more than he could ever imagine. He floats around for a little while, feeling a little less comfortable in the water than he did as Lana. Eventually he makes his way out of the water and back to his towel, wringing out his hair as he goes, as it hangs down his back. As he lays out relaxing, Ash starts to get quite tired. \u201cHuh, I guess transforming so many times takes it out of me\u201d he thinks to himself. \u201cI\u2019m still in control though, Lillie was worried for no reason\u201d he says to himself as he starts to close his eyes out of tiredness. As he does however, from behind him he hears \u201cAsh Ketchum how dare you!\u201d Bolting upright, he sees Lillie storming towards him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI knew you couldn\u2019t handle this! You promised you wouldn\u2019t turn into me anymore, and now look at you! I saw you change earlier, but twice? And not only that, but you\u2019re in my bikini as well!\u201d Confused, Ash looks down and sees that he is in fact in Lillie\u2019s body again, wearing nothing but Lillie\u2019s white bikini. \u201cHow did.. It must have been when I thought about her...\u201d Ash thinks to himself, feeling quite embarrassed. \u201cLillie it\u2019s not what it looks like! I was falling asleep and I thought about how I proved you wrong, but thinking about you turned me into you! I promise I didn\u2019t mean to-\u201c before he can finish Lillie cuts him off \u201cExactly! You didn\u2019t mean to! You can\u2019t control this, I told you!\u201d Somewhat annoyed, Ash turns back into himself, though still wearing Lillie\u2019s bikini. \u201cLook I can change back, I\u2019m just tired!\u201d He says, though he recoils when he realises he\u2019s wearing a bikini. \u201cI can fix this!\u201d Ash focused again to change his clothes, this time though he ended up in Mallow\u2019s bikini. Puzzled, but feeling exhausted, he tries again. His first attempt leaves him wearing Mallow\u2019s regular outfit, which is highly restrictive on him. Next, he ends up wearing Lillie\u2019s dress, showing off his hairy legs. After several more attempts, he ends up with Lillie\u2019s body and his own outfit. \u201cS..See Lillie? I... I can control it\u201d Ash says, on the verge of collapsing. Seeing that Ash is in pain, Lillie helps to steady him. \u201cAsh I know you\u2019re trying, but that\u2019s my body, not yours.\u201d Looking over himself, Ash realises what she said is true. \u201cYou\u2019re right... Yeah... I\u2019ll fix it\u201d After focusing one more time, Ash feels his body start to transform, as he passes out from exhaustion.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As Ash was laid out on his towel unconscious, Lillie paced back and forth panicking. \"This is all my fault, I pushed him too far, oh I hope he's okay... What if he never wakes up, what if he can't transform again!\" As she continued to worry, Ash began to stir. Seeing this, Lillie ran to his side. \"Ash! You're awake! I'm so, so sorry. Are you feeling okay?\" She asked hurriedly. Rubbing his eyes, Ash tried to stand up, but found he was too weak. \"Don't worry Lillie, it was my fault, I went too far with my transformations\" Ash says, though his voice sounded a little odd, almost like Mallow's. Relieved that he was awake, Lillie gave Ash a bit of space while he recovered. \"Ash I don't want to worry you, but you may want to take a look at yourself\" she says as she hands Ash her mirror. Taking the mirror, Ash begins to look himself over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at the reflection of his face, it seems that it is his own, though upon further investigation, he can see that he has Mallow's hair on top. Looking across the rest of his body, he found that he was wearing Lillie's outfit, which caused him to sigh, as it was his least favorite of the outfits he had worn that day. His torso was undeniably feminine, and based on the slight tan that he had, he guessed that it was Lana's. His lower body seemed to be his own however, though thankfully it seemed as though he had one of the girls body hair, as his legs were hairless. Freaking out slightly, Ash manages to climb unsteadily to his feet with the help of Lillie. \"I don't want to rush you, but do you think you can change back?\" Lillie asks, helping Ash to keep his balance. Ash concentrates briefly, his body turns pink, but no changes occur. \"Sorry Lillie, I think I need more rest\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the pair slowly made their way back up the beach, Ash couldn't help but feel a twinge of discomfort in Lillie's panties. \"Great\" Ash thought to himself \"At least I still have my penis\" As they approached Ash's home, he made them both stop. \"Wait, Lillie I don't want to be seen like this! I would be in so much trouble with Kukui... Could I stay at your house or something? We can just pretend I'm Mallow!\" Ash says hopefully. Thinking on it, Lillie eventually agrees, still feeling somewhat guilty about pushing Ash too far. \"Alright Ash, but what about your clothes? Won't Hobbes be confused?\" Thinking on it, the pair leave a note for Kukui to tell him that Ash is staying out training for the night to excuse his absence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pair make their way through town and over to Lillie's house just as the sun is starting to set. As they arrive, Hobbes welcomes them, though as it's dark, he doesn't get a good luck at Ash's face. \"Good evening Ms. Lillie and Ms. Mallow, will you be staying with us this evening Mallow?\" Hobbes asks to Ash. \"Uhmm.. Y-yes I will\" He says, trying to avert his gaze. \"Very well, I shall prepare the usual set up in your room Ms. Lillie, might I ask though, why are you wearing Ms. Lillie's clothes?\" Panicking slightly, Ash quickly says that he had fallen during school and he got covered in mud, so Lillie gave him a spare outfit. Not one to ask too many questions, Hobbes nodded and left the \"girls\" in the entryway to set up a bed for Ash. \"Thanks for this Lillie, I don't want to have to deal with Kukui while looking like this\" Ash says smiling, as the pair begin to go upstairs. \"No problem Ash, I'm just glad you're okay.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey make their way to Lillie's room, where they find that Hobbes has set up a bed for \"Mallow\" to sleep in. \"Hey Ash, you might need some pajamas, you can borrow a pair of mine I guess\" Lillie says with a slight blush. \"Well usually I would just sleep in my boxers, though I guess I don't have any with me\" he says laughing. He begins to go to the bathroom to change, but Lillie stops him. \"You don't really need to leave you know, you've got a girls body\" she says with a smirk. Blushing slightly, Ash turns away. \"Well actually I... I still have my uhmm... Y'know... So I wouldn't feel comfortable changing in front of you\" he says. Hearing this, Lillie blushes while stifling a laugh. \"Oh right, well go ahead then\" she says, as she gets her own pajamas together. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he enters the bathroom, Ash starts to strip out of the dress he was wearing, leaving him in Lillie's bra and panties. \"Ugh I really hope I can change back tomorrow, I don't want to be stuck like this...\" After re positioning his penis to reduce the discomfort he was feeling, Ash begins dressing in the pajamas he was given. As he still had his own legs, the pajama pants he was given were quite tight. He then slipped on the tank top he was given to sleep in, which was quite loose on Lana's somewhat smaller torso. Sneaking back to Lillie's room to avoid Hobbes, Ash closes the door behind him, finding that Lillie has already changed, wearing similar pajamas. \"Thanks again for this Lillie, but I think I'm going to try and get to sleep as soon as possible, the sooner I can change back the better\" Ash says, climbing into bed. Looking a little sad, Lillie sighs but agrees. \"That's fair, I don't want you to be uncomfortable\" Feeling slightly bad for Lillie, Ash instead sits up. \"Hey Lillie, did I ever tell you about the Kalos League?\" Perking up slightly, Lillie and Ash spend a few hours talking into the night. Hobbes brings up some hot chocolate at one point, where Ash nearly forgot he was pretending to be Mallow, so Lillie threw a pillow at his face to hide his features.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while, the pair started to fall asleep, hoping that Ash would be able to change back in the morning.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Waking up the next morning, Ash looked around in confusion before the events of the previous day came flooding back to him. \u201cOf course, how could I forget\u201d Ash says to himself, letting out a sigh. He pulls off the bedsheets, revealing his feminine body, as well as his very evident morning wood. \u201cOh great\u201d he thinks to himself. \u201cI just wish I didn\u2019t have to deal with this now too, how can I pretend to be Mallow with this sticking out\u201d. As he thinks through his options, he notices his skin briefly turn pink, before fading. Looking over himself, he realised that his entire body had changed into Mallows! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpringing out of bed, Ash runs over to Lillie, shaking her awake. \u201cLillie! Lillie! It worked! I can transform again!\u201d Ash exclaims. \u201cThis is great! I can head back home now!\u201d Rubbing her eyes, Lillie sits up with a smile on her face. \u201cThat\u2019s great Ash! But you can\u2019t change back until you leave, Hobbes thinks that Mallow stayed over\u201d. \u201cYeah I know, but at least I have the option to\u201d he says. \u201cI appreciate everything you did, but if you don\u2019t mind I\u2019m going to go home. Can I borrow some clothes for now?\u201d Sitting upright, Lillie frowns. \u201cThat\u2019s fine, but when you change back after leaving, what will happen to them? Maybe you\u2019d be better off just stripping and morphing a set onto your body\u201d Thinking it through, Ash reluctantly agrees. He strips out of the pyjamas that Lillie gave him, blushing slightly at the sight of Mallow in her underwear, before he focuses and causes a dress identical to Lillie\u2019s to appear. He thanks Lillie again for letting him stay before sneaking out of the house. He manages to avoid running into Hobbes on his way out, and leaves the estate. When he is certain that he\u2019s out of sight of the house, Ash focuses briefly as his clothes transform, this time into Mallows regular outfit. \u201cJust because of what happened yesterday doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m never going to transform again, I\u2019ll just make sure to be careful... and make sure that Lillie isn\u2019t around\u201d He thinks to himself, as he happily skips back towards his house, his long green hair bouncing as he does so. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAvoiding going through the town, Ash arrives back home, and notices that none of the lights are on. Cautiously, he finds the spare key Kukui leaves out for him, hoping that nobody catches \u201cMallow\u201d sneaking into their house. Unlocking the door, he makes his way inside, listening out for Kukui in case he had to rapidly change back. Not hearing anything, Ash relaxes slightly, noticing that there was a note on the counter, which read \u201cHey Ash, sorry for not telling you in person but I had to make a trip to Akala island until next week. There\u2019s food here for you, and if you need anything just call. -Kukui\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter reading the note, Ash let\u2019s out a feminine squeal of glee. \u201cWhat are the chances the Kukui would be gone the day after I start to randomly transform! Now I have all of the freedom I need to play around with this!\u201d As he starts to think about what to do, he realises that he skipped breakfast. \u201cBut that can wait I guess\u201d he giggles to himself in Mallows voice. Rummaging through the fridge, he pulls out a variety of ingredients, things he would have never thought to use. Seemingly on auto-pilot, he prepares a huge meal for himself, despite never really cooking for himself in the past. Finishing up, he collapses onto the couch, completely full. \u201cMan that was good, I can\u2019t believe I made something so tasty. I wonder if... Is it because I\u2019m in Mallows body? Hmm... Well when I was in Lana\u2019s I was much more comfortable swimming... Well, if that\u2019s the case this just got a whole lot more fun!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the rest of the afternoon, Ash spent his time sitting around the house planning out the rest of his week and transforming into various people. He knew that he would use Mallow\u2019s body whenever he wanted to cook, but the rest of the time he could do anything he wanted. With the amount of time he had spent travelling the world, he had met and he knew so many girls that even with a week to himself he could never get through all of them all. \u201cRight!\u201d He said to himself, currently pacing through the living room in his friend Serena\u2019s body. \u201cIf I\u2019m going to have some fun, I can\u2019t stay here all week. I can go out into town in any body I want, I can even meet up with the others as someone they\u2019ve never met before! And there\u2019s no way Lillie can be suspicious if I don\u2019t the into one of our friends, she\u2019ll never know!\u201d Deciding on his new plan, Ash gets ready to leave as Serena, ready to have some fun.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cWell, here goes nothing!\u201d Ash says to himself as he makes his way outside. Currently Ash decided to explore the town wearing Serena\u2019s body, knowing that nobody would stop to talk to him like when he was turned into Lillie. \u201cMan, how does Serena put up with this dress? It\u2019s so short it feels like I\u2019m going to flash somebody at this rate!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he leaves the house, he takes in a deep breath, and steps out the door. \u201cAlright, nobody here knows Serena. I\u2019ve got nothing to worry about\u201d he tells himself. \u201cEven if somebody does talk to me, I know her well enough to pull off pretending to be her\u201d. Making his way up the hill into town, he can feel the dress swishing around him, and notices how naturally his hips are swaying. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nArriving in Iki town, Ash finds that the town is oddly quiet. Compared to the previous day when he was being stopped constantly, very few people were out and about, and even fewer even regarded him. \u201cWell, at least I don\u2019t have to worry about being spoken to\u201d Ash thinks to himself, almost disappointed. Wandering through some of the market stalls, Ash comes across a woman selling clothes. He perks up after seeing them, and decides to look around. Running his hands across a number of the dresses to check their materials, and considering buying a few, he realises that Serena\u2019s fashion sense is kicking in. \u201cHmm... If I give into this then I\u2019ll end up spending my own money... Well... I could always just try one or two on\u201d Ash thinks to himself, before blushing, realising he would have to strip to do so. \u201cI don\u2019t really want to invade Serena\u2019s privacy like that... But if her personality is making me want to do this, then she would want to try these on, then I guess that it would be fine... Screw it, why not?\u201d He says to himself, as he grabs several different dresses, a black one-piece swimsuit and several playsuits and walks into a nearby changing room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStepping into his own changing room, Ash pulls the curtain across and begins to strip. After taking off Serena\u2019s jacket and unbuttoning her dress, he finds himself looking at Serena in nothing but a bra and panties. Blushing profusely, he can\u2019t help but turn his body, checking out his entire body in the mirror, before snapping himself out of it. \u201cRight... Right... Back to trying on outfits...\u201d he tells himself, his eyes constantly wandering back to the mirror. \u201cThere\u2019ll be plenty of time for this later, now focus\u201d. He then spends the next half hour or so trying on various dresses and other outfits, finding a few that he really like, several that were quite slutty and could only have ever imagined Serena wearing them. \u201cOn the bright side of all of this, I can probably transform my clothes into any of these outfits later\u201d he says to himself, as he checks out Serena\u2019s ass in a pair of skin tight leather pants, topped off by a very revealing tube top and black heels.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRemoving that outfit, Ash moves onto the final piece of clothing, the black swimsuit. \u201cI guess I have to get naked for this one\u201d He says, blushing again. Trying his best not to look, though failing quite badly, Ash begins to work the one piece up his body. Having worked the tight fitting material up his body, adjusting the straps and adjusting his breasts, Ash\u2019s jaw dropped as he got a good look at Serena in the outfit. The sides of the one piece were non existent, which showed off Serena\u2019s curvy body. The material was skin tight, which left absolutely nothing to the imagination, particularly highlighting his breasts and ass, which he couldn\u2019t help but squeeze, sending chills up his body. The straps of the one piece crossed at the neck and left the top of his back open, which Ash found quite sexy. The leg holes were quite high rising, which left almost all of his thighs on show. He knew that if he still had his own equipment, he would be hard right now. He briefly felt a tingle in his crotch as that thought went through his head and could see the front of the one piece bulge out slightly, though he focused before things got out of hand and the bulge went away. \u201cOkay, I\u2019ve got to be a bit more focused with things like that\u201d he says to himself, as he checks out his body from every angle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling like he had spent long enough in the stall, he decided he would leave before he went on another Serena inspired shopping spree. He returned each of the outfits to the stall owner, though he had been highly tempted to buy the one piece, he had resisted. \u201cAlright that\u2019s one downside of wandering as a girl, their personalities can take over slightly. Though I can\u2019t say I\u2019m upset, that was a great experience.\u201d He says to himself. \u201cI should use my time and turn into someone else now, that was the idea.\u201d Thinking about who to change into next, his stomach starts to growl quite loudly. \u201cI guess I spent too long in the changing room, I\u2019ll head over to Mallows restaurant for now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he approaches the restaurant, he decides that now would be the best time to change his body. Ducking into a side alley, he starts to think about who to change into. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t turn into any of my Alolan friends... May is always an option, she loves eating in fancy restaurants, and she has an appetite as big as mine... Dawn is an option, though I couldn\u2019t imagine wearing a skirt that short... Yet.\u201d He says with a grin on Serena\u2019s face. \u201cIris... Nah, not the time. Misty... Maybe, but I\u2019d prefer to do something aquatic with her body, plus Mallow met her... I suppose May it is! See you later Serena, you were great while you lasted!\u201d He says to himself as his body turns pink, before reforming as May. Looking over himself, he can\u2019t help but smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe always liked May, and loved how she dressed. Though at the moment, he wasn\u2019t a fan of how tight the biker shorts were that he had on, and he had the sneaking supsicion that he was wearing a thong. He chose to wear her original outfit rather than the outfit she wore to the Wallace Cup, and had forgotten how tight it was on her. His breasts were being heavily accentuated by the tight red top, and the shortness of her top and shorts really showed off a lot of skin. \u201cOh well\u201d he says in her melodic voice. \u201cI chose May, and I\u2019m not going back on it now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaking his way out of the alley, Ash adjust his tight biker shorts as he walks toward Mallows restaurant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Somewhat nervously, Ash makes his way up the steps and into the restaurant, glancing around in the hopes that Mallow wouldn\u2019t be working today. Unfortunately for him, she was the one who greeted him. \u201cHello ma\u2019am, my name is Mallow and I\u2019ll be your server today\u201d she says with a smile. \u201cYou don\u2019t look familiar, first time in Alola?\u201d She says as she leads Ash to his table. \u201cOh uhmm... Yep! I\u2019m just here for a day or two, I thought I\u2019d try some of the local food\u201d he replies with a nervous laugh. Taking a seat at the table, he smooths out Mays micro skirt, adjusting the bike shorts again and as he does, he feels Mays thong slide between his cheeks, making him shudder. \u201cOoh, okay I\u2019ll need to remember about that. That felt... weird, but almost... nice\u201d he thinks to himself, not sure what to make of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlacing his order, Ash realises he needs to use the toilet. He makes his way from the table and walks to the restroom. Realising he has to use the women\u2019s bathroom, the situation dawns on him, he\u2019s never used the toilet as a girl, which causes him to blush at the thought. He enters one of the stalls and pulls down his biker shorts and the thong. Not really sure what to do, he relaxes his body, and eventually nature takes its course. Blushing again, he cleans himself up and pulls the thong and shorts back up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nExiting the stall, he washes his hands and checks himself out in the mirror. He straightens out his bandana, adjusts his hair and can\u2019t help but check out his body. While not a fan of wearing them, his bike shorts did a great job at showing off his ass, which after travelling around several regions and years of cycling had become well toned and firm, which he confirmed by giving it a squeeze. His breast were also much bigger than anyone he had spent time as before, and he couldn\u2019t help but jiggle them, which proved to be quite the handful. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nReturning back to the main room, he found that his food had arrived. Sitting back down he realises how hungry he is, and Mays love of exotic food really kicked in as he didn\u2019t leave a single scrap. \u201cAhh... I\u2019ve eaten here before, but that was the nicest food I\u2019ve ever had\u201d he thinks to himself. Mallow soon comes back over to collect his plates, amazed that somebody so thin could put away so much food. Blushing slightly, Ash simply thanks her and pays the bill. Before he can leave, Mallow recommends a few places for him to visit as a \u201ctourist\u201d, most of which he had already visited, though she also recommended a day spa, several shops he had never heard of and a boutique in town. Thanking Mallow, he leaves the restaurant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMan, that wasn\u2019t nearly as awkward as I thought it would be. I have to admit, I\u2019m very tempted to try out that spa, but maybe not today, I\u2019ve got all week\u201d he says to himself as he stretches. \u201cIt\u2019s probably just Mays personality, but I feel like I need to go for a jog or something to work off this food, I never realised how into exercise May was.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeciding that his his best route would be the coastal road to the school, he sets off jogging, loving the feeling of the wind blowing through his hair. He can\u2019t help but notice how much his breasts are bouncing, which he finds quite distracting. What he found most interesting was how little he was tiring out, by now he would have had to take a break if he was in his own body, but May\u2019s body was doing fine, though he was working up a bit of a sweat. Reaching the school, he decides to run along the beach on his way back home, which is a lot more peaceful. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nArriving back home, he decides to do some cooldown stretches, and can\u2019t help but check out his body again. Somewhat bothered by the sweat he had worked up, he decides to take a bath. He runs himself a bath, as he strips out of Mays outfit, blushing at the sight of himself in a black thong and matching bra. Removing the last of his clothes, he can\u2019t help but look himself over. Not being supported by a bra, his breasts feel a lot heavier. He finds that May is cleanly shaven all over her body, and that her ass really is toned and incredibly tight, which he can\u2019t help but grope. \u201cI know that I should respect Mays privacy, but damn does she have a nice body.\u201d Ash thinks to himself, as he slips into the bath. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile in there, he can\u2019t help but get carried away and starts playing with himself, which leads to him understanding a girls body more than he ever thought he could. After a while he does get bored, and plays with his power again for a while. At one point he transforms his body so that he has his own penis, which he can\u2019t help but laugh at the sight of before turning back. He then decides to transform his head back to normal, which he found looked ridiculous on Mays feminine body. Eventually he transforms his head back into hers, and just relaxes before he decides to get out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClimbing out of the bath, he wraps a towel around himself, one around the torso, and another around his hair, finding it difficult to wrap as he has never had to deal with that much hair. He dries off before he goes to pick out a pair of pyjamas as it had gotten late and he didn\u2019t plan on leaving the house again. Looking through his clothes, he realises none of them are likely to fit Mays body, so he shrugs, and transforms some pyjamas onto himself, the same set that he had seen her wear during the Wallace Cup. He makes himself a hot chocolate and settles down on the couch for the night, finding himself watching some romantic movie he normally wouldn\u2019t watch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually he finds that he\u2019s too tired to stay up any longer, and decides to go to bed. He climbs into his bed, happy with how he spent his first day alone. He can\u2019t help but rub his breasts again, before he drifts off to sleep.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Waking up the next morning, Ash is briefly confused as his eyes are covered by some very soft, long brown hair before he remembers the previous night and how he decided to go to sleep while looking like May. \u201cThat would explain my dreams\u201d he thinks to himself while rubbing his eyes. \u201cI\u2019ve never dreamt about being a coordinator before, but that seemed like all I could dream about... Though it did remind me of something I wanted to do at one point.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClimbing out of bed, he gets together a bowl of cereal and sits down on the sofa with his legs crossed under him. \u201cI haven\u2019t fully decided what I want to do today, if I were to visit the spa that would take up a bit of time, but do I really want to spend my day there? I\u2019m sure if I turned into someone else their personality might push me towards it, but I\u2019m not being pushed by Mays to go\u201d he gets up a few minutes later, cleans his bowl and proceeds to move aside the table that was in the living room, and sets up a camera to record. Smirking to himself, he focuses briefly as his body turns pink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello there ladies and gentlemen! Tonight we have a special treat: a special fashion show made up of girls that Ash has gotten to know over the years.\u201d The person making this announcement is of course Ash, though the body is very much not his own. Standing in front of the camera is the super model and gym leader Elesa, in her standard high heels, leather leggings and yellow and black dress. \u201cI\u2019ll start things off today for us with a demonstration\u201d Ash says to the camera with a wink, as he proceeds to carry out what can only be considered a professional level catwalk, using Elesa\u2019s modelling skills to walk perfectly in her heels, as well as strike a number of poses, showing off her body and looking as sexy as possible. Carrying this out gave Ash an idea of how he should act when he turns into the other girls, which he rapidly proceeds to do after he\u2019s happy with Elesa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis first choice is Misty in her original outfit, though as she\u2019s not as confident about her body and is quite tomboyish, the act looks as if she was quite nervous, which Ash found quite endearing. Next up was May dressed in her contest outfit, he tried to make this show more themed towards the Arabic style of the outfit, making sure to shake his hips as much possible, and show off her toned ass. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was followed up by Dawn, where he used a variety of her outfits. He started with her regular outfit, acting playful and flirty towards the camera, and purposefully flashed her panties. He then changed her outfit to her cheerleader costume, and performed a short routine that ended in the splits, something he never thought he could do. After several of her costume dresses were shown off, he transformed into Iris. He tried to make this walk seem as wild as possible, spinning and dancing his way toward the camera, then pulling some faces. \u201cWho\u2019s the kid now\u201d he giggles to himself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFollowing his act as Iris, Ash carries on with his mini fashion show for quite a while before switching off the camera, though he\u2019s wearing Lillie\u2019s body in her white bikini. \u201cOof, I\u2019m tired out after all of that, I need to remember to limit my transformations\u201d he says as he adjusts the string of his bikini. \u201cIf Lillie were to call in right now I\u2019d be in so much trouble, she\u2019d probably never forgive me!\u201d He says with a laugh. \u201cI think I\u2019ll rest up for a bit before I head out, though I should change out of this bikini first, and there\u2019s no way I want to wear her regular outfit, I\u2019ve had enough of that dress for now\u201d focusing again, his body turns pink as it reforms into Iris\u2019s.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI figure if I\u2019m going to relax for a while, it should be in some comfortable clothes\u201d Ash reasons. \u201cThis top is light and airy, and her skirt is little more than an accessory.And these leggings are surprisingly comfy, despite how tight they are.\u201d He says, rubbing his hands over his legging encased legs. While sitting around, he found that he was becoming increasingly fidgety, it felt like he couldn\u2019t sit still or he would go mad. \u201cOf course, Iris loves exploring... Why couldn\u2019t I just relax in peace\u201d He stands up offf the sofa, grabs the key and heads outside, deciding he would go for a walk. He finds that although he\u2019s enjoying his time as other people, it\u2019s not as fun enjoying it on his own. He needed to find someone to make friends with when he was someone else, which is when he started planning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had already spent time with Mallow, although briefly while he was wearing May\u2019s body, so why not meet up with his other friends and pretend to be a tourist? He decided on choosing a former travelling companion as he felt he knew how they would act the best. If he could fool Mallow, he could probably fool them too, right? Though the issue came with who he would choose. May could work, though he told Mallow he was leaving today. They had met Misty, so they would know he and her were friends which ruled her out. He had fun as Serena, but he didn\u2019t want to spend too much time as the same girl twice, which also ruled out Iris as he was spending the afternoon as her. \u201cThat just leaves Dawn as the the number one candidate.\u201d He decides, though he wasn\u2019t quite finished with being Iris.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the rest of the afternoon, Ash wanders through town as he starts to come up with a backstory for when he pretends to be Dawn. He knows she\u2019s a successful coordinator, but if his friends look her up they might link her back to him, and Lillie might figure things out. He decides that as Dawn, he is there until the end of the week, and she came over because she heard that some Alolan Pokemon could work well in her team. Satisfied, Ash prepares to put his plan into action. He makes his way back home briefly, where he takes one last look over Iris\u2019s body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking down his top, he can see that compared to some of his friends, his breasts are quite small. Lifting up the skirt however, it\u2019s clear that Iris is more gifted when it comes to her ass. While not as toned as Mays, his ass is quite thick, which proves to be quite the handful. Smirking slightly, he slaps his ass, which causes it to jiggle quite hypnotically, but also forces a sultry moan out of his lips, which stunts him momentarily, that felt really nice! Not wanting to stop there, he pulls down his leggings, bends over and proceeds to spank his ass several more times while also pulling on his hair, causing him to bite his lip and moan from both pleasure and pain. \u201cOkay okay that\u2019s enough, I can\u2019t take much more of this\u201d he tells himself, feeling slightly damp. \u201cIris has some weirdly hot kinks\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStraightening out his outfit, he says goodbye to Iris before concentrating again, and reforming as Dawn. Immediately he could feel how short her skirt was, which he tried to pull down to preserve some modesty. \u201cI knew there was a reason I wanted to avoid being Dawn...\u201d He says to himself. \u201cI\u2019m more than happy to see her parade around in a skirt this short, but I\u2019m not a fan of being the one parading\u201d he says, giggling slightly. \u201cOh well, this was my choice\u201d Ash then proceeds to familiarise himself with being Dawn. He learns how to avoid any wardrobe malfunctions while walking around and how important it is to cross you legs while sitting down. Eventually he feels comfortable enough to pull off being Dawn, and gets ready to go out again.</span></div></div>",
