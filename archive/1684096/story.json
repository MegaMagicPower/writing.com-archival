The story of Mark North begins on a day that was unordinary to begin with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were at home after a day that had been off from your usual routine. You'd won a car on the radio that morning, aced a test in your class at University, got promoted at work and went out on your very first date with the girl you'd had a crush on since your first day of highschool. You was now back home, your girl in the bathroom and wondering what other good and strange things the world had in store for you next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour cell phone rang and you answer only to hear the voice of a woman on the other end of the line.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen Mark, what I am about to tell you is of the utmost importance. Just moments ago you were struck by a special particle from space or something. It came in the window is my guess, I don't know. This particle has given you the power to switch bodies with someone by touching them in a picture. The picture can be on paper, a screen, anything. The only catch is that you swap with the person, travelling back in time to when the picture was taken,\" says the voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who is this?\" you ask, \"Is this some kind of prank?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is no prank, I guarantee perfectly,\" replies the voice using one of your favourite phrases, \"The most important thing to remember is that you do not and cannot allow temporal paradoxes to occur thanks to the time travel afforded by your power. And so I ask you to, when you get the picture I'm about to text you, touch the person in the picture so that you can have this conversation yourself in just a few minutes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're fucking with me,\"  you snap back, convinced it is some stupid prank by someone you know, \"Who is this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My name is Mark North but right now I'm in another body. Now touch the picture I'm sending you. It is important!\" hisses the voice before hanging up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door to the bathroom opens and you look up at your new girlfriend, smiling. She is dressed only in one of your T-shirts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Mark,\" she says to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel your member harden and you smile back. Just then your phone rings, you look down at it and see the picture of a girl you recognize. Rolling your eyes you decide to do what the voice said, after all what is the worst thing that could happen?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey,\" you say back before touching the picture of ______ and travelling back a few minutes in time to when it was taken and into the person's body.</span></div></div>",

Wait a minute..it's right that I become Sarah but it's not like I am going to live her life forever, in that phone call she said that I have the power to go back in time and became the person. when I  touched the photo or screen'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"and if you look at the bright side of it will bring me nothing but only benefits, I can become the person I want and I only have to go to the past. Which is GREAT it's like I can travel through time not in a future but I can go to the past which is pretty good in it self, and I am not going in my body back if I have this cool super power, what is good bieng a college student when you can't enjoy your life\" you said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hahahahahahahahaha\".'wait I am laughing like an idiot. Control your self mark control '<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look at Sarah's mobile  and go to the gallery you see many pictures of her friends and family's, but only three particular pictures catches your eye <br>\r\n<br>\r\n1st: it's a picture of Sarah when she was in middle school and she is with her friends you like this picture because if you go in that time and in that body you could start again and with knowledge of future you can do many things and one of that is Sarah, she is daughter of super rich family and if you became her you can live life of a luxury but it is also risky because this picture was taken 10 years ago. If you were to go back you cannot return. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n2nd: it's the photo of Sarah's mom who look very beautiful with she is wearing night gown and is looking very pretty she has a blonde hair and a glamorous breast <br>\r\nWhich you can't help but look and it seems this photo was taken in the night and behind her you could see a big luxurious house and you think that they must've come to celebrate and party and what year it is you don't know she must have received this photo that is why. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n3rd: it's a picture of Sarah and her friend you don't know who but she looks like a Chinese women and look really beautiful, she is very fair looking with big eyes and red hair with petite and sexy figure, and from the way you can see she look really rich with expensive bag and jewelry. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don't know why you choose only women but you were always curious what it felt like to be a women <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou want a life full of luxury without doing hard work, from childhood your parents would always told that study hard working hard is always necessary. But enough is enough, you are tired of working and want to enjoy life and seeing different things in this world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look at the photo and press the image <br>\r\n<br>\r\n                 ************************<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich image do you click on.... </span></div></div>",

You kick the shoes off of your tanned feet. Still a bit freaked out by everything you pull off the dress and throw it aside.

Your new nipples harden and you begin to hyperventilate. You close your eyes and count to ten, trying to calm down but the flow of the cool night wind fights your every attempt. To try and calm down you pull on one of your old T-shirts that is hanging on the back of the door. It does little to calm you. Finally you can't take it anymore so you...</span></div></div>",

Its clothes start to catch fire and the furniture starts to join in. You feel yourself being pulled backwards. As you reach the door, fingers scraping against the walls, you see your old body begin to melt, revealing a strange blue glowing shape within. You fly through the door and across the hall. Instead of hitting another wall you see that the apartment building is starting the break down, being replaced by an automobile repair shop. As you fly back you feel the t-shirt start to change shape into a uniform of some sort. Ahead of you, you can still see where your body lies, the world reforming around it. In its place is a blue form that seems to be disappearing bit by bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!\" you shout out, as you fly farther and farther away, the city around you changing slightly in this way and that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou finally start to fall, well across town, and see that the changes to the city seem to be nearly at an end. You are suddenly jolted to a stop in a dirty street downtown. In a bright flash of light, you see a figure appear in front of you as time around you seems to stop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who are you?\" you ask the figure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am Jyzzeckibyualk but you can call me Jason. I am part of the paradox control board of the Universal Regulatory Commission under the Grand Oversight Director,\" says the figure, \"Or by your more poetic terms, I am an Angel and I work for the G.O.D.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What just happened?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You created a paradox, we corrected it,\" was the slate toned reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Corrected it?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Precisely,\" the figure replies, \"We removed the interfering element and rewove the fibres to make up for its loss.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about me?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are a strange case,\" says the angel, \"Normally paradoxes only occur once or twice in a universe's existence and it is very rare for one of this magnitude to crop up. Somehow you gained the ability to cause an extra one to occur and did so. While we now have corrected the broken element, your seemingly past-self, we are left with you without a place to go. So we left you where you were.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about Sarah?\" you ask, shocked that such a small action could have such disastrous consequences.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Her mind and soul, as you would call it, are safe,\" the figure responds, \"If you like we can restore her to her form, unfortunately with full memory of the previous weave of the universe, or we can leave her be and let you take her place in this world.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If she is put back in here, what will happen to me?\" you ask, not liking the kind of choice you are being asked to make.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We can determine that at a later time,\" replies the figure, \"Just understand that now things have changed, the world is not as you remember it to be.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" you ask, \"How much could have changed?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"More than you may guess. Just think of your day today, without your existence, another would have won the car, you would not have aced the test, resulting in a different grade average, another employee would have likely been promoted and Sarah would have spent the night home, single and lonely. Now multiply those effects across your entire life and the changes start to become very significant. Take into account the consequences of those changes and many things change.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But how could my non-existance make my apartment building disappear?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, you chose an easy one,\" says the figure, seemingly relieved, \"It all started when you were three years old and met Sarah for the first time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I met Sarah for the first time in highschool,\" you return.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not so, \" smiles the figure, \"The two of you met when you were three.\" The figure pauses for a moment before continuing, \"You were out playing in your front yard as you liked to do. Sarah was out for a walk with her grandfather who passed away later that year. You accidentally bumped into her, causing her to fall and scrape her knee. This scrape led to her grandfather taking her to the doctors office. This visit to the doctor delayed the doctor getting home to catch his wife in bed with the architect of the apartment building you lived in. Had you not existed, none of those events would have taken place and the doctor would have caught his wife cheating, exposed the architect to the public and ruining the architect's reputation. The architect would then start to drink feverishly until one day he runs over the son of the developer who would have hired him to build the building in your timeline. This death would lead to the developer donating all his money to a charity to stop drunk driving and so he would not buy the land and the building would not get built.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was easy?\" you ask, shocked at the long diatribe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Some would have taken many of your mortal lifetimes to explain,\" replies the figure, \"Now what is your decision? Do you stay here as Sarah and sentence her to stay and work for the G.O.D or do you allow her to return to her body, though not her life, and come join me working for the G.O.D.?\"</span></div></div>",

It was the afternoon, shortly before you and your girlfriend Sarah left your small rental home to start your date.  Your neighbor Lily Nang was sitting on her front porch, looking very groggy.  She had partied through the previous night and most of the morning.  Now, she was suffering through a hangover.  Sarah had jokingly taken her picture with her camera phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLily is of Asian descent but was born in this country.  At nineteen years old, she is a few years younger than you.  She graduated high school almost a year ago.  Her parents are divorced and she lives at her mother's house.  Since her mother is usually out on business trips, Lily spends most of her time on her own.  She makes use of her freedom to stay out late at night or to throw loud parties at her house.  Even though she is underage, she never seems to have trouble getting alcohol.  The noise of her parties didn't make her your favorite neighbor, and she knew it.  On a night before one of your college exams she threw a particularly loud and late party, and you called the police on her to stop it.  Afterwards she started playing pranks on you.  They were harmless enough, but annoying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter touching the photo on your phone's screen, you suddenly find yourself sitting outside.  You have a throbbing headache, and the sunlight feels like it's burning your eyes.  Sarah is lowering her camera phone after just having taken your photo.  She jokes, \"This picture is a classic.  I'm posting it on the web.\"  You then notice yourself, from a few hours earlier, standing next to Sarah and smirking at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThrough your headache and confusion, your only response is to mumble, \"Ooooohh... Wha...?  Where...?\"  Your voice sounds strangely high pitched to your ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour girlfriend and your past self both start laughing and walking away.  As she's walking, Sarah tells you, \"That's quite a hangover you got, Lily.  Hope it was worth it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look down at yourself and confirm the impossible.  There are a pair of perky breasts on your chest that are being shown off by a low-cut tank top.  Below is a pair of shorts that don't cover up much of your new smooth, toned legs.  You had thought that the phone call you just got was one of Lily's pranks, but the voice on the phone wasn't lying to you.  You have actually gone back in time and turned into Lily Nang!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThinking briefly about the strange phone call, you realize the photo you touched that switched you with Lily had been taken by Sarah, and Sarah had just walked off with her camera phone.  You wonder how you could make the phone call if you didn't have the picture.  You wonder if you should even try making the phone call.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

They are covered in pink nail polish, contrasting with Lily's bronze-toned skin.  You wiggle your fingers, and notice with fascination how this foreign hand responds to your commands.  The soles of your feet feel cold on the ground, and you look down past the breasts on your chest to see you are barefoot.  Having no idea on what to do, you simply decide to go into Lily's house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou awkwardly stand up, and are hit with a wave of dizziness that almost makes you fall over.  You dimly notice waist-length hair brushing against your back as you stand.  In Lily's voice you quietly say to yourself, \"Damn hangover, why did she have to get so drunk last night?\"  You turn around and stumble through the door of Lily's house to find yourself in a living room.  You have never been in this house before, and you didn't know what to expect.  The place actually looks nicely furnished, but parties and Lily's messiness have taken their toll.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA wave of nausea hits you.  You rush around the house, looking through doors until you find a bathroom.  After kneeling over the toilet for several moments, the expected wave of vomit escapes your mouth.  Thankfully none of it hits your long, dark hair.  Not much comes out, but you do feel a bit better afterwards.  Standing up and moving to the sink, you turn on the water faucet.  You cup your petite hands to catch some of the flowing water, and use it to thoroughly wash out your mouth.  Realizing how thirsty you are, you continue to scoop water into your mouth to drink.  The sink in front of you seems taller than it should.  The realization comes that with Lily's short height, things now appear bigger.  You finish drinking.  Then your eyes move up and catch your own reflection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLily blankly stares back at you from the mirror.  Even though her face looks haggard, it is still very cute.  You admit to yourself that you have always thought she was hot.  You stare at her brown eyes, her small nose, and her lips that still have bright pink lipstick on them.  Her skin is unblemished.  Her low-cut, form-fitting tank top and short shorts show off her figure.  Beneath decent sized breasts is a tiny waist which widens to her curvy ass.  Her smooth legs are well toned.  You find your eyes lingering on Lily's breasts in the mirror, then you quickly shake your head to clear the strange thoughts in your mind.  You had just found yourself checking out... yourself.  At least that means you're still attracted to girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can't accept that this body is now yours.  You wonder what your next move is.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

By now, your past self and Sarah have left on their date.  Your house is empty and locked up, and as Lily, you don't have the keys to get in.  There isn't much else to do, so you decide to check out more of Lily's house.  In the living room, a couch with a few stains faces a large, flat screen television.  A framed photograph sitting on an end table shows Lily and her mother, standing together on a beach looking happy.  Lily's mother looks good for her age.  You marvel on how much Lily looks like a younger version of her mother.  You take care not to touch the picture, you don't want to touch an image of someone and go back in time even further.  The kitchen is messy, with dirty dishes filling the sink.  A couple empty beer bottles clutter the counter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere is a neat bedroom that doesn't appear to have been used for a while.  This must be Lily's mother's room.  The second bedroom you find looks like it would be Lily's room.  There are clothes, food wrappers and a couple empty beer bottles strewn about.  Almost all of the clothing is revealing.  While you look around, the effects of the hangover catch up with you.  Your headache and weariness are not going away.  You decide that resting a few minutes couldn't hurt.  You lie down on Lily's bed and quickly pass out.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The light coming through the bedroom window is starting to darken with the coming of dusk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at a clock on a bed stand, you realize you've slept for several hours.  Your past self and Sarah have just returned to your house.  You again remember the strange phone call from a woman claiming to be you.  You resign yourself to having to make the very phone call that gets you into this mess in the first place.  The thought of creating a \"temporal paradox\" if you don't make the call is unsettling.  Besides, as soon as you get that over with, you can work on getting back to your rightful body.  Unfortunately, the picture you need to send yourself is in Sarah's phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are supposed to make the phone call in just a few minutes, and you need to get Sarah's phone.  You quickly get up and walk to the front door, where you notice a rack of shoes.  Lily almost always wore high-heeled or platform shoes to add some height to her small stature.  Ignoring those, you go outside in a pair of flip-flops.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you walk towards your house, you notice a strange sensation on your chest.  You stop, and so does the sensation.  You take a few more steps while looking down at yourself and notice that your new breasts bounce with each step.  With your headache and hangover, you hadn't noticed this before.  You laugh in disbelief and say to yourself, \"Ah hell, you got to be kidding me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can't just knock on your door and ask to have Sarah's phone.  However, you remember Sarah was in the bathroom when you got the call.  Perhaps you could steal the phone from there.  You quietly move to the side of your house where the bathroom is.  You finally catch a bit of luck as you see the bathroom window wide open.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You use your arms to keep from entirely falling back out the window, but as you fall your chest mashes against the window-sill.  You let out a yelp of pain, you didn't expect your new breasts to be so sensitive.  You manage to finish crawling through the window and sit up in the bathroom.

Finally you shake your head and say, \"Your story couldn't have happened, I'm the one with the power to swap bodies.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLily says, \"No, the power stays with whoever has your <i>former</i> body.  You're in <i>my</i> old body.  Since 'past me' is in your former body, now she has the power.\"  Again she casually points behind herself at your old body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And why does, uhh, 'past you' use the power to become Sarah?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLily's says, \"I want to be Sarah.  My old life has issues.  Mom found out I spent last year's college tuition on parties, and, ummm, she cut me off.  I would have had to work to raise money to go to college.  I can't work, go to college and keep up with my social life at the same time.  Now that I'm Sarah, I only have a month before I graduate with a great business degree.  I'm as cute, well, almost as cute as I used to be, and I'm tall now.  I've realized I like being tall.\"  Lily straightens her posture a bit to accentuate her full height.  It still feels strange for you to have to look up at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou say, \"I can't believe you would do all this to get out of paying for college.  Why did you want to swap with me first?  Why bring me into all this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLily giggles.  \"Are you kidding me?  I stuck you in my old body, that's hilarious!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, you did that as a prank?!\"  You think for a moment, struggling to understand Lily's story.  You ask, \"How did you know to do all of this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Since I went back in time, I was able to tell myself exactly what to do.  I told myself how to give you the body switching power.  I told myself to call you up and tell you to touch my picture.  I told myself to pretend to be you in that call, because I figured you wouldn't trust a call from me.  It wasn't hard to pretend to be you, I guarantee perfectly,\" Lily teases.  You suddenly hate your old favorite phrase.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou start to feel defeated.  The girl in front of you looks like Sarah, your beautiful friend that you deeply trust and have had a crush on for years.  However, she's now someone else, and she has a cruel plan for both you and Sarah.  She's trying to steal your lives.  You uncertainly say, \"I... I'll stop you.  If I keep you from becoming Sarah.  I can prevent all of this from ever happening.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you do, you'll cause a temporal paradox and end the world.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll do what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You heard me.\"  Lily checks her watch and says, \"Okay, I need to do this now.  Time to turn the old me into the new me.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Lily picks up a framed photograph of Sarah that was taken a week ago, before you became \"Sarah's\" boyfriend.  After believing that Sarah was your girlfriend, you had proudly framed and displayed that picture.  Lily holds up the picture to \"past Lily.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce \"past Lily\" touches the picture of Sarah, she will go back in time and enter Sarah's body.  You clench your fists in frustration.  Every part of you wants to stop this from happening.  However, while you don't know what will happen in a temporal paradox, it sound's bad.  Really bad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Past Lily\" looks at the photo with some apprehension, then says, \"Here I go.\"  She touches the photo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment, her face goes completely blank.  Then she snaps out of it, and looks around in confusion.  Sarah Marshall is now in your body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looks around and says, \"What... how did I get to Mark's house?  Why does my voice sound funny?  Lily, why are you in here?  What's...\"  At that moment Sarah notices Lily, in Sarah's rightful body.  Sarah asks her, \"Why do you look just like me?  Who are you?\"  She points a finger at Lily, then notices her own hand.  She lets out a yelp of surprise and says, \"That's not my hand.  What's going on here?  What did you do to me?!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLily says, \"Calm down, Sarah.  Nothing's the matter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah insists, \"What's going on here?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLily sighs.  \"I just went over all of this with 'Lily' over there.\"  She motions to you.  \"Ah, well.  I guess I have to talk to you now, too.  First of all, take a look in the mirror in Mark's bathroom.  Then we'll talk.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah slowly starts walking to the bathroom.  Meanwhile, Lily walks into your bedroom.  She returns with a pair of Sarah's shorts, which she then puts on right in front of you.  She says to herself, \"Glad I kept these shorts here.  The shirt's too big, but at least I'm out of that dress.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour old voice then calls out from the bathroom, \"Oh, crap!  I'm Mark?!\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

But if you're Lily, who's that?\"  Sarah points at me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's Mark.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah looks at you, and you nod your head.  She asks you, \"How do I know you're really Mark?  Uh, tell me how we met.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou answer, \"Ummm, we met in freshmen year of high school.  I sat behind you in Algebra class.  I missed the second day of class, and you let me borrow your notes.  We've been friends ever since.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah says, \"Okay, fine.  Tell me why am I you, and why you are her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLily explains the whole thing to Sarah, taking her time to repeat what she told you.  Sarah seems to accept the story.  Perhaps suddenly finding herself in your old body makes it more believable.  After Lily explains that she plans to keep Sarah's body forever, Sarah explodes in anger.  \"What?  You bitch, that's my life!  You told me that since I'm in Mark's body, I now have the power to swap bodies.  I'll just use the power to become myself again!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLily gives a stern look.  She says, \"I've already thought about that.  I've been in your body for a week now.  I had time to make some very... interesting videos.  Starring you, nude.  I'm keeping them in a safe place.  If you get your old body back, I'll send out the videos.  I'm sure the dean of your school would be very entertained.  I'll also put them on the Internet.  I can send them to your friends, your family, and to anywhere that you apply for a job.  You'd have your body back, but your life would be ruined.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah is speechless at this.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The particle that gave Mark the power to swap bodies doesn't last forever.  It breaks apart or something, I don't know the details.  Anyways, while I was taking the time to tell both of you all about what I'm doing, Sarah just lost the power to swap bodies.  Both of you are now stuck like this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth you and Sarah exclaim, \"What?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is my last joke on you guys.\"  Lily grins at you.  \"Mark, you're such a stick in the mud.  I mean, seriously, calling the cops on me to stop a party?  You should be out partying yourself.  Maybe seeing life through my eyes might lighten you up.\"  After a brief hesitation, she adds, \"Probably not, though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah stutters, \"You... you can't do this!  You don't even know me, you don't know how to live my life!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I already am living your life,\" Lily replies.  \"I spent the last week figuring out your life and pretending to be you.  I even fooled your best friend here.\"  She motions towards you.  \"Now, it's time for me to return to my new life as a soon to be college grad.  Enjoy your lives, Lily and Mark!  Oh, by the way, hope you like that new car I got you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah looks confused.  You say, \"Are you talking about the car I won in the radio contest this morning?  But I'm the one who called the radio station to win it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but I told you to make the call, didn't I?  Consider it a consolation prize.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLily then walks out of the house.  Neither you nor Sarah makes a move to stop her.  Sarah stares off into space, shocked.  She says, mostly to himself, \"I can't believe this.  I'm stuck as Mark.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's strange to be looking at your own body from a third person perspective, especially since you have to look up at \"yourself.\"  You say, \"Umm, Sarah, I'm sorry this happened.  Lily tricked me.  Now both of us are in the wrong bodies.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah sighs.  \"Ehh, it wasn't your fault.  Both of us have the same problem now,\" she says.  After a brief pause, she continues, \"Still, Lily was in my body for a week and you didn't know it?  She can't be that good an actress, how could you think she was me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I, errr...\"  You decide to be truthful.  \"Well, she did act a little funny, but she looked like you.  Besides, when she suggested we go out on a date, I thought it was you asking and I got excited.  I guess I didn't pay as much attention after that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of Sarah's eyebrows rises.  \"So... you were happy to be dating me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm, yes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Sarah had been friends for years, and you were never sure how she would react to learning that you liked the thought of becoming closer to her.  You didn't want to ruin your friendship, which was the biggest reason you had never built up the courage to ask her out before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were expecting more of a reaction, but all you saw was a faint sign of a smile on her lips.  All she said was, \"I see.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter several moments, you ask, \"Umm, what now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe says, \"I'm not sure I want to be Mark for the rest of my life.  Not that there's any thing wrong with you,\" she quickly adds.  \"It's just that, well, I'm just not used to this new thing between my legs.  And I don't think I'd be good at being a computer technician.  If I can keep Lily from ruining my life, I'd like to be me.  If not, uhh, I'll have to think about something else.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou add, \"I certainly don't want to be Lily.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah gives you a sly grin.  \"Oh, I don't know about that.  You are kind of cute as Lily.\"  You give her a sour look, and she laughs in response.  \"Hey, even your pouting is cute.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou normally don't mind Sarah's occasional teasing, but you don't feel in the mood for it right now.  You change the subject from your cute pouting.  \"Anyway, both of us want to get out of our current bodies.  We need to figure out how to swap again.\"  You spend a few minutes talking about how to switch back.  As a test, Sarah takes your photo and touches the image.  As Lily predicted, nothing happened.  Neither of you know enough about Lily to realize how she might have found the power to swap bodies.  You decide you need to search for clues.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She pulled out a bottle of wine, and we both drank a glass.  She might have put something in my glass.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah nods.  \"Let's go check it out.\"  Both wine glasses are in your kitchen sink and have been rinsed clean.  The trash can in your kitchen is nearly empty, and it only takes a second to pull out the bottle of Syrah.  It's completely empty, and there is nothing special about it that offers any clues.  You curse and throw it back into the trash can.  As you do, you catch a glint of something shiny in the garbage.  You pull out a small, cylindrical bottle.  It is about three inches tall and appears to be made out of stainless steel, or maybe lead.  This definitely wasn't yours.  You and Sarah exchange a curious look, then you examine the bottle.  You can make out tiny writing stamped on the side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSPECIMEN X591617.  WARNING: CONTENTS UNSTABLE.  DO NOT REMOVE FROM DEGROOT LAB.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou cautiously open the cap of the bottle to confirm it is empty.  You hand it to Sarah and say, \"This must be what Lily used to hold the body swapping potion, or particle, or whatever it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah looks at it and says, \"Weird.  DeGroot Lab?  Ever hear of it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou answer, \"Nope.\"  You turn on your laptop and start searching for any information on the DeGroot Lab.  Typing with Lily's long fingernails is an strange experience.  After more than an hour, you give up after having not found anything relevant.  You curse in frustration as you slam your laptop shut.  Your only clue hasn't led anywhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah says, \"Mark, it's been a long day.  We should take a break, maybe get some sleep.  Tomorrow we can figure out what to do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tiredly grin at her and agree.  Even though she is in your body, she still has some calming influence on you.  You aren't attracted to your old body at all, but you like Sarah more than ever now.  If you didn't have her support, you aren't sure how you would take being trapped in Lily's life.  Then your grin turns into a frown and you uncomfortably say, \"Ummm, I'm not sure how to ask this, but, ummm, I need to use the boy's room, and... I was wondering if I needed any tips.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah bursts out laughing, and says, \"First of all, it isn't the boy's room for you anymore.  Second, it isn't rocket science.  Just sit down and do your thing.  Oh, remember to wipe when you're done.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour go to conquer the bathroom.  At the moment you aren't especially interested in seeing your new privates, as you know they will further drive home the fact that you are no longer yourself.  You can't help but get a peek when you're getting ready, and you find that Lily was completely shaven down below.  You let out an annoyed \"Ugh!\" at seeing this.  Sarah calls from the outside the bathroom, \"I heard that!  Come on, going to the bathroom as a girl isn't that bad!\"  You sigh and continue your business.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you're done, you grab some food from your kitchen for a quick meal.  With her own life stolen from her, Sarah has nowhere else to go for the night so she agrees to sleep at your house.  You're not certain whether it can still be called chivalry, but you insist that Sarah sleep in your bed while you take the couch.  In Lily's shortened form, you find your couch seems roomier than it once did.  As you lie on the couch, it is hard to shake the knowledge that your body feels foreign.  You shift a few times, trying to find a comfortable position for the new weight on your chest.  However, the day has been a long one for you, and you soon fall asleep.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It is Saturday morning, and thankfully Sarah doesn't need to deal with pretending to be you at either work or class.  Since Lily neither worked or went to college, you will never have to worry about either.  You idly wonder if Lily has anything in her life that would require you to actually try to impersonate her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou go to the bathroom and see Lily glumly looking back at you from the mirror.  Your mind still can't accept that the girl's reflection you see is your own.  You wash the day-old makeup from Lily's face, and sigh when you realize without it she looks more innocent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the kitchen, you pull out some bread and eggs for breakfast.  You quickly find that as Lily, you are now too short to reach a cooking pan you had stored in an upper cabinet of the kitchen.  Annoyed, you need to stand on a chair to reach it.  While you are munching on eggs and toast, Sarah wanders out of your bedroom.  She eagerly accepts the food you offer.  When the meal is finished, Sarah asks the obvious question.  \"What now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou think for a few moments, then say, \"Since I'm now 'Lily,' we can spend as much time as we like looking through her house.  She might have left something behind that tells us how she did all this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah nods her head in agreement and adds, \"We can also pick up some more clothes for you there.  I think you've been in those same clothes for a couple days now.\"  You look down at yourself and find yourself staring straight down the trench of Lily's cleavage exposed by her low cut tank top.  You silently hope that you can find some clothing that better covers yourself up.  Unfortunately, Lily almost always liked to wear clothing that showed off her assets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Sarah make the quick walk over to Lily's house.

The woman was in the middle of cleaning a few things from the living room.  You recognize her from one of the photos in Lily's house, it is Lily's mother.  In the flesh, it surprises you how much she looks like an older version of Lily.  She has the same height and a similar figure.  Her face looks similar, though her hair is cut much shorter and she has a few age lines.  Overall though, she looks good for a woman of her age.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe frowns at you and says with a slight accent, \"Lily, you finally decided to return from whatever drunken party you were at all night.  I see you also brought along some boy, who is he?  Your latest boyfriend of the month?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhh, ma'am, I'm...\" Sarah awkwardly starts to say before Lily's mother interrupts her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wasn't asking you, get out!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhh, yes.  Okay.\"  Before she leaves to return to your house, Sarah whispers in your ear, \"Good luck.\"  You are now left alone to defend yourself from this angry woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLily's mother asks, \"So Lily, where were you last night?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don't know how to respond, and you end up stuttering out what is generally the truth.  \"I was, errr, at... his house.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, at least you didn't try to come up with some story this time.\"  The woman sighs.  \"Why do we keep going through this?  I gave you chances.  I hoped that making you work to go through college would make you more responsible, but...\"  She changes languages mid-sentence and starts ranting at you in an Asian language.  You have no hope of understanding what she's saying.  You awkwardly stand where you are with no idea how to react to her complaints.  Every now and then, you make out a brief phrase spoken in English.  In the back of your head, you find it interesting how she switches languages in the middle of her rant:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...like your father...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...and then you had to...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...why was that?...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...DeGroot was nice enough to let you see the lab...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last English phrase snaps you to attention.  'DeGroot Lab' was the name of the place where Lily had gotten the body-swapping particle!  You know interrupting this upset woman isn't a good idea, but you need to find out about the lab.  \"Wait, what was that you just said?  DeGroot?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLily's mother looks at you confused, then starts to answer in the Asian language.  You again stop her.  \"Umm, could you please talk in English?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe eyes you with surprise and suspicion.  \"What?  Why?

I'm supposed to be a guy.  Lily did something to swap our bodies, and she did it with something she got from the DeGroot Lab.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman's initial expression is one of surprise, as she clearly didn't expect you to say that.

After hearing the same story from two different people, she finally becomes satisfied that it is probably the truth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe says, mostly to herself, \"My daughter would trade away her life to skip college?  I knew she didn't like to study, but to do all this?\"  She shakes her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter several moments, Sarah says, \"Ma'am, we told you everything we know, but we don't know anything about you.  We don't know how you know about the body swapping and time traveling stuff.  We don't even know your name.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lynn.  You can call me Lynn.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, Lynn.  Nice to meet you.  How do you know about the laboratory and the body swapping particle?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLynn Nang thinks for several moments, then says, \"My daughter did this to you, so I guess you deserve an explanation.  I'm a physicist.  I'm out of town most of the time, working at a secret facility.  I can't tell you where it is.  We were trying to find a particle that could bend time and space.  It was supposed to let us travel faster than light.  Instead, we found was the specimen, errr, particle that caused you to travel through time and swap bodies.  It wasn't what we were looking for, but it was still absolutely amazing.  We sent a few specimens to the DeGroot Lab for testing.  My daughter knew about the lab.  I'm not sure how, but somehow she snuck in and stole one of the specimens.  I still can't believe she would do this.  If she had caused a paradox, the world as we know it might have been destroyed.  I'm sorry, this wasn't supposed to ever happen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou see a way out of Lily's life in Lynn's story.  You ask, \"So there is more than one 'specimen?'  Umm, is there any way you could get one of them to help us switch back to our real lives?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLynn takes on a more guarded look.  She responds, \"If DeGroot and the other lab workers find out a specimen is missing, they'll go crazy.  Only one is missing now, and I might be able to hide that fact.  Things will be very difficult if a second one disappears from the lab.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah says, \"Please Ms. Nang, I don't want to be Mark for the rest of my life.  Is there no way you can get one of those specimens?  I know Mark doesn't want to be Lily either.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong with Lily?!\" Lynn says with annoyance, though her expression quickly softens.  \"I'll see what I can do, but no promises.  I'll go over to the lab right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou ask, \"Is there anything we can do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!  Just stay here for now.  I know you're not really my daughter, but you can stay at my house if you like.  In the meantime, you should start getting used to your new lives.  If I can't help you, you might be in them for a while.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLynn grabs her purse from an end-table and leaves the house.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",
