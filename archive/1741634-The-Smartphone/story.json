They're gone!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding there in just the stuffed bra and panties, he felt incredibly awkward and embarrassed as the boss looked at him like he was a stupid little girl. \":You mean you didn't even have sense enough to secure your locker?\" she said in disbelief. \"What  a ditz!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor Steve, this was getting worse and worse. \"But--my clothes! My Wallet, my ID my keys...I don't have anything left!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait a minute,\" the boss said, \"Here's your smart phone.\" From under a chair she retrieved the smart phone that started all this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I don't have any clothes...\" Steve started. Then he remembered, \"I have almost a hundred dollars in tips,\" he said,  \"Won't you sell me some clothes?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right, Hand it over.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteve gave her the money--and she handed him a pair of high heels!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here you are.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But-but is that all?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that ALL?\" the boss sneered,  \"That bra and pantie  and those breast forms cost a lot of money.

The next stop was an address just a few blocks fro here, with the added note \"rear door\". He told himself his bra and panties covered as much as a swim suit and he'd just have to walk it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it was so WEIRD, walking down the street like this!

I wear my boyfriends, too.\u201d He didn't know how to respond to that and before he got the chance to, she left again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteve again was left standing there, naked and feeling really vulnerable. He saw himself in the full-length mirror and saw the bizarre image of a  cute girl's head on his thin body. He shivered and turned his head back to the phone. He started reading the list of activities out load to himself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c5:00pm Gotta get that needed hair cut at the Salon.<br>\r\n  6:15pm I need to do some clothes shopping at \u201cLady Bug's\u201d for tonight.<br>\r\n  7:20pm Got a date tonight, I would really like to look nice for it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteve jumped a mile high when he heard Daisy outside the door. \u201cHere you go, Steph.\u201d Hands appeared above the door holding fabric and Steve took what was offered. \u201cYour stuff was pretty much ruined so I put it in the trash. Stacy, however, has decided to pay for a replacement outfit as a way of saying sorry for the inconvenience. I've got a pretty good eye when it comes to sizes, so those should fit well. Let me know if they don't. I'll see what I can come up with for your date tonight, Stephanie.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe leaves you again, this time holding a bra and pair of panties.</span></div></div>",

She walked into the dressing room for a moment then returned, handing Steve the purse. \u201cI grabbed some of the items you left in the dressing room and put them in here, seeing as you don't have any pockets.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, thank you,\u201d Steve said and reluctantly put the purse's strap over his shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs everything alright?\u201d Daisy inquired with a look of worry on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nForcing a smile, Steve responded \u201cEverything is fine, thank you. This outfit is very nice.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrinning, Daisy said \u201cGreat, Is there anything else we can do?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, no. Thanks\u201d Steve said. These girls had done enough as far as he was concerned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, alright. You have a nice day, Stephanie.\u201d Daisy smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou too,\u201d Steve forced another smile and walked out the door. Still a bit awkward on the heels, he started down the street while looking at the girl's phone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c7:20pm Got a date tonight, I would really like to look nice for it.\u201d Steve scrolled down and read a little more. \u201cMeeting at Le Bec Fin. I hope he is at least alright looking, he was so nice online.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe began to head to the restaurant Le Bec Fin, which wasn't far from where he was. As he walked, the heels forced his hips to move in a sexy sway, which actually made walking much easier. This time, people took more notice of him, in particular the guys. Steve turned plenty of heads by the time he made it to the restaurant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was standing outside the entrance looking for the girl, but there was no sign of her. He looked down at her phone, again, to see if there was anything that might be able to help him out but he couldn't find anything of use.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExcuse me, Stephanie?\u201d Steve heard a man ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes?\u201d Steve responded reflexively before realized he was saying it. He cursed himself for doing that and looked at the man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt's a pleasure to finally meet you, I'm Roger,\u201d He said smiling. He was a tall man, had brown hair and a strong jaw line. He reached his had out to Steve.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI...uh,\u201d Steve stammered and, without thinking, gave Roger his hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShall we?\u201d He asked leading Steve to the entrance.</span></div></div>",

There it was.  Stephanie Krantz... just uptown.  He could find her there and put all this behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the other hand, he'd still be dressed as a woman.

You wonder what happened yesterday.  Did you really drink that much?  What would have....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe memories of the day before crash into your hungover brain with painful force.  You look around wildly, trying to remember where you are.  You feel odd, silken sensations on your body and look down at the lingerie you crawled into the night before.  You struggle to accept that what happened yesterday really happened.  You stagger out of bed and find the bathroom.  Looking in the mirror you see the bizarre sight of your feminized face, now with smudged and streaked makeup and marred by the slight stubble of your morning growth of facial hair. The earrings still dangle from your ears.  The confusion, horror, and hangover all combine and before you can stop yourself you feel last night's dinner rising up your throat.  You make it over to the toilet in time... mostly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfterwards you rinse out your mouth in the sink.  The nightie you're wearing didn't escape unstained so you peel it off and toss it in the clothes hamper, along with the female underwear.  You reach up and struggle with the earrings until you finally can work them open with your long, pink nails. You turn on the water in the shower, just hoping to get clean and hopefully remove the makeup and see if you can wash this color out of your hair.  Maybe then you can start looking like a guy again!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou step into the shower and relax as the warm water flows over your body.  You look around and don't see any soap, but there's a bottle labeled \"Body Wash Treatment.\"  Unsure, you pour a dollop of it out into your ands and rub them together.  The mixture foams up and you spread it over your chest. There's a slight tingling sensation, but you're pleased to see the slight stains from your sickness wash away, so you pour out a full handful and start rubbing yourself down.  You try to get everywhere, your chest, arms, back, legs and groin.  You start to work it up your neck and face, scrubbing hard over your mouth to get rid of the lipstick, but as you do so a bit of it gets past your lips and you feel a burning sensation in your mouth.  You immediately duck into the stream of water in the shower, holding your mouth open to rinse out the chemicals.  The shower head is the detachable sort, so you pull it off the wall and try to rinse yourself off as quickly as possible.  As you do so, you feel with shock a sensation like ants crawling over your body.  Looking down, you see all your body hair sluicing down your skin and clogging the drain.  You touch your face and find that what little facial hair you had is now gone as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAghast but unable to think of what else you can do, you finish the shower.  This time, paying careful attention to the labels and directions on the products, you wash your hair thoroughly and are able to clean the remaining makeup from your face.  You step out of the shower and survey the results in the mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf you had any hopes the shower would restore your masculine appearance, one look is enough to dash them.  Your hair is still a golden blonde and being flattened against your head makes it seem slightly longer than when it was styled in a pixie cut.  Your nails are still long and pink.  Your skin seems to glow and there's a smoothness and softness to it that seems to be more than simply the removal of your hair.  You look down at your nude body, but that doesn't help.  Your now-bare crotch is the only thing semi-masculine about you, but (you hate to admit) it was never that impressive to begin with.  As for the rest of you, the best your could say would be that it looked androgynous.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere's a pale-yellow bathrobe hanging on the door and you slip it on.  It hangs down to mid-thigh and (you regretfully realize) pushes you firmly back into the \"female\" appearance.  Your hair is hanging in your face so you grab a barrette from a shelf and push it back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou step from the bathroom when, suddenly, the front door to the apartment (which you suddenly realize you never locked last night) opens and in comes...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Their hands are everywhere at once, lifting your legs and sliding something up. You gasp in shock as you feel your balls pushed up inside you and your penis tucked back between your legs.  Then a firm pressure holds everything in place.  You feel a cold dampness on your chest and then a sudden weight.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs quickly as it begun, the tornado of helping hands vanishes and you find yourself staring in a full length mirror.  You've been fitted with some kind of restrictive, padded panties that hold your genitals in check and plump out your rear.  But what draws your attention is the breasts adorning your chest! BREASTS!?  You each up and cup them in a daze.  Their weight and texture is completely believable. No seam is visible around the edges.  If not for the fact that you can't real your own hands touching them, you'd swear they were real!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not bad, huh?\" croaks Helga.  You stammer, \"Whu...

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You pick up the doll from the ground. It looked like it belongs to a little girl. But looking around, you didn't see any little girls anywhere. Deciding to return this lost toy, you hug it to your your chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There you are!\" You suddenly hear, which gets your attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look around to see a woman come running over to you. When she gets to you, she pulls you into a hug. \"I was worried about you!\" she says, and you are just speechless by the sudden event, and are unsure of what to do. After a moment, she holds your hand and leads you to a car. \"Now come on, follow me.\" she says sternly. All the while, you were too surprised to protest or say anything, and felt compelled to do as she said. She then sat you in the back seat and buckled you in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting in the back seat of the car, you sit quietly the whole time, wondering who this woman was and where she was going with you. You also had another question on your mind. \"Are you mad at me?\" you find yourself asking meekly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, of course not, sweety.\" she replies. \"I was just so worried. But I'm so glad I found you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling strangely happy that the woman wasn't mad at you, you look at the doll you were holding. It was pretty cute, so you decide to play with it for a while until the car reached its destination. You find yourself deciding to keep it. Since you found it, its yours now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, the car pulled into a suburban home, and you and the woman got out of the car. \"Now, why don't you head upstairs and get changed?\" she said. \"I'll make lunch in the meantime.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay.\" you say as you enter the house with her. Heading upstairs, you enter a room that , and inside you find a typical little girls room. The walls were pink, and there were various dolls, stuffed animals, and other little girls toys. You then take off all the clothes you were wearing including the breast forms, glad to get out of the skirt suit, then wipe off all the makeup you had on. You then headed over to the closet, and find various dresses, all of which seemed to be just your size. Picking a pretty, frilly pink dress out, you then walk over to the dresser and pull out a cute pair of pink panties, and a pair of knee-high socks. With the new articles of clothes picked out, you put them all on. Once dressed, you walk over to the mirror and think that you look pretty cute, but needed one more thing first. Grabbing some hair ties, you put your hair into to pigtails. Now, you decide to play with your dolls as you wait for your mommy to finish lunch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWait, your mommy? That woman wasn't your mom. And were you just thinking about playing with dolls? You then look back to the mirror, and at yourself, a man dressed in oversized little girls clothes. And looking where the skirt suit and everything you had come in wearing, you saw that it had all vanished as if the clothes were never there in the first place! You then realize it was just as Amanda had told you, you had now gotten yourself trapped in the life of a little girl, and unlike with Stephanie, you really did have less control. Until just a moment ago, you had been going along with things as if they were completely normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd that wasn't the end of things. You honestly did think that your new clothes were pretty and cute, and playing with dollies and other girly toys seemed fun. And no matter how hard you try, you can't think of the woman downstairs as anything except your mommy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ashley! Its lunch time!\" the woman called out from downstairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd at that, hearing your new mother call out to you was enough to make you momentarily forget about your current predicament. \"Coming!\" you reply as you leave the room and head downstairs in a cheerful mood.</span></div></div>",

He hustled across the street over to the shop and quickly entered. He only half noticed that the shop was geared toward woman but didn't think too much about it. As far as he was concerned, as long as they sold shoes for men, it didn't matter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteve walked down the aisles looking for something to buy but couldn't find anything he liked. A sales woman saw him looking and noticed his lack of shoes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan I help you, hun?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe attempted to speak but nothing came out but a whisper. His eyes widened. He lost his voice! Was it the screaming he was doing running from the wasps or the nasty pond water that found its way down his throat in his panic? Either way, his voice was gone and trying to talk was painful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs...everything alright?\u201d The sales woman could see the sudden panic as he gestured to his throat trying to speak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere, take a seat. It looks to me like you have laryngitis and guessing by your surprise, this is new for you. Is that right? \u201d she said leading him to a chair. Steve nodded and tried to say something but she stopped him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou probably shouldn't try to talk, you could hurt yourself.\u201d Steve tried to calm himself down, since he knew panicking wouldn't help. He was going to have to set up a doctor's appointment once he got his phone back. The woman found some paper and a pen then handed them to Steve. He decided to finish up here as soon as he could and started to write. He handed the paper to her and she read.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSounds like a really bad day. Well, I can help with the footwear issue at least.\u201d She instructed him to take off his dirty socks and gave him some disposable nylon socks that the store had. Next she took his foot's measurements.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe is a little above average. I know just the pair that would look cute on her,\u201d the woman thought to herself. She excused herself and when to find the pair. She quickly returned and slipped them on his feet then helped him out of his chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow do they fit?\u201d she asked. Steve gave her a thumbs up not realizing that he was wearing shoes for a woman. He liked the extra height the shoe's heels gave him though he wondered if they were a little too feminine. Other than that, they felt really comfortable. He thought about asking for something else but the thought passed as the woman helped him to the counter to pay. He figured he could return them if he ended up not liking them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou can keep the nylon socks, we have plenty. Have a nice day.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteve smiled and exited the store.</span></div></div>",

It took some getting used to since he never had anything exactly like them before. He wore cowboy boots for a Halloween costume once, but these were a little different. They changed his stride and he found that if he kind of rolled his hips with the steps, they steps felt more natural. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe problem though was his tie. With his new walk, it kept bouncing left and right which was getting pretty annoying. He took it off and looked at it and looked at the thing. His mood dropped again seeing his silk tie was completely damaged from the pond.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course,\" he thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith little reason to keep it anymore, he tossed it into a bin and sashayed off. As he walked along he felt the girl's phone buzz and he looked at the screen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can't wait to see you tonight.\" it read.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteve smiled seeing the message. It made him happy to see that the girl's boyfriend was thinking about her. Then he frowned realizing that that this guy was probably waiting for her to respond.

He was surprised by the size of the swelling that was happening to his chest and hoped that the two mounds wouldn't last too long. With everything that has happened already, he really needed a shower. He was feeling pretty gross and distracted when he felt the phone buzz in his hand and he looked down to read the message. He was about to read the message when a crack of thunder made him jump.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA storm? It was blue skies just a second ago!\u201d Steve tried to whisper before returning to the phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis almost doesn't feel real, you know? I'm glad we could finally make this happen. I can't wait to finally meet you in person and put a face with that name, Steph. :) See you tonight,\u201dread the message.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteve read the message, a bit confused. He had heard of people dating online thanks to mmo's and the like but never thought he would meet anyone like that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFew drops of rain hit the phone, breaking him of his train of thought. He took off as fast as his heels could take him but the rain started faster than he could imagine. All too soon, he was drenched all over again, but this time by the freak storm. With little option, he ducked into the closest building and hoped they would let him wait out the rain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteve took in the sight of the building, clearly seeing that it was gym.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExcuse me, miss? Can I help you?\u201d asked a female voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly hearing the last part, Steve looked over and saw a woman behind a counter. Realizing that he was going to need to explain himself, he walked over and tried to get the words out his time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI lost my voice. I needed to get out of the rain. Really bad day,\u201d he whispered softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman leaned in to hear him but Steve had to repeat himself a few times before she mostly understood. It was by then that that he started to shiver from the cool room combined with his wet clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, would you like to use our showers to warm up? I can see if we have some shampoo. We have a huge lost and found that I'm sure might have something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteve nodded gratefully and tried to reach for his wallet but the woman stopped him. Instead, she took his arm a lead him toward the shower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon't worry, you don't have to pay. This is nothing,\u201d she told him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe smiled and tried to tell her thank you. He did his best to tell her about his day, the hive, the ruined clothes, the shoes and the rain. He was so busy training to explain, he never noticed that they entered the woman's locker room. The woman only got every other word or so but figured she understood. She told Steve to leave his clothes behind and she would take care of them. After that, she walked off and left him int the locker room alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteve wasn't exactly sure what she meant...did they have a washer or something? Either way, he was quick to disrobe and hope into a shower stall, leaving his clothes on one of the benches in the locker room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman didn't take long to return with two bottles and a robe that she hung just outside of the stall. Steve smiled and nodded to her, taking the bottles from her and popping open the shampoo. He cleaned his hair before switching to the body wash. The scents were pretty flowery but smelled nice. Steve explored the swelling on his hips and back side, feeling strange about the new preparations he was sporting. He hadn't even noticed until then how uncomfortably tight his pants had gotten until he was free of them. He didn't notice that the body wash was removing his body hair, which slipped down the drain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally warm, Steve put on the robe and went to the locker room to find his clothes.</span></div></div>",

He noted that it was rather soft, and even without any sort of undergarments, fit right. How much of that was his newly smooth body, Steve would never know, since he had yet to notice it. His only problem was that his chest sort of chafed against the material, but he could live with that until he could figure out what he was wearing next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteve looked around for his shoes, but they were nowhere to be seen.

Still, let me help you with your shoes,\u201d she said apologetic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteve was overcome with embarrassment at his current attire and didn't fight as she slipped his comfortable heels back on. Happy as he was to not be freezing, he tried to ask about men's clothes but she didn't hear very clearly. She looked at him as he spoke, and scratched his chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, right.

My friend told me all about the day you've had, I don't want you to worry about a thing, hon.\" the woman said. \"What's your name?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Steve.\" Steve tried to reply, but Angela didn't understand. After a few tries, Steve pulled out the phone and typed Steve into the notepad. He hit enter and turned it to Angela.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! Got it.\" she exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteve smiled weakly and was led into the store. It was just as nice on the inside as the outside made it out to be. Steve walked through racks of clothing, following the woman until he got to a back room that was separated from the rest of the store by a curtain. There was a platform and three angled mirrors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAngela led Steve up to the platform and he stepped onto it. Angela pulled out a measuring tape and turned to Steve.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, strip.\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Steve asked. He couldn't strip! He didn't have any underwear! \"I don't... I don't have...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! I'm so sorry, of course! She said that everything was destroyed but I figured you at least had... never mind.\" Angela said. \"Give me a minute.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe rushed out of the room and came back with a small bundle of cloth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll go outside for a minute while you change.\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteve unfurled the cloth to find a pair of red underwear. Panties, but at this point, he was willing to put up with it. He pulled them on over the shoes and Angela returned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, now strip and I can measure you.\" Angela said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteve had never stripped to pick out clothes, but this place was high-end, maybe she needed exact measurements. Can't just go medium or large, it's gotta be perfect. Plus, it would be nice to get out of the dress, the chafing on the chest was getting worse. He pulled off the dress and stood straight, as Angela measured. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking in the mirror, he was a sight. His hair was clean, but it hadn't been brushed since the wash, and needed to be fixed, and his chest was very raised. What struck Steve as odd was how much time she was spending on measuring the chest area. Sure, that was important, but she barely focused on anything else. Thankfully, she didn't comment on the swelling, though, so it can't look that bad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAngela didn't say much while measuring, being focused on it, but she did mutter a few things that Steve didn't quite understand or catch entirely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm... not all the way yet. Might need a little space for them to grow.\" Angela muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Angela finished, she left the room again and Steve was able to sit down in a chair. He glanced at the phone, which buzzed with another message from Mark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"I'll meet you outside the restaurant, sending the address to your phone now.\"</i> Mark texted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great!\" Steve thought. \"Now he could quickly go there, return the phone and Mark could hopefully direct him to Steph and his phone. The faster this was over with the better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Awesome! Can't wait! <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/suitheart.png\" alt=\"*SuitHeart*\" title=\"SuitHeart\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"><img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/suitheart.png\" alt=\"*SuitHeart*\" title=\"SuitHeart\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"><img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/suitheart.png\" alt=\"*SuitHeart*\" title=\"SuitHeart\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"> \"</i> Steve replied. Steve couldn't think of a better way to detail his elation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was when Angela returned holding something red. Steve returned to the platform as Angela placed it onto his chest and attached it around his back. It wasn't quite a shirt, it was... a bra? Steve didn't understand understand why until he realized that the material was so soft, it was preventing the chafing on his swelling chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you think?\" Angela asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I love it.\" Steve replied softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm glad. Consider it on the house.\" Angela replied as she helped Steve back into the dress. He was confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about...\" Steve meant to motion at the dress, but motioned at his entire body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAngela looked at the poor girl, her hair all tangled and half-dried, she supposed it was a natural day with the lack of makeup, and her dirty and ragged nails. And then she had a really good idea.</span></div></div>",

This didn't make sense to him, he did need a trim but he thought getting some pants was the priority. Any protests were either ignored or drowned out as the blond and her coworkers surrounded him. While one attacked his hair, another started putting stuff on his face. He felt his shoes being removed but couldn't see what was happening, since he had to keep his eyes closed. Something weird was being done to his toes, then his fingers, all while the other two continued doing weird stuff to his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the phone buzzed again, he tried to to check it out but everything was too frantic for him to get a good view of it.</span></div></div>",

What he was was... confusing. Or rather, it was a very confused young woman. She had wavy hair that delicately framed her elegantly made up face, from her plump red lips to her defined eyes. She didn't have any blemishes and her eyebrows were even neat. She raised her hand, on which the nails had been lengthened and manicured, then painted a bright red, to her face. Steve noticed that the color matched her dress... and that she put her hand up to her face at the same time that he did and...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteve's phone buzzed again, which took him out of his trance.

He got out the door and there was a car sitting at the curb.

He was sure this place would impress Mark's date, too. He smiled to himself, glad to finally get this girl's phone out of his hands. He took out the phone and typed a message to Mark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHi, I'm in an Uber and on my way now. <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/inlove2.png\" alt=\"*InLove2*\" title=\"InLove2\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\">   \u201d Steve wrote without seeing that the phone had auto corrected his emoji.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI'm already here *inlove1*  \u201d Mark replied<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteve half noticed Mark's message as he was getting out of the car in a hurry.

Standing just past the door was a man in a dress shirt and tie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello, do you have a reservation?\u201d he asked with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI'm looking for a Mark,\u201d Steve told him in a strangely high sounding voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRight this way,\u201d the man said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe lead Steve deeper into the restaurant while Steve noticed something. Guys were looking at him as he walked and he couldn't figure out why or why they all had these weird looks on their faces. Then it hit him all at once.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe dress!\u201d he thought in a panic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were looking at him oddly because he looked ridiculous! He was mortified by the experience and wanted to just turn and run. Steven didn't get to do that, instead, he saw a handsome man sitting at a table look up and smile as he approached.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSteph? It's good to finally meet you in person,\u201d Mark said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteve didn't notice how, but the waiter hand got Steve in front of a chair and pushed it in.

The guy offered to cover the meal for him but he didn't want to take advantage of this guy's kindness. Still, he took another sip of wine and looked on. Drinking alcohol was a good way to get tipsy fast, so he needed to get something else in his stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs there anything you would be interested in, if you had the time?\u201d Mark asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI suppose getting into music what be fun. I'd love to be able to play the piano one day. What about yourself?\u201d Steve tossed back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI'm a pretty big film buff. My dad would take me out to see the newest thing and the habit stuck with me as an adult,\u201d Mark explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteve and Mark talked a little about movies that they liked. It was a fun coincidence that they had the same taste in movies and really got the conversation going. The waiter soon came back and refilled their wine glasses and asked if they were ready to order. Steve realized he never figured out what to get, having gotten too caught up in the conversation. Mark, he found, was really easy to talk to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWould you mind picking for me? I'm not sure what to get,\u201d Steve admitted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark just grinned and ordered them both their meals. Pulling a strand of his hair behind his ear, Steve smiled wide. He was happy with his quick thinking at letting Mark pick. With him choosing, Steve didn't have to worry about ordering too much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two talked more about their interests and Steve was finding the time flying by. The meal was amazing, which he made sure to tell Mark, and he was having a great time. Mark had him laughing and giggling all night, though it was hard to say how much of that was Mark and how much was the wine. Either way, Steve didn't mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a shock to Steve when the check arrived. The meal was over and it turned out that Steph had stood up Mark! Steve found himself getting a little upset at that. Mark was such a great guy and went to so much trouble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou okay?\u201d Mark asked, looking concerned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh? Uh...yes. I just didn't expect it to be over so soon...\u201d Steve told him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark didn't look sad but Steve knew how he would feel if he set up a date and the girl never showed up. Mark clearly didn't want to make Steve uncomfortable with his disappointment, he concluded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know, it doesn't have to end here,\u201d Mark smiled.</span></div></div>",

He attempted to push past, but was stopped by two burly fire fighters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can't go any further, miss.\" the fire fighter said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean? My apartment is in that building!\" Steve exclaimed. \"What happened?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As far as we know, a space heater in Room 5B went up and razed the entire floor, then started spreading. No word on the structural integrity, but everything in it's basically a lost cause.\" the fire fighter said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteve numbly stepped back, and nearly tripped, but was caught by Mark, who had caught up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong?\" Mark asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My apartment burned down... All my stuff...\" Steve blankly muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My god... At least you weren't home when it happened. You still have your life.\" Mark replied as he securely held and rubbed Steve's hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteve really needed human contact right now, so he threw his arms around Mark and started sobbing into his shoulder. Thankfully he was wearing waterproof makeup, so none of it was running. He couldn't even process what was going on. All his clothing, his possessions, everything was likely burnt to a crisp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What am I going to do?\" Steve asked aloud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, Steph.\" Mark replied, pulling Steve back and wiping his tears. \"I've got a plan.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You do?\" Steve sniffled as looked into Mark's eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do.\" Mark said.</span></div></div>",

Mark took him by the hand and they walked back to the car, not too far away from where the apartment was. Steve was quiet, contemplating everything that he had lost.

She lost everything. Do you still need a roommate?\u201d he asked, hopefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTell you what, I'll let her stay the next couple of days. We'll see if her and I can get along,\u201d She told him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks a bunch, Linda. You are the best,\u201d he said excitedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou better remember that. See you soon?\u201d she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, we're on our way,\u201d Mark told her before hanging up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark got into the car and Steve turned to face him, still having a hard time. Mark took Steve's hand into his own and rubbed it with his thumb, comforting Steve. Steve looked up at him with big eyes and gave him a weak smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI talked to may sister, Linda. She says you can stay the night and maybe you two can work out something more long term because she is looking for a roommate. My place is also available but I wanted to make sure that you had options\u201d Mark explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou can't possibly be real, you know that?\u201d Steve said, truly smiling for the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteve decided that if he was going to be moving in with Linda, he might as well meet her now. With that, Mark and Steve made their way to Linda's apartment. On the way, he told Steve a little about Linda.</span></div></div>",

You must be exhausted,\u201d Linda told Steve.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe nodded in agreement feeling both physically and emotionally done. Linda had him follow her and to his new room. Steve walked through the door and was met with whites and pinks, The decoration was clearly feminine but Steve wasn't about to complain after being showed such kindness. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI've got some clothes I can lend to you. I was going to drop everything off at a goodwill store but I think you can find something that works for you. I'll be right back,\u201d she told him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteve sat on the bed, kicked off his shoes and sighed. Girly as it was, the bed was very comfortable. He was sure he was going to sleep well that night. Linda was soon back with a large box with a few toiletries in a plastic bag on top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI like to have back up toiletries, just in case. You can have them until you can get yourself some. They should last you a while, though,\u201d She told him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you for everything,\u201d Steve told her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteve took the box and Linda left to give him some privacy. Steve put the plastic bag in the bathroom before returning to the box and opening it. He dumped the contents onto the bed and was disappointed at all the feminine articles. He wasn't surprised, of course, that would be unreasonable. He decided just to be grateful with what he was given.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe rummaged through them all but couldn't find any shorts to toss on. Giving up, he tossed off the dress and fumbled with the bra. He forgot that he was even wearing the damn thing with all the craziness he had experienced. He eventually got it off but was surprised at the sudden pain he felt when he took it off. His chest was still swollen and the weird weight of it was uncomfortable for him without the garment. Still, he tossed it to the side and hopped into bed. Again, the weight of his chest was strange as he attempted to get comfortable. He eventually found a spot that didn't bother him and soon fell asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside of the room, Linda was doing a lot of thinking. The girl, Steph, looked terrible and so vulnerable. It broke her heart seeing the weight of of what happened just hanging on her like a chain. Linda thought about what it might have felt like if something like that had happened to her. She felt a chill at the notion of loosing everything like Stephanie did. To be lost and alone, with nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then that she decided that, no, Stephanie was not alone. She was going to help Steph like she hoped someone would help her if she had ever had such bad luck. She when to her phone and made a call.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHi June, It's Linda. I think I found a woman for that study we were talking about earlier today. She could use the extra money,\u201d Linda explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLinda made plans while Steve slept, not knowing what was still in store for him.</span></div></div>",

But the first thing he noticed was how much his chest was bothering him. He sat up and looked down at his chest, the swelling was even worse than it was the night before and the weight was unbearable. He needed to see... someone about that. Maybe Linda knows a dermatologist? Steve tried fumbling with the bra, but found it hard to hook it up with his nails the way they were. He'd have to do something about those when he had a chance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, he was able to hook it up. He looked over at the dress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not right now.\" he said. \"There's got to be a better option in here somewhere.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe started looking through the box that Linda had given him the night before. There were a few casual dresses, but no shorts. Steve sighed and pulled out what looked like bike pants. They were black and were his best option right now. And they were pretty comfy. He found a light blue t-shirt with a really big neck hole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Linda must have stretched this out a lot...\" Steve remarked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne thing that excited him was that the box had some hair ties in it, so he was able to pull his hair back finally.

Sure, I'll participate. How do I start?\u201d Steve asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe can start right now,\u201d June said, sitting back down and pulling out a clipboard from a bag she had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteve sat down next to her while Linda began putting breakfast together. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTo start, this is a blind study but I will need your name for our registry.

Dr. Wilson made notes and nodded as Steve spoke, finishing up in no time at all. Once they were finished, Steve was handed a little pill and a small bottle filled with more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSuch a small thing, I hardly even see the point. Nothing this tiny could do anything noticeable,\u201d he thought to himself before swallowing the powerful pill.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you very much. Here is your $200 for your first session. Keep up with your pills every morning and come into the clinic on Wednesday to continue. Based on some of he answers to your questions, I believe you are eligible to participate in more studies we are conduction. Let the secretary know when you come in if you are interested,\u201d she told him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJune hand him $200 in cash and a business card for the clinic, which he took gratefully.

I can shoot two birds with one stone,\u201d he said excited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking again, he saw that the appointment was soon, however. Realizing that he had better run, he grabbed his purse, since he didn't have pockets, and rushed out of his room. He told Linda that he had to Uber to the doctor's but she insisted that he let her drop him off to save the money. Grateful, he thanked her for the help. He could tell that this living situation was going to work out but he was going to have to make sure he was going to be able to pull his own weight and pitch in around the apartment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doctor's office wasn't far but it was coming down to the wire and unfortunately, there was traffic just out outside of the parking lot.

Behind the desk was a young woman that adjusted her glasses as he came in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHi there, how can I help you?\u201d she asked pleasantly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteve did his best to get out that he was there to see Stephanie before her appointment.

He followed directions why trying to explain why he was there as well as the day he had. The pond water and the stings. She took his blood pressure and made notes, though he wasn't sure she understood, exactly. She left and instructed him to strip and put on a medical gown, which he did. Soon after, the doctor arrived and sat down reading Steve's file.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, you are having some swelling?\u201d he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, that's right,\u201d Steve told him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet's take a look. Could you pull down the top?\u201d He asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteve pulled down his top and then remembered he was wearing the bra. His face went red with embarrassment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI...got this yesterday...because of the swelling, you know? It has been helping my back,\u201d Steve attempted to explain through his embarrassment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat was a good idea. I recommend you get some more. It can only help. Could you take it off for now?,\u201d he explained to Steve's who was happy not to be shamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteve struggled to remove it but eventually got it. The doctor examined his chests, squeezing the mounds and asking about pain. Steve did notice how sensitive they felt, chills running down his spine as the doctor's fingers explored.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEverything looks normal here, I prescribe you a few things and you should be feeling better. Could you turn around and bend a little?\u201d He asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteve did, thinking that the doctor wanted to see the rest of the swelling. What happened was the doctor injected something into his backside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTalk to the receptionist for your scripts and to set up your following appointments,\u201d He told Steve.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the doctor left, Steve dressed before going to the receptionist. He did as he was told and, script in hand, headed to the pharmacy. </span></div></div>",

I...\" Natalie started to reply. \"I hardly recognized you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteve was confused until he remembered what he was wearing.

She'd never have guessed, but based on how she was acting with the guy, she guessed that was Mark, that this must be what Steve wants. Why else would he be dressed like this in public? She entertained the notion of blackmail or a bet, but the way that Steve was acting with that man... he was enjoying it. Natalie was certain of it. And if this is what her friend wanted... she wasn't going to judge. Male or female, Steve was a friend. Or was he going by something different now?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n================<br>\r\nSteve was so relieved to finally see a familiar face. He was also happy that Natalie didn't seem to be judging the strange way he looked. She was a good friend like that, not going to say anything to embarrass him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you need money or anything?\" Nat asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not right now, I've got some savings.\" Steve replied. \"But I just wanted to make sure that you'd know I was okay, in case you had heard. Feel free to tell anyone else that asks about me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly seemed fair to let her give the news, in case a mutual friend reached out to her if they couldn't find him.<br>\r\n================<br>\r\nNatalie surmised that he must be out of the closet, if he's not asking her to keep quiet. And good on him... her, whichever it was. She certainly didn't expect this when she saw the couple, but she's happy for Steve.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyway, I've got to get back to Mark, but it was great seeing you. Feel free to reach out.\" Steve said as he got up and walked back to his table.<br>\r\n================<br>\r\nMark smiled when Steve returned to the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How's your friend?\" Mark asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, I think.

The table shook and Steve's glass knocked over into his lap, covering him in soda. The man that did it profusely apologized but Steve assured him it was fine and an accident. Steve patted himself down and offered Mark a week smile and a shrug. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou want to head back and get changed?\u201d Mark asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I guess I should,\u201d Steve frowned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe didn't know what he was going to do once he got there, though. There weren't really many options for him to get changed into. He figured he would think of something, though. Mark payed and the two of them left, hand in hand. Steve waved to Natalie, you still couldn't believe what she was seeing as the couple left. Once they got back to the apartment, Steve looked back at Mark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou are really great, you know that,\u201d Steve said before squeezing his hand and getting out of the car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLinda was on her way out when Steve got to the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh good, here,\u201d She said handing over a key.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you.

I'll see you later,\u201d Linda told him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey parted ways and Steve when to get a quick shower. He used the products that Linda had passed his way, feeling a little silly but still wanted to be clean. Once done and smelling like a flower, Steve started to get dressed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe put on a pair of panties and put the bra back on, taking note that he was going to need more. He was wondering if Linda's might fit when his attention came back to the phone. He opened it up and started looking at the details.

He had hoped he could find something vaguely masculine until he had disposable income to replace his own belongings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes he had everything separated into categories. Underwear and socks went to the side, and he started looking into everything else. The dresses were out, some of them looked nice, but he wasn't going to wear one unless he was that desperate again. He found one nice suit jacket, a feminine cut, but serviceable, the only possible issue was that it was a bright purple. Unfortunately, there were no matching pants, and no pants of any kind apart from the exercise pants he had been wearing. Only dresses and skirts. Steve picked up a black skirt and entertained the idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I was wearing a dress yesterday, so what difference does a skirt make?\" he asked himself. \"No one said anything then...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were also several button-down shirts that would work even without the jacket. He found an off-white, vaguely pinkish shirt, and held it next to the blazer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm...\" Steve debated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe tried on the outfit and checked how it looked. It was comfortable and he looked okay in it. As he slipped on his shoes to test, the phone buzzed again. A reminder about the interview.

He ordered an uber and, once arrived, headed to the office. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteve thanked the driver for the ride and took in the site of the building. It was new, it seemed. shiny and modern in design. Steve wondered what kinds of things they did there as he entered through the glass door. The giant desk in the center of the lobby was dwarfed by the size of the lobby itself. The clack of Steve's heels echoed with each step as he made his way to the overworked woman behind the huge desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHi, I'm looking-\u201d Steve started to say before being cut off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman held up a finger and answered the a ringing phone before putting them on hold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere is an interview for Stephanie-\u201d He tried again before getting cut off again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe same thing happened once more. The finger. The phone. Putting on hold. One more time he tried before being told to sit in one of the chairs along the wall. Steve took the seat, crossing his smooth legs, frustrated at the situation. Steve sat there for a long while, going through the phone and bobbing his foot up and down, before the secretary called out to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLast name?\u201d she asked him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMiller. I'm here to-\u201d he started before being cut off again with that damn finger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain Steve waited with the phone before a man came out from a side door. He looked over at Steve and grinned, looking him up and down. He reached into his pocket as subtly as he could, readjusting himself. He knew already that he was going to hire this person in the sexy skirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMs. Miller?\u201d he asked hopefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cYes,\u201d Steve said hearing his last name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease, come this way,\u201d he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteve got up, confused, but followed. The inside of the building was just as impressive as the outside. Steve was lead into an office with an expensive looking desk topped with a name plate. Albert White: CEO.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHave a seat please,\u201d he told Steve.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteve did, waiting for an opportunity to speak. Again he sat, his long legs crossed but now across from the CEO. Albert stole glances at Steve's legs as he went through a file on his computer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEverything here checks out. Which is great because I could really use your help. Would you be willing to start today?\u201d he ask, cracking his fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStart today?\u201d Steve asked, not sure what he was talking about.<br>\r\n\u201cI could use someone to man the phone and sort through some backed up emails. Can you do that for me today?\u201d he asked, still grinning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI...sure?\u201d Steve responded, taken off guard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWonderful. You are hired then. Welcome aboard. Let me show you to your desk,\u201d he said getting up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteve stood, bewildered. He had a job? This was wonderful! He happily followed Mr. White to his new desk. He was instructed of his duties and was informed of the pay. When he heard the dollar amount, he was floored. He was going to be back on his feet in no time!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteve got to work, going through emails and answering calls. Occasionally he caught sight of Mr. White watching him, making sure he wasn't slacking off. He would smile when he noticed him, assuring him he was grateful for the position of assistant.

Predictably, Linda was already there, getting some breakfast prepared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Morning, sleeping beauty,\" Linda smiled with a little giggle, noticing his sleepwear. \"That looks pretty good on you. Really suits your figure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks,\" Steve smiled, even giggling a little himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHonestly, it had been a funny week. Sure, everything seemed to be going well, especially with work and how he was making friends and all that. In addition to that though, there were the occasional odd things. Like, maybe it was just him, but it seemed like his hair was considerably longer than it had been before. It was a little long before when he started pulling it back into a small ponytail, but now it reached his shoulders easily. It was pretty strange, although everyone seemed to like how it looked on him. No doubt using Linda's hair shampoo helped with that. Steve didn't mind it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAside from that though, there was the swelling in his chest, which hadn't gone down at all, although it did feel a little more bearable. In fact, that was one reason Steve thought about going shopping. The bra he had been wearing all this time was starting to feel small. He had little knowledge of the sizes of women's bras, but he had a feeling the ones he had from her were too small. He wished he didn't have swelling at all, but might as well try to make himself comfortable while he could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, any other plans for the day?\" Linda asked as she got him a plate of breakfast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, Natalie texted me. Wanted me to come to the mall to shop,\" he said. \"I figured I should eventually.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, that's good,\" Linda smiled. \"My clothes will probably only work for so long after all. They don't do your figure justice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh you,\" Steve giggled a little and playfully touched her arm, getting a laugh from them both.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Still, it's great news,\" Linda said. \"You think you can hold off on that until a little later? I assume you remember June is coming over today to check on you, and she should be on her way soon. You don't mind doing that first right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, not at all,\" Steve nodded. \"We can shop during the midday.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good call,\" Linda smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, the two of them finished breakfast, and Steve again had his pills with something to drink. It wondered to Steve how these pills were doing, as he was taking pills from both June and Stephanie's doctor. Still, he felt great so he assumed whatever he was doing wasn't going to kill him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn any case, he finished breakfast and then went to shower as usual. He had gotten hooked on Linda's shower supplies, so much that he had gotten some similar ones for himself. The flowery scent actually relaxed him as he washed. Upon finishing that, he got on another pair of panties with a bra, struggling a little with said bra due to it being smaller than he needed now. Finishing the ensemble was a nice little lilac shirt with a white skirt. Skirts had surprisingly become easier for him due to working all week in them. Even walking in heels was easier thanks to his date with Mark and said work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, all good to go,\" he smiled, letting his hair flow straight instead of putting it in a ponytail. He wasn't working today after all.</span></div></div>",

There are a lot of competitors around, you know?\" June responded. \"What I can say is that it's related to overall health.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Makes sense.\" Steve said. He wasn't sure what that meant, but he trusted June.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right, have you noticed any changes in the past week?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"None that I can think of. I started taking other pills from a doctor, but I don't think they're interacting.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right... And if you don't mind, I'd like to take a blood sample.\" June said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem at all.\" Steve held out his arm as June took out a needle and quickly drew blood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, that should be everything. Next week, I'll have you come in to the office so we can do an official check-in, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds good.\" Steve replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJune packed up her things and left, satisfied with how Ms. Miller was progressing.

He wasn't sure why, but he just felt really good now. Everything seemed to be getting better after feeling like he hit rock bottom just a little while ago, and now he was even going to spend some time with Natalie, one of the few old friends he really had at this point. Just the idea of some shopping with her made him feel a little giddy, which was kind of odd. He never felt that involving any shopping before, but then again, he was open to new things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, he arrived at the shopping mall, parking where he could and beginning to walk towards the entrance. Natalie was easy to pick out, and Steve smiled as he came over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi Natalie. Nice to see you,\" he smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, likewise,\" Natalie said after a small pause.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoy, from her perspective, Steve looked really girly now. That hair looked very well taken care of, and his bust looked distinctive against his swollen chest, though even she could see the bra was undersized. Needless to say, she was pretty confused about the whole thing. But then again, it was Steve's choice, and he seemed pretty happy about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf he was happy, then she could too, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what would you like to see first?\" Natalie prompted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, anywhere's good,\" Steve smiled. \"Though...you think we could perhaps get something better for my chest. It's...really tight at the moment.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a good idea,\" Natalie nodded a little. \"Last thing you need is a bra that's too small. Let's....go for that first...and maybe see what other clothes you like. You mentioned getting a better wardrobe, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I don't want to take advantage of Linda all the time,\" Steve said. \"It'd be good to have some of my own stuff, and we should have enough money too. The new secretary job I have pays very well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow....sounds like you have quite a story...\" Natalie smiled softly.</span></div></div>",

Yes?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteve wasn't sure what that meant but assumed it was probably about having better sex. Who wouldn't want better sex?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Steve was brought to a new page that had a video. His eyes were drawn to a swirling image as music played from the phone's speaker.

Opening it up to clear it out, he saw something strange. I looked like he had Nat had exchanged a few messages before she arrived.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don't remember this,\u201d he thought to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe scanned the text change quickly and a few words and phrases jumped out at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\nNothing to wear<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoing out with Mark tonight<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWant the night to go well.<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs that Mark?\u201d Nat said with a grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, no...just, uh, thought I got a message,\u201d Steve didn't want to worry his friend but he was feeling a little uneasy with the fact that they had a whole conversation that he couldn't remember.

Natalie could tell that something was up with Steve but jumped to the wrong conclusion, based on their text conversation. She leaned over and hugged Steve, much to his surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon't worry, I told you that I'd help.

I've already met so many new people.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, that's good,\" Nat smiled as well. \"I know making new friends was a little hard for you in the past, but I guess you're finally getting over that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"True,\" Steve said. He then looked at his simple attire, being a blouse and skirt from his selection of borrowed clothes. \"I even got used to these new clothes, though I really need to get more of my own sometime so I can return them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right,\" Nat nodded. \"Well perhaps we can take care of that someday. For now, we can make sure you look great for Mark.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteve nodded at that, though he was still internally conflicted about it. What was going on here? When did he end up on a date with Mark? This made no sense. He didn't want to make too much of a fuss and care off Nat, but it concerned him all the same. To be fully honest, it was one of many odd things that had bugged him over the days, like his skin and hair and such. His skin was so smooth and sensitive now, free of any blemishes and hair he might have had before. As for the hair on his hair, it was longer and shinier, nearly reaching his shoulders now It looked more feminine than anything else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn a different note, as he looked at his smooth legs underneath his skirt, he wondered if they too seemed a little different. Maybe....a little shapelier or something? They didn't seem to have as much a manly look as before. Actually, a brief comparison between his legs and Nat's own bare legs showed some similarities.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEh....probably just overthinking again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, the two of them arrived at the mall. Nat wasted no time in getting Steve over to the clothing store to get a nice date outfit. Steve wasn't actually sure what to go for though. Nat was immediately checking out dresses and the like, but he wasn't sure. Was it really all right to wear a dress? He supposed he had worn some of late but still....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, how's this?\" Nat asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe held up a violet dress, which actually looked really nice. It was sleeveless and came down to a good length, though....it seemed kind of loose in the front. Probably for a well-endowed lady which he was got. Granted, given the dress he had worn before, that feeling was a little familiar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it's cute...\" Steve said, hoping that answer satisfied.</span></div></div>",

He suddenly became aware that he was in a shoe store, but... hadn't he just been checking out dresses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe suddenly glanced down to his hand and saw he was carrying a bag with the logo of the last store on it. Had they finished up? Steve wasn't entirely sure. Did he black out again? First with the texting and now this... Steve was beginning to get really concerned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteve was broken from his reverie by Nat, who had returned carrying a shoe box. She opened it to reveal a pair of violet high heels, the same color as the dress from earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what do you think?\" Nat asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're very pretty.\" Steve replied. \"But...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Try them on,\" Nat handed the box to Steve.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteve wasn't entirely sure what to do, after all, this trip was supposed to help him get some proper clothes so he could stop wearing Linda's, and he was intending for a different style but another part of him trusted Natalie. She seemed to notice his apprehension.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Trust me, those are the right shoes. I know you're new to all this, but I'm gonna make sure that you look great tonight.\" Nat said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomehow, that was all Steve needed to hear. He took off his shoes and replaced them with the pair of Nat brought over, taking a few hesitant steps in them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've got great legs, you know?\" Nat remarked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteve had never been complimented on his legs before but for some reason, it felt good.

It was kind of weird how awkward yet good the compliments made him feel. I mean, it wasn't like he was outright trying to be feminine was he?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, he had to admit there was a certain shapeliness to his legs that felt nice. He wondered why they looked the way they did now. Perhaps the small heels he had been wearing at his secretary job helped with giving his legs a workout? He had worn them upon suggestions from other secretaries. Those heels from the store though were a completely different story all together though, making him wonder just how he would handle them on a date.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I don't think so,\" Nat giggled, nudging Steve again. \"Showing off what you have is nothing to sneeze at. We'll have to remember that when we get the chance to expand your wardrobe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now that would be nice,\" Steve nodded. \"I'd like to be able to give Linda her stuff back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I doubt there's any rush, though it was really nice of her to be so helpful,\" Nat smiled before pulling Steve again. \"Now in that case, time for some lingerie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteve gulped a bit before she pulled into the nearby store for lingerie. He had worn the panties and bras Linda had lent him, though he wasn't sure how he felt about them. Keeping his manhood in check while wearing them was awkward, though that thing had been a little less active of late, allowing him to wear panties better. The bras were always too big though. Linda was well stacked so it made sense, but Steve didn't feel right with using them to quell the swelling in his chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo little mounds had developed from that, though they weren't too big right now, probably A-cup by girls's standards. He had considered bringing up the swelling to Linda and June, but the irritation had gone down and he hadn't thought much of it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about my old stuff?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, you need something big for a date,\" Nat giggled. \"Something that goes perfect with the date and perhaps even after....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteve wasn't entirely sure what she meant by that, other than how she just got him into a changing room while she went out to find something. It didn't take long for her to do so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay....first piece! A bra!\" Nat smiled, before bringing out....</span></div></div>",

School? Friends? He couldn't remember, that's why he needed his phone, and chasing after this girl, was really eating into his time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first, he aimlessly wandered through the store, staring at every woman he passed, though he wasn't quite sure he remembered what the woman looked like, he felt like he'd recognize her if he saw her again though, and so far, no dice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFiguring he could narrow his search if he focused on the Women's clothing section, rather than the whole store, since she might not have even gotten here yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe slowly wandered awkwardly through the racks of clothes, feeling like a foriegner, not recognizing any of the women he passed<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe's been here for nearly 20 minutes, he'd nearly wasted an hour looking for his woman, where had she gone, Her phone had said Macy's she must be coming here sooner or later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stuck with it, hanging out in the women's section, hoping to recognize her face somewhere in here, he absentmindedly browsed through the clothes looking for things in his size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had an idea, it was possible he'd missed her and could maybe be in the changing rooms. it seemed unlikely, but Steve was willing to try anything at this point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe approached the dressing room, completely oblivious to the pile of clothing he carried with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dressing room 3 is open\" The Sales associate told him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nmomentarily forgetting his objective he went into the changing room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nsuddenly his head cleared. \"Wait, I meant to wait outside, why did I walk in here, and why was I carrying all these clothes, I'm losing my mind! I need to get my phone back now\"</span></div></div>",

He began to wonder if she forgot, much like what he seemed to be doing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, another part of him wanted to stay and stick things out. This was the plan on the phone, and the next item wasn't for a little bit. He could spend all the time he wanted in the changing room, since they offered a lot of privacy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why would I stake out here though? Perhaps I should just wait outside here.\" he murmured to himself. However, right as he was about to, he spotted what happened to be the pile of clothes he seemed to bring with him. All women's clothes of course.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow.....you've got to be kidding.\" He said as he brought a hand to his forehead. \"I must have been really absentminded to carry all that with me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was quite the variety in the pile, from blouses to even a dress. Some bras of different sizes were there, panties included. Heck, there was even some footwear he happened to snatch up. Steve wasn't sure how to proceed from this. Was there anything on what he should do? Just out of habit, he checked out the phone again, hoping for some answers. After looking, there was another message, indicating another note left by the woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is this?\" Steve asked as he red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe extra note was.....</span></div></div>",

The chair starts to move as your placed in what seems like a smaller room and then a shower comes on and you feel the hot relaxing shower and the body wash, however it wasn't body wash it was hair removal next the chair folds into a table and you are given a massage, unknown to you the woman who you number into was overseeing the project. After the massage your hands were tied together and you were dressed supposedly in more comfortable clothes, they took off your blindfold only to see a dark room, a woman told you to close your eyes, thinking you can't see any thing anyway you did and they applied makeup or as they called it facial moisturizer, finally they a woman came in and told you to open your eyes, her voice sounded familiar but you couldn't place it. When you opened them you saw her and motioned to give her her phone but you didn't have it instead you had hot pink fingernails you looked to a mirror and saw your completed self, you had no hair on your body, hips to die for, a bust that si big you couldn't look down and a very sexy latex two piece, a top and skirt.
