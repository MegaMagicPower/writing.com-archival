She hasn't unwrapped her presents yet. As you ponder this question, she picks up the small box from the table and removes the wrapping paper, then opens the box, revealing the earrings. She takes them out and then stops on the spot, looking confused.</span></div></div>",

It will send you back in time, but only your mind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou need a photograph of the moment you want to jump back to. The device scans the photo and transfers your mind back into your body at that point in time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn order to jump back you need an anchor.
