It was a rather peaceful area. Household netnavis roamed about completing chores, deleting a virus or two ot merely haging around. The viruses in the area are rather weak. Mettaurs, Canodumbs, a Billy here and there but for the most part it was a peaceful part of the net.  Close by you could see the entrance to various homepages including Mayl, Dex and Yai's. Dex was currently away at a tournament a few cities over (he finally qualified), so his homepage was blocked off. Ring was currently visiting Yai at her house again for the first time since the GP. Mayl was at home this weekend so her page was open. In the distance you could see the entrance to the school computer system. You decide to head to:<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You feel your body dissipate and then reconstruct itself within the computer. It is a feeling Navis are used to. The space was mainly pink with cute symbols of teddy bears or hearts. You spot Roll and call out to her.<br>\r\n\u201cHey Roll\u201d you shout.<br>\r\n\u201cShe notices you and quickly floats over. \u201cHey Mega what brings you here.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201c Oh I\u2019m just bored. Lan is busy so I decided to see what's going on here.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWell not much\u201d she replied, \u201cMayl's out as well\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWell maybe we can do something together.\u201d you recommended.  <br>\r\n\u201cOkay\u201d she replied cheerfully.<br>\r\nYou and her had known each other for a while. You were rather fond of each other and shared a bond strong enough for you to do a cross (a fusion of two navis with megaman as the dominant form.) <br>\r\n\u201chmm...\u201d she thought out loud.<br>\r\n\u201ci know!\u201d she exclaimed, \u201cwe can go to this competition in Elec town. The winner gets a trip to ()!\u201dshe had an excited look in her eye. He saw it and understood that he was supposed to get these for her so they could go together. <br>\r\nYou sigh and say ,\u201dyou know Roll you could just ask instead of trying to act like you don\u2019t know anything. She gave you a look of ignorance and said, \u201cwhatever do you mean?\u201d<br>\r\nA little while later In Elec town...<br>\r\ncheers *  the crowd went crazy as yet another net navi exploded and was disqualified from the battle. It was a gladiator battle of sorts that pit all contending navis with the prize of tickets to (). As violent as it seemed, the competition was merely sport. Navis didn\u2019t die easy. They could easily be brought back by a backup just like anything else on a computer. The losers merely re-spawned in the crowd. Megaman was in this with Roll sticking to him as they dodged past bullets and retaliated with shots and arrows of their own. They made quite a team and had become the crowd favorite. Any shots they took Roll would heal quite quickly. But one opponent they refrained from getting near. In hopes another navi would take him down. He was a rather large navi covered in Red armor and two large cannons on both hands. He wiped out competitors two at a time, or more if another happened to get caught in the blast. Suddenly Megaman stopped. Roll kept moving a couple feet until she noticed her partner had fallen behind. She began to ask why but then she noticed. There were no opponents left... except for one. The large navi stood there, menacing lights shone out from it's helmet. Roll said in a quiet voice, \u201cwhat do we do Mega?\u201d Megaman stood and said \u201cwell  guess we attack him.\u201d<br>\r\n\t The opposing navi lifted it's cannons. You plan to attack him head on. If your lucky he will be destroyed and you can fuse with Roll to heal your wounds. Do you:</span></div></div>",

He took the internet subway down to the Police HQ and headed for the work board. As always there was an abundance of work to be done. From missing items and homework help to virus deletion and internet police volunteering, the board had it all. A few jobs caught megaman's eye. There was a job to delete some viruses down at a fantasy MMO site. A job to spy on Mr. Mach (a fire navi user who has been involved in numerous plots to take over the world, somehow he never ends up in jail) who has been rumoured to be working on a new navi potentially for another terrorist attack. Another was more of a wanted poster for a group of four ex.WWW navis who have banded together and have been terrorizing the net. The group includes Plantman, Cosmoman, Freezeman and Flasman. It also states that there is a slight chance of more navis being part of this group but havent shown their faces as of yet.

He arrived at the SciLab netspace and headed up the stairs and into the main lobby. looking around he saw science and medical navis rushing from place to place in a rush to get files delivered and data analyzed. A friendly looking female navi stood at a holographic counter and beckoned Megaman over. Her name was Iris she was a blue and red navi with a cyber skirt which reached down to her knees. she had a long brown ponytail composed of cyberhair similar to protoman's. She gave off a warm energy and knew Megaman from his frequent visits to the lab <br>\r\n\"hello Megaman\" she said cheerfully.<br>\r\n\"Hi\" said megaman witha slight blush<br>\r\n\"what brings you here\" asked Iris blushing a little herself.<br>\r\n\"i was just bored and decided to see if anything was going on down here\" replied Mega<br>\r\n\"hold on a second\" said Iris as she looked through some files ltying near the reception area.<br>\r\n\"found one!\" she exclaimed and handed a digital piece of paper to Megaman. At the top it said SciLab test subject form underneath was a space to fill in credentials and then a list of options you could sign up for. It also read that you get paid after the experiment. There were four choices apparently ranked in risk level.<br>\r\n\"test subject?\" you inquired quizically.<br>\r\n\"yeah said Iris I thought maybe you could make some money and someone like you shouldnt have to fear a little bug or so. And that's only if they mess up which they rarely do.\" she replied with her usual cheer.<br>\r\n\" well I guess I could try one out\" you replied to her.<br>\r\n\"If you don't want to it's fine\" she started to looked a bit afraid that she may have offended you. Given the tone of your previous comment it was understandable. <br>\r\nLooking to make amends you quickly stammered, \"Sorry i didn't mean for that to come out so rudely. Of course I'll try one of these out I'm here anyway.\" <br>\r\nShe cheered up again and said \"oh Good\"looking relieved.<br>\r\nYou then shifted your attention to the sheet. Your options ranged from mildly to dangerous to a bit scary. The first and supposedly least dangerous option was battlechip testing. It required you to test various prototype chips from new types of swords to a specialized suit seeming to be a mech suit upgrade. The next test was a navi body swap sytem meant for military navi disguise. It requires the the testee to switch minds with another test subject and then back again. The most dangeros was one which warned loss of personality or sanity. If the test goes wrong it could result in deletion. It was a navi virus fusion experiment, similar to megaman's \"soul\" abilities. Even though viruses contained less power it was for this reason that the sientists believe more navis could harness it unlike megaman being the only one to be able to fuse with other navis. However given the fact that viruses exist to destroy and wreak havoc fusing with them is potentially dangerous. Megaman decided to go with:<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

However It had a long series of wires attached to a small glass box about the size of a small table.  A black, one-way window was near the top of the room. Next to it lat some form of speaker. Suddenly a patchy voice echoed through the room.<br>\r\n\u201cwelcome test subject #464, Megaman. You have volunteered to participate in anew soul cross system we call \u201cvirus fusion\u201d. In this process we use the ability certain navis have to fuse with other navis but instead of navi plus navi we are attempting navi plus virus. There are a number of risks associated with these tests. The two most likely ones being, A: the virus somehow corrupts your data during fusion creating undesirable side-affects.  Or B: You remain stuck in your fused form indefinitely. Due to the risks involved with this process we allow the subject some control over there experiment. We allow you to choose which virus we will test with. Once you enter the capsule simply envision it and we will prepeare and use it in the experiment.<br>\r\nYou walk over to the capsule. Cautiously you step in one leg at a time and lie on your back at a rather uncomfortable angle. You were somewhat afraid but there was no way out at this point.

There was a NormalNavi standing at a booth in front of it with a banner which said, TOUNAMENT REGISTRY. Megaman approached and took a sheet from the navi. There was a variety of tournaments which one could sign up for, Not all of them took place in the same area and they all hada different set of rules and objectives. The first of the tournaments was a simple 32 man battle, composed of 3 rounds of 2 0n 2 matches and then a final battle 4 man free for all. Next was a tournament which appeared to be more of a sign up for a gladitorial tournament. You can battle as long as you want but they take something from you as incentive to battle more. Next was a 2 person survival challenge in a strange biodome of sorts.  The 2 people must stick together and fight other teams of two while surviving against the various viruses.

You could approach one of the cults they worshpped various idols from A cybeast to a navi made completely of bugs. You could try out a dark chip.
