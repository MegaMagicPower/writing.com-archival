You make your way down to the dining hall to see that Madeline, Thomas, and your good friend Sarina are sitting at the table already. You sit down next to Sarina and Richard serves you your favorite breakfast meal: pancakes with a side of bacon strips and orange juice.<br>\r\n\"Wow, Richard, these look better than usual.\" you say.<br>\r\n\"I know,\" Richard replied. \"It's a new recipe that I'm trying out. Thanks.\"<br>\r\n\"Typical freeloader.\" King Thomas mumbled under his breath. Queen Madeline pinches Thomas's ear and he tries to contain his cry of pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, [your name],\" Sarina said. \"I was wondering if you wanted to take a walk through the garden with me.\"<br>\r\n\"That sounds nice. I'd love to.\" you reply. \"As long as your parents are okay with it.\"<br>\r\nThomas was about to object, but Madeline shot him a deadly glare.<br>\r\n\"We have no problem with it at all, dear.\" Madeline says sweetly, as if she had never shot a piercing glare to her husband.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you and Sarina finish breakfast and go outside, Madeline decides to have a chat with Thomas.<br>\r\n\"Why do you hate [your name] so much, honey. It's obvious that Sarina is very fond of him.\" she inquires.<br>\r\n\"I know,\" the king replies. \"But it's not him personally, I just can't trust Sarina around boys yet.\"<br>\r\n\"Thomas, Sarina is seventeen years old. She can handle herself just fine. And [your name] is a responsible, and caring young man. You've nothing to worry about.\" Madeline reassures him.<br>\r\n\"I guess your right.\" Thomas says, finally relenting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, you and Sarina were taking a nice walk in the garden. You two pass by Felicia watering the plants and make small talk with her before continuing.<br>\r\n\"You know, I've never noticed how beautiful the garden was.\" you say. \"It's like I'm seeing it for the first time.\"<br>\r\n\"Is there anything else that's beautiful here to you?\" Sarina asks, trying to flirt.<br>\r\n\"I dunno, what?\" you ask back, oblivious of Sarina's intentions.<br>\r\n\"I meant me, silly!\" she says with a cute giggle.<br>\r\n\"Oh, right.\" you say, feeling stupid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Sarina sit down on a bench in the garden and talk for awhile.<br>\r\n\"Listen [your name],\" Sarina finally says. \"there's something I've been meaning to tell you, but I've always been too nervous to say it. I................. I...................... I love you. I love you more than words can describe. When I first met you, I thought we would just be friends, but now I see that I want more than that. I want to be your <i>girl</i>friend!\"<br>\r\nYou were shocked! There was no other way to describe it. You had no idea that Sarina felt so strongly about you. She then puts her, soft, furry hands on your shoulders and looks at you with love in her beautiful, blue cat eyes. As her lips get closer to yours she finally says to you: \"Be my prince.\"<br>\r\nSarina then gives you a soft, deep, passionate kiss upon your lips, and all sorts of sensations run through you. When she finally pulls away, the beautiful princess Sarina looks into your eyes again and gives you a big hug. As she purred in your ear, she whispers: \"I love you <i>so</i> much.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, what are you gonna say?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Sarina had just disappeared into her room. Just as the door clicked shut, you let out a massive breath you didn't know you were holding. It had been an interesting day so far. Getting rejected, saving the Princess from some local scum, and making amends with said Princess as a result. And the best part, the increasing chance Sarina might truly like you as well. A smile crosses your face at this thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe this could work, maybe we can truly be toget....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"BOY!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sound of a booming voice nearly caused you to leap out of your skin. Turning to face the source, your blood soon ran cold in your veins. Standing twenty away down the corridor, was the King himself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKing Thomas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe struck such an imposing figure. Half a foot taller than yourself, he stood proud and powerful as any good king should. He wore brown leather boots with black leggings. A red tunic was complemented with a black &amp; gold colored cloak. Fashioned to his hip was a steel sword that had been polished until it glowed as bright as the Sun. A fitting contrast to the blood soaked history of warfare you were certain it possessed. His fur was a deep chocolate brown, the hair atop his head a sleek black shade as dark as coal. Covering said hair was a crown of a style the people of the kingdom referred to as \"modest\" in taste. An emerald and ruby encrusted affair across three rings along the main body. It was a sight to make anyone feel small and vulnerable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd you've faced it everyday for the past four years.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yes your Majesty?!\" you began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Was that you just exiting my daughter's bed chambers?\" he asked sternly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I..uh...well, it's not quite what you'd expect.\" you began, stammering uncontrollably.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not what I'd expect? Then tell me what I'd expect young human, or perhaps it is my eyes failing me in my advancing age. Is that what I <i>expect</i>?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-n-n-no! Uh, no your majesty!\" you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's nothing to worry about Father.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth of you turned to face the interruption. Standing in the doorway, concealed behind the wooden door of her room, was Sarina. She must've been washing up as her fur looked clean and damp. You quickly deduced the real reason she was still mostly behind the door was due to a possible lack of <i>clothing</i> at that moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took all your willpower to stay focused and conceal the rising amount of red on your cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The two of us were walking in the town square this morning when a passing cart soaked me head to toe in wet mud. Dear [Your Name] was kind enough to assist me in returning to my room to change, lest I catch a fever or ruin the Castle floor's with mud and filth. You know how mother wouldn't approve.\" Sarina explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well?\" the King asked, turning to face you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is true your Majesty, Sarina and myself were in town this morning. We had only just returned mere moments before your arrival.\" you said. Not entirely lying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe King's gazed moved from you, to Sarina, and back to you. Scanning and judging every inch of your being. After what seemed like a few centuries had passed, the King's shoulders relaxed, his gaze softening. You certainly did so as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well. I humbly thank you for helping my daughter with her predicament. You honor your family well in continuing to aid our fair kingdom young human.\" he said before bowing. You did so as well, both out of respect and slight bewilderment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will see you at dinner Sarina, I have other matters to attend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKing Thomas swiftly turned and departed down the corridor, quickly disappearing from sight. Sarina looked to you for a moment, gave you a quick wink and a smile, and vanished into her room. Leaving you all alone once more in the silent corridor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sweet Hellfire...\" you mutter in disbelief from recent events.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFiguring Sarina will still take some time getting dressed. You decide to see what your pals Richard and Felicia are up to this afternoon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut which one first?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou decide......</span></div></div>",

You shut off the music and answer the door. You don't expect it to be Sarina, 'cause she's still changing. You hope it's not her father asking you where you and his daughter have been. Richard and Queen Madeline are sleeping in there respective rooms. That just leaves.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, hi Felicia.\" you say to the girl standing in your doorway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, [your name].

Nothing new.\" you answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen,\" she said. \"I realized that we haven't really gotten to know each other in the four years that you've been here, so I was wondering if you'd want to go to the local diner. We can get a bite to eat and, you know, talk.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay,\" you say. \"It's not like I have anything planned tomorrow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelicia's eyes seem to brighten when she hears your response. \"Great, I'll be ready to go at 12:30 tomorrow. G'night!\" she finally says before she walks away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning, you see something on your nightstand. As your vision finally focuses, you recognize the object as a rose. You don't remember the rose being there before. You pick it up to see a note attached to it. Your eyes widened at what the note said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>To [your name]<br>\r\nYou're the one object of my affection.<br>\r\nEvery night when I go to sleep, it's you I think about.<br>\r\nI can't spend one day away from you,<br>\r\nbecause I've always loved you.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou see that the writer of the note signed her name at the bottom.<br>\r\nWho wrote the note?</span></div></div>",

She couldn't have picked a worse time to admit it, now that you finally got Sarina to fall for you! You're really in deep shit now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the four years you have lived here, you have learned one thing about furries, specifically the females, and that is when it comes to competing for affection, they can get very violent, very quickly. If Sarina found out that Felicia wanted you, they would probably both end up in the hospital, not to mention she would  likely never speak to you again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo make matters worse, you agreed to go out with Felcia this afternoon! You could cancel your date (for lack of a better word) with Felicia, tell her you have something else you need to do. But then she would probably want to set another date some other time, and you couldn;t keep blowing her off, or she would get suspicious. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou decide the best course of action would be to meet Felicia at the diner, gently tell her you are already taken, and pray to God that Sarina dosen't see you with her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater that day, you walk into the diner where Felicia said to meet her. Fortunately, it wasn't a fancy place, so there wasn't a good chance of Sarina coming here. \"Hey (your name), over here!\" Your turn and see Felicia waving to you from a booth in the corner.You take a seat across from her as she smiles at you. \"So, did you get my note this morning?\" she asks with a grin like the Chesire Cat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, about that......\" You saym, but are interupted as a waitress brings your your menus. \"Order whatever you want.\" Says Felicia. \"I'm buying.\" Oh perfect, you think to yourself, now she's buying me lunch. That's only gonna make things worse. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hold your menu in front of your face, pretending to read. What you're really doing is frantically trying to think of some way to tell her you love Sarina without hurting her feelings. suddenly Felicia reaches across the table and tilts your menu down, staring at you with a loving smile, and great big eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gulp as she leans in closer....and closer....and closer.....until......</span></div></div>",

By the time you have read this, I will have hung myself from the top of the north tower. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelicia</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou ran through the halls of the castle as fast as you could, hoping desperately that you weren't too late. If only you had known Felicia felt this way about you before. You would have given up Sarina just for Felicia's own sake. You've heard \"love makes people do crazy things\", but you never heard \"love makes people commit suicide\"! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dear God, please let her be alive!\" You prayed in your head. You would never forgive yourself if you had to live with the fact Felicia died because of you. When you get to the base of the north tower, you suddenly remeber that it is the highest tower in the castle, with over a thousand steps leading to the top. You begin to think maybe God is ignoring your prayers and instead is diliberately pissing you off. And it's working. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEach foostep echoes through the tower as you race up the spiral staircase to the top of the tower. Every muscle in your legs feels like it's ready to burst. Your lungs feel like they're on fire, and you are so drenched with sweat, it looks like you just crawled from the bottom of the castle moat. Finally, you burst hrough the door at the top of the stairs, panting like a dog, to see Felicia standing on the edge of the tower, a long rope tied to the base of a stone gargoyle tied around neck. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Felicia!\" You exclaim, nearly out of breath \"Don't do this! Please!\" Felicia turns to look at you, a solemn expression on her face. \"If I can't have you (your name), then maybe I'll find love in the afterlife.\" \"Felicia please! I'm not worth killing yourself over! If you do this, then I'll have to kill myself too. I couldn't live knowing I was the one really responsible for your death.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry.\" Felicia says \"But <b>I</b> can't live knowing my true love belongs to someone else. Goodbye, (your name).\" She blows you a kiss before turning around, spreading her arms, and letting herself drop. You quickly try to grab her.</span></div></div>",

I won't stop you.\" As you passed by an alley, you happened to notice a young catgirl with white fur and blonde har dressed in tattered clothes digging through a trash can. You walk up behind her and tapped her on the shoulder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSurprised, she jumped a little as she spun around to face you. \"Who are you?\" She asked. \"I'm (your name), why are you digging in the garbage? That's bad for your health you know.\" \"Isn't it obvious?\" She said, indicating her ragged clothes and dirty fur. \"I'm homeless. I have to dig in the garbage if I want to have any hope of finding something to eat.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking pitty on her, you told her to come with you and Madeline to the ice cream parlor, which she happily agreed to. The two of you shared a sundae as she told you and Madeline her story. Turns out her parents had died in a house fire. Not wanting to be sent to an orphanage, she ran away and took to living on the streets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadeline had a look of great pity and concern on her face as she listened. When Felicia had finished, she invited her to come back to the palacer, where she was given a home, food, and a job. Sarina and Felicia became good friends almost immediately, and she seemed to take a liking to you as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPresent Day<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was when I started to fall in love with you.\" Felica said. \"At first I was just grateful for the kindness you had showed me, but as the years went on, it became something more.\" You nodded in understanding. \"So, shall I tell Sarina about this myself, or should we do it together?\"</span></div></div>",

Not once paying the slightest bit of attention to all the honking cars, and bewildered pedestrians you ran past. As you approached the alley Sarina was dragged into, you could see down the long passageway just enough to catch a glimpse of a large figure disappearing around a corner and into a smaller side alley. Breaking into a run to head into the aisle, you stopped briefly just long enough to grab a sizable board of flat wood that was roughly the same size as a baseball bat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perfect!\" you exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you rounded the corner of the smaller alleyway, your blood grew cold in your veins. Forcibly pressed up against the wall high enough her feet were off the ground, was Sarina. Pining her to the wall with one fat hand on her throat and another holding her right arm against the wall, was a filthy, greasy, slime ball brute of a human. He was easily a head taller than you, and three times your size in sheer girth. He was wearing a brown, tattered leather coat, stained jeans, and a ratty pair of boots. A feeling of cold rage and disgust blossomed in your rib cage when the greasy man slowly pushed his filthy, bald headed, unshaven face closer to Sarina's lips, a vile smile creeping across his features when Sarina flinched backwards with revulsion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith great relief, you were happy to see Sarina wasn't much worse for wear. There were no scratches or marks to speak of, but her stylish, crimson turtleneck shirt had a few tears in the fabric, while her snow white leggings were now stained with dirt and mud. Your heart sank a little at the sight, as you always thought she  looked beautiful in that outfit. The way the crimson shirt highlighted her jet black fur and moonlight yellow eyes, and the way her white leggings fit snug and tight against her shapely form and sharp hips......n-not that you looked or anything!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello kitty kitty, won't you give us a kissy kiss?\" The man cooed slimily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe look Sarina gave him could've turned a person into stone. \"Let go of me sir, and I promise you the kiss of death will be satisfactory,\" Sarina spat back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehe,I like me one with a bit of spunk....\" said the man with a chortle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oi! Tiny Tim!\" You called out at the top of your lungs, running full tilt toward the massive scumbag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe instant the greasy man's head turned to see who had called out, was the same instant the wooden board collided with his head with enough force to shatter the board into  splinters and knock the greasy brute into a daze. As the man staggered backwards, Sarina fell to ground hard on her rump, coughing violently as she rubbed her sore throat. Throwing the now useless remains of the board away, you dropped to your knees to check to see if Sarina was alright, thankful your heart had stayed strong and true enough to convince you to rescue her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I don't think I could've lived with myself if I didn't...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-you?!...<b>*cough*</b>...What are..<b>*cough*</b>..you doing <b>*cough*</b> here?!\" she wheezed, her brilliant golden eyes gazing up at you in wonder and surprise. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGingerly helping the royal cat back onto her feet, you were about to answer her question when the sound of furious cursing could be heard coming from behind you. \"No time, just go!\" you exclaimed, pushing her away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But what about...\" she argued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go! Please!\" you yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wanted to protest, you could see it in her eyes, but she did what she was told and ran. You watched with relief as her long, majestic tail disappeared back into the main alleyway. So distracted were you by Sarina's bewitching form, you didn't see the sheer cannonball of a fist that was coming at you from a now <i>recovered</i>, attacker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStrange spots of bright color filled your vision as the entire left side of your head erupted with pain like a volcano, launching you sideways straight into a pair of metal trashcans. You knew this man had to have been strong, but to actually <i>feel</i> his strength was an experience you could've done without. The man was just about to swing another punch downward but you quickly blocked it by use a metal trashcan lid, which crumpled like tinfoil from the blow. As the man drew back to punch again, you delivered a quick kick to the man's knee, distracting him just long enough to allow the chance to drop the lid straight on his head, hard. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the man fell to the ground in a heap, you hurriedly scrambled back up to full height to make a break for it, only to have your feet pulled out from under you when the man grabbed your ankle. Landing hard on the ground on your stomach, you swiftly turned round to find the man pulling you back toward him by your ankles.Despite your kicks to his head, the large climbed up to full height with both of his hands on your neck, where he began to squeeze with the strength of a bear. Blackness was beginning to envelope your vision as you desperately tried to break free. Failing that, you resorted to one last option of kicking the man square in the groin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA loud cry of agony echoed across the alleyway as the man tensed up from the blow. Recovering yourself, you broke free of his hold and began to fight back, throwing punches left and right at the man's face, throat and shoulders. Unfortunately, the big brute drew into himself and was easily shaking off whatever damage you could throw. Quick as a whip, the man grabbed one of arms, leaving you exposed so he could bring round his other arm to lethally drop you to the ground. Thick, globs of blood pooled on the ground as you coughed harshly.  At that moment a dark figure suddenly loomed over head. You looked up in horror as the greasy faced man lifted up his thick leg high into the air, ready to crush your skull into the pavement. Closing your eyes and whispering a prayer, one final thought fluttered through your mind as you awaited your demise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I love you Sarina....I only wish you knew how much.....</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as the man was about to deliver the killing blow, a loud sound grabbed both his and your attention. Suddenly, the man began to scream and shout while twisting frantically about in place. Opening your eyes cautiously, you found yourself in awe at the sight before you where the man was being attacked by....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It was only fate that she came running here to the castle one day to escape a group of thugs from the outside. Of course, the guards were still wary of the feline suddenly bathing in here. But once she told her take of her orphaned life, Thomas and Madeline quickly warmed up to her, gave her a job, home, and friends, and during those times, she started having a liking to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe now known Felicia was then dropping hints on you, but you were blind by them. This one time when you saw her dancing around way too cheerfully at the palace gardens that it was creeping out everyone in the castle.

You thought that she was taking in for poetry, or it was made by someone else she thought was intriguing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut what really kicked the fan was that time she fell into the moat and you went in after her. It was nearly too late when you gave her CPR. Luckily, no one found out, but when Felicia looked at you, you saw a glint in her eyes. It was then decided that Felicia not only like you, but loved you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou just realize this now that you came back to reality.

You had always loved Sarina from the moment you saw her. For a long time, you kept it secret, even from your best friends, Richard and Felicia. Until a few weeks ago, when Sarina wanted to speak to you in private. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had called you to her room, and as soon as you were in, she locked the door and tackled you onto her bed, hugging you tightly and repeatedly kissing you. Needless to say, you had been taken by surprise. She went on to say how she had loved you from day one, and that she couldn't live without you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat day had been the happiest of your life. You even asked Sarina to scratch you to prove it wasn't a dream. After that you and her began going on dates in the city. Movies, restaraunts, amusement parks, you name it. Of course, Sarina's parents were completely oblivious to all of this. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKing Thomas really didn't seem to like you, and if he ever found out you were dating his daughter, he would probably have you tied and quartered, and that was a best case scenario. Whenever you and Sarina went out, you each left the palace seperately, and would meet up somewhere, so as to avoid suspicion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLast night, Sarina had left you a note on your pillow telling you to come to her room after midnight. You spent the whole night in each others' embrace. Sarina had wanted you to remove your clothes, which you hesitated to do until she did the same. So yes, you were both naked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarina's eyes fluttered open, and she looked up at you with a loving smile. \"Good morning my prince.......\" </span></div></div>",

So instead of waiting for karma, you were gonna <b>be</b> karma.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walk off, predending that Sarina's last comment didn't faze you, and she gets mad. \"Where the hell are you going!?\" she yells.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"None of your damn business, that's where.\" you say without even turning around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater that night, at about 8:30, you, Richard, and Felicia were in your room discussing how you were gonna get Sarina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm surprised that you were willing to help us with this, Felicia.\" Richard siad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She may be my best friend,\" she answered, \"but she can't just treat people however she wants.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, so we're all on board.

After about five minutes, it seemed hopeless, you couldn't find anything. No humiliating phtos, no drugs, nothing! But then you see one area that was left unchecked: Under Sarina's second pillow. You check under there and sure enough, you found something. It was a diary, but there was a lock on it. Richard thinks for a second and pulls one of Felecia's hair pins out of her hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell?\" she whispers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chill out, you'll get it back,\" he retorts. He picks at the lock with the pin and eventually opens it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jackpot,\" you whisper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three of you leave Sarina's room and go back to your room, where you peruse the contents of the princess's secret book.

My parents think it\u2019s part of my routine to stroll around the city on Saturday evenings, but if they ever knew what I was really doing\u2026..I dread to think of it. I know I am endangering myself by continuing to do this, but I love it. The music, the lights, the hundreds of eyes watching me spin and twirl as I ever so slowly reveal more of my beautiful body. \u201cKitten! Kitten! Kitten!\u201d they chant, their minds clouded by lust, handing over more and more of their money, eager to see more, until I stand before them in only a thong. Their hands smack my royal ass as they slip bills into my G-string. If they knew who I really am, I\u2019m sure they would only want more of me. What can I say, I love the attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes widen with every word as you read. Finally, you burst out laughing until your stomach hurt. This was just too perfect! Miss High and Mighty was a stripper! Needless to say, Felicia was speechless. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can\u2019t believe this!\u201d Says Felicia. \u201cI mean, everybody has their secrets, but why would Sarina even resort to this? She\u2019s royalty for fuck\u2019s sake! What would cause her to stoop so low for money?\u201d Richard, on the other hand, was rolling on the floor laughing, on the verge of pissing himself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think\u2026.\u201d He said as he caught his breath. \u201cIt\u2019s not a matter of her needing money, but a matter of the fact that  she\u2019s secretly an exhibitionist.\u201d You had an ear to ear smile on your face as you imagined all the things you could force Sarina to do as payback for all the bullshit she put you through. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou guys won\u2019t tell her about this, will you?\u201d You ask. \u201cWe would be idiots to.\u201d Says Richard. \u201cIf we told her you took her diary, we would give ourselves away too.\u201d Felicia nods in agreement. \u201cI may be her friend, but I think she needs to be knocked down a notch.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day you casually strode through the halls of the palace, knowing that any second Sarina was going to come marching up to you with another order, and sure enough, here she comes now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou!\u201d She says. \u201c There is a dead rat in the royal pool. Go fish it out.\u201d You smile evily. This is the moment you\u2019ve been waiting for. \u201cWhat are you smiling about?!\u201d Says Sarina angrily. \u201cI gave you an order! Now go do it!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou mockingly click your heels and salute her. \u201cAt once your bitchiness!\u201d \u201cWhat did you say?!\u201d She tries to smack you but you catch her wrist in mid-air. \u201cUh uh uh\u201d You say, wagging your finger. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t want me to tell your parents about your dirty little secret, now would you\u2026\u2026.Kitten?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarina\u2019s Eyes shrink the size of pin-pricks, then widen to the size of dinner plates. \u201cWhat did you call me?\u201d She whispered, her voice full of fear. \u201cThat is what your fans call you, isn\u2019t it?\u201d You say, grinning. \u201cI\u2019m sure your father would be very interested to hear his beloved daughter is local strip club\u2019s favorite whore.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarina grabs you by the scruff of you shirt, holding you directly in front of her face. \u201cI am not a whore.\u201d She snarls. \u201cI am a stripper. There\u2019s difference.\u201d You shake your head. \u201cThe only difference between a stripper and a whore is a whore sells more of the product. Also, I would say that you\u2019re not in any position to be making threats. So if you want this to remain between the two of us, you had better meet my demands.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a long moment, Sarina hesitated. Finally, she released her grip on you. \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d She says angrily. \u201cYou will do whatever I tell you to do, no matter what it may be, when I tell you to do it.\u201d You say. \u201cGot it?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarina nodded, but the look in her eyes said \u201cI will get you for this\u201d. \u201cNow, you are to go get that rat out of the pool yourself, using only your mouth, and fully clothed.\u201d For a second, Sarina looked like she was about to slice you to ribbons with her claws, but she turned around and started stomping her way towards the pool. You follow suite, an ear to ear grin on your face.</span></div></div>",

It was a pleasant Saturday morning, and you and Richard were discussing the best, most hilarious things you made Sarina do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay... oh! How about when you messed up your room on purpose and then had Sarina clean it.\" Richard says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah, that was awesome!\" you say in agreement. \"But not as awesome as the time I had her search the entire castle for my watch while I had it in my pocket the whole time!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Priceless.\" Richard says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry that you can't cash in on this.\" you sincerely say to Richard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No sweat, man.\" he says. \"Just helping you pull this off and seeing Sarina go through all this is enough for me. Just make sure she doesn't try any tricks to get you to let up on her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I guess you two are having a jolly good time.\" you hear someone say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're damn right, Felicia.\" you answer. \"This has been the best week of my life! Sarina's FINALLY getting what she deserves!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"While I can't argue with that,\" she began, \"don\u2019t you think that enough is enough [your name]?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Felicia, need I remind you that Sarina's been fucking with me since we were thirteen?\" you say. \"I'm no mathematician, but I think that adds up to four years.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I saw her sobbing in her bedroom just now.\" Felicia continues. \"She can't take it anymore.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, when I first moved here, I was sobbing in my room after a week, too.\" you argue, not caring that some of your masculinity just disappeared. \"And I'm not ashamed to say that because Sarina's finally going through what I went through. Besides, she's most likely faking.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A woman can tell when another woman is faking something, and this isn't one of those times.\" she retorts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRichard grunted in annoyance. \"You see, [your name]? This is why I said that letting Felicia in on this scheme was a bad idea.\" Felicia shoots Richard a death glare, which he simply ignores. She then turns her attention back to you. \"Just please talk to her.\" she pleads. You sigh in frustration. \"Fine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn your way to Sarina's room, you wonder: What good would <b>you</b> talking to her do? You'd be the last person she'd want to talk to when she was feeling bad, especially given the current circumstances. Then again, maybe you did go a little overboard. You never actually did anything Sarina told you to do. Sarina, on the other hand, HAD to fulfill your orders, or have her status as a stripper exposed to her parents. In a way, she had it harder than you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou open Sarina's bedroom door. She turns and sees you, which makes her angry. \"Are you really heartless enough to ask me to do something for you when I'm an emotional wreck?\" she asks with venom in her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I came to talk to you.\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do we have to talk about?\" Sarina asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take a seat on Sarina's bed and look at her. \"I've... decided to stop making you do stuff for me, and keep your secret.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitten, or rather, Sarina, couldn't believe her ears. \"What? Why?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"After giving it some thought, I decided that you're going through enough hell having to keep your secret.\" you say. \"I'm sorry I did what I did.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No,\" Sarina said. \"I deserved it. I treated you like scum for four years for no reason. You had every right to blackmail me. I'm the one who should be sorry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were stunned that your enemy was apologizing to you. Maybe blackmailing her gave her some remorse. There was one more thing you wanted to know, though. \"If you don't mind my asking,\" you say, \"what was it that made you want to be a stripper in the first place?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarina paused for a second. She sighed and said \"Okay, I guess you deserve to know.\" You prepared for a lengthy story. \"There were two different reasons why I did it. The first being that I wanted to be another person.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" you ask, confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All my life I was protected and pampered, and I wanted to experiment with a new lifestyle, one that was the polar opposite of the one I had.\" she explains. \"After my first night, the adrenaline rush it gave me was... unbelieveable. The music, the lights, it was amazing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were taken aback by that explanation, which almost justified her decision to be a stripper. meanwhile, you couln't believe that you were having a heart to heart talk with Sarina. \"So what was the second reason?\" You ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This reason is simpler than the first.\" she said. \"I wanted attention.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No offence,\" you say. \"but don't you think there was an easier way to get attention?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It wasn't that simple.\" Sarina explaied. \"I wanted the attention of a certain someone. I wanted their love.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who are you talking about?\" you ask.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Never bothered to point out the fact that he was a guy himself, so in a way, he was telling me not to trust <b>him</b>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looks up at you, tears flowing down her face. \"I really am sorry for the way I treated you.\" To your surprise, she suddenly wraps her arms tightly around you and burries her face in your shoulder, sobbing softly. You gently stroke her back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry too.\" You say. \"I didn't mean what I said about you being a whore, and I'm sorry for blackmailing you.\" You suddenly jerk and fall on the floor clutching your stomach where Sarina's fist made impact. \"Apology accepted.\" She says, stiffling a giggle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou slowly get back on your feet, sucking in a loud breath. \"It's cool.\" You say, sitting back down next to Sarina. \"I deserved that.\" You notice Sarina staring at you now with a bright passion in her eyes as she leans in closer. \"That was for blackmailing me.\" Suddenly, she presses her lips against yours, kissing you for ten seconds. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's for keeping my secret.\" Your brain momentarily ceases to function as it tries to process what just happened. Sarina, the girl you spent the last four years hating, just kissed you and admitted she loved you! You just stare at her, dumbfounded, your mouth slightly agape. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarina waves her hand in front of you with no response. \"Oh great.\" She says. \"I think I broke him.\" After several seconds you finally bring yourself back to earth. You stupidly say the first thing that comes to your mind. \"So are you good at your job?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment you expected Sarina to slap you silly.

Sarina was gone now, and she's just let Kitten out to play.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitten walked over to slowly, taking off her earrings, then her bracelets, then her jeans, and then her shirt. But it wasn't that simple. When Kitten removed each garment, she did it slowly and gracefully, sometimes putting them back on just as they were about to come off. She <b>was</b> good at this. She was now in her underwear, and pushed you down on the bed and straddled you. She then unhooked her bra and tossed it aside. She lowers herself a little so that she can look into your eyes.

At first I thought he was alright, but then on my first day he threw a water balloon at me. From then on, I couldn't stand him. I knew that he had a disdain for me, too. We were at each other's throats for years. Then, in tenth grade, your parents transferred over to our school. For some reason, they could see that underneath all this animosity between me and Thomas, there was some level of attraction. Of course, we didn't believe them, until one day, during our senior class trip, we all went camping. I was sent to get some firewood when out of nowhere, a bear appeared. I thought I was a goner, but then Thomas came out of the bushes and scared the bear away. It was at that moment where I realized what your parents were telling me. Ever since then, Thomas and I got along a lot better, and we eventually got married. Your mother was my maid of honor, and your father was Thomas's best man.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were interested throughout the entire story. \"Wow, I was expecting you to fall asleep about halfway through.\" she says. \"I'll talk to Thomas about this tonight. You can go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, Aunt Maddie.\" you say. Sarina's mother had insisted on you calling her that when you first moved to the castle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat night, you felt thirsty, so you decided to go get a glass of water, but then you run into Sarina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened?\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your mom is okay with it, and she says that she'll talk to your dad.\" you explain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarina gives a sigh of relief. \"Thank God.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, the two of you hear sounds of talking, and realized that it was Sarina's parents.

Thomas pushes one of the doors open and leads you inside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou find yourself in the castle library, a place that despite having lived here for four years, you had never been here before. Aty the far end of the room was a grand fireplace and two large armchairs. The rest of the room was lined by rows upon rows of books and polished oak shelves. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThomas sits in one of the chairs and motions for you to do the same. Thomas sighs as he locks his fingers together and places them in his lap. \"I know that I haven't been very friendly towards you these last few years.\" He begins \"I know at times it may have seemed that I didn't want you around at all.

But, you decided since you we're a couple now, you would have gotten to this point anyway. You just didn't expect it to come so suddenly. Sarina begins by turning around and slowly lowering her skirt, revealing her ass inch by inch. You raise your eyebrows when you see she isn't wearing any underwear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe kicks off her shoes and gestures to her blouse. \"Mind giving me a hand with this?\" With shaking hands, you slowly reach out to unbutton her blouse, before Sarina gets impatient and grabs you hand and places it on her chest. \"What are you so nervous about?\" She says \"You've seen it all before already.\" She was right, you had already seen her naked when she offered to demonstrate what she had learned on the job. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith new confidence, you undo each button one at a time, untill Sarina lets the blouse fall from her shoulders, now standing totally nude before you. Suddenly. Sarina is staring at you with a hungry look in her eyes, like a housecat the ha spotted a mouse. \"Now, are you going to take those clothes off, or do I have to rip them off?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou remove each peace of clothing, Sarina watching intently, until you're down to your boxers. \"Well?\" Sarina says \"I'd rather keep these on, thanks.\" You say. \"Oh no, if I'm going to be naked, thewn it's only fair that you should be too.\" You smrik as you get an idea. If Sarina was going to play around with you, you might as well play back. \"Alright, I'll take my boxers off...if you can catch me!\" You say before quickly turning around and running off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come back here!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou laugh to yourself as you hear Sarina running after you. You knew you couldn't keep this up for long. Sarina was a cat, which meant she was quicker than you. Sooner or later, she'll catch you. The chase goes on for a few more minutes untill....</span></div></div>",

It wasn't really Sarina's fault. It was in her nautre as a feline. You take a look at the bite, and see it is bleeding somewhat profusely, the blood flowing down your arm and into the boiling water.

It could take a few days, or a few weeks.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will I grow fur, and claws, and stuff like that?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In advanced cases, yes.

You weren't very muscular either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're nice, for starters.\" she says. \"You became friends with me because you liked me as a person, unlike all the other guys that liked me because I'm a princess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Richard likes you for who you are, so what makes me and him any different from each other?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not done.\" she giggles. \"You were always there for me. You helped me feel better whenever I felt bad, and you're really cute.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow...\" you say. \"I didn't know that you felt this way about me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I figured that today would be the perfect day to tell you.\" she says. \"One of the reasons that I wanted to see The Avengers with you is because it's over two and a half hours long, so if you did want to make out with me, we'd have plenty of time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDid you want to make out with her? You always thought that Sarina was cute since you met her, but you never had romantic feelings for her. When she hit puberty, you started to notice her becoming a beautiful young woman, and now you're both seventeen, and she's asking you to make out with her. What do you do?</span></div></div>",

You both have known each other since you were children, and you have a lot in common. Frankly, I would be surprised if you didn't fall for each other.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou silenlty thank God that she didn't know about the incident at the hot spring. Or did she? You decide it would be better not to ask. \"You won't tell dad, will you?\" Sarina asks. Madeline shakes her head. \"I won't, but he's bound to find out eventually. But when he does, I'll be there to support you.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarina lets go of you for a moment and hugs her mother. \"Thanks mom.\" \"You're welcome honey.\" Madeline suddenly gives you a glare. \"But, you had better be good to my daughter. If you do anything to hurt her, there will be hell to pay, understand?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Sarina both looked at Madeline in shock. Madeline bursts out laughing. \"I'm only kidding!\" She says between fits of laughter. You sigh in relief. After she stops laughing, Madeline gives you a serious look. \"But seriously, be good to her.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod. \"Don't worry, I will.\"  \"Good.\" Madeline smiles. \"Well, goodnight lovebirds.\" As she leaves down the hall, you turn  to Sarina and say \" Your mom can be scary sometimes.\" Sarina nods in agreement. \"That's nothing. You should have seen her when I was naughty as a child.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I always sleep naked.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pushes her skirt down to her ankles and steps out of it, leaving standing before you in only her undergarments. \"Would you mind getting this for me?\" She says, turning around she that her back was facing you, pointing to her bra clasp. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had never been asked to unclip a girl's bra before, and hesitate. Sarina giggles, finding your shyness cute. \"Go ahead. It won't bite.\" You slowly reach out and unclasp her bra, and it falls to the floor. Sarina turns around, and you get a view of her beautiful breasts. They weren't overly large, but just big enough to be a handful, the tips of her pink nipples just visible beneath her black fur. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarina gestures to her lower regions. \"Aren't you gonna help me with these?\" You blush. Now she wants you to remove her panties too!? You hesitate even longer this time, so Sarina takes you hand, guides it to her panties, slips o e finger beneath the waistband, and slowly helps you slide them down her legs to her ankles. Her nethers were obscured by her fur, so you didn't really see her, ahem, private area. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven though your face was red as a beat, you had to admit, you liked what you saw. \"I thought princesses were supposed to have modesty.\" You say. Sarina giggles \"Normally yes,  but I never was one for traditions. Now, are you going to take of those clothes, or shall I do it for you?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gotta be kidding me, she wants you to strip too!?</span></div></div>",

Sarina sighs in frustration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well then, (your name). I gave you the choice to strip willingly. Now...I'll just have to do it for you!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarina grabs for you, but you quickly duck and jump back. \"Nice reflexes.\" Says Sarina \"But you're not getting away from me!\" Sarina suddenly gets a fierce look in her eyes, and slowly steps toward you, like a lioness stalking it's prey. You take several steps backwards, trying to think of an escape plan. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One way or another, your coming out of those clothes, (your name), I promise you that.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarina was blocking the door, so you couldn't run out of the room. You decide to lure her away from the door, and then get get back to it. There was no way Sarina would go running around the palace halls nude, so she wouldn't chase you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou spin on your heel and run towards the back of the room, Sarina following close behind. You make a shape turn, jump across Sarina's bed, and run towards the door. You were five feet away from escaping when Sarina tackles you from behind. She drags you by your legs back to her bed, and plots you down on top of it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe straddles you, and stares down at you with a lustful smile. \"Well now, mouse, are you going to cooperate?\" You finally give in and nod. Sarina begins undressing you, sliding off your shirt and pants until you're down to your boxers. She begins to slowly, tellingly slide those off as well, shenanigans there's a knock at the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sarina. Are you in there?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarina's eyes widen in horror as she realizes she forgot to lock the door. The door opens, and in walks...</span></div></div>",
