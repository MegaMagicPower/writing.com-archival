Anakin feasted for what seemed to be an hour till he stopped completely stuffed. If anything changed in the room he wouldn;t have noticed he was so caught up in his meal that he didn't even pay attention to anything that wasn't on the table, that why he was shocked to see when he looked down he saw that he had gained some weight. \"Impossible\" Anakin had muttered to himself, he knew that he had stuffed himself to the brim but he didn;t think that it would have lead to a considerable weight gain like this. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor now, the weight gain seems to only have affected his belly, it jutted out from his waist and pulled on his attire, he didn't even dare touch it, fearing that it would jiggle.

I must fight!\" When the idea of fight appeared in the mind of Anakin, the parasite started to take the control over Anakin's mind. He then decided to let the growth occurs. When the parasite entered a Force user's body, he need space so he grew his muscles. The process started in Anakin's biceps, as  his arms started to grow, unconsciously, Anakin started to flex. His biceps grew and grew as his sleeves were rising farther on his arms until the breaking point, were his sleeves started to rip. Anakin moan in pleasure. His pecs were pushing his armoured clothes . His tunic started to stretch as his six pack started to grow bigger, then became an impossible ten pack! Anakin was moaning and panting as he was growing, loosing his self-control \" -pant- more! Oh! Bigger ! -pant- ah yeah! - pant-\". His legs were so big that his pants were sticking, then exploded! His legs were enormous! They also grew longer! His outfit started to totally rip. His body became so big! Then the grow stopped... The new Anakin was standing in the middle of the corridor. He was panting and moaning. He also have lost any self-control. The parasite was in charge of everything! Anakin started to flex and do poses destroying what remain of his outfit. He was almost naked, his boxer was standing... Almost destroyed by the Jedi's gigantic package. He touched it lightly and moaned of intense pleasure. He started to walk, his foots making big noises. He was 10 feet tall, stronger than any being on the universe and the most irresistible thing in the entire world (The parasite was producing pheromones which makes every being attired by Anakin). His biceps were as big as cantaloupes while he was relax. His abs were pulsating of power and Anakin was flexing his pecs making them bounce... <br>\r\n Did the parasite changed the personality of his puppet?</span></div></div>",

As he thought this though, a dart flew out a hidden corner and struck his neck. He promptly collapsed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he woke up, he dimly realized he was strappe to a table in a lying flat position. A disembodied mechanical voice droned, \u201cSUBJECT AWAKE. BEGIN TESTING.\u201d As Anakin wondered what sort of horrible test they meant, another dart hit is shoulder. Immediately bracing himself for that woozy feeling, he was surprised to feel none. Strangely, he felt an odd tingling in his groin. He felt strangely aroused. Then it hit him like a bomb went off. His package suddenly swelled. His dick shot out 7 inches. His balls swelled to the size of tangerines. As he lay there feeling very turned on, he exploded out again, and a lot more. His package completely destroyed the groin of his tunic, so that it lay in the open now. His balls were now the size of apples. His manhood exploded out yet again, and this time it didn\u2019t stop. As it continued to swell, his dick got thicker so it stayed reasonably proportional (at least with his balls). His balls passed the size of melons. As his member continued to swell, he arched his back as much as he could, loving the feeling. His balls had passed the size of soccer balls. And it begin to slow. As his growth ground to a halt, Anakin lifted his head just enough to see his glorious manhood. It was too much. He roared and shot the hugest load anyone had ever seen. If he had not been strapped to a table; he would have been propelled over by the force. He erupted like a volcano for several minutes. As he finally finished releasing, the table tilted upward, and released him. He thankfully did not find it difficult to support his enormous package. As he stood there, he decided that maybe these \u201cspecial weapons\u201d projects might not be no good after all.</span></div></div>",

Apparently it was not as abandoned as he thought. As he focused on his surroundings, he realized he was suspended above the ground by some force. As he pondered this (and of course how he was going to get out of it), evil laughter reached his ears. It sent shivers down his spine. \u201cWelcome to my research station, young Kenobi.\u201d \u201cWhat do you want with me?\u201d he called back in a steady voice. Again, the chilling laughter. \u201cLet us just say one of the more \u2018interesting\u2019 aspects of the force has a side efffect which I have never realized, which I would like to test. \u201cYou are young and strong, a perfect candidate.\u201d Wondering what on Coruscant he could mean, Obi-Wan was unprepared for the bolt of bluish lightning that shot out of a dark area at him. He roared as it struck him. He had heard of Siths using this \u201cforce lightning,\u201d though he had never seen it. He suddenly felt every muscle in his lean body clench violently. This forced another growl out of him. He then oddly felt them all loosen, them clench again. He realized, with shock, that they were growing before his very eyes. They would clench, then loosen and expand slightly. He began to feel less pain, and more power. As he became lost in this blissful agony, he fell to the ground on his hands and knees. He continued to expand as his tunic tore, leaving his powerful growing body exposed. He then suddenly felt the lightning stop coming. After recovering on the floor for a moment, he stood, sweat glistening on his large, meaty pecs and his powerful shoulder and arms.</span></div></div>",

The sphere was glowing bright blue, and it was even humming!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat sphere\u2026 It\u2026 It is powered by\u2026 The Force!\u201d Luke noted. \u201cI\u2026 I can feel it!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally?

It almost appeared as if he was called to go near it. If the sphere was so strong in the Force, then why did he have to stay away from it? Maybe his Uncle was being too cautious! Jake slowly got up from  his sleeping bag and walked out of his tent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young Jedi apprentice then took a small flashlight and walked towards the small cavern, which was only a few yards away from where they were. Again, as he approached the cavern, he spotted the strange, bright blue light coming from the cavern. The light just seemed too welcoming to him. He wanted to see what it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Jake stepped into the cavern, he saw the bright light coming from the spehere, which rested on the pedestal. He no longer needed the flashlight, and turned it off. As he got closer, the light grew more intense! Then, when Jake was almost six feet away from it, a bright, blue flash of light suddenly emitted from the blue sphere, and struck Jake in the chest!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake just felt overwhelmed! He was overcome by an enormous surge of power! It was as if an enormous blast of The Force was being pumped into his body! In fact, his body was almost being levitated off the ground, as the beam from the sphere continued to charge the boy's body with the mysterious power. Jake didn't feel any pain or anything, but he could feel that his body was changing!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the beam of light weakened and the blue sphere had lost its glow completely. There was no beam of light, and the sphere was completely died out. Jake's body dropped to the ground, and the boy was unconscious. After a few minutes had passed, he woke up, in a daze, and he stumbled back to the tent. He felt tired and sweaty, but he also noticed that he seemed a little more muscular than before. His arms were thicker. His biceps were bigger. His quads and calves had inflated some. His chest had puffed out some. But, weirdest of all, he felt this strange, amazing power coarsing within him. Was that the Force?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLittle did he know that he was endowed with the measure of the Force that was comparable to that of a Jedi Master... And he was only fifteen years old!<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jake ran back to his tent and crawled under the sleeping back after his strange encounter in the cavern. Strangely enough, he felt stronger\u2026 faster\u2026 more powerful. Still, he ignored the feelings and drifted off into a deep sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Luke woke up a few hours later, he got dressed and started gathering some wood for a fire. When Jake heard that Luke was already up, he put on his robe and his boots, and came out of his tent. As he looked around, he saw that Luke had started a pile of firewood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood morning!\u201d Luke shouted, since he spotted Jake from a distance. \u201cSee if you can get a fire going! I\u2019ll get some more firewood, Jake!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake walked over to the stack of branches, which were tossed over a small fire-pit, dug in the ground. This was near the tent, overlooking the lake and the x-wing landing site. The teen boy knew that he had to take two sticks and rub them together in order to produce so much heat, that he would eventually start a fire. But\u2026 would there be another way to do it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake felt strange\u2026 He felt different. There was something inside of him that told him that there was a better way to start a fire\u2026 Using the Force!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe walked over to the pile of branches and he raised up his right hand. He pointed his index finger at the fire-pit, and took a deep breath, thinking of nothing else but a nice, hot fire burning before him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA bright, blue spark suddenly shot from the tip of his finger, like a bolt of lightning, and struck the branches on the ground\u2026 Instantly setting all of them on fire! In fact, the flame which ignited was huge!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhoa!\u201d Jake gasped. \u201cDid\u2026 Did I do that?\u201d  he wondered in disbelief. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuke had just made it back to the campsite, when he spotted the large, burning flame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow! You got a fire going already?\u201d  He asked Jake. \u201cYou\u2019re fast!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuke then took a small pan and heated up some beans and soup, while holding the pan under the flame. He made something to eat for himself and for Jake, and the two young men enjoyed a quick, small breakfast together, while sitting on two large tree stumps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce they were done, Luke lead Jake to a grassy area near the lake, where they were surrounded by several boulders and rocks, neatly placed in front of the x-wing fighter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow, let\u2019s practice the art of levitation!\u201d Luke instructed. \u201cUse the Force to raise these rocks!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuke used the Force to raise a few rocks off the ground, and to make them hover in mid-air, before setting them back down again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThink you can do that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUmm\u2026 Let me try!\u201d Jake smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake looked around him and focused on everything in sight, using the Force to make every item in view to levitate a few feet off the ground. Suddenly, about a dozen rocks and boulders, including three very large boulders, began to levitate above the ground! Next, the tents began to hover in mid-air as well! Jake just grinned as he was able to make so many things hover in mid-air all at once! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake then turned towards Luke, who was completely slack-jawed, and made him levitate as well!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey! Whooaaa! JAKE!\u201d Luke shouted, as his boots left the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Jake turned to the x-wing fighter plane, and concentrated on that, even while he was still maintaining his mental grip on all the other objects at the same time. The space-plane suddenly began to lift off above the ground, but without its engines running! The fighter then climbed higher and higher, as Jake willed it to swing around in a full one-hundred-and-eighty degree turn, so that the nose of the space craft was pointing to the other direction. Then, Jake decided to make the x-wing fighter slowly descend back to the ground, until the landing gear touched down on the grass. Lastly, Jake set down all the boulders, the tents, and he allowed Luke to land back on his feet before him!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2026 That was just amazing!\u201d Luke stuttered, as he walked up to Jake. \u201cYou\u2026 The Force is very, very strong with you! How\u2026 How did you do that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake just shrugged. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI just use the Force and it happens!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, but\u2026 Nobody is THAT strong!\u201d Luke wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can use the Force to do many things. I can feel it. I think\u2026 I think I can even change things\u2026 I can even change people! I can change YOU!\u201d Jake realized, as the extent of his powers became clearer to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d Luke asked him. \u201cAre you that strong in the Force?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure! Look\u2026 Let me try something, Uncle Luke!\u201d Jake smiled, as he stared at his favorite Jedi-uncle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Luke felt a tingling sensation in his arms, specifically in his biceps. His muscles quickly began to harden as they slowly started to inflate with raw muscle! Luke couldn\u2019t help but flex his arms as some unknown, invisible force seemed to be pumping more muscle into his biceps! He moaned with pleasure as he felt an amazing surge of physical strength coursing through his arms! It was as if he had just enjoyed many hours\u2019 worth of grueling workouts in the gym! His biceps kept on growing bigger and bigger, until they were almost as large and as round as bowling balls!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy arms! My muscles! What\u2026 How did you do that?\u201d Luke gasped, as he flexed his huge biceps, much to Jake\u2019s amusement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI did that, Uncle Luke! I can manipulate your muscles by way of the Force! Isn\u2019t that awesome?\u201d Jake replied with a grin. \u201cIt\u2019s so easy!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow\u2026 I have to take you back to the Jedi Training Academy on Sandooine\u2026 You\u2019re just like a Jedi Master! What happened to you? What did you do?\u201d Luke asked his nephew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell\u2026 I\u2026 Uhh\u2026\u201d was the boy\u2019s answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDid you go back to that cavern where that blue sphere was being kept?\u201d Luke asked him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah\u2026 I woke up last night\u2026 I went into the cavern and I got zapped by that blue sphere! I don\u2019t know what it did to me!\u201d Jake explained. \u201cWhy? Am I in trouble? Did I do something wrong?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cObviously, the sphere has passed on all of its powers to you! We\u2019ll go get it and place it in a bag, and we\u2019ll take it back to the academy so they can analyze it\u2026\u201d Luke suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuke and Jake then broke up their camp and they retrieved the sphere from the cavern. The sphere had lost all of its power, and it was like a dark rock. The two Jedi Knights then climbed on board of the x-wing fighter and took off, to Sandooine, where Jake was to be reunited with all his other Jedi trainees. The only difference was that this time, Jake was already a Jedi Master. He was looking forward to using his new powers to making some of his friends\u2019 muscles grow, including those of Uncle Luke, who could always use some more muscle on his body!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Jake was feeling exhausted but decided to stay awake What he didn\u2019t know was what was happening to his uncle as the effects of the sphere of Force started to spread  in Luke body and to mutate it. His body started to pump: his biceps started to grow,  his suit\u2019s sleeves started to rip apart has his mighty arms were pumping to Olympian athlete\u2019s size. His torso started to become larger and larger as his pecs were pushing farther and farther, the zipper of his suit started to open, showing his incredible growing muscles. His abs also started to grow changing into an impossible twelve pack. As the growth occurs, Luke\u2019s body was reacting by creating pleasure\u2019s hormones. The Jedi master\u2019s legs started to fill his pants. His calves were pumping like air balloons. His arms continued to grow until they have reached bodybuilder sized. Luke\u2019s legs were also growing longer, increasing Luke\u2019s height of some feet. Also some other changes took place: His eyes\u2019 became totally blue and started to glow. Between his legs, his package became bigger making appear a bump on his pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Immediately after the end of the transformation, the Jedi woke up. \u201cWhat happened? I feel a little strange... I feel... Stronger? Powerful?\u201d It was really dark in the tent but Luke didn\u2019t know why, He could see everything like it was in midday with an enormous sun.  Luke started to walk in the tent and he figured out he was bigger than before. And then he looked at his body. \u201cWhat ! Is... that...me? Wow... it \u2018s ...amazing!\u201d. Luke\u2019s biggest dream was always to become big and great as he always was small. He now fell satisfied. Like he could do everything! He then flexed his arms, making appear enormous biceps. He then flexed like a bodybuilder and destroyed his clothes. Also he started to feel the Force differently like if everything was possible. \u201c Looks like that transformation has improved my connection with the Force too!

He suddenly exploded out of his shirt. He couldn\u2019t help giving a gasp or noticing his voice was lower. He had quickly developed very powerful muscles. They continued to grow, and he began to feel aroused. His legs followed suit, bursting through his pants, leaving him in a small pair of undergarments. He moaned as he felt his body harden everywhere. He was quickly becoming a beast. His manhood began to swell too, straining against his undergarments.

His shoulders and arms looked like he had soccer balls under his skin. His back made every movement visible. His legs were like thick tree trucks that were indestructible.
