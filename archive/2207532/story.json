The bun was stale, the patty was freezer burnt, and the cheese was that gross spray from a can kind. James swore that the school board served these crappy meals on purpose to encourage the monster students of his school to eat their human classmates instead. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the other students chattered all around him, he started to reflect on how he, by some miracle, had made it to his sophomore year of high school. He was halfway there, only two more years to go. Most humans his age are eaten by some random beast halfway through freshman year. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut deep down in his gut, he had this strange feeling that unless he did something to ensure his continued survival, he wouldn't even see summer vacation this year. A premonition, if you will.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked around the room as he considered his options. First, he could try and befriend one of his Monster classmates, or better yet, get himself a monster girlfriend. That way, he'd have sort of a personal bodyguard. But the problem with that, was what if his potential mate, so to speak, was more interested in having him over as dinner, rather than for it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext, he could find a student that knew magic, and ask them to teach him. In this world, humans who know magic aren't technically considered monsters, but they tend to live much longer, due to predators not wanting to risk being melted into a puddle. As James thought this, he look d over in the corner of the room and saw Nick, the school goth dude, also sitting by himself. Even the bullies of the school were afraid of him, because of rumors that he was a necromancer that could raise the dead. Perhaps he could teach James a few tricks to defend himself?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA third option was to ask Rene for help, but this was definitely a last resort. Rene was the head cheerleader of the school, as well as a succubus. Being a demon, this of course meant she had a fondness for making deals with mortals, especially human males. Usually it was for popularity, money, or even a one night stand. But Rene was well known for having a sadistic streak, and those who made deals with her tended to regret them. Butmaybe, just maybe, if he phrased the terms of the deal just right, he could come out on top. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, there was the option to become a monster himself. Though not unheard of, it was extremely rare for someone born a human to become a monster, and there were supposedly several ways of doing it, but all of them were just theories and myths, none of them having been proven to work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, what will it be?</span></div></div>",

There were plenty of female monsters in the school, but James knew he would need one that was rather intimidating, so that others would be afraid to anger her by eating her boyfriend. So that excludes the smaller species like imps and goblins. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter looking around for a few minutes, he spotted five girls in total to choose from. First, there was Sasha, a large and muscular werewolf. She was known to be pretty athletic, being involved in several school sports. However, she was also known for her ravenous appetite. All the exercise she got from her after school activities tended to make her very hungry, and she had a reputation for eating anyone she randomly came across after a game or workout to satisfy her hunger, particularly boys. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext, there was Marcy, a dragon that was sort of a bit of a nerd, being very intelligent as well as into playing RPG's (Ironic, isn't it?) She was also known devour anybody that would mock her hobbies, but not before cooking them to a crisp with her fiery breath. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen there was Desdemona, a snow white skinned gargoyle that looked as though she had been carved out of the purest marble by angels.Out of all James' choices, she was definitely the best when it came to looks. Except, James really didn't know much about her, except the fact she was a cheerleader for the school football team. As for her personality, he had no clue. She might be nice or mean, smart or a bimbo, he wouldn't know unless her talked to her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr there was Suki, a kitsune foreign exchange student. She wasn't exactly physically imposing, but all other species knew to never mess with a kitsune, because their magical powers bordered on the level of gods, and if you made one mad, they would place a terrible curse on you, if you were lucky. If you were unlucky...well, you really don't want to know. Suki, being from Japan, didn't know much English, and had to have a translator to interpret for her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLastly, there was Pam, an eight foot tall, rather rotund ogre. To be honest, she wasn't very bright, but maybe Janes could offer to tutor her if she agreed to watch out for him. She was known to be a huge eater, as is an ogre's nature. James just hoped she didn't decide to add him to her lunch tray.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, who will it be?</span></div></div>",

He picks up his tray and heads over to her table. Having transferred to this school rather recently, Suki didn't really have any friends around here at the moment, which meant she was sitting at her table alone as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames approached her and said \"Hello.\" Suki turned to face him and gazed at him with her bright emerald green eyes. \"Konichiwa.\" She said. James didn't know much Japanese, but her voice hadn't been threatening or angry, so he guessed that was some kind of greeting. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames pointed to the device Suki wore around her wrist like a watch. She held it up and he said \"Do you mind if I sit here?\" The device translated what he said into Japanese, and Suki motioned for him to have a seat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlright, he thought as he sat down, first step is done. I guess now I should get to know her. James noticed Suki was staring down in disgust at her lunch, clearly not intending to eat it. James chuckled and pointed to her translator, saying \"The food here is terrible, isn't it?\" After the device translated his statement, Suki giggled, saying something in Japanese, which came from the translator as \"Yes, it certainly is. I think I would rather eat an ogre's gym socks than this slop.\" They both laughed, and James thought to himself \"So far so good. Now what should I talk to her about?\" </span></div></div>",

It was hard to stomach but all he\u2019d get until he went home. He was quite curious, too. Japan was like a holy land in the eyes of most nerds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the device translated Suki responded. \u201cWell I didn\u2019t have a particularly normal life. Even when I was little I was working my family\u2019s shrine. We\u2019re servants of Inari, and so are expected to protect followers from wild and hungry yokai/monsters.\u201d The translator bugged out a little and said both \u2018yokai\u2019 and \u2018monster\u2019 at once. \u201cHonestly I find it unnerving how little my kind this side of the ocean seem to care about our sacred task, but I suppose they\u2019re from the time before we served Inari, when we lived off of humans life force instead of Inari\u2019s praise.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWait did she say protect humans from monsters? You had made an excellent choice of who to befriend, it seemed.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt probably goes without saying I prefer the way you see humans to how others do.\u201d James said and awkwardly chuckled, feeling just a little embarrassed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOhh I\u2019m sure you do. After all humans are treated horribly in this land. Quite odd, since your government is mostly made up of them.\u201d Suki said and sat down her tray \u201cAhh that is all I can stomach of that. Would you like to come off campus and eat with me? We still have time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs that even allowed?\u201d James asked, a bit surprised he hadn\u2019t thought to do that himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, but I can use a spell to let us easily sneak away.\u201d Suki explained and smirked, holding up two fingers as if about to snap them.</span></div></div>",

N-not that I think you do or any-\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time Suki actually cut him off. \u201cYour panic is cute but save it for yokai/monsters.\u201d Again with the translator bug.

Everything around them was titanic. They were maybe two inches tall each, if that. Suki took it in stride and started walking towards the wall \u201cAnd now we head off school property, I grow us back, and we get our preferred lunch~ Do you have money on you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI did this morning.\u201d James hurried to follow her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhatcha spend it on?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI didn\u2019t.\u201d James replied, not needing to explain for it to be clear it was stolen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cyou get bullied alot, huh?\u201d Suki asked without looking back, hands behind her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah.\u201d James said glumly<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell I\u2019ll protect you.\u201d Suki turned her head and smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWait what?! \u201cWait what?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou heard me, but I\u2019ll repeat.\u201d she stopped and turned around, waiting for a pause in the cacophony \u201cI\u2019ll protect you.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuccess on the first try?

Surely, he must have gone completely mad, to make a deal with someone as sadistic as Rene! But as he approached her table, he did so with confidence and and calm expression on his face. He had just come up with an ace up his sleave, something the succubus would never see coming. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe tapped Rene's shoulder, and she turned to face him, a sneer on her face. \"What do you want, worm?\" She practically snarled, only for her scowl to falter when she noticed he was unfazed by it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hear you like to make deals. Particularly with human boys.\" Said James. \"What of it?\" She replied. \"Well, I was wondering what your policy was on such agreements, as I was interested in making one with you.\" Rene's face suddenly changed from contempt to wicked delight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's simple, really. You name whatever it is you desire, and in return you agree to be my property in this life and the next. After I've taken ownership of your soul, you will join the other boys I've claimed, my own personal harem, so to speak. Agreed?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames nodded. Rene snapped her fingers, and a contract and pen appeared in her hands. \"Just sign right here.\" James did so, and the contract disappeared in a flash of fire. \"Now then, what is it that you want?\" \"I want to live a long and full life, without being eaten or enslaved by any monster of any kind.\" Rene was actually impressed. This human was smarter than she thought. Most who make a deal with her kind wish for fame, power, wealth, or all three if they're convenient. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"However...\" James added \"You may not claim my soul until I visit Paris.\" To James' surprise, Rene did not object to this clause. They shook hands, and the deal was sealed. As James went back to his table, he thought to himself \"She actually fell for it! Now all I have to do is never set foot in Paris, and I'm home free!\" </span></div></div>",

As the hallways roared to life, then as the sounds of laughter, feet, and, lockers slamming, you follow the crowds to the further edges of the school building, to the home ec Class. The scent of food, sounds of house work, and, the sight of people meticulously sewing, the calmer part of the school by far. The group you were with was mostly spiritual creatures, some domesticated vampires, and, the occasional human pretender, but you fit in pretty well, as long as nobody smelled you, of tasted you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello everyone! Am Miss.Beetrey! I'll be teaching all of you wonderful younglings about the joys and loves of living at home!\" A blue skinned phantasmal humanoid cheered, her face wasn't particularly special, no pretty. Pleasant would describe her, yet the eyes glowed a warm amber and her hair was of the same color. She had legs, but floated around the room, gliding over desks and students , spinning and dancing as you each took a seat in her room. The while room was quietly seated with your group of four being the farthest from the door, with you taking the seat in the corner, which was a <b>very</b> bad choice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay class! Let's all get to know our little families for today and tomorrow we'll gather up to talk about what we are going to start learning!\" Miss.Beetrey announced taking her time as she circled the class room getting to know her little groups and students. Which left you all alone with the other three people in your tiny seat of four, each one having an advantage over the other in terms of how main a human, or how to torment you with their supernatural powers. To your left was the literal omega of the school, the werewolf of Shade Geist, Zoe Lupricale. She was the top pack leader of the school's lycanthropes, all of them, no matter the species, their background, or how crazy they got, she would always win, even worse she's also a magical werewolf, which explains everything, and makes you more terrified of her. The second biggest fear is the cloaked robed guy, yeah he's lanky like a stick bug, but he's an ethereal, they are <b>literal magic stuff</b>! He wears them to be nice, because anybody who knows him, also knows he can be a walking magical catastrophe. Rainstorms? No, try gravity storms, with fire raining from the ground and water boiling on contact, last September was the year summer vacation literally ended when autumn begin. That's why the call the rag and bone man, Zeke, a problem, he got angry once. The last person across from me is the president of the student council, Zhu lie. Who was always on fire, making a fire, exploding, purifying people, organizing things, boiling water, and, oddly enough using ashes to improve the school gardens, considering her enormous lost of things to burn, which she read in multiple classes, you never spoke to her, never made eye contact, and, never, under any circumstances, ever approached her, which is the real reason you've been able to stay alive. Increasingly desperate survival, for the human race, you might be the last hope, you hope not. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right everyone, let's get to know each other! Am Zhu lie, our class president, and, I want to be able to do my best this year!\" She begins by pumping her fist in the air. With a cute smile, suited better for a killer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Am Zoe, I want to ride a motorcycle.\" The wolf speaks, but doesn't say anything more, she just turns to you, in an aloof tone, she says, \"your turn\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Am James Wilson, I like to keep to myself.\" You say, as if it's normal, which draws the attention of Zhu lie, who frowns as you toss the baton to Zeke. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My name is Zeke, I am happy to learn about things.\" He whispers, like he's speaking directly to your ear, but it's hard not to jump at his voice, since most of the monsters here, seem to enjoy being able to keep themselves satisfied. You begin to lean forward, to try and escape the barrage of questions, placing your arms in the best position for sleeping possible, you glance back at Zoe, remembering the fact that those teeth have wrapped around more people's throats that you can count, chose no to sleep. So you begin to doodle on the paper in front of you, trying to distract yourself from the trio that can snap their fingers and wipe your existence from this earth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, James?\" The voice of Zhu lie speaks, sounding genuinely concerned, yet also happy, enthused really. You look up to her, making eye contact with her, them breaking away going back to your doodles. \"James, the use of runes, sigils, and, circles aren't allowed during school.\" She speaks, a bit more demanding. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is not a magical mark of any kind, president, those are simple lead pencil lines on paper, drawing as humans called it.\" Zeke cuts in, his head, twisting completely upside down to gaze into the paper, like some sort of owl, or well undead creature, it made you wonder if he had a neck of any kind under all that cloth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you? A human sympathizer? Like those weirdos at the colonies?\" Zoe asks, taking the paper, realizing the details on the spiral notebook, with a strange hand she's begins to flip the pages, as you sit down and just watch, knowing what will happen is you try to fight back. She slowly and meticulously turns every page, judging each picture with a steel gaze, her face, is empty of any emotion, or curiosity, she's taking her time, but she just grabs it and tucks it away under her massive hand. You just blink at her, waiting for her words, to which there are none, she has some kind of gaze at you, and it is then, when you begin to feel it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"She wants to guage my reaction, she's trying to see what I'll do, how to best pick me apart, see thinks am a monster in hiding? Or does she know am human? Either way, the notebook is gone.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou just think for a few seconds, letting the moment pas without any incident, you reach into your bag and pull out another bag, this time the drawings are more detailed, varied, and, this sketch book is more valued by your own personal feelings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know what I was expecting, but that's just sad.\" Zoe says, sliding the notebook away to Zhu lie, who in a huff just looks at you with some kind of pity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't cause trouble for the people who want to look human! It's common courtesy in some places to keep up with outward and inward appearances! The dukes of old England do it! As do the southern barbarians! It's etiquette!\" Zhu lie starts, as she flips through the pages, some what excited by the drawings, with Zeke's head now hanging twisted over her should, his whole body wrapped around the table. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't mind, it's not the first time it's happened, nor the last.\" You tell them, letting the conversation die with these words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"James? You so not display your heritage's power and blessing?\" Zeke asks, inquisitively moving his long cloak into a snake like body meeting you eye to eye. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't.\" The answer that usually sends the crowds reeling, as if it was a spit to their pride, that idea that power is not always up for fighting for, but that you don't care about displays of strength, not like they do anyways. The policy the educational institutions had adopted was a don't show, and don't tell, meaning a vampire can look human, as can a werewolf, but neither needs to show it, like having a concealed weapon in human times, same concept, you basically have to guess what you're around, which unless you have some kind of six sense or know what to look for, then its a guessing game, which makes me even more scared of Zhu lie, since she isn't a spirit, you rules that out a long time ago. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow. I heard there were some crazy dumbasses like that, but here? In the new south kingdoms? I can't even believe it, nine hells, that's beyond sad.\" Zoe begins, just look absolutely disgusted by the mention of not being interested in fighting against the other species of the world. \"My kind were exceptional in the human uprisings, hunting down the revolutionaries and destroying their camps, we had like some of the most kills and best battles.\" She begins, floating about her bloodline, as she stands over you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Until the midnight duelists and grand silvers appeared at Austin, Texas. Which lead to the decimation of eighty one lycanthrope teibes, seven of the noble vampire clans, two vampire progenitors, twelve war golems from the age of ancient, and, the loss of the elven king Midas Fuorthrak.\" You cut into her speech, letting it be know of the real results, the way the war ended wasn't with glory, just a one sided slaughter, which created the Texas arid mesquite jungles in the heart of the state, something the elves regret, as in the mesquite, while a good fire wood, wasn't understood by their magics users, sadly it only pushed the revolutionaries into a more bold tactical situation, which resulted in the loss of more life on the magical creature's side, creating a free city, which was sadly a know paradise for your kind, but also the last of the human dynasties, the know family who rules was the Salazar family, who has had success after success.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, you might be some kind of fucking mut mix bastard, but wolves don't back down.\" Zoe begins, grabbing you by the collar, yanking you to her snout. \"<b>When a wolf gets bit, we bite back twice as hard, get the fucking picture?\"</b>. She says through a growl, holding you with one hand, her other griping the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go ahead, kill me. I've lived a good life.\" You tell her, as you take a breath, close your eyes, you bless yourself, then say nothing, waiting for the rip of claws, teeth, the snap of your neck, something, the darkness preventing anything from reacting, no ideas, just acceptance. The whole room is quiet, no sound or breathing is heard by you, just you and her in everyone's eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck you!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoe yells.</span></div></div>",

As he was getting his things from his locker and preparing to leave, he was still thinking of his choices from before. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting himself a monster as a girlfriend wouldn't exactly be easy, since he was pretty much as average as a human boy could be. Making a deal with Rene was also probably not a smart idea, who knows what she would want in return? He was seriously considering asking Nick to show him some magic so that he could at least defend himself from any potential predators. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs these thoughts ran through his head, he was lost in his own world, not paying attention to where he was going. And in this world, that was likely to be a one way ticket to trouble... or worse. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point, he had left the school ahead of the other students, and was absent mindedly headed home. But as he stepped into the street, he heard the sound of screeching tires and turned just in time to see a large van mere inches from him!</span></div></div>",

He lands flat on his back and looses consciousness, everything fading to black. The next thing he knows, he's waking up surrounded by a crowd of humans and monsters alike, all staring down at him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sits up and is surprised to find that he is not in any kind of pain at all. The impact from the van should have at minumum broken his rib cage, yet he felt absolutely nothing. Even stranger, the crowd continues to look down at hwhere he had been and murmur to each other. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, what are you all staring at?\" James says as he turns to see that his body is still there on the ground, yet he was standing right there looking down at himself! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs James begins to panic, an ambulance arrives and a couple of paramedics load his body onto a stretcher. \"What's happening to me!?\" He exclaims as the crowd begins to disperse, all except for one woman dressed in a black suit and skirt, scribbling on a clipboard. \"Another one gone before their time.\" She mumbles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, can you see me?\" James asks, and the woman nods, not even looking up. \"Yes, I see and hear you. I suppose you've figured out what's happening right now?\" James hesitated. He knew in his gut what was going on, but he found it difficult to actually state. \"Am I...dead?\" The woman nodded again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames couldn't help but laugh dryly at the irony. Just this after noon he had been plotting how his survival plan, and he didn't even last the day! What's more, it wasn't a monster's hunger that did him in, but his own stupidity! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman continued \"Fortunatley for you, or unfortunately depending on how you look at it, you were not actually scheduled to die today.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Exactly what I said, this was just a sort of freak accident, which means the afterlife isn't ready for you yet.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what happens now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you have two choices. See, since you weren't supposed to die today, you'll just have to wait until the day you were scheduled to die to roll around. Until then, I can take you to Limbo, where you can just wait it out the, or you can stay here on earth until then. So, what would you rather do?</span></div></div>",
