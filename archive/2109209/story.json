Rubbing your tired eyes, the face of the devil, AKA your twin sister Kasey, only in her underwear, filled your vision. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWakey wakey weirdo! Don't want to miss the last day of Junior year do you?\u201d She asked, with her still sitting on your chest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRolling your eyes, you let your head drop back onto the pillow. Grumbling something inconsiderate, you pushed her off your chest. A smile formed on your face as you heard the thud. Climbing out of bed, you stumbled over to the bathroom, which your little brother John had just run from when he saw you coming. He hid around the corner, and you just sighed and shook your head. Walking inside, you clicked the door shut, then locked it. It became muscle memory to lock the door since John always tried to spy on you, Kasey, and your mother Ellis.He never seemed to in get in trouble when he got caught though. Mom would say that is was \u201cjust a phase\u201d and continue on about her business. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter checking the room for any \u201csurprises\u201d he left and smelling the body wash for anything different, you turned the shower on, stripped, and began showering. The water was absolutely freezing, but you didn't really care. You finished relatively quickly, and dried off. With a swipe of a hand, the foggy mirror revealed the old, tired soul that was Sarah Mcbride.After drying your hair and face, and brushing your teeth you sauntered back over to your room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n10 mins later, you walked out in a pair of blue jeans and a black hoodie. Stepping into the bathroom to finish getting ready, a hand stopped you from progressing any further. Kasey was in her tan and blue cheerleader outfit applying makeup to herself, trying to mimic something out of a Glamour magazine. Even though you two were exactly alike in looks, you prefer not to be the \u201cpopular girl\u201d that your sister is. The school was apparently doing some kind of performance for the senior walk. You weren't to sycked about the colors though. When she finished, you continued your morning routine of brushing your hair, flipping it up into a ponytail, then applying very miniscule amounts of make-up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCompletely finished, you walked down the stairs and into the kitchen. John was in his school uniform, eating some eggs while mom was cooking some more. Dad was in the corner table, talking on the phone with a client. Kasey was busy on her phone, probably texting her \u201cfriends\u201d. Grabbing a small plate of eggs, you wolfed them down, and headed off to school. It was about a 15 min walk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the way there, you spotted Ashley and Jane walking ahead of you. From this distance, it looked as if they were holding hands, but you couldn't be sure. You asked them once if they were a thing, but before you could even finish your sentence, Ashley hastily denied it. They spotted you, and decided to stop and wait for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Sarah! Ready for today?\u201d Jane asked, casting a friendly smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot really. I think i might have summer school, but i'm not sure. And Kasey has cheer practice all summer long\u2026 You guys excited?\u201d you replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, duh\u2026 it's the end of the year.\u201d Ashley retorted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the walk was filled with conversations ranging from school to video games. Reaching school, you three split to separate classes. First was Chemistry, which you were currently failing. Then after that it was home-ec then gym. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting down next to your lab partner, you could immediately tell that something was up. Her face was a sickly green, and she had a runny nose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPerfect, the weird girl is sick.\u201d you thought to yourself. You removed your jacket, laying it over the back of the chair. The class had nothing to do yet, so you just laid your head down to sleep. A sudden \u201cachoo!\u201d erupted from beside you, and you felt blobs of something wet and slimy cover your arm and the nape of your neck. You slowly lifted your head out your arms, and saw the small girl covering her nose and mouth, her eyes wide and staring directly at your arm and head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh no\u2026 I am so sorry!\u201d she began, but you just held up a hand, and wiped the snot off your arm and neck with your jacket. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou don't understand though... \u201c but you cut her off, stood up, and left the class for the restroom. <br>\r\n--------------------------------------------------<br>\r\nThe rest of the day was uneventful. You decided to skip the senior walk entirely, and just headed home instead. Walking in the door, you dropped your bag off in the living room, and proceeded up the stairs to your bedroom. Within a few moments, you had quite literally fallen into bed, and crashed. The next morning, you woke up feeling wonderful, except your view was all distorted. One side of your head was completely flat. Feeling your face, it was completely malleable. Oh shit. But you couldn't worry about that now because...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cWhat the hell!\u201d You cried, you voice oddly muffled due to half of your face being squashed. Before you could fully process what was going on, you heard footsteps out in the hallway, and a door being opened. You realized with fear that it was your mother going around the house collecting the dirty laundry. She was surely going to stop by your mom next!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were freaking out, and weren\u2019t able to think clearly at all. In a hasty panic, you decided that there was no way you were going to let your mother find you in this terrible, gummy state. You began squashing yourself, folding up different parts of your body. Finally, you were nothing but a blob of gummy, though to your surprise, you found you could move slightly if you put all of your energy into it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were lying on your bed, so you wiggled your way to the edge, and plummeted to the carpeted floor. Your plan was to then roll under the bed and hide their until the coast was clear, but then you realized the horrible flaw in your plan. The previous night, you had stripped your clothes off and tossed them in a pile on the floor. Now, your squishy body had landed right on top of that pile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that exact moment, your bedroom door swung open, and your mom walked inside. She was carrying a large basket filled to the brim with dirty clothes. She headed over to your hamper, and poured the contents into her basket. Right as she was about to leave, she spotted the pile of clothes by your bed, the same pile you were currently in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSarah, Sarah, Sarah.\u201d Ellis sighed. \u201cHow many times have I told you not to leave dirty clothe strewn about?\u201d Your mom stomped over to you, and you could do nothing but stare up at her in fear. You were paralyzed, in awe and in fear at the sheer monumental size of your mother. You couldn\u2019t even see her face, as her large breasts jutted out from her body like a shelf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mother didn\u2019t notice the odd weird lump at the top of the pile, and merely scooped you up into her arms. This position brought you back to reality, and you shuffled and squirmed for all it was worth, but it was too late. Your mom dumped you into the hamper, and you fell in first, with the rest of your clothes burying you underneath. Your mom then lifted up the basket and carried it out of the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe basket was full, and so Ellis strolled down to the basement, where she already had the washing machine prepped and ready. She tilted the basket, causing you and a mountain of clothes to fall into the dark and metallic basin of the washing machine. Your mother hummed a little tune, blissfully unaware of the fate she was about to subject her daughter to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA deep sense of dread filled you as you heard a few clinks and beeps, and then freezing cold water began to pour out into the basin. The water flooded the basin quickly, and soon you were soaking wet. As the machine began to spin, you were tossed head over heels, quickly loosing sense of direction and position inside of the giant, pitch black washing machine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWet articles of clothing slapped left and right, sending your tiny, squishy body ricocheting into every corner of the basin. Finally, your body collided with the inside cup of a bra, and you felt your now gummy flesh adhere to the fabric of the bra. This effect only intensified with the water pressure pounding against you, until finally your body flattened out, and you stuck to the bra like a sticker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wash cycle came to an end, but your pain and suffering did not. All of the clothes were retrieved from the washing machine, and deposited into the dryer. The spinning and whirling began once again, only this time intense heat baked your body to a crisp. To your horror, your skin began to crawl, and then melt into goop. It felt like every inch of your body was being sucked away, and you lost feeling in your arms and legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you were melting down, the spinning of the dryer kept constant pressure on your body, forcing you into the cup of the bra. As such, your liquid body was being sucked up into the fabric of the bra at the same pace that you were melting. By the time the dryer stopped, you had been absorbed into the very fabric of the bra, essentially becoming a part of it. It would take a long time to reform at this point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, you didn\u2019t even know what reforming meant. You didn\u2019t even know what had happened to your body, or how things had spiraled so quickly out of control. Part of you wished that this was all just a bad dream, but deep down you knew this was real life. Somehow, you had become squishy, and in less than an hour, you had been absorbed into the left cup of a random bra. To make matters worse, the bra was tan, and so you blended in almost perfectly. Only a small outline of your face could be seen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bra was pulled out of the washing machine, and you caught a quick glimpse of your mom before she folded the two cups together, casting you into darkness. You were dropped into a basket filled with many other articles of clothing. It was at this moment you realized you had no idea whose clothes basket you were in. The owner of the basket could make all the difference in determining your future, so whose basket is it?</span></div></div>",

Praying to\u2026 basically anyone who was listening, you hoped that it wasn't Kasey\u2019s, who had cheer practice; or your mother, who seemingly never takes hers off. You felt your stomach drop as the basket was lifted into the air. Even in the pitch black, you became nauseated by the constant swinging motion as she carried the basket under her arm. Everything was heavily muffled, but you could just make out the voices around you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKasey, have you seen your sister? She wasn't in bed this morning.\u201d Your mother asked, stepping up the stairs towards the bedrooms. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, I haven't. Shes probably at her friend's house. Are those mine?\u201d You heard Kasey ask from a distance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, it\u2019s your sister\u2019s. Be a doll and put them on her bed for me.\u201d your mother said, then you could feel your basket shifting to another person's hands. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn't believe your luck! This was your bra! Making a mental sigh of relief, you felt a door being pushed open. Your entire world was shifted upside down as the clothes were unceremoniously dumped on your bed. Finally, you could see light again and you could see your sister rummaging through your clothes, making sure that mom hadn't mixed any up. Her eyes landed on you, and you paused all thought as she lifted your bra up, and gave a puzzled look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat a weird design. it looks like Sarah\u2019s face is on the inside of the bra. Must definitely be Sarah\u2019s.\u201d She said, dropping the bra right back down onto the pile. She left, closing the door behind you. You sat there a minute, wondering what you could do. You needed to get back together, and get out of this mess. Concentrating with all your might until your brain hurt, you could slowly feel your body forming back together. peeling your now flattened form from the bra cup, you slowly began reshaping, until you had formed into your old self\u2026 well, a version of it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou now stood no bigger than the pile of clothes beside you. Somehow, the washing machine had taken so much of your body away, that you now stood at about 6 inches tall, completely naked. With the world so much bigger, you knew that you could no longer fit into standard clothing. Too bad Chris had\u2026 ruined all your old gummy toys, You could've worn the clothes. Lets just say you didn't want to touch them afterwards. You caught him putting one of the toys into his\u2026 thingy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA car door had closed outside, and you went over your window to investigate. Kasey was getting into mom's car in her cheerleading outfit. Thank god you hadn't been in her bra. The two of them were leaving, which was good because all that left in the house was\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA sudden trample of feet was headed right for your room. You had to hide NOW. Looking for a spot, you noticed that there was an opening in the mass of clothes, so you dived inside. the steps were even closer now. Needing cover, you grabbed a pair of tan panties, and rolled yourself inside them. The door opened, and you heard a hand sifting through the pile. The pair of panties you had covering you were ripped off, and you saw his face looming above you. In his hand were a pair of your moms panties. And his pants were around his ankles. His eyes had met your scared, stiff body, and you gulped. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo Sarah got a new gummy doll\u201d He said to himself with a grin.</span></div></div>",

John enjoyed himself continuing to caress his dick, whiffing the dirty pair again before setting them down. You quietly remained as he rummaged through the basket, \"Nothing! Mom must have just cleaned them,\" he spoke loudly with disappointment before adverting his attention towards you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBroken in an uncontrollable sweat you grew nervous for safety, John's vision set on you as his dirty intentions coming forward. \"What should I do?\" you asked yourself concerning the only two possible outcomes, either you speak hoping John might help you or end in a crucial situation. According to him, you a regular gummy doll left out in the open only after in his company you classify more like a sex doll, having to swallow his cum or perhaps even taking it by the loads in your ass makes you dread even more. It seemed like all hope lost, John was going to take you with him when suddenly without warning to either of you the doorknob began to twist open. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn where did I put my phone,\" the voice utter from your twin sister Kasey who entered, immediately taking notice to John with his pants dropped below his knees in her room. \"What the fuck were you doing?\" Kasey yelled in a hostile tone already knowing the answer towards her question, observing him pulled his pants up pretending like everything was normal. \"I ahh,\" John stuttered knowing whatever he said it wouldn't matter after being caught in the act, his only rational response was running out the door. \"You're a disgusting pervert I'm telling mom,\" Kasey screamed out as she watched John run like a coward, locking the door behind she made her way over to the laundry basket. \"Look at this mess,\" Kasey spoke with annoyance, cleaning up the mess up and folding her twin sister's clothes, only to stop what she was doing after discovering you. \"What the hell is this Sarah's,\" Kasey asked picking you to glance over, \"Eww, Why does it look so similar to her also,\" she noted on fiddling with your tiny squishy body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou moan as Kasey continuously squashed your boobs within your body, then dangle you upside down spreading your legs open as she rubbed your sex to feel the design. \"It's rather creepy that this doll almost seems real,\" Kasey talks as she proceeded to stretch you out, your arms and legs became noddles as they retracted back to normal, bending your torse forward driving your face deep into your pussy. Kasey laughed pretending you're giving head to yourself, \"Oh man if this were real Sarah it be ten times better,\" Kasey says setting you back to normal as you gasped for breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had enough of the torment it was time to speak, \"Kasey!\" you shouted out \"It's me you have to help,\" you beg for sisterly assistance, only your sudden speaking startled poor Kasey dropping you back in the laundry basket. \"SARAH!\" Kasey declared with an ominous tone, poking mutlipe times that knocked you on your feet, \"How did you get so small? How did you become malleable,\" Kasey asked with astonishment. \"If I knew Kasey I wouldn't be naked and 6 inches tall,\" you replied with anger wanting your normal life back, as Kasey gripped you in her hand. \"Do mom and dad know about this?\" she questioned with an interesting excited pitch. \"No! I haven't told anyone yet so if you could,\" you were silenced as Kasey squished your lips shut. \"So they don't perfect!\" Kasey said with a devilish grin that was never a good sign for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKasey heard the honking from your mother still in the car waiting, \"Crap! Cheerleading practice,\" Kasey utters wondering where to keep you until she gets back as her eyes locked on to the dirty panties your brother brought in. Kasey retched as she got a whiff of them, \"God! I can't tell if these are mom's lazy pair or her gym ones?\" as she began squishing you in the fibers. The scent hit your nose with such rancidness that you could practically taste the air. \"I can't wait to come back and mess with you more,\" as she stuffed you in the drawer leaving you trapped. You knew it would get worse when she came back home. Afterhours of waiting for Kasey the smell was getting to you badly when the draw finally open and you saw...</span></div></div>",

Was it something to do with that weird girl sneezing on you the other day? You had no idea, but to your surprise, your face slowly reformed back to normal over a span of ten minutes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you could dwell on that any longer, your phone buzzed, and you saw a text from Ashley and Jane. They were on their way over, and would arrive in ten minutes. You quickly jumped out of bed, throwing on a red t-shirt and red shorts, before freshening up in the bathroom. You had just finished breakfast when the doorbell rang. Opening it up revealed your two best friends in the whole world, Ashley and Jane.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had so much in common with Ashley and Jane, and you had known them for so long that the three of you were practically inseparable. Both girls were fairly well endowed, with rather impressive curves in all the right places. Ashely was wearing a low-cut re blouse and tight red leggings, while Jane was wearing a gorgeous blue dress that fluttered down to her thighs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey girl! We match-batch!\u201d Ashley giggled, gesturing to your own, all-red outfit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh wow. I guess we do.\u201d You smiled, not quite in a perfect mood. The experience from this morning was still bothering you immensely. Jane picked up on your mood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong Sarah?\u201d She inquired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh? It\u2019s nothing.\u201d You lied, but then thought of a valid excuse. \u201cIt\u2019s just\u2026I have summer school.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou do? That sucks.\u201d Ashley nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah. Only in Chemistry, but still. It\u2019s a pain. I\u2019ll have to start attending soon. I DEFINITELY do not want to be held back a year.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, of course.\u201d Jane laughed. \u201cWhat we do without you?\u201d Ashley and Jane walked inside, and the three girls headed into the living room. Your mom and brother passed you by, saying that they were leaving for the mall. They would be back later in the evening. You said goodbye to them and then turned your attention back to your friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDoes a movie marathon sound alright to you?\u201d You suggested, trying to think of something that would raise your spirits. Your friends nodded in agreement, so you fetched a few DVDs from your personal collection. To start, you slid \u201cMean Girls\u201d into the DVD player, and the main menu screen popped up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait a sec, I have to use the bathroom.\u201d Ashley cried, dashing out of the room and heading into the bathroom. You and Jane shared a quick laugh. You sat down on the large couch Ashley had been sitting on, while Jane chose a plush chair in the corner. Moments after sitting down, her phone began to ring, so she excused herself and exited the living room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that you were all alone, you couldn\u2019t control your curiosity anymore. You poked and prodded at your face, feeling it squish and squash. With a bit of hesitation, you put pressure on your stomach, and it too began to flatten. You were freaking out at this point, but some strange sensation within you urged you to test out the limits of this new affliction that had befallen you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext thing you knew, you had squashed yourself down to only a foot in height, and you made up only a tiny bit of space on the wide couch. Knowing that you could reform, you actually found bit of enjoyment in being small and squishy, as it was a brand new experience you had never even thought of encountering before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, all enjoyment flooded away as you heard the bathroom door open, and footsteps walk towards the living room. You heard a soft grunting noise, and then a shadow fell upon you. Looking up, you saw Ashley had propelled herself up and over the edge of the couch, and she was coming in for a landing. Her gigantic, red leggings clad ass filled your vision, and then came crashing down on you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were crushed instantaneously, with a wave of pain washing over your body. You mentally cried out in agony, not fully realizing yet that your pleas were silent, and not able to be heard. Your body flattened out, squashed senseless under Ashley\u2019s powerful ass. The tight fabric of her leggings pressed against you, and you felt the full weight of your best friend weighing down on you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe situation was even worse that just that though. You had been slammed into her face first, and so all you could see was darkness. It also meant any outsiders couldn\u2019t see you either. Also, your all-red outfit blended in almost perfectly with Ashley\u2019s red leggings, save for the tiny tan blobs that were your feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAshley? Where did Sarah go?\u201d The muffled voice of Jane asked, as she walked back into the room. \u201cShe was sitting right there.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know. She wasn\u2019t here when I walked in.\u201d Ashley shrugged, standing up. She turned around to peer down the hallway for signs of you, presenting her rear end to Jane. Jane\u2019s gaze rested on you for a moment, but does she spot you?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cWait. Hold on Ashley.\u201d Jane spoke up, and bent down in front of her friend\u2019s sizable rear. She rubbed her hand across Ashley\u2019s ass, and felt your faint outline. Ashley shivered a bit, her flesh jiggling slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJane? What are you doing?\u201d She inquired, wondering why her friend was feeling up her butt. Deep down, Ashley had feelings for Jane, and she knew the feeling was mutual, but she didn\u2019t expect Jane to be so bold in public.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou have something stuck to your butt.\u201d Jane explained, and she gripped your flattened body. With a strong tug, you popped free from Ashley\u2019s round butt, but not one hundred percent intact. Your clothes ripped off of your body, and remained stuck to Ashley\u2019s sweaty ass. You were now completely naked, and left to the mercy of your giantess best friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley sat back down, and Jane sat down beside her. Jane stretched and pulled you slightly, which made it even harder for her to discern your already smeared bodily features. She scrunched up her hand, clenching it into a fist, and causing your body to compress and squish between her fingers. She did this several times, a smile slowly spreading on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s gummy material, right?\u201d Ashely asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah. A tan glob of gummy material. I wonder why this was sitting on the couch.\u201d Jane wondered, continuing to play with you while she talked. \u201cIt\u2019s in really good condition. It must be brand new.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh no. I recognize that look in your eye.\u201d Ashley sighed. \u201cThis belongs to Sarah, don\u2019t you think? Are you just going to steal it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI doubt she\u2019ll miss it.\u201d Jane shrugged. \u201cYou know I can\u2019t pass up fresh gummy material when I find it. I\u2019m always looking for ways to increase my clothing making skills.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know. I know. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll make something amazing with it too.\u201d Ashley grinned, resigned to her friend\u2019s determination. Your sudden disappearance had slipped their mind over the course of their conversation and discovery of the \u201cgummy material\u201d, and so they started up the movie and relaxed on the couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJane placed your mangled form on her lap, and you could do nothing but stare up at your two best friends for the next several hours, as they laughed and cried along with all of your favorite movies. Whenever your body grew close to reforming, Jane would pick you up, squash you for a few minutes, and set you back down. It was like fate was compelling Jane to ruin your chances at being rescued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, it was beginning to get dark outside, and another movie had ended. Realizing that it was probably about time to head home, Ashley and Jane stood up, turned off the TV, and walked out of the house. Jane gripped you tightly, and slipped you into her pocket on the way out the door. You couldn\u2019t believe that your friends had just forgotten about you completely. You thought that they of all people would\u2019ve saved you from this mess. Instead, they were causing it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJane got into her car and drove back to her house, ideas racing in her head about what to do with her little gummy present. Once at home, she sprinted up to her bedroom, and closed the door behind her. She pulled you out and dropped you onto a smooth wooden desk. She rummaged around her room for a few minutes, giving you time to glance at your surroundings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could see several plastic molds, a few pairs of tweezers, bottles of glitter and sparkles, cans of fabric dye (apparently in every shade of color imaginable), and a box with ribbons and other assorted strings and such. There was also a big bottle marked \u201cBeta4\u201d, which looked to be some sort of chemical. You had never heard of it before, but the sight of it gave you chills.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJane sat down at her desk, and slipped a pair of black latex gloves onto her hands. She smiled down at you, and there was something incredibly terrifying about the look she was giving you. You squirmed for all it was worth, but your minuscule movements went unnoticed. With a glint in her eye, Jane cracked her knuckles and opened her mouth to speak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright then. What am I going to make you into?\u201d</span></div></div>",

With that being said, everything was still dark around you, even after a few minutes to let your eyes adjust. You tried to move your body, but it refused to budge. In fact, it almost felt as if your entire lower half was flattened. Finally, it dawned on you what had happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was no doubt in your mind that your beautiful wife, Mckayla, had once again rolled over you in her sleep. Even thought you were only two feet tall, and very malleable, your loving and caring, five foot eight wife still insisted that you shared the same bed. Hardly a day went by where you didn\u2019t wake up with some part of your body plastered to her curvaceous figure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight now, it appeared that your body was crushed flat under her sizable ass, and until she moved, there really wasn\u2019t anything you could do about it. Thankfully, she started to stir after about ten minutes, until finally she stood up. You were pressed first into her bare flesh, so everything was still dark, but you could feel the pressure loosen as she stood up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMckayla yawned and stretched her arms, trying to rub the sleep out of her eyes. She stumbled over to her closet, where she pulled out a pair of panties and a bra. She dropped the underwear to the floor and began putting it on. Not wanting to spend the day as a sticker on your wife\u2019s shapely rear, you used all of your energy to wiggle free, popping off of her butt and landing on your bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you laid on the bed and began to reform, you were treated to a show of your oblivious spouse sliding the panties up her thick thighs and into place around her wide hips. Thankfully, you reformed just in time to jump out of the way as she plopped down onto the bed to wiggle some leggings up her body. Once the coast was clear, you walked up to her and hugged her from behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood morning honey!\u201d You said, giving her a soothing backrub. She let out a \u201cpurring\u201d noise and shuddered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood morning hot stuff.\u201d She grinned, and turned around, lifting her legs up onto the bed. She grabbed you, brought you up to her face, and planted a huge kiss on you, her plush lips covering up almost half of your face. Her kiss lasted fifteen seconds, and she released you with a loud \u201cSMACK\u201d. Her saliva coated your face, but it had felt wonderful, so you didn\u2019t care.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s your plan for today?\u201d You asked her as she set you back down. She stood up and brushed her hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI have some important work today.\u201d She sighed. \u201cIt\u2019s probably going to be pretty boring though.\u201d Mckayla worked as a receptionist for a famous modeling agency. She described it as being a boring desk job, but at least it paid exceptionally well. \u201cI\u2019m going to clean up in the bathroom, and then head down for breakfast. I\u2019ll see you this evening!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMckayla blew you a kiss and headed into the bathroom. You heard the door close, and you shook your head. She had had no idea she had been squashing you under her butt for presumably hours during the night. Mckayla was drop dead gorgeous, and one of the sexiest women alive, but also one of the most oblivious, forgetful, and ditziest. Still, her loving and caring nature had kept you happy and content for years.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou dropped down from the bed and walked out of the room. Glancing around the hallway, you saw that both of your children\u2019s rooms were closed. They were most likely still asleep, something you didn\u2019t have any problems with. Ryan was a great kid, and you had a lot in common with him, but his video games were often quite loud, and you could use some peace and quiet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the other hand, Vicky terrified you to no end. She was your daughter, sure, but often she saw you as nothing more than a plaything that existed for her amusement. She would crush you, mold you into something humiliating, or anything in between. And she would get away with it, due in part to her perfectly innocent act and gift for lying, and your wife\u2019s sweet and accepting nature. Vicky also took after Mckayla in the looks department, and was growing into an incredibly attractive woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe trip down the stairs and into the kitchen took you a while at your small size, but at least it was simple. Once in the kitchen, you scaled the cabinets and jumped from one to the other, quickly assembling a few pieces of toast and a glass of orange juice for breakfast. You dropped the meal down on the table and knelt down in front of it, ready to enjoy your meal. A brand new day had just begun, and you just hoped nothing terrible would happen.</span></div></div>",

            ],
            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Right as you were about to start digging into your meal, you felt the urge to sneeze. A tingling sensation welled up within your nose, and your face scrunched up reflexively. After a few seconds of sniffing in air, the sneeze exploded out of your nose. You fell backwards from the force of the blast, only to find out you had misjudged how close you were to the edge of the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead of smacking against the table, your head and upper back slipped right over the edge. Unable to catch yourself on the smooth surface of the tablecloth, you tumbled down onto the kitchen chair waiting below. You landed roughly on your back, squishing slightly from the impact. More or less, you were unharmed though, and so you laughed the incident off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh wow!\u201d Mckayla\u2019s voice thundered, cutting your laughter off. \u201cHe made me breakfast. That\u2019s so sweet!\u201d Your wife giggled happily, and approached the table. She hadn\u2019t seen your fall, and had no idea you were even in the room. You hadn\u2019t expected her to finish in the bathroom and come downstairs so soon, so you hadn\u2019t even planned for something like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour chair was pulled back, and you looked up in horror at your giantess spouse. Her legs stretched on for miles, until they reached her wide hips and impressive ass. On the topic of ass, Mckayla\u2019s was getting closer and closer as she bent down to sit in the seat, not noticing your body lying there. You opened your mouth to scream, but you were a second too late.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMckayla descended onto you, and her plump rear squashed you like a bug. Your gummy body flattened out instantly, being reduced to paper under your wife\u2019s weight. Worse of all was that Mckayla, in her haste to leave to work, false joy at interpreting your breakfast as her own, and large, jiggly ass, hadn\u2019t even felt you. The only person who could help you had no idea that you were crushed under their butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tried to escape, even though you knew it was futile. You couldn\u2019t squirm, wiggle, or move at all. You couldn\u2019t reform with this much pressure weighing down on you. You couldn\u2019t talk, because your mouth was as flat as paper. Your entire body was as flat as paper for that matter. Since you had been on your back, your face was also pressed deeply into her leggings, and all you could see was darkness. All you could do was wait for her to stand up, and hope that the worst case scenario didn\u2019t come true.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, fate had it out for you, and the worst case scenario came to pass. When Mckayla stood up, your flat body went with her. She had exerted enough pressure to partially stick your gummy body to her butt. She strolled to the front door, her ass and you wiggling back and forth with each step. As she headed out the door, your daughter Vicky descended the stairs and spotted you. She simply blew you a kiss and laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMckayla plopped down into her car faster than you could reform, forcing you to endure the fifteen minute drive to the modeling agency. During the trip, each bump in the road caused her to rise up and slam back down, crushing you painfully. With each passing second, you felt your body stick more and more to the fabric of her leggings. This was quickly spiraling into a horrible situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMckayla reached the modeling agency, which was known as Sunshine Photography. Companies from all around the world would send their products to Sunshine Photography, and one of the many models who worked at the agency would take pictures with the product and send the pictures back. They charged a lot of money but most companies knew that Sunshine Photography was the best agency in the business.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs boring as the job was, Mckayla was able to find joy in other ways. The pay was through the roof, and more than enough to cover for the fact that you didn\u2019t work. She also got to meet a lot of famous supermodels, and sometimes try out the products that were sent in from companies. Most of the time was relegated to desk work, and so that\u2019s where she headed once she reached the agency.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she strutted to her desk, you knew you had a very small window of escape. If you didn\u2019t get off of her butt before she sat down, you would be trapped beneath your wife for hours, and would no doubt be engrained into her leggings by the time the day ended. This was not a fate you wanted to endure, so you squirmed for all it was worth, putting all of your focus into reforming.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You struggled valiantly against the grasp of your jiggly prison, knowing what your fate would be if you were not able to escape. You've been stuck to articles of Mckayla's clothing enough to know exactly how the process would go. She would inevitably wear you for hours and hours, until possibly noticing you, but even then her ditzy nature would likely lead her to forget about you once more and continue her unaware torture. You desperately wanted to avoid another of these situations so you focused what minimal strength you had into reforming. With each step of your giantess wife wobbling her ass tremendously this was no small feat, but little by little you felt your body peel off the fabric of her leggings. Just as Mckayla was about to reach her office, the last bit of your crushed body popped off! You fell to the ground, squishing yourself a bit more in the process but still in a mostly reformed state. You simply watched your gorgeous wife's buns rise and fall as they turned a corner and headed out of sight. Once she was gone you got back to reforming, and soon enough popped back into your normal, albeit 2 foot tall, human shape. At that moment you heard a feminine voice ring out behind you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What in the world\" the woman behind you stated softly. You quickly turned around to face her, seeing a woman nearly as beautiful as your wife towering over you. She was a total bombshell with wavy blonde hair, blue eyes, and appeared to be roughly 6 feet tall. While her curves were not quite as voluptuous as Mckayla's, they were still overwhelmingly prominent, especially because they were being covered by only a small bikini. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey there, my name is Tom, I'm Mckayla's husband. Long story short she, well, accidentally brought me with her to work today.\" You wanted to explain yourself as quickly as possible in order to avoid any confusion of why you were there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! You're Tom! Mckayla's always talking about you! I'm Emily. Your wife has told us so many funny stories about the two of you\" the model concluded her response with a stifled giggle. You hoped that this woman had not enjoyed Mckayla's stories about squashing you too much, but from the first impression it seemed like she didn't have any evil intentions towards you. You were thankful to have been found by someone who appeared to be nice, but before you could continue the conversation you heard a set of footsteps approaching you from behind. Your instincts caused you to quickly swivel around and face the direction of what sounded like high heels clacking on the ground, and behind you came yet another beautiful woman. This woman, dressed in a more modest skirt and blouse, was also holding a camera. You pieced together the obvious and assumed that she was the photographer, but you also couldn't help to notice that she was herself yet another curvy woman. She took another step and slammed her heel down mere inches from you, making your heart race. She didn't look down and addressed your new model friend, saying,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Emily, who are you talkin to?\" The photographer asked, still unaware of your presence. In response Emily just pointed down at the ground. The photographer bent over slightly to see beneath her sizable bust. Quickly she saw you and her eyes went wide, it seemed like gears were turning in her head as she looked at your for a few seconds without speaking. Just as you were about to break the awkward silence, she said,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're just what I've been looking for!\" You were puzzled yet at the same time intrigued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" You cautiously asked, part of you fearing what she would say in response. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're Mckayla's tiny, squishy husband right?! I'm asking because we just got a request for a photoshoot that involved a tall woman\" she said pointing to Emily, \"and a tiny guy!\" she said pointing at you. You were a bit annoyed at her use of the word tiny, but had to admit you were a bit intrigued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh, really? What type of stuff would I have to do? Nothing bad right?\" you asked back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh uhhh... no! Definitely not! It will be nice and easy, and we'll pay you the same hourly wage as your wife for the duration!\" The photographer's answer seemed a bit suspicious to you, but the idea of bringing home a little extra spending money didn't sound half bad. You mulled the decision over for a few seconds before finally responding, <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Sure, why not! It sounds like fun!\" You responded eagerly to the photographer. You weren't exactly sure what you were in for but this seemed like too good of an opportunity to pass up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fantastic!\" The photographer exclaimed, \"Follow me and we'll get started right now.\" With a beckoning hand she motioned for both you and your new model friend, Emily, to follow her. Quickly the three of you began walking, you having to break into a light jog simply to keep up with the long, powerful strides of these women. As much as you tried not to you found it difficult to pry your eyes away from the hourglass shaped women sashaying in front of you. While they were wearing completely different outfits you could easily tell that both were overwhelmingly curvy. From your 2 foot tall perspective the asses of these ladies towered above you, and dwarfed you in size at the same time. After a minute of walking it seemed you had arrived as the photographer exclaimed,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right here, this room should be perfect!\" As she said that she swung open a door to a relatively large, compared to you, room. Lights were set up all around and there were a few prop items strewn to and fro. Being the professional that Emily is she shot you a quick smile then sauntered to the middle of the room where all of the equipment was facing. She began double checking her hair, her makeup, and adjusting the fit of her bikini to make sure she looked perfect for the cameras. You, on the other hand, scrambled to make yourself look at least somewhat presentable. Thanks to your wife transporting you via the ass express this morning you had no opportunity to put on a normal outfit and instead you were stuck in some casual shorts and a shirt. The photographer noticed your worry and giggled slightly, before saying to you,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You look great, Tim. Don't change a thing.\" She finished her compliment with a smile and you felt yourself relax a bit. So far it seemed like this would be a fun process! A moment later the photographer spoke up again, saying, \"Alright guys, ready? The client really wants these pictures to emphasize the difference in height between you two so lets get you some heels, Emily, and we can start!\" She tossed Emily a pair of tall, stiletto heels and she quickly put them on. As if her 6 foot frame didn't make you seem minuscule enough, now the top of your head only reached her mid thigh. Emily peered down at you to her side and giggled quietly, she completely towered over you. Immediately the photographer began taking a series of photos. Emily struck a different sexy pose in each one, and you tried your best to do the same. After a minute of this the photographer began giving some direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, Emily, can you turn around and kind of uhhh, hang your butt over Tim?\" She paused briefly with the instruction, not knowing how either of you would react. Your instincts kicked in and started to tell you that this photoshoot might end up a bit more intense than you originally guessed. Emily, on the other hand, only smiled and nodding, immediately spinning 90 degrees until you were directly behind her. Her soft thighs brushed up against your face and you looked up to see Emily's voluptuous ass hanging over you like a canopy. Each of her cheeks stuck out so far that quite literally your entire body fit in the shadow they cast. You gulped and looked up in a mixture of awe and fear at the moons that could crush you effortlessly beneath them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then the photographer said, \"Yes! Great work you guys! The fear in your eyes looks so genuine, Tim, you're a natural!\" You glance back at the photographer and shoot her a weak smile as well as a thumbs up, but inside you did not feel so confident. Emily seemed nice enough but she also seemed to follow the photographer's orders without question. You couldn't help but worry about what might happen next. The photographer took a few more pictures before speaking up again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Those were fantastic, guys. Now Emily, can you raise your heel and hold it over Tom as if you were going to step on him?\" Emily responded immediately, \"Sure can!\" and quickly spun back around, her thighs brushing against you as she turned. She then raised her foot far above your head and held it there. While it cast much smaller of a shadow than her gargantuan ass, it still struck fear into your heart. Instinctively you ducked and raised both hands above your head, despite knowing deep down that this would do nothing in the event of her foot actually dropping down on you. The photographer snapped a medley of pictures in this position, obviously elated how perfectly the photoshoot was going. After a moment you lowered your hands, despite Emily's huge foot still looming over you. At that second the photographer said,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Emily! Look how hot you look in these pictures! They're perfect!\" She spun the camera around to show Emily and instantaneously your new model friend became enraptured by the photos. A series of \"oohs\" and \"ahhs\" came from both their mouths as they checked each one. However, in her fascination with the pictures the rest of the her thoughts melted away, and without a care in the world Emily dropped her heel straight down to the ground. You had no more than a split second to react before your entire body was squashed flat against the ground under her shoe. With an unceremonious *squish* sound, Emily stepped on top of you and kept browsing the pictures. Luckily for you, the ground felt oddly gummier than usual to her, and after a moment she looked down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god, Tom! I'm so sorry! I totally forgot you were still there!\" Emily exclaimed down at you. Your body was comedically crushed flat underneath her but you could still hear the concern in her voice. She began to lift her shoe off of you when suddenly the photographer yelled out,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait! This shot is perfect. Can you just hold it for one minute?\" Emily was concerned about whether or not she was hurting you, but obeyed the photographer's wishes anyway. She snapped away taking pictures of your crushed form, of Emily, and of both of you at the same time. She even asked Emily if she could fake different emotions in regard to what she had done. Happy, angry, remorseful, Emily cycled through different poses and expressions while the photographer captured each one. Meanwhile your body was mashed and twisted up beneath her as she adjusted her stance repeatedly. It was absolute torture for you. You knew you should have turned down the offer in the first place, it was just too good to be true.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe photographer then spoke up and said, \"Well if you two are comfortable with stuff like this, the client has an entire list of other squashing positions that they asked for!\" She seemed excited at the prospect, and utterly thoughtless towards your wellbeing. You would have vehemently refused if you were in any position to voice your opinion at the moment, but sadly you could not. Emily, though, was flip-flopping on what she would choose. On the one hand she never likes saying no to her boss, but on the other hand she really did feel bad for you. She contemplated for a minute, tapping her heel on your body carelessly as she thought before saying,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

With that idea in mind she was sure that you would be more forgiving than her boss would be if she turned down the work, plus she could make it up to you by getting you a bit of a bonus since this isn't exactly what you agreed to. \"Sure! Let's do it!\" You wish you could have groaned at the model. The photographer smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay this session might extend a bit longer in that case I have a Long list of err.. poses that we need to accomplish\" you didn't like the way that she said that but you couldn't really protest in your situation. Emily tried to lift her foot up but you were stuck to it a bit so that you looked like gum with human features stuck to her shoe. The Photographer snapped a few pictures of that before your body decided it liked the floor better and came off of the shoe. \"Alright Em peel him off the floor and get a stool to put him on.\" Emily did exactly as she was told and you were now 'eye' level with her large rear. She was directed to wave her ass at you and look over her shoulder like she was teasing while you inflated and right before you were enough of a three dimensional object to say anything she steamrolled her ass over you and rolled it around, you imagine from the outside it might look quite sexy but under her as she was grinding you in a slow circle and smearing your features. When she lifted up you went with her and that also got a few good pictures before you were peeled off to be smashed by her breasts. There were quite a few shots like this, of the waiting and then of the actual crushing again smashing you just before you could make any noise almost like the photographer could tell when you would be able to speak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was almost two hours of this before you could hear the Photographer say that they were taking a break Emily set you down on the couch and the photographer motioned her over to look at the pictures. Finally finally you got a moment of not being crushed to voice your opinion well when you reformed anyhow. Before that could happen though Emily left the room saying something about getting a lunch. You were almost, so very close to being reformed when the curvy Camera girl walked over to the couch Emily had set you down on and slammed her ass into you. You wondered if she had just forgotten that you were there but she was grinding  her but back and forth like she was trying to crush you. You hadn't really focused on the modestly dressed woman, even if you had noted that she was curvy when you had first seen her, she was a bit more, 'plush' rather than the toned roundness of your wife or Emily. This in turn made her booty a bit larger, strange how you managed to notice minute differences like that only while these women were crushing you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe seemed to realize that she was sitting on you though because she stood up and peeled you off of her butt. you could really take in her appearance now, she wasn't that tall and she was a little on the 'pleasantly plump' side but she didn't look bad, although Mckayla outclassed all women in looks as far as you were concerned. She had a cute face and brown hair and she was smiling, but that kind of erked you, this woman had just had you smashed for several hours and she was just smiling at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully she let you reform but you couldn't bring yourself to let it go. \"Hey! why didn't you let me speak before! I never would have agreed to that!\" The woman was taken aback by the forcefulness of your statements and stuttered. \"I- well it\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou cut her off. \"Don't just spout excusses! how are you going to make it up to me! You should know I hate it being-\" You didn't even see it coming as she actually hopped over and crushed you under her ass again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, I don't know what to say but I couldn't take you yelling at me. Mckayla never played up how you didn't like being smashed when she talked about you. but... I have to meet a this client's requests and having you do this was like, a lot easier than photo editing your pictures with Emily. I was going to ask you about the next part but you were just so mean to me I don't think I will.\" She said grinding her butt into you very purposefully this time \" Next was supposed to be the part where the smushy guy gets molded into clothing I would have given you the option to opt out or take some more money but I don't think that you need either of those.\" She peeled you off her ass and  walked over to her camera setting it to auto take pictures and showing you to it before molding your body into...</span></div></div>",

She was probably getting great shots if her 'client' was anything like you were thinking but those thoughts were interrupted by a different Model than Emily entered the room. This time a Mocha skinned beauty that had curly brown hair and still with a prestigious figure although she was perhaps a bit more bottom heavy than Emily had been, your hopes rose that you would be saved but that was quickly dashed as she started speaking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Tess, Emily sent me here to take her place or something? I didn't really pay attention to what she was saying.\" She waved her hand dismissively \"Is that the product?\" She said pointing at you, obviously oblivious to the fact that you were a person.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yha,\" The Camera girl who's name you only just now learned looked down at you smiling. \"You do a lot of product modeling don't you Tasha. These are an ultra stretchy, durable, and reversible panties! The can be plain\" She flipped you over to your back where it was nothing but tan \"or you can have this face pattern like you squashed a guy with you ass.\" Tess just lied so easily as if she was used to giving the models only half truths. You pleaded with her in your mind not to do this but she was already committed, so she continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll get some shots of them going up your legs and some of you wearing them, and then flip them and do the same thing again.\" It wasn't really a surprise then that the model just started undressing and Tess handed you off to her pointing the camera at the floor. Tasha faced away from the camera and you were face down until she started to lift you up her legs. You got to look at Tess grinning at you as you got closer and closer and finally you were secured in place on the large cheeks with your face on the outside. Tasha ran her fingers under you and pulled, stretching you out all the way around to cup her cheeks. you could feel your body shrink a little inwards as you were left 'alone' for a moment and it shaped you to her contours. Tasha did a little spin for the camera and got in a few shots of her leaning over to really stretch out your face which was somehow worse than the few hours of time that you spent getting squashed by Emily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe real situation was yet to come though because after around fifteen minutes of that it was time to try out your 'reversible' feature, again the camera was trained on you as she slowly flipped you around and pulled you back up stretching you the same way she had before but with your face on the inside this time. Apparently the lighting was making her sweat because when she went to bend over, now with your face sucking up her sweat, you could taste it. Thankfully there was only so much that one could do with panties so either Tess would need to come up with something else or you would be getting the chance to change back very soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, Tasha I guess I don't have any more pictures to take right now, just hand me the product back and-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTasha held up her hand \"Actually these are super comfortable like even being so tight they aren't cutting into my skin. I think I'll keep them\" This was bad news for you hopefully Tess actually had a come back for this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You uh, can't the prop policy is um\" Again Tasha had a argument perpared<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My contract specifically has a clothing and worn products clause. I get to keep anything that I like if I model it, so unless it's something super pressing, I'll be walking out of here with my new panties on.\" Your fate could be wrapped around this model's toned booty for the near future if Tess doesn't save you.</span></div></div>",

If only you had been able to be on the outside, at least then Emily or maybe even your wife would take note and ask about you. Walking around was worse than posing, as your experience dictated and the amazing booty you were currently wrapped around was no different. you couldn't exactly tell where you were going but you were pissed at Tess for getting you into this situation. Tasha couldn't really be blamed even though it was her sweat you were currently sucking up. She was talking to some other models and standing around, you could feel every movement that she made, every slight shift in her weight caused a slight stretch in your body you had become so tight on her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApparently they were headed to another shoot and you were coming along, they didn't even need to change you couldn't really pay attention to what they were saying anymore, but a weird motion of Tasha lifting her leg really high. She was posing on something and you felt your body slip off her cheek just a bit and farther into the crack. Soon she was sitting down and the compression was another whole level but at least she wasn't wearing pants.

Assuming it was your beloved wife heading off to work, you set your toast down and flashed a winning smile towards the doorway to the kitchen. However, it was not Mckayla who walked in, but rather your terrifying daughter Vicky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell hey dad!\u201d Vicky grinned, her expression sending shivers down your spine. \u201cYou made me breakfast. That\u2019s so sweet of you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cActually Vicky, that\u2019s my breakfast and I\u2026\u201d You began, but your daughter cut you off by grabbing your throat. Your neck was squashed flat instantly, and the rest of your body soon followed. It wasn\u2019t long before you were a tiny lump resting in her hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry. What were you saying? I couldn\u2019t quite make it out!\u201d Vicky laughed, and she gobbled up the toast and orange juice you had set out for yourself. When she had finished, she carried you into the bathroom with her, where she brushed her teeth and applied a bit of makeup. Lastly, she slipped on her shoes and grabbed her backpack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019re heading to school now dad, and you\u2019re coming with me.\u201d Vicky stated, as if it was fact. The horrible truth was that you had no way to deny her wishes. She was stronger than you, taller than you, and admittedly smarter than you (or at least more cunning). \u201cMom won\u2019t even have a clue!\u201d Vicky crumpled you into a ball, and tossed you into her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour body entered the hot, moist cavern of your daughter\u2019s mouth, and her saliva washed over you. Her thick, meaty tongue lapped at your body, rolling you in circles. It wasn\u2019t long before her teeth began to gnash and crush your body, painfully grinding you to bits. This wasn\u2019t the first time your daughter had treated you like nothing but a piece of gum, and it surely wasn\u2019t going to be the last.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVicky headed to the bus stop, where she met up with her best friend, Lily. Lily was a toned and athletic girl, who never let anything get in the way of her and exercise. That being said, her body was a bit more curvaceous than one would usually expect from an athlete. She was a proud member of the soccer and swim teams, and Vicky would constantly get her to unknowingly torture you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s up girl? Ready for another day of school?\u201d Lily asked as the duo stepped onto the bus and sat down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh. It\u2019ll sure be exciting.\u201d Vicky replied, her voice oozing with enthusiasm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat flavor of gum is that? It smells really good.\u201d Lily sniffed the air, catching a whiff of what was actually Vicky\u2019s strawberry mouthwash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know. It\u2019s a subtle taste. Apparently, it\u2019s my dad\u2019s favorite flavor.\u201d Vicky snickered, trying to hide the irony in her statement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you have any extra?\u201d Lily inquired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh\u2026not right now I don\u2019t.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh. That\u2019s too bad.\u201d Lily frowned, and the bus began to pull up to the school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWeren\u2019t you looking for a new swim top?\u201d Vicky mused. \u201cDid you ever find one?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI didn\u2019t.\u201d Lily sighed. \u201cI can\u2019t seem to find one that fits my exact measurements. I want it to be tight fitting so that my boobs don\u2019t get in the way of my swimming. BUT I don\u2019t want it tight enough so that it hurts. That would be distracting.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI got ya.\u201d Vicky nodded. The bus came to a stop, and everyone piled out. Vicky waved goodbye to Lily, and headed off to her first class. As she passed the bathroom, she walked inside and spat you out. She washed you in the sink for a few minutes, until you were nice and squeaky clean. Because of all of her crushing you had endured, your clothes had been torn to shreds, and so you were now a naked ball of gummy, hoping and praying for mercy from your giantess daughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVicky glanced down at you, ideas spinning in her head about what to do with you. Lily had just presented some very tempting offers, but Vicky did enjoy getting some time with you herself. Eventually, she reached a decision, so what does she decide to do?</span></div></div>",

Vicky always loved to submit you to such unrestrained torture, probably due to the fact you and Mckayla didn't buy her everything she wanted. Being spoiled rotten, she tends to outlash, and you are the unwilling victim. It actually kind of excited her.

Maybe even chuck you into the school's food.

Vicky rectified this by taking you into the bathroom and washing you under the sink ringing you out drying you of all moisture. When she got to the class the teacher beamed at her, Vicky was after all one of her best students.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright class today we're going to do our group projects, I'm sure you all have your personal fabrics I asked you to bring. Each of you will work together to make one garment using both fabrics that you have. grades will be tomorrow.\" The teacher sat down in her chair as all the kids went to make groups. You watched as Vicky ran around to her target giggling all the way. The girl in question was another one of Vicky's friends Nicole the difference between her and Lilly is that she knew what Vicky did to you and even helped her on occasion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"ohh is that what I think it is. Vicky you're so bad.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"what was I supposed to do I forgot my actual fabric back at the house, mhe just hope Miss Vermilion doesn't like our project to much or dad might be spending a lot more time with our teacher and I'll be a few dollars richer.\" Vicky giggled to herself as the two girls began work on you, Vicky expertly pulling and stretching you into whatever shape she was going for. you couldn't really tell what that shape was as your body was so jumbled at this point but you could see from a couple of angles. One range was pointing out and down and the other was kind of surrounded by some other parts of you. Nicole was working on some sort of black leather like skirt from what you could see and at around the twenty minute mark you finally were taken to the mannequin which you noticed had the same proportions as the teacher of this class. Vicky's statement suddenly made sense if Vermilion liked you to much she would keep you and maybe pay Vicky for the clothes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were lowered down to the ground at the feet of the Mannequin and pulled up it's legs, the plastic felt strange on you but one of your 'eyes' was blocked out by the mannequin's butt section and your other 'eyes' was somehow on the middle of the leg. You could see Nicole walking over with the skirt and you felt the pin pricks as she was sewing it into you. Vicky held up a mirror for you, tauntingly without saying anything. Even though you were terrified there was a aesthetic beauty to what you saw in the mirror. A short black fabric skirt ending just above your vision above the knee with tan tights being you. it was the kind of thing a sexy librarian would wear in a fantasy you've had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrying to move only made a bit of pain shoot through you as the thread pulled back and the feeling of being stretched so much was catching back up with you. the bell rang and you're daughter simply left you there on the mannequin for her teacher to inspect. You and all the other projects were shuffled into the back and new Mannequins brought out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were sitting in the back with nothing to do all day but your body was constantly trying to fix itself but there was no room for it and it only caused you a bit more pain for the effort, until after the school day was over. you were singled out at the very bell ring for Ms. Vermilion to 'grade'. You got a good look at her, a very attractive woman maybe a few years younger than you with long red hair. She was no where near as beautiful as your wife in your personal opinion but her hand moving over your body was a nice feeling as it soothed the pain of being stretched around the plastic body of  the mannequin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So soft, Vicky is so amazing at making clothes and her fabric selection, whatever this is it looks to thick to be a tights material. I can't give her an A+ if it doesn't breath.\" and with that justification she pulled you off of the pseudo person and took you into the changing room within the class. You were glad to be off of the plastic person but you knew what was coming next. Vermilion's feet entered you and pressed down lightly giving you a lighter feel and a warmth that hadn't been there with the mannequin. your view was thrust into the fact that she was wearing black panties and that her rear was just a bit larger than the model. She stood up pressing her weight onto you for the first time and it felt like she was standing on your nose, and this was confirmed by the light smell of foot sweat. and then she hopped a little to slip the skirt past her large butt and the movement drove pain through you as well as pushing your seam to the edge making the thread bite into you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe bent over to put on her shoes pulling you across her ass even more and a more pungent stench of feet emanated from her heels. just the short time of her walking around making grades was a torture for you pressing you to the limit. It took two long hours but then your unwitting captor stroked your body again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"these are breathable, I'll have to wear them home tonight just to make sure I want them.\" she said. walking out of the classroom and to her car.</span></div></div>",

I mean, otherwise what kind of example are you setting for your children right?\u201d She laughed at her own private joke, and your blood ran cold as a barrage of horrific memories assaulted your mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver the last couple of years, Vicky had gotten into the habit of referring to Lily as your girlfriend, reinterpreting your various times being stuck to or used by her as intimate moments. Those were all experiences that you would rather forget, and which the blonde herself remained blissfully unaware of, yet your daughter was always sure to remind you of those days you\u2019d spent stuck in Lily\u2019s cleavage, or how you\u2019d been a sticker on her ass for a week long soccer camp. Not to mention your experiences as various pieces of underwear and one time even an overstretched swim suit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaking matters worse was that the few times Lily had actually gotten to see you in person, she\u2019d gushed excessively over how cute you were, and it was apparently a topic she\u2019d brought up with Vicky several times since. While you were pretty sure she saw you more in the manner of a small child or pet, your daughter was convinced that her friend had a precocious crush and took great pleasure in holding that against you, dropping hints around McKayla in an attempt to get you in trouble. Sometimes it even worked and you were punished for things you didn\u2019t even do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile you were distracted by your thoughts, Vicky had already sprung into action. Her fingers massaged your body as she methodically smoothed out the many indentations left behind by her teeth and wiped away the last of her saliva. Though she knew from experience that it didn\u2019t take much to fool Lily, she wanted to make this as bad for you as possible, so she took her time smoothing you out into a perfect gum ball shape. To add an extra layer of realism she even pulled out her cherry lip balm and covered you in a generous coating, both changing your colour to a light pink and giving you the scent and, superficially at least, the taste of cherry. It wouldn\u2019t quite match the strawberry scent Lily had smelt before, but it would be close enough to work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time you brought your mind back to the present, Vicky had already exited the bathroom on the way to find Lily, not even sparing you a glance as she stalked down the halls with purpose. At this point you knew that there wasn\u2019t anything you could do to stop her from giving you to the blonde and from the shape she had trapped you in you were pretty sure you knew what as. It wouldn\u2019t be the first time you had been chewed unaware by Lily, and you certainly weren\u2019t looking forward to experiencing it again, since you knew she was the type to chew long and hard without remorse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite the hopelessness of your situation you still tried to struggle, but were barely able to twitch, a movement that didn\u2019t even register to the teenage tormentress as she tracked down your fate with unnerving accuracy. In no time at all, Vicky found her friend getting ready for class, calling out to get her attention as she jogged to cross the remaining distance, a broad smile on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor her part Lily was confused as to why Vicky would have come back so quickly after they\u2019d just split up, but her questions died on her lips when the evil girl presented you on her open palm. \u201cOh my god, you found another one!? Thank you so much!\u201d She\u2019d been really craving some gum ever since she\u2019d first seen her friend chewing, and had just been lamenting the lack of the same. With an encouraging nod from Vicky she scooped you up, and almost immediately brought you to her mouth. However, just as she was about to throw you into the waiting maw she paused and\u2026</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Remembering the trouble she\u2019d gotten in last time she\u2019d been caught chewing gum at school, Lily paused for a moment to cast a few furtive glances around. Seeing no teachers in the immediate vicinity, she shared a knowing wink with Vicky before tossing you into her mouth. If your daughter\u2019s answering smirk carried more mirth than expected, it flew straight over the blonde\u2019s head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLily was an aficionado of chewing gum and didn\u2019t waste any time sucking on you, but rather used her powerful tongue to move you straight onto her teeth, a thick coating of saliva already coating your body by the time the molars above came down on your vulnerable form. Even if you were expecting it, that did nothing to decrease the agony as you were squished flat by the clenching teeth, the powerful jaw below you moving back and forth to grind you into the solid enamel above. After just one bite you were already in hell, and it only became worse as the teeth above retreated only to slam back down on you again with renewed vigour, and then do it again, and again, and again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOblivious to the torment she was inflicting on Vicky\u2019s cute father, Lily chewed loudly and openly without remorse, confident that there were no teachers nearby to call her out on her behaviour. The gum definitely had a cherry taste to it but there was something else as well, an exquisite taste that she couldn\u2019t quite put her finger on. Wanting to ensure she got out every drop of your flavour she used her tongue to move you around her mouth between bites, crushing you with molars, incisors and canines alike, as she greedily devoured the juices that flowed from your tortured form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA particularly vicious bite at the edge of her incisors that nearly severed you in two brought a deep moan of pleasure to the blonde\u2019s throat as the sheer taste of you flooded her mouth. It was always a treat whenever she received some gum from Vicky, yet for whatever reason the girl just wouldn\u2019t tell her where she got such excellent product. No matter what the external flavour, just a few seconds between her teeth would inevitably bring out that same overwhelmingly sweet taste that lay beneath. Better yet no matter how hard and long she chewed the flavour always remained, and she\u2019d spent hours on end enjoying such gum in the past. However, she\u2019d always ended up having to spit it out for one reason or another, and couldn\u2019t help but wonder how long this one would last.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could do nothing to defend yourself as the chewing continued, broken only by the occasional interference of Lily\u2019s tongue shifting you from one point of torment to the next. You were given a brief moment of relief as the chewing paused to allow your captor to bid Vicky farewell and get moving to her class, but as soon as the words were done the chewing recommenced. For her part, your daughter just waved her friend off happily, telling her to enjoy the gum with a wicked smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith no way to resist, or to even alert this girl to your presence, you spent the rest of the school day being relentlessly devoured by Lily. During classes she would suck on you like a lolly, stopping her chewing to avoid getting caught, but giving you no relief as her tongue shifted you around to be pressed against the roof of her mouth, the depths of her cheeks, or just crushed under its own weight. No matter the position, the athletic girl would suck on you with incredible force, the fleshy muscle of her tongue forming a tight seal around your body as the suction of her throat threatened to pull you down into the abyss of her stomach. Even if you weren\u2019t being sucked you were being battered around by her tongue, thrown all over the place just to satisfy the blonde\u2019s urge to play.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course the times when she was able to chew were even worse, with Lily clearly redoubling her efforts to make up for lost time as she really mashed you into nothingness between her teeth. By the time lunch rolled around she was happily starting to blow small bubbles with your body, stretching out your tortured flesh from her mouth before sucking you back in with a wet slurp. The feeling of this girl\u2019s warm breaths filling your body was something you would never get used to, and you were dreading the moment she finally blew a bubble large enough to burst. Each time you were returned to that tortuous maw you would be tossed straight back onto her teeth, any progress made towards stretching back to your full size undone as you were ground back into an insignificant paste.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were several times when you were sure you were about to take a one-way trip down this girl\u2019s throat, but each time you were caught by her tongue and thrown back to the front of her mouth, your flavour still too good for her to dispose of you so soon. As much as a part of Lily wanted to feel the sensation of swallowing such a delicious mouthful, she just wasn\u2019t willing to let go of this excellent gum, not when there was still so much flavour to squeeze out of your tortured form. So it was that she chewed and sucked on you with barely a moments pause until the final bell rang.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time Lily was getting changed for her afternoon soccer practice you were a barely conscious and utterly unrecognisable blob of flesh still being grinded around between her molars. Even the constant stimulation of her teeth and tongue wasn\u2019t enough to fight the darkness forming at the edges of your mind, and you felt as if any moment could be your last. You couldn\u2019t recall the last time you had been this badly mashed, and were starting to wonder if you would ever see the beautiful face of your wife again, or if you would never be anything else but your \u2018girlfriend\u2019s\u2019 gum.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile she had no concept of your fate, Lily briefly turned her attention to her gum as she pulled on her shoes and got ready to head out to the field. She knew from experience that it could be dangerous to chew gum while engaging in physical activity. There was the risk of choking if a particularly harsh intake of breath drew you into her throat, not to mention the embarrassing possibility of coughing you up onto someone else. Yet she felt as if there was still so much flavour to be had, and was strongly considering just taking the risk. If she did remove you she\u2019d have to decide between throwing you away, sticking you somewhere for later, or just swallowing you whole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a moment of indecision, in which she chewed her lip, and you, in thought, Lily decided to\u2026</span></div></div>",

It was as if you were in a pair of handcuffs. You then feel her pick you up and squeeze the middle of you thinner and thinner and using the extra parts from the middle to go to the sides. You felt her begin to push you out to make two cup like shapes. You look in the mirror and realize what is happening. She is turning you into a swim top for her friend Lily.

Except for you, the predators you were afraid of were the ample assets of your wife and daughter, easily capable of squashing you flat without even noticing. With every bite you scanned the room for either of them, ready to make any evasive maneuvers you would need to avoid becoming a personal sticker, insole, piece of gum, whatever. A number of minutes passed until...nothing happened! For the first time in forever you actually enjoyed a meal without threat of being squished. You were ecstatic! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes passed and Mckayla walked hurriedly into the kitchen, grabbing an energy bar from the cabinet as she headed straight towards you. It was then that you noticed she was engrossed by something on her phone, and at the same time swung her purse high above your body on the table, ready to slam it down and put the energy bar in for later. Instinctively you rolled out of the way a split-second before being utterly decimated, and you shouted up to your wife, \"Hey babe! Watch where you put that thing!\" you said half-jokingly. Mckayla looked up from her phone and scanned the room, trying to find the source of your voice, before finally coming to your body on the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh sorry, sweetie! You know I'm always in a hurry in the mornings, I'm not trying to squash ya!\" Before you could continue the conversation she added, \"Speaking of which I gotta run right now or I'll be late! Love you, see you later today!\" and sauntered quickly out the front door. You took a moment to watch her gigantic cheeks sway side to side with every step. No matter how many times that booty threatened to squish you underneath it or chew you up between it, you were still outrageously attracted to it. Finally, she  blew you a kiss and closed the front door, forcing you to come back to reality. You realized the next person to come downstairs would likely be your spoiled daughter, Vicky, so rather than take your chances with her you decided to use the opportunity and get out of the house a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly you tossed on some clothes and headed out the doggie door installed in your front door. Funnily enough, you had no dog but your wife had the doggie door installed anyway so it would be easier for you to get in and out of the house. At first you were a bit annoyed that you had to go through the same entrance a pet would, but soon you realized your wife did it out of love, and it really was a lot easier for you. You took a turn and headed down the sidewalk towards the local park only a block away. This early in the morning there weren't many people out yet and you felt like a walk in the park would be nice. Soon enough you got there and tried to decide what to do. You could go for a jog, but being on the jogging path usually ended up poorly for you if you weren't paying attention. You briefly thought about playing on the playground, as to your size it was more like a massive gymnastics facility. But interactions between you and small children usually ended poorly. You hopped up on a nearby bench to contemplate your options for a bit. After a number of minutes of thought, you noticed another woman running down the path next to you. Immediately noticing her voluptuous figure, you recognized as your wife's good friend, Allison! Coincidentally, Allison's husband, Tim, was another squishy guy, just like you! Because of this you all quickly became friends as couples. You hopped up and down on the bench trying to say hi, and it seemed like it worked! She ran right up to you, but for some reason didn't acknowledge your presence. Once she got close enough you realized she was wearing sunglasses and had her headphones in! Your heart sank as she approached the exact spot on the bench you were standing and turned around. Her ass, not quite as large as Mckayla's but still sizeable in its own regard, blocked out the sun and cast an enormous shadow over your diminutive form...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAllison began her day with a quick jog, as she always does. Her tightest leggings on, a skimpy sports bra supporting her large breasts, and chewing on a tasty piece of strawberry gum. Well, to the rest of the world it was strawberry gum, to her it was her squishy husband of 10 years, providing her with a boost of flavor to wake her up in the morning. She giggled as shoe blew a small bubble, seeing her husbands arm expand out before popping back over her lips. Now, Allison loved her husband very much, but that didn't mean she wasn't afraid to use him or mess with him when she wanted to. She would never do anything evil to him, but to her, a prank here and there didn't hurt! She quickly licked Tim back into her mouth and began to focus on her run. As she approached a nearby bench, the morning sun shining in her eyes and music blaring, she realized her shoe had come untied! Allison quickly changed paths towards the bench so she could sit own and tie her shoe before it caused her to trip. She turned around quickly, and powerfully plopped her buns onto the wooden bench. Immediately upon making contact with the bench, Allison felt something tiny squish beneath her right ass cheek. \"Eww gross did I just sit in gum?\" She said out loud before lifting her cheek off the bench. Her nails approached the spot on her ass where she felt the \"gum\" stuck and scratched it off with her fingernails. She held it in her hand, inspecting it before seeing a tiny face half folded into itself. Immediately she took our her headphones, smiled, and said, \"Hey Tom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour body was flat as a pancake, being held in the hand of your fun but mischievous friend Allison. After being completely obliterated by her butt it took you a moment to reform. Eventually, you popped back to normal and she set you down on the bench next to her. \"Hey Allison, it's been a little while since we've seen each other! And even longer since your ass and I have seen each other\" you said up to her. This was true, the last time you interacted, you didn't even get a chance to talk to Allison before she squashed you. \"Where's Tim at?\" you added. Allison responded with only a smirk as she blew a large bubble of her gum. On the outside of that gum you saw a contorted face, and realized there was no other explanation than that being him. \"Haha come on Allison! Can't even give the guy a break! I feel like you're always messing with him one way or another.\" you said while laughing at her. In truth, you were a bit afraid of her pranks, but you tried not to show it because it always seemed to just make her more willing to pull them on you. Allison finally responded,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey I'm not always messing with him! Just yesterday we went to... no wait I was using him as a bra then. Well, last week we took a yoga... ooh actually half way through I had to grab him and use him as a sweat rag... Well, whatever! Tim's a tough guy, he knows I love him even when I gotta use him\" Allison concluded her lovely trip down memory lane, as you just chuckled and shook your head. \"Whatever you say\" you responded with another laugh. Just then you heard Allison gasp and she looked down at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That reminds me!.......</span></div></div>",

Allison was trying to show your wife your deodorising properties and your scent so she must have made me into some soap on a rope. This was a less than ideal thought for you as you knew your wife loved nothing more than working up a sweat and the thought of having to mop that up each time was going to be tortuous.    <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMcKayla meanwhile simply plopped your body down on the corner of the bathtub and sauntered away to make a start on dinner and you were left once more to meditate and reform.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHours later you were startled awake by the sound of your wife bursting into the room. Her face was painted with an exhausted expression as she slumped over to the bathtub and began filling the tub. Without a single word she then began peeling away her layers. First of all she stripped off her top dropping it carelessly to the floor; she then released the clasp from her bra revealing her bouncing bosom that sprung free. She then stripped off her pants and clumsily stumbled about as she plucked her socks free.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stood in awe of your wife\u2019s semi-nude form, practically drooling at the sight of her. This intensified tenfold as she shimmied her panties down to her ankles and stepped out of them, her trimmed womanhood on full display as she stepped towards the bath. She then tested the water and turned off the faucets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou knew soon enough you would be dragged across her perfect body and even though you knew she could be a bit rough it didn\u2019t seem to dampen your excitement. What did dampen your excitement is when she stepped back towards you, her two jiggly moons you called buttocks encompassed your surroundings and with the simply act of picking up her clothes to put in the hamper you were put face to face with a swampy, earthy smell that was your wife\u2019s butt crack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were still mentally gagging as she stood up and rummaged through a nearby drawer before placing something by you and swiftly slinking into the warming waters. You heard her coo in delight as she sunk ever deeper into the waters, her feet pressed up to the side nearest your location leaving you a full view of her face and the cleavage that wasn\u2019t obscured by the bubbles.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce more she shifted pressing the water up towards you as she clambered over to you. \u201cWell best to get this over with\u201d You slightly chuckled, hoping to be returned to this metal dish after so you can continue scanning the curves of her body. Oddly enough she never picked you up. Instead her hefty breasts hung like pendulums in front of your face as the water cascaded off them and a strange noise was heard. Mckayla then simply slumped back to her previous position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sat there dumbfounded not sure what the hell was going on. It was then you started to feel something very hot at the tip of your feet. This feeling then began to spread further as you felt blinding pain and the unmistakeable scent of cherries flooded the air. You struggled and screamed producing the tiniest of movement and sound. Your eyes frantically darted over to your wife who was now displaying an expression of pure bliss as she inhaled the scent that reminded her so fondly of her husband.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>To your disbelief, your breakfast went as planned! You felt the table wobble a bit due to its uneven legs, reminding yourself to fix that sometime soon, but other than that just your average breakfast. As you finished up you figured out what you wanted to do with your day. Your kids are relatively self-sufficient so they do not need too much help with their daily routine unless something drastic happens, so you could do whatever you wanted. You decided to take care of some housework, and you were going to start with cleaning up Mckayla's exercise room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou started your short trek down the hall and eventually got the door. Looking at the door knob looming far above, you had to get up there and reach it. You could have squeezed yourself under the door but you spend so much time squished by your beautiful wife that the prospect of inflicting it on yourself was not too tantalizing. Luckily, just like you scaled the cabinets earlier you could climb the door frame with ease and use your minimal strength to swing open the door. You sat there in the room, taking a moment to pat yourself on the back for being so self-sufficient at only two feet tall. Most people at your diminutive stature are totally dependent on others to help them live out their daily lives, but you take pride in being able to fend for yourself. In fact, it is this exact confidence and capability that led you to win over your beautiful wife when you met over twenty years ago. Before delving into the cleaning process you felt your mind start to drift to that wonderful day...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a warm spring day, and you were walking through the city from your college campus to your internship. Always the go-getter you chose to attend college in a relatively metropolitan area, something rather risky for a two foot tall squishy man to undertake. The seemingly endless seas of oblivious pedestrians seemed like it would be the worst situation for you to be in. One misstep and you could be thoroughly squished by a a looming foot. But you were not the average squishy man. Through this mass of people oblivious to your existence, you bobbed and weaved between steps, under legs, and expertly avoided danger. In fact, you could likely move about at an equal pace to these giants thanks to your nimbleness. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn this day, however, you found yourself walking behind someone that you simply could not take your eyes off of. A pair of creme colored heels led into some of the longest, most beautifully tanned legs you had ever seen in your life. Each elegant stride of hers equaling more than 5 steps of your own. Your eyes were naturally drawn upwards, following the smooth contour of her legs, and what lied above them could only be sufficiently described as the best ass you had seen in your entire life. You were immediately mesmerized. First, it was large, very large. The width from the edge of one cheek to the other was easily wider than your entire body was tall, and it stuck out like a shelf. Second, it jiggled just the perfect amount in front of you with the clack of each heeled step on the pavement. And third, her short forest green dress struggled valiantly to contain this massive body part but simply could not succeed. Every step revealed just a hint of her smooth cheeks that was only visible from your perspective, but enough to entrance you even more. She would grab the dress and yank it down every few steps but the process kept repeating itself. It was during one of these forceful tugs that this beauty happened to knock her purse off her shoulder, causing it to land right in front of you. You immediately grabbed the purse off the ground and lifted it up, just then realizing that this woman did not even notice dropping her purse, and neither did the number of pedestrians around you. It seemed a bit strange that she was ditzy enough to not notice her own purse falling off her shoulder, but you brushed those thoughts aside, this was your chance!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the seconds that had passed she had gotten a fair distance ahead of you, and you had to figure out how to not only catch up to her but get her attention in an appropriate manner. Because, at two feet tall your voice would likely not rise all the way up to her ears over the bustle of the city. And further, the difference in height between you two meant that you could only reach her calf, thigh, or tremendous ass to get her attention physically, and you did not want your first interaction with this goddess to be groping her. Thinking on your feet you quickly ran forward to scale a nearby newspaper dispenser, leapt from there to a street sign, and ended up atop a bus stop some feet ahead of this beauty. From there you scanned the crowd looking for her, and you found her almost instantly. Standing above nearly every other person in the crowd was an angelic face that could only belong to the perfect ass you had seen before. She had to have been at least 6 feet tall, before counting the extra height her heels added, and looked like a model to you. She approached you and you shouted out, \"Excuse me miss, I believe you dropped this\" while holding her bag out. A look of complete surprise washed over her face, first to see a man less than 1/3 her height speaking so confidently, and second to see you holding her purse. She exclaimed, \"Oh thank you so much it completely slipped my mind!\" with a short giggle. \"What can I ever do to repay you?\" she continued. In one motion you flipped yourself into a hanging position from the bus stop you were sitting on, and came to her eye level. \"You can let me take you out to dinner\" you said smoothly as you extended a business card to her beautiful hand. Clearly taken aback slightly by your advance, she then formed a perfect smile and responded, \"I would love to.\" She extended the same hand and said \"Mckayla Jacobson, pleasure to meet you,\" you took two of her fingers in your much smaller grip and responded, \"Thomas Malthus, and trust me the pleasure is mine. Does tonight at 7:00 work for you?\" She smiled again and nodded, you smiled back then each of you continued on your daily life. You worked out the details of the date over the phone later, and from that point on the rest was history.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could spend the whole day recalling the wonderful history of you and Mckayla, the times she accidentally sat on you, stepped on you, even forgot about you after doing the first two. While your natural agility let you avoid many dangerous situations, when it came to your wife it seemed like you simply could not focus on avoiding her. Her natural beauty seemed to hypnotize you and lead to you being squished against her one way or another. Each of these times though, while not physically very enjoyable only served to strengthen your relationship and forge the bond between you and your beautiful wife. You both made each other happier than ever before, and is the reason why you have had such a loving marriage for over 17 years.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Back in the real world*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou came out of your daydream content, and ready to start your day. This is when you first noticed just how messy the room was. While Mckayla was in no way a gross woman, she was definitely passionate about maintaining her figure through intense workouts. Combined with her natural ditziness and oblivious nature, this led to her leaving this room looking like a tornado hit it. Pairs of sweaty high socks were strewn about, one sock you specifically remember sharing with Mckayla's large foot while your wife ran a local marathon. You shuddered, not wanting to take that trip down memory lane and looked around the rest of the room. Dumbbells were spread out, running shoes left tipped over, even a pair of leggings shed on the ground because your wife frequently gets \"too sweaty to workout with pants on\" as she puts it. And in the middle of the room laid your wife's very much broken in yoga mat, still a bit damp from her session last night. Just as you were about to get started you heard your wife's voice from upstairs,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Honey! The girls at work are out of town today so they told me I can have the day off! I think I'm going to work up a little sweat then we can do whatever we want!\" You heard your wife's footsteps as they came down the hallway and hoped that she had not put her headphones in already. When she did she tended to get into the zone and it was nearly impossible to get her attention if she wasn't looking for you. She stopped briefly to ponder why the door was already open, and you were stunned by her beauty yet again. She had thrown on a sports bra to accompany her leggings, but neither did much good at pinning down her ample curves. It was then you noticed she did already have her headphones in, and you gulped, hoping that she would notice you before starting her routine. But this time, to your surprise, actually saw you! \"Oh hey Tom, what're you up to?\" She said while removing the headphones from her ears. You responded, \"Nothing much, just gonna help you pick up a little bit around here!\" Mckayla smiled back and said \"Aww thank you, you really are just the sweetest. Well now that we're both in here...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I would offer to help but I have another marathon coming up this weekend and I can't miss a day of training\" Mckayla smiled and asked you. You were already planning on cleaning the whole room yourself so it didn't seem like a big deal to you. You responded, \"Yeah thats totally fine with me, get your sweat on babe\" and finished with a wink. You felt the need to add, \"Oh and try not to forget that I'm in here this time! I definitely don't want a repeat of what happened during the last marathon you ran.\" Mckayla looked a bit puzzled and asked you, \"Huh? What happened then? All I remember was beating my previous record time and having this suuuuper comfy insole in one of my shoes. Man I wonder why I only had it in one shoe, I wonder if I could find another to match it. Speaking of which, where did I put that insole in the first place, and...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"MCKAYLA\" you shouted up at her, interrupting her ditzy train of thought. \"I WAS the insole in your shoe. You stepped on me in the bedroom, put on that exact sock\" pointing to the one on the ground you noticed earlier, \"then ran for nearly 5 hours on top of me, honey. You couldn't unstick me from your sole for like 3 days.\" Finishing your explanation you saw the gears turning in her head and she finally responded, \"Oh yeah! I remember that now! Jeez I'm really sorry about that, especially with how funky these feet can get after vigorous exercise. I promise that won't happen again sweetie.\" Mckayla then picked you up, gave you a huge kiss that engulfed your face. Setting you down she said, \"Alright I'm going to hop on the treadmill now, good luck with the cleaning!\" As she said that she put her headphones back in her ears and turned around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou facepalmed briefly at your wife's incredible talent for forgetting things, especially when it came to you. But you knew she never did any of it with bad intentions so you couldn't feel upset by it in the slightest. It was just the price to pay for living with this amazing goddess of a women. Soon enough Mckayla had put on her running shoes and started her run, so you began your cleaning. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou started by picking up the loose clothing around the room. You balled each article up and threw it into the nearby hamper. Even the hamper was taller than you were though so it felt like a fun game of basketball to you. Sports bras, leggings, all of them swished perfectly from your tosses. You paused a brief moment at the sock that nearly sealed your fate as an addition to your wife's foot, but quickly shook off the fear and threw them in as well. Everything was going relatively smoothly for you. After around 20 minutes most of the clothing had been picked up off the floor without incident. Just then you heard your wife say loudly, \"Hey hun, can you bring me a small towel? My whole body is sweating already and its starting to get in my eyes even.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You looked up and noticed that she was squinting her eyes hard, practically closing them stave off the downpour of sweat from her forehead. Moreover her entire body was practically drenched already, a layer of sweat giving her an almost glowing sheen. If it weren't for the dark blotches of sweat on her ass crack and under her breasts she would have looked like perfection to you. Even so you found yourself entranced by her shining body and bouncing assets. Before you got too caught up in your ogling you walked over to a nearby cabinet and grabbed a tan towel to bring to her. You never understood your wife's affinity for tan colored items, but they were often the cause of much hardship in your life. Regardless, you scaled up the cabinet and jumped from there to the control panel of the treadmill, directly in front of Mckayla's tremendous bust. You attempted to shout up to her but your voice could not reach her ears over her music. to get her attention you reached out with your arm and poked the exposed skin of her stomach below her sports bra. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom Mckayla's perspective she was struggling to deal with her body's sweaty tendencies. She knew that she was in no way tired from the run yet, but her body simply loved to produce as much sweat as possible whenever she exercised. Even worse, forgetting to wear her baseball cap that normally absorbed the sweat in her eyes caused a fair amount of it to drip down her forehead and begin stinging them. She was incredibly uncomfortable, but did not want to cut her run short in the middle, so when she felt something hit her stomach she assumed it had to be you giving her the towel. In one quick motion she yanked your arm that was touching her and began tossing your body around in her hands, getting ready to save her from this nightmare. Unfortunately even her light manipulation of your body triggered your squishy features, smushing your arms, legs, and head down into your torso. Somehow in an instant your wife had unknowingly transformed her husband into a perfectly rectangular object, just like the towel you were about to give her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was the absolute worst case scenario for you, you dropped the actual towel to the ground when your wife grabbed you, and felt your body quickly molded into its exact shape. Your wife said, \"Thank you so much Tom, you are a lifesaver\" and began to use you. Her first stop was obviously her face, wiping off her neck, cheeks, forehead, and finally eyes. You were praying that once your Mckayla could open her eyes again she would realize she was using you to mop up her excessive sweat. But when she looked at you she only said, \"Woah I never realized we had towels that were this color, it's pretty cool looking!\" Immediately your hopes were dashed, she mistook your thin shirt and shorts, which were giving her the clothlike feel of a towel, for a color-block design. She then moved onto to wiping you across her massive chest. She peeled her sports bra back and used you to swab each breast, and ultimately the crevice that ran between them. You soaked up practically all of her sweat, cursing your body for being so absorbent. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, Mckayla pulled you out of the valley and you thought the process was over, but as she swung you around behind her back you realized it had just begun. \"Tom honey, wherever you are in the room turn around, this is gonna get kind of nasty. Sorry\" Mckayla said with a giggle but it felt much more ominous to you. She then used one hand to grab onto the back of her practically painted on leggings, and stretched it back. Your eyes could see each beachball-like cheek, and the Grand Canyon (compared to you) that separated them. More so it looked like her entire backside was practically underwater due to the amount of sweat pooled up back there. Before you could even brace yourself you felt your body plunge in. Immediately you felt an intense pressure that you were too familiar with. Each asscheek pressed against each other with what felt like tons of force, looking for anywhere for the massive amounts of flesh to flow because the tight leggings compacted it from the outside. Your body quickly disappeared completely as your wife began vigorously rubbing you around. The sweat and earthy scent of her crack filled your senses as each cheek crashed over you. You realized now that your wife hadn't even stopped running! She was doing this at the same time! You were being utterly destroyed by Mckayla's most impressive asset, and she had no idea she was doing it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a minute she seemed satisfied with her work, feeling much less sweaty overall and much better. She tried to tug you out of her ass, but a combination of the pressure between her buns and the smaller amount of sweat created friction on your body. She yanked a bit harder and pulled her little towel out of her ass, but in the process she tore off your shirt and shorts! Leaving them deep in her ass. She looked once again at your towel shaped body but this time only saw tan. Mckayla looked a bit confused and said, \"I thought I was using a different towel than this? Weird, I guess not.\" She then flopped your thoroughly soaked and smelly body over the console and kept running. After another minute or so you found yourself having a tough time reforming. The complete saturation of her sweat on your body was starting to solidify and prevent the process. Luckily for you however, Mckayla began to feel something like a wedgie way down in her ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack to Mckayla's perspective she was feeling so much better. She was now dry and could keep running the rest of her planned time. The towel that she had used had been incredibly absorbant, probably the best one she had ever used. She took a mental note to ask you where you got it from later. But as she focused back on her running she felt an irritation in her crack. Mckayla first tried to ignore it, but simply could not, it was bothering her too much. So she reached a hand back there and fished around, finally feeling some extra fabric that was definitely not her thong. She pulled it out of her ass and inspected the unknown intrusion. It was actually two small pieces of cloth, completely soaked by her sweat, but when she pulled them apart she realized that it was a tiny pair of shorts and a shirt! \"What the hell, why was this in my ass?\" she wondered. She looked around the room to find you to ask you but couldn't spot you anywhere. In her process though she saw how much cleaner the room looked already thanks to you! But simultaneously she noticed the only thing left was one dry tan towel laying on the ground next to the treadmill. She didn't understand why her husband brought her two towels until she took a second look at the soaked towel she had just used. Right then all of the puzzle pieces fit together and a lightbulb went off in her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh shit... Tom, please don't tell me this is you right here\" Mckayla said evidently worried as she looked at the towel hanging on the treadmill console. You were honestly taken back and proud of your wife for realizing her mistake. It took memory and connecting the dots for her to make this connection. Knowing this was your only shot at freedom you wiggled as hard as you could, sending a wave of movement through your towel shaped body. Mckayla's jaw dropped and for the first time so far she actually stopped running. She immediately scooped your little body up and ran to the bathroom saying \"Oh my god, oh my god I'm so sorry for what I just did to you. That was so gross of me!\" she quickly stripped down and filled the tub, getting in with you. You felt your wife's soft hands massaging your towel like form, as well as felt the sweat begin to seep out of your body. Soon enough you were almost fully recovered, and your wife asked, \"Can you forgive me?\" in an evidently worried tone. Your face was totally reformed by this point so you smiled and said, \"Of course babe, accidents happen. You know I can never be mad at you for stuff like that. I'm just glad you noticed me! That was some pretty impressive detective work!\" You attempted to make your beautiful wife feel better about confusing you for a towel, and it seemed like it was working. She giggled and responded, \"Hehe I guess it was! Thanks! Finding your little clothes in my buttcrack is what really gave it away.\" You were happy she wasn't beating herself up too much, \"But you were the real star. You were like, the best towel I've ever used! It could definitely be a career path for you if you wanted it to be\" Mckayla added jokingly. You laughed and said back, \"Yeah that or your insole right?\" Mckayla thought for a second, and said, \"Wow yeah I've never thought of that! If you ever want to we should try it someday!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou facepalmed and smiled one more time at your wife not only forgetting about her marathon with you as her insole, but even forgetting about the conversation you had about it no more than 30 minutes ago. She's the love of your life but she truly is the world's biggest ditz. After your conversation you two got out of the bathtub and decided how to continue her day off...</span></div></div>",

You stood by her feet, using a much smaller towel to dry yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d You answered. \u201cI think it\u2019s been a while.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t we binge? That would be fun!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess. All day?\u201d You inquired, deftly dodging to the side as your wife dropped her towel to the floor. She always dropped her towel after drying off, and so you had learned to dodge out of the way. Otherwise, Mckayla was prone to picking up the towel, squashing you in the process, and then tossing the towel into the washing machine with you stuck to it, with Mckayla none-the-wiser.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYep! It\u2019ll be like a little party, just the two of us!\u201d Mckayla stepped towards the bathroom door, and you rolled out of the way of her foot. She left the bathroom and went back to your bedroom, and so you trailed behind her. The two of you got dressed, with you slipping into white shorts and a white t-shirt, while Mckayla just clipped on a red sports bra and tan leggings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMckayla then picked you up and carried you downstairs, setting you down on the couch. She sat down beside you, sitting on one half of the cushion while you sat on the other half. She flicked on the TV, changed over to Netflix, and then started up the episode that you had left off on. She flashed you a beautiful smile as the episode loaded, and then your binge session began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hours sped by, filled with laughter and fun. You cuddled up next to your wife\u2019s thigh, sighing as her body heat emanated off. Her jiggly flesh gave way slightly, and it was an extremely comforting sensation. Mckayla gently rested her arm around you, caressing your chest with her thumb as you watched the TV. You lightly kissed her hand, and once more wondered how you had ended up with such an amazing spouse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019M HOME!!!\u201d An extremely loud voice suddenly cried out, causing your heart to skip a beat. Mckayla let out a brief squeal, and her arm instinctively tensed up, causing her to partially squash your face. Mckayla turned around to see Vicky walk into the room and set her backpack down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGoodness darling. Can you be more quiet next time?\u201d Mckayla sighed, releasing her grip on you. For safety, you scooched a few inches away from Mckayla.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you watching mom?\u201d Vicky walked further into the room, standing behind the couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour father and I are catching up on \u2018Parks and Rec\u2019. Why?\u201d Vicky looked down and saw you. For a brief moment, an unsettling grin flashed across her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh hey dad! Didn\u2019t see you there!\u201d Vicky smiled, the perfect picture of innocence. \u201cCan I join you two?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell\u2026I don\u2019t know if\u2026\u201d You began, but Mckayla didn\u2019t hear you, so she cut you off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure thing Vicky. Have a seat!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks mom!\u201d Vicky giggled happily, and she flipped herself over the edge of the couch. You had to almost jump out of the way to avoid her landing right on top of you. As Vicky adjusted herself, you found yourself with almost no room to move. Mckayla\u2019s thigh and Vicky\u2019s thigh pressed against you from both sides, and you found your arms partially smushed between the two curvaceous females.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait a second!\u201d Mckayla cried, jumping to her feet. \u201cI should make some popcorn! Be right back!\u201d With that, your wife dashed out of the room, and disappeared into the kitchen. You watched her go, and then felt a sharp pain as your head was suddenly crushed flat. The rest of your body soon followed, until you were nothing but a tan lump resting in your daughter\u2019s hand.

That\u2019ll be fun!\u201d Vicky leered, smiling from ear-to-ear like the Cheshire cat. You struggled against her grip, but it was no use. You were completely at your daughter\u2019s mercy, which was practically non-existent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does Vicky decide to do with you?</span></div></div>",

Rolling your tiny tan ball in her fingers, she stood up and walked into the kitchen, pushing your tiny ball into her cleavage. Her breast flesh greatly muffled everything, but you could still make out the conversation between the two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey mom, Dad said he had to go help grandma and grandpa out with a few things for a couple of days. He said to not wait up for him.\u201d Vicky said, sliding into one of the many bar stools. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell that\u2019s odd. He didn't mention anything of the sorts. Oh well. Hey would you mind watching the popcorn please? I've got to go grab a pillow from the room. And don't add too much garlic. You know your father and I hate it like that.\u201d You heard your wife say, most likely retrieving the garlic salt. You didn't like the stuff at all, but they seemed to love it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure ma.\u201d Vicky said, pulling the bag of popcorn out of the microwave as it beeped. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo fingers retrieved you from the confines of her cleavage, and you were brought ball-to-face with Vicky. She gave you a lick, and a pleasant look washed over her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmmm\u2026 this piece of popcorn taste nothing like actual popcorn. Kinda has my dad's butterscotch taste. Better fix that.\u201d She said, and your stomach jumped to your throat as she dropped you into the scalding hot bag of popcorn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n In seconds, the butter inside had covered your entire body, soaking into like a sponge. She shook the bag, dumping the salt inside, and sending you to the bottom of the bag. The bag shook as she carried you over to the living room. The bag dropped, and everything shook again as you landed on the table. Inside the bag, you could hear your wife walk down the stairs and plop down on the couch. The bag lifted again, the show started again, and a hand began to collect the popcorn on top of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWant some Vic?\u201d Mckayla asked, motioning your bag in her direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure mom.\u201d Vicky said, grabbing a handful of popcorn and eating it. Over the course of 30 minutes, the bag was nearly empty. A hand reached into the bag, scooping you up with the last of the popcorn\u2026 but who's hand was it? </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The rest of Mckayla's day off went by relatively uneventfully for you guys. You finally finished cleaning the rest of her exercise room without much incident and spent the time after just hanging around the house. Having finished with her workout and washed up, Mckayla wanted to lounge around the house and have a nice relaxing day off. You spent the rest of the day binge watching a series you've been meaning to catch up on, then ended the night with a nice home-cooked meal for your family. As far as your luck went it wasn't too bad of an afternoon either! Well, relatively speaking. You spent the first two episodes of your guys' binge-watch plastered under your wife's enormous ass, but after that she remembered you were with her and quickly peeled you off. And while you two were cooking Mckayla only managed to knock you off the counter with her bust once before she stepped on your body on the ground and realized what she did. So overall you felt like it was a pretty nice day off for her and you. The next few days were back to the routine, with your wife going to work, coming home to work out, then you two spending some time together. Soon enough though Saturday rolled around, the day of Mckayla's marathon, and little did you know your peaceful week was about to come to an abrupt end...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe starting line and surrounding area of the race was packed on this hot, Saturday. It seemed like the amount of people was endless, as you and your two children tried to get as close to the starting line as you could. Even though you were perfectly capable of navigating the crowd yourself, your 17 year old daughter Vicky insisted on carrying you like a child on her shoulders. You never understood how she turned out to be such a spoiled and rude girl, despite both you and your wife's best efforts to raise her right. You had to admit though the view was much nicer up here than it was down around leg level. You scanned the crowd for your gorgeous wife, seeing your 14 year old son Ryan lost in his 3DS with his headphones in. You shook your head and laughed a bit, but realized it was nice of your kids to even come and wish your wife luck with you. In fact, this seemed especially out of character for Vicky to do, but right as your suspicions started to rise up you finally caught sight of your wife. Bent over stretching out her hamstrings the first thing you saw was her gray, booty-shorts covered ass, but having spent just about as much time face-to-ass as you have face-to-face with her you recognized it immediately. It stuck out like a shelf, stretching the limits of even her elastic shorts. It looked just as amazing as the first day you saw it, if not even better. Just then she stood back up and looked around, you and her locked eyes and both of your faces lit up. You guys pushed through the crowd as your wife came to the edge of the railing that separated the runners and the spectators.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow! Thank you guys so much for coming out to support me! It means so much from all of you\" Mckayla said, obviously overjoyed to see her whole family taking such an interest in her hobby. Vicky then responded, \"Of course Mom, we just wanted to help you out in any way that we could.\" Hearing your daughter speak like this immediately caught you off guard, this was completely uncharacteristic of her, and to be honest it scared you. You didn't know what she was planning but you had a feeling it was not good. Your son looked up for a split second from his game and flashed a thumbs up to show his support too, then your wife responded, \"Well I really appreciate it from all of you, but the race is going to start any second now so I should really get to the front of the pack!\" As Mckayla turned around to walk away, Vicky shouted out, \"Wait, Mom! Dad just told me he wanted to give you a good luck kiss before the race starts!\" Your beautiful wife quickly hustled back over to you guys and responded, \"Aww okay real quick, I love you babe\" and closed her eyes. You were taken aback by all of this, not understanding what your daughter meant, but just that instant you realized. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVicky's hands grabbed you and slammed your squishy body together into a papery thin form, folding you up to only a few inches long. And in a split second she swung you around to your wife's gargantuan backside, peeling her booty shorts back with one hand, and threw you down Mckayla's ass crack. Your entire body disappeared from head to toe between her jiggly ass, and your wife's eyes shot open. Before she could say anything, Vicky shouted, \"Whoops, I meant to say he wanted to give your ASS a good luck kiss!\" and let go of your wife's tight shorts, snapping them back down to seal your fate. Mckayla looked at your daughter, livid for what she just did. But just as she opened her mouth to reprimand her, a noise rung out, *BANG* and the starter pistol had been shot. Immediately all of the runners took off, leaving your wife at the back of the pack. You couldn't observe anything besides mountains of warm, already slightly sweaty ass, but your wife was going through a crisis in her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMckayla couldn't believe what had just happened in the span of only a few seconds. She clenched her basketball sized ass cheeks together to confirm that her loving husband really was trapped in her butt, and completely obliterated any sort of 3D nature your body had left. At this point she knew her husband was more or less a sticker plastered inside her crack, and it was all her daughter's fault. She was agonizing over what to do now. Obviously she felt horrible about her ass swallowing you up, and knew that running the marathon meant at least 4 hours before she could pull you out. But on the other hand, she had been training for this race for so long and knew that you always supported her running. It was an impossible decision for her, and every second she took to decide was a second she was wasting for the race. Nervous sweat began to soak her body, and you, in addition to the exercise sweat that her warmups had already created. But finally, she reached a choice...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"I'm really sorry Tom, I feel terrible about this but I'll get you out after the race!\" Mckayla looked down at her own ass and said. From your doughy prison you heard bits and pieces of your wife's beautiful voice, but made out something like \"after...race\" and your heart dropped. Was she seriously going to leave you between her butt cheeks for the entire race?! That meant more than 4 hours of each cheek steamrolling your body like it was absolutely nothing. As if to answer your question immediately you felt Mckayla's muscles tense and her body took off like a rocket. You figured out quickly you must be stuck onto her right ass cheek like a little husband tattoo because her left one hit you like a ton of bricks. Each cheek rose and fell, slamming you into the other one like waves in an ocean. All the while both of them were jiggling like crazy, making the whole process feel like some kind of twisted, painful, roller coaster ride. More than ever you now realize just how gigantic Mckayla's ass was compared to you. It was big enough to eat your entire body with absolutely no indication of your presence in there. If anyone was looking at it right now, which you could guarantee some onlookers were, they would only see two orbs bouncing up and down, being compressed by some tight gray running shorts. But to you it was your entire world. You could barely tell which way was up with the beatdown her cheeks were giving you. And the worst part of it all, you felt your body slowly becoming more and more stuck to her right cheek. This was quickly becoming one of the most terrifying situations you and Mckayla have ever been in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut far above you, Mckayla was pressing forward, pumping her legs with a motivation that she had never before felt. She felt terrible about what she was putting her husband through, but her desire to finish the race and save you from this situation was inspiring her more than ever. Despite the situation, she started to smile a bit, and when this was all over she would have to thank you for giving her a reason to push her limits. Soon enough though, after a number of minutes of running, she began to sweat profusely. The hot Saturday sun combined with her naturally sweaty tendencies and was soaking her body. Oddly enough though her ass crack, normally the sweatiest zone of them, felt relatively dry in comparison. Maybe it was the underwear she was wearing, she wasn't sure. But she was thankful for whatever it was. There was no way for you to know what she was thinking, but in her head all thoughts of you had slipped her mind completely. It was only her, and the race.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTime pressed on and your spirit was almost totally broken. You had resigned yourself to this terrible fate, and hoped only that your wife would remember you after this whole ordeal. One surprise to you was that it seemed like after hours her pace had not slowed down at all. The rhythmic pounding of her ass cheeks over your body had stayed consistent this entire time. You took the slightest bit of consolation in the fact that Mckayla must be having an amazing run, and felt a bit of pride in her despite the situation. With this in mind you had something to hold onto, and managed to stay optimistic even given the circumstances.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMckayla was beyond excited when she saw the finish line, and gave herself one last burst of energy. As she crossed the line, body completely soaked and exhausted, she looked up at the clock. It read 3 hours and 30 minutes! She had completely shattered her previous personal record! She had no idea what inspired her to run so fast in the first place, but she was glad at whatever it may be. She thought hard about it as she drank cup after cup of water, but something seemed to keep evading her thoughts. Well, whatever it was must not have been too important or else she would have remembered it, and she started heading home. Coincidentally, this marathon did a loop around town and ended up only a few blocks away from home. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour wife burst through your front door, elated at her performance, and yelled, \"Honey! Kids! I'm home! That was the fastest marathon I've ever run!\" She rounded the corner and saw your daughter sitting on the couch. Vicky was petrified, in her mind she was about to receive the punishment of her lifetime, but Mckayla only shot her a smile and said, \"Hey, thanks for coming out to support me today! Do you know where your father is?\" Vicky quickly relaxed when she realized that her plan had worked, and her mother's forgetful nature had caused her to not remember the entire incident. She simply smiled and responded, \"No I'm not sure where he is, sorry mom.\" Mckayla looked back and said, \"It's okay Vicky, I'm sure he's just in the bedroom or something, speaking of which I'm going to head there now. It's going to take some serious effort to peel these clothes off of me\" your giggled at herself and began to walk out of the room. Vicky only threw back an \"Ew mom\" before laughing again at her perfect plan. Mckayla strutted confidently down the hall towards your room, but right before heading into your room she saw your son Ryan's door cracked open. She decided to say thanks to him too before hitting the shower. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Ryan, I know you're in the middle of a game, but I just wanted to say thanks for coming to the starting line today! It meant a lot to me.\" To her surprise Ryan took off his headphones and said, \"Yeah sure mom, how did dad handle the whole thing?\" Mckayla looked a bit surprised and said, \"I can't seem to find him so I haven't told him yet, do you know where he is?\" Ryan laughed a bit and said, \"Uhh mom? You remember what happened right? Vicky shoved him down the back of your pants right before the race started.\" Mckayla's jaw dropped, just then everything made sense. The inspiration to run faster, the sweat absorbance she had felt in her crack, it had been you the entire time. She immediately ran out of your son's room without a word and ran to the bathroom in your guys' room. With some effort she slowly peeled her utterly soaked booty shorts down, grabbed an ass cheek in each hand and peeled them apart. There, she saw the completely flattened, soaked, and minuscule version of her husband crushed head to toe on her right cheek in her crack. Mckayla's heart dropped, as did her hands, leaving her cheeks to swing back together and squish you one more time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had been a day of absolute torture for you. Hours upon hours of being smashed in your wife's ass had left you both physically and spiritually crushed. You knew already this was the worst you had been crushed in your entire life, and prayed that Mckayla would remember you and be able to peel you off. So when the darkness of your prison was lit up by your wife peeling her shorts back, it was a godsend. You were quickly separated from the left cheek that was practically your best friend at this point, and saw the angelic face of Mckayla, freaking out at what she had done to you. For the first time today you heard her clearly and she, almost crying at this point said, \"Tom, I can't believe what I did to you. I am so, so sorry. I don't even know what to say.\" While you were face was facing up so you could see, your mouth had been completely crushed shut, leaving you incapable of talking, or in this case responding to your wife. Looking even sadder, Mckayla at least realized this fact and said, \"Shit I squished you so bad you can't even talk? Oh god I have to get you out of there.\" You felt her hand brush across your body but neither her nor you could feel a spot where your skin ended and hers began. For all intents and purposes you were just a tattoo lining your wife's deep ass crack. This really was the worst situation you had ever been in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMckayla attempted to scratch at your body for nearly 30 more minutes, turning both your body and her crack red from the friction, but it made no progress. \"No no no no this can't be happening\" she said desperately as she let her cheeks go one more time, crushing you yet again. She wanted more than anything to free you from her ass but didn't know what more she could do tonight. Sadly, she peeled her ass apart one last time and said to you, \"Honey, I know you don't want to hear this, but I don't know how to get you out of there. It's like you're just part of my crack now or something. I feel absolutely horrible about what I did to you, and I promise I'll go ask someone for advice tomorrow. But tonight I'm so exhausted from the race I need to go to sleep. I don't know if you can ever forgive me for this one, so once I get you free we can talk about whether or not you even want to stay with me anymore.\" Mckayla just then began to cry and let go of her ass again, sealing you in your prison. You couldn't bear to see your wife this broken up, and with as much force as you could muster managed to vibrate the smallest amount. Your wife's head shot up and she quickly peeled her ass apart again, saying \"Did you just buzz?? Can you do that at least?\" and you vibrated again in response, this time in three distinct parts. *Bzz,bzz,bzz* you managed to move just enough to get her to notice. Praying somehow your wife would understand your vibration language, you vibrated three times again, over and over while she felt you. After a minute you felt her gasp and laugh for the first time tonight. You could practically hear the smile in her voice and she said, \"I love you too, baby.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were happy. Despite being stuck in the neverending crevasse of your wife's ass, you could take solace knowing that she knew you still loved her and she wouldn't go to bed too upset. She then said, \"Thank you for being the most understanding husband on earth, I really love you so much. I'm going to go to bed now though, and I'll set an alarm to ring every day at noon to make sure I never forget about you, okay?\" You buzzed once in response and your wife dropped her cheeks, walked over to bed and then flopped down. She was out in seconds.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The first night you spent in your new ass-home was, a tough experience to say the least. Mckayla was so exhausted from the marathon and worrying about you that she fell asleep immediately, leaving you in a land of squishy flesh, rising temperatures, and darkness. Your wife slept wonderfully, one of the deepest sleeps she had had in a long time. Luckily for you it was relatively peaceful, and she slept on her stomach for the majority of the night, so you weren't crushed too much more. But even with this stroke of luck the night was not a cakewalk for you. First off, her titanic ass cheeks were big enough that they still pressed together even while Mckayla laid on her stomach. The pressure was nowhere near the level you experienced during that fateful marathon yesterday, but it was still enough to cause you some discomfort. Whats more, Mckayla kept multiple layers of blankets on her as she slept so her ass quickly heated up around you. Before you knew it sweat slowly began to come out of every pore, some from your very own body. You couldn't tell if that was your squished body sweating as well, or if you were so fused to her crack that her pores were sweating through you, but you prayed it was the former. To top it all off your wife passed gas a few times during the night. What were relatively minor farts compared to a normal sized person were absolute torture for you, and even worse the fact that you were trapped completely still under the covers meant that the smell lingered around you for much longer than normal. Despite all of this unaware torture, you eventually managed to fall asleep...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMckayla woke up the next morning feeling absolutely fantastic. Her body was a bit sore from the marathon yesterday but she felt a strong sense of accomplishment from her performance during it. She rolled onto her back, compressing her massive cheeks over you, and daydreamed for a second. She rolled over to look for you in the bed, but when she pulled back the covers and didn't see you, her eyes shot open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh shit Thomas! You're still back there aren't you?!\" Your wife exclaimed and ran to the bathroom, still naked like she slept. Even this run of a few steps triggered horrible flashbacks of yesterday's events for you, but unlike yesterday it was over quick. Mckayla spun around and grabbed a cheek in her hand, each one bigger than her hand could fit but she did her best to peel them apart. There deep in her ass crack was your sticker-like form, utterly flattened to her right cheek and coated in a thin layer of sweat from the night before. Quickly Mckayla's hands began to scratch at your body, but just like last night they made no progress. With a dejected look in her eye she said to you, \"Tom, it's like you literally are just part of the skin on my ass. I can't figure out where your body ends and my butt begins. I'm so sorry about this babe, but I'm going to shower then hit the uhh, squishy guy specialist at the hospital to ask her advice.\" You weren't surprised that your wife forgot the title of the type of doctor for people like you, it was malleable-ologist for the matter, and you were honestly happy that your wife was going to shower. Her crack had built up quite the earthy stench from the marathon yesterday and the night of warm sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour wife hopped in the shower and quickly began soaping up her body. You've spent enough showers as her washrag on accident to know that she started on her breasts, cleaned the rest of her torso, moved onto her legs, then finished with her massive rear end. Possibly because it was her biggest asset, or maybe because it was generally the area most in need of cleaning, but when you were exposed to the light via one hand peeling a cheek apart you knew it was close to being finished. She jammed her soap-covered wash rag into her crack and began scrubbing around. You laughed internally, thinking to yourself that this is what it feels like to be on the receiving end of this washing as opposed to giving it. Soon enough Mckayla finished up and quickly hopped out of the shower. She walked into the bedroom and got dressed, not wanting to waste any more time. In her hurry though she didn't give a second thought to her outfit choice and how it would affect her little ass passenger, or \"assenger\". She briefly stopped and giggled at her clever wordplay with the word \"assenger\" but then continued getting dressed. She slipped on a skin tight thong that slid far between her cheeks, landing even further in her crack than your body was. You mentally said \"what's up, you gonna be stuck in here all day too?\" to the thong and laughed to yourself. You were happy you could make light of the situation but simultaneously saddened by the fact that your wife's underwear was your closest companion at this time. Just then you felt your world compress dramatically as your wife struggled to slip her ass into another pair of skin tight leggings. You cursed your wife for wearing such tight clothing in this situation but there was nothing you could do about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFar up above Mckayla finished her outfit with a loose white shirt and some running shoes, and headed out to see the doctor. Hopefully she will have some insight on the situation, your wife thought to herself. Mckayla slammed her butt down in the drivers seat, and wriggled it around a bit before realizing what she was doing and saying, \"shoot, sorry babe I'll be more careful.\" She turned on the car and headed off to the hospital. The vibration of the car made her butt jiggle around, a feeling that she giggled at, unknowing to the torture it was causing you. But quickly she arrived at the hospital and went to see the specialist. By some stroke of luck she had a cancellation at that exact time and Mckayla walked straight past a line of people waiting in line to see her. She saw one woman with her foot propped up and a visible face sticking off the sole. Another woman looked obviously upset and was saying something about \"Should I throw him up??\" but Mckayla just strolled past into the office and closed the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doctor was another beautiful, curvaceous lady, as it seemed like just about everyone you encountered was. And as she began to make small talk with your wife, Mckayla surprisingly interrupted her and said, \"I'm sorry to be rude doctor but I'm really worried about my husband and don't want to wait any longer.\" The doctor responded, \"Of course, why didn't he come here with you?\" Mckayla sheepishly responded, \"Well... uhh he did.\" The doctor looked confused and Mckayla decided to simply pull her pants down and show her rather. So Mckayla peeled her tight leggins and thong down, grabbed her cheeks and spread them for the doctor. The doctor was initially taken aback by the boldness of your wife but as her eyes drifted to her ass she spotted your miniscule body, deep within her crack. The doctor simply nodded her head and said, \"Got him stuck back there somehow?\" Mckayla said back worriedly, \"Yes I did, and I uhhh, ran an entire marathon with him back there. It's a complicated story, can you possibly just tell me how to get him off??\" The doctor looked a bit worried after your wife mentioned the marathon, and after writing some things down on her clipboard had an answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, with the pressure caused by a woman of your *ehem* assets, over that course of time, it is likely that your bodies have fused together. I've seen it before with a young boy and his mother before. Actually that same young boy has come in multiple times with the same predicament. He must have some terrible luck.\" The doctor laughed thinking about this other patient, and continued, \"But this is no small matter. Your husband is stuck back there pretty badly, he will take at least a few weeks until he is ready to be peeled off, and that is if you make sure to sleep on you stomach and not apply any unnecessary pressure to him.\" Your wife looked utterly shocked, and said,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A few weeks!? But...\"</span></div></div>",

I suppose there's one alternative I could offer you...\" McKaylas face lit up at hearing the doctor say this, \"what is it, doc? I'll do anything to liberate my little man,\" McKayla relies wiggling in her chair for emphasis as she says 'little man'. Having McKayla grind her asshole on top of you was not any kind of playful teasing to you as your gorgeous wife intended but your ears perked up regardless eager to hear the doctors idea. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can give you a pair of gummy panties in similar composition to Tom's body, however they appear extremely similar to him and will bond with him so strongly, he won't be able to reform off of them by himself. Wear these panties for a few days, and Tom will surely fuse with them. When this happens, you won't be able to tell except that he'll be gone from your ass, so you must return the panties here so he can be removed! Otherwise he will stay fused into the panties and you won't even be able to see him on them. Got it?\" McKayla nodded enthusiastically, a few days of not having to change her underwear? She was allll for it. \"Thank you, doc! I'll put them on right away! So I can live just like normal? Because after work I usually like to sweat out any stress of the day on my treadmill and then plop right into bed.\" You rolled your eyes, of course McKayla wouldn't take any precautions to make this experience any easier for you. \"Of course, McKayla but just remember to keep checking to see if he's popped off of you because he has to be extracted from the panties he can't just reform on his own! Also make sure to go easy on the guy you have to wear the panties for multiple days and they'll get dir-\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, Doc!! before the doctor could finish their sentence McKayla was off, her ass jiggling in her new tan gummy panties. \"Hear that, Tom? I did it for us again, found you a solution and I don't even have to do anything! Before you know it you'll be in those comfy panties of mine! And then all I have to do to get you out was....what was the next step again...something about you being inside the panties for a while...maybe you need to be the panties for a certain amount of time or I have to wash them or...oh I'll figure it out, what's important is I get to work and get to work on mooshing you into my panties!\" McKayla was ecstatic about getting you out, yanking her gummy panties into a wedgy, pushing you moreso into her flesh then the panties themselves, all you could do was appreciate the effort. You just hoped McKayla would remember you, remember to wear the panties, keep them clean, and take you back to the doctor. What could possibly go wrong?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Having taken the idea that she can go about her day as normal, she barely gave it another thought as she sat down in the car and drove home. The vibrations of the trip your only companion as Mckayla hummed along to the radio. You knew it was going to be a long week trapped deep in the ass of your forgetful wife. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Mckayla got home she walked into the house and bumped into Vicky. She quickly poked her daughter and frowned \"You are still in big trouble young lady.\" She scolded, making Vicky nervous, before continuing on \"Thanks to your little prank your father is stuck in my ass until the doctors pair of gummy panties can suck him out. I have to remember he is there because he wont be visible. Once he is back to normal he is deciding your punishment!\" She said sternly. Vicky gulped \"how long will it take to free dad?\" She asked, acting as if she felt guilty over getting you stuck, but really she only wanted to know how long she had to plan a way out of punishment. \"A week, the doctor said.\" Your wife replied before huffing annoyed and headed up to her room. She missed Vicky grin as she turned her back to her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVicky began to spend alot of time with Mckayla before and after work, never asking how you had handled being sat on all day at her work, instead seeming to try to keep Mckayla's attention from you, filling her time with mother/daughter bonding. They exercised together, they went for runs together, sat and watched movies together, Vicky spent every free moment with her mother, keeping her attention on her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the week had gone along, you had slowly begun to be sucked into the panties, which by the end of the week had begun to smell quite a bit. That morning, a full week later since the doctors appointment, Mckayla was getting ready for the day when Vicky came into the room with a basket of dirty clothes under her arm. \"Hey mom, thought i would do the laundry for you. got anything dirty? those panties look a bit worn\" She said gesturing to your gummy prison. Your wife looked down at them and chuckled embarrised \"Hehe, yeah ive worn them for ages...probably time to get them washed...where did i get them anyway?\" She said, trying to remember as she hadnt thought about your prediciment all week.Vicky had been waiting for that question all week and grinned knowing her little distraction plan had worked \"We picked them up at the mall a few weeks back remember mom?\" She said casually. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMckayla blinked and smiled \"oh right, of course, silly me.\" She slipped out of them, letting you feel the cool air for the first time all week before she handed the panties over to Vicky, who had quickly scanned her mothers butt for you when she bent over, seeing it devoid of you. She took the panties with the dirty washing down to the basement and looked them over \"hehe wow these stink...there really is no sign of you dad...if i didnt know you were there, i would never guess...nor will anyone else. hehe, sorry but im not getting punished\" She said before simply tossing you into the wash with the rest of the dirty clothing and slammed the door shut. You silently said many curse words directed at your satanic daughter as the wash cycle began, but the spinning soon rendered you unconcious...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>With a few beeps you regained consciousness in a warm, dry place. You realized that you must be in the dryer and the beeping meant that the cycle was over. Disoriented, you glance around you with your vision that was miraculously maintained despite being utterly indistinguishable from the panties you were stuck to. You saw a variety of thongs, bras, and other underwear that clearly belonged to your wife and daughter. With a sigh you took stock of your current situation, and boy was it bleak. Your wife's downright airheaded nature had caused her to completely forget about your entire predicament, and thanks to your heartless daughter it seemed nothing would ever remind her. A few moments later you heard the lid of the machine open and peered up as well as you could. Expecting to see your beautiful wife your stomach churned when you saw Vicky, smiling evilly down at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jeez dad, I can't believe how well you blend into these panties. If i was half as ditzy as mom then I would forget you were part of 'em too!\" Vicky mocked you smugly, before grabbing your pantie-body in her hands and closing the lid of the dryer behind her. She waltzed out of the laundry room past your mother sitting on the couch watching tv. She hollered out, \"Hey mom you mind if I borrow your tan panties? They look super comfy and I want to try them out.\" Mckayla turned over her shoulder, looking at her daughter a bit confused before responding, \"Uhh sure, Vicky, knock yourself out.\" Mckayla didn't understand why Vicky would want to share underwear with her but she didn't see much harm in it anyway. Vicky flashed Mckayla a smile and walked into her room, closing the door behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woohoo, you hear that dad? Mom just gave me the all clear to wear you! This is just too rich, not only can you not punish me but now I can torture you as much as I want! Seems like it's me on top yet again, and you on MY bottom!\" Vicky giggled at her own joke before dropping your body to the ground and stepping through the holes. Quickly she yanked your body up her legs, and you saw her ass looming above you. While it in no way rivaled Mckayla's, it was still big enough to strike fear into your heart. Almost immediately you felt your body, absorbed completely into the backside of these soft, tan, panties pull taught against her cheeks. Pressed tightly against your daughter's butt you sobbed mentally. While you had been in this position countless times before, this one was different. Without Vicky showing some kind of mercy you didn't see any plan of escape. This could potentially be your fate for the rest of your life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next three days passed by in a long, torturous blur to you. Vicky never once took you off, or even acknowledged your existence really. She went to the mall, hung out with friends, exercised, whatever. For all intents and purposes you simply were a pair of panties. But after a few days something miraculous happened...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMckayla woke up that morning, rolling over in bed looking for you, just as she had done every day since her marathon. After a few second of scanning your side of the bed, Mckayla remembered that her tiny loving husband was still missing! Mckayla grabbed her phone, thinking that perhaps you had left her a text or a voicemail. Looking at her phone she saw... nothing, and frowned. But right at that moment a notification for a new email popped up! It said it was from the doctor's office. Mckayla opened it up and read it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dear Mckayla Jacobson-Malthus, I am emailing you as a courtesy reminder to bring the underwear we loaned you back to the clinic. We have dealt with a few cases such as this in the past and I must remind you that your husband will NOT reform without our help. So please, stop by as soon as you can.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMckayla finished reading the email and her heart dropped. Her memory came rushing back to her. The marathon, the doctor's office, the new comfy panties... and Vicky! Vicky had borrowed the panties you were attached to! Mckayla immediately slipped on a robe and ran into your daughter's room. Still sound asleep on her stomach, Mckayla saw her daughter wearing the very same tan panties and instantly recognized them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Vicky! I know those panties have your father attached to them! Wake up and take them off this instant!\" Mckayla's voice boomed with a force and authority that you wished yours could. Appropriately Vicky shot up out of bed, terrified at the punishment she was sure to receive, and she swiftly removed the panties, handing them to Mckayla, Mckayla had the wherewithal to know that she would likely forget all about you yet again. So instead of giving Vicky the tongue lashing she deserved she immediately ran out of the house towards her car. Slamming her butt into the driver's seat she crudely shoved you in the cup holder and sped towards the squishy doctor's office. She arrived as quickly as she could and ran in, maneuvering through the halls until she reached the doctor herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Doctor, I have my husband uhh panties here! I need you to remove him, ASAP!\" Mckayla shouted out as she threw you over. The doctor, recognizing the panic in her voice immediately took your body with her into another room. In a matter of minutes she came back, and walking up behind her was your two-foot tall, human form, grinning ear to ear. Mckayla nearly burst into happy tears as she scooped you up, hugging you firmly and squishing you slightly yet again. The two of you exchanged a loving look as Mckayla thanked the doctor profusely and headed out of the office. Setting you down in the passenger seat of her car, she looked at you and spoke up...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"So Tom, what do we do with Vicky?\" Your wife asked as she climbed into the drivers seat and started the ignition. You felt the rumble of the car start up, for the first time in a while from a sitting position and not trapped under someones ass and thought hard. Mckayla let you think as she drove you both home. By the time you both entered the house, Vicky's punishment had formed in your mind. \"Sweetie, can you come with me while I tell Vicky her punishment\" you said, slightly nervous that your sadistic daughter would simply crush and hide you again. Your wife gave you a loving smile \"Of course\" She said and followed you to Vicky's room. When you entered the door, Vicky looked up from her phone and gulped, seeing both her parents staring at her angrilly from the doorway. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Young Lady,\" You started, trying to sound in charge as you spoke, not easy for a squishy two foot man who spent the past couple of weeks in a pair of panties. \"What you did was inexcusable. I could have been stuck perminantly in those panties. Would you like being trapped in panties? I dont think so. SO here is what will happen. You are grounded for a month\" \"but\" \"NOT FINISHED\" You yelled, actually shutting up Vicky in shock. \"You are grounded for a month. In that time you are going to scrub clean every inch of this house, you are going to do your brothers chores, then you will not pull a single prank on me for a month. You will leave me, completly alone. Is that understood\" You said angrilly. Vicky glanced at her mother, who was nodding with what you said and still glaring angrilly at her daughter, very dissapointed in her. After a few moments she mumbled something, you glared \"I cant hear you, i said do you understand?\" She grunted and said louder \"Yes dad...\" With that, you and Mckayla left the room to let her stew. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou relaxed downstairs, cuddling up to your loving wife as you both watched TV, it was so nice to be able to do things with her again. Though that happiness was cut short when her phone went off. She sighed \"Damn its work. Im sorry sweetie, i have to go in for a bit. Be back later \" She said, kissing you and nuzzling your nose before leaving. You had barely heard her car drive off when a sudden shadow and massive weight crashed down on you. In an instant you were flattened between the weight and the couch cushion. You heard a muffled chuckle as Vicky got up from you and looked down at your flattened body with an evil smirk. \"She had changed into some old grubby clothes, the clothes she usually did her chores in. \" So Dad, im grounded and I have to clean every inch of the house...ok, well then im gonna need something super durable and absorbant to clean with\" She said looking thoughtful before looking down at you with a cheshire grin. You felt your body go cold, but couldn't stop her peeling you up, peeling off your clothes and squishing, folding and flattening you out into a little tan rectangle with your face taking up one side. She had turned you into a little gummy cloth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you even had any hope of reforming, she scooped you up and began her chores. Spraying polish on the wood and slamming your face down into it, spraying cleaner on the surfaces and floor and scrubbing you hard against it. You tasted every bit of dirt and cleaning product as your gummy body absorbed it leaving spotless surfaces in your wake. Vicky seemed to scrub harder than she ever normally did and make things cleaner, seemingly happy to put her full effort into cleaning if it meant torturing you. This went on for hours as she went from room to room, using you to clean everything and letting you get nice and dirty. Eventually you heard the front door open and your wife voice ring out \"Im home\". When she saw Vicky on her knees scrubbing the toilet clean she looked around \"Vicky, where is your father?\" She asked, Vicky acted annoyed and grumbled \"Havent seen him, ive been cleaning like im supposed to. Maybe he went out, like im not allowed to\" Mckayla frowned \"You know perfectly well why you are being punished.\" She looked at the cloth Vicky was using and quickly snatched it off her, looking it over. You hoped that she would free you from this fresh hell, but after a few moments she handed you back. \"I just had to check\" She said to her daughter who took you back, holding back a grin. What you didn't know was, over the house of scrubbing, your facial features had smeared more and more until your entire body was now a uniform colour, a dark, dirty tan colour from all the cleaning. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVicky cleaned for the rest of the day, before putting you in the cupbourd under the sink with the cleaning supplies and placed a few spray bottles ontop of you to stop you reforming. Day after day, when Vicky wasnt at school, she was using you to clean more of the house, torturing you right under your wifes nose. She checked you a few more times but you smelt, felt and looked just like a normal wash cloth so she never guessed what you really were. Finally after two weeks, the house was spotless. Home alone Vicky took the time to mock you, holding you up between her hands. \"There we go little wash cloth\" Not even calling you Dad \"The house is spotless, just like I was told to do. Hmm what was the last part of my punishment..oh right, leave you completly alone\" She giggled and placed you back in the cupboard you had been calling home the last couple of weeks and placed the bottles ontop of you again. \"Have a nice month wash cloth.\" She taunted before closing the door, leaving you in pitch black again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver the last two weeks, your body had been so tortured from the cleaning you werent sure if you could even make yourself reform even if the bottles werent on you. You heard muffled conversations from time to time, but couldn't make out words. Listening to your family have chats over breakfast or dinner, or Mckayla chatting to any friend who came over for coffee, you were so close, but so stuck. A few days later, your wife opened the cupboard to grab some laundry detergent and shed some light on you. Your blurred vision had gotten better slightly as you stared up at your oblivious wife, before your eyes caught a worrying word on the bottle resting on you. \"BETA4\" Your attention quickly moved to the bottle as you read that the cleaning spray had amongst its many chemical mix, trace amounts of Beta4. You had been scrubbing and soaking up this stuff, did that mean you would be unable to form, it was hard to tell. Perhaps it would be too watered down to effect you. As Mckayla grabbed the detergent, she knocked over the bottle, putting it back upright, she placed it next to your little rag body, freeing you from its weight.  before putting you back into darkness as she closed the door again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tried with allyour might to reform now you werent being crushed, you tried for hours and hours to undo what torture the house cleaning had done to you...</span></div></div>",

She continued, \"Isn't there anything you can do to get him off quicker?!\" looking at the doctor expectantly. Mckayla was panicking a bit, not knowing whether she should cancel the vacation or not due to these circumstances. As she fiddled nervously she steamrolled her massive cheeks over your body while shifting the weight to either foot. Times like these made you realize the sheer difference in size between you and your gorgeous wife. Something completely unconscious to her is quite literally rocking your entire world, but quite frankly it made sense because at this moment her ass, in fact, was your entire world. The doctor responded after a second and Mckayla straightened her posture expectantly, slamming her glutes tightly over you yet again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well yes actually there is a procedure that could get him off today, if you're willing.\" Mckayla's eyes brightened, and the doctor continued, \"However, it is very similar to lasering off an actual tattoo. We would basically use intense heat to separate his body from yours. However, the process would be slightly painful for both of you, and you would have to rub this special ointment on hourly to help your skin heal. It would likely put a damper on your vacation plans, but it would be the quickest way to free your husband.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMckayla's eyebrows furrowed as her ditzy brain worked through the options. One the one hand, she could free her husband quickly from her ass and get back to a normal life. But on the other hand she didn't really want to hurt her butt in the process. Plus the ointment application seemed like it would be pretty annoying, and she would definitely forget to do it. Her mind started to drift to the other option as she thought to herself, \"I really don't want to have to cancel the vacation for the whole family just because of this little accident. Also, I would be saving both Thomas and I from the painful procedure!\" She started to get more and more excited at the second prospect as her thoughts continued, \"Yeah I doubt he would want to go through that either! I mean I know he loves my booty, even if it won't let him go sometimes\" she giggled at her own joke, \"I think Thomas would definitely want me to go on the vacation!\" Mckayla finished her consideration and turned to the doctor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you for the option, doc. But I think it's too much of a hassle for us right now. I'm just gonna wait it out!\" Mckayla finished her response and started walking out of the office, figuring that there was nothing else the doctor could do for her. Speaking of which the doctor was left speechless at your wife's response. How could she really choose to keep her husband trapped as a tattoo in her ass? As another patient entered the doctor brushed the interaction off and accepted it as another weird occurrence in her office.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside Mckayla was feeling fantastic. Although she had gotten absolutely nothing accomplished at the doctor's office, her own airheaded thought process helped put her mind at ease. She knew that you would have approved of her choice, even though it meant a little more time between her buns. She felt a slight buzzing deep in her ass crack and grabbed each cheek in her hand, kneading them together powerfully while saying, \"Aww I love you too honey.\" Mckayla took your signs of communication as approval of her recent choice, and figured that squeezing her ass cheeks together was the closest thing to a hug she could give you at the moment. Mckayla reached her car and plopped her ass down powerfully, obliterating your body yet again. She giggled and said, \"Whoops sorry sweetie! That was probably a little too strong of a bear hug for ya, I'll be more careful next time\" while grinding her buns into the seat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFar down below in the land of thongs, butt sweat, and earthy stench you could not believe the events that had just transpired. Mckayla's tons of ass-flesh muffled her conversations from your perspective, but you could still make out parts of them, and what you heard dumbfounded you. Your beautiful wife chose to not only leave you in her ass crack instead of getting you out, but had completely ignored your attempts to buzz and communicate. You were starting to regret buzzing out the words \"I love you\" the night before because now it seemed like every time you vibrated that's what she assumed you were saying. You heard the rumble of the car start up as your wife began to drive home. This was pure torture for you, and based on the sheer amount of pressure that her planet-like derriere put upon you, you didn't even know how well you would be able to reform! Your only hope was that Mckayla wouldn't get too wrapped up in the fun of the vacation and still focus on your freedom. But as Mckayla sang along to the radio and bounced her ass in the seat happily, something told you that was not very likely...</span></div></div>",

Mckayla bounced down the stairs with a spring in her step, obviously with no regard for the living tattoo trapped on her ass, she assumed you were asleep in the bed! Mckayla begins munching on her bagel for breakfast while humming to herself as she reads the Sunday comics. Her loud humming and her bouncing in her seat at the kitchen table easily drown out whatever minute buzzing you could attempt from so deep within her crack. All you could hear was her humming and the occasional loud obnoxious laugh as she read a funny comic. Mckayla reaches for her coffee to take a sip. \"This is my chance to get her to notice me!\" you think. You begin buzzing as rapidly as possible and Mckayla takes notice!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr so you thought, Mckayla, as ditzy as ever, thinks the buzzing is just her phone and picks it up. <span style=\"font-family:comic sans ms, cursive\">\"Hey girl come meet me at the mall at noon, I know you're sore from your marathon but we can at least try on some hot new tights and prepare for the next!!\"</span> Mckayla read aloud the text from Courtney and it made your blood run cold. Not only would Mckayla be out of the house to not notice you but she'd also be trying on tons of tight workout clothing! Mckayla glanced at the clock, it was already 11:30! Mckayla ran upstairs, threw some spandex on, and yelled \"the kids are at a friends honey, enjoy sleeping in!\" Little did she know you were going along with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour oblivious wife hops in the car, cranks up the seat warmer (to help with her sore glutes of course), and sets off. Halfway to the mall, her phone alarm began to go off. \"Oh god its twelve already I'm going to be late. Wait, why is this alarm going off at noon?\" Mckayla thought to herself. You began trying to wiggle or buzz or shout or anything to get her attention right when her favorite song chimes on perfectly timed to distract her. With you completely slipping her mind and the alarm not set to go off until the next day, you know you're helpless to whatever wrath Mckayla has in store with Courtney.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCourtney meets with Mckayla in the parking lot and by the time Mckayla got there, her ass has already sweat out gallons(to you at least) covering you from head to toe. The girls saunter into the mall, Mckaylas sweaty ass grinding you into the flesh with every agonizing step. Where do the girls head first?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She caught it all the same, quickly getting to work wiping the sweat off as she ran. You smiled as you watched her run, she always kept herself in great shape and was so passionate about everything she loved. Shaking your head gently, you got back to your cleaning. Wiping down the weights and scrubbing the dried gunk off Mckayla's yoga mats you discovered that the room was soon spotless alot faster than you expected. Leaving your wife to her work out, you left the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeading back downstairs you heard a rummaging coming from the hallway. Confused as you had expected the house to be empty by now, you wandered towards the sound and gasped. Your daughter Vicky, had just pulled your wallet out of your bag and was pulling out all your money. You glared angrilly, storming towards her. \"What do you think you are doing young lady?\" You asked in a parental angry tone. Vicky actually jumped in shock, but soon grinned as she saw it was you. \"Oh its you dad, im just taking money to get a new dress\" She said casually, tucking the wad down her top. You crossed your arms. \"Put that money back this instant Vicky. you are in big trouble, stealing money from my wallet!\" You said, but she just smirked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she walked closer to you, you began to lose your anger as fear crept up your back. She poked you in the nose, squishing it right into your head \"And how are you going to make me daddy\" She asked in a mocking tone, calling your bluff. \"I'll...I'll tell your mother!\" You tried to suggest, but Vicky just grinned and before you could react, had scooped you up in her hands and crushed you down into a wadded up ball in her hands. \"I can't hear you calling...is it like a dog whistle thing or something?\" She mocked, holding you tight in her hands. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe began kneading you between her hands and chuckled \"However, eventually you will tell Mom, then i'll be in trouble...if she can find you that is\" She said with a sadistic grin on her face. Crushing you flat, she tucked you down her cleavage. \"Lets go shopping Daddy dearest\" She explaimed, knowing exactly what she wanted to do with you. Unable to move or make a sound, you were powerless to stop your daughter taking you out of the house. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVicky headed down into the mall, heading right to the gummy store with a skip in her step as she crossed its threshold.of the store. She headed right up to the first store worker she saw. \"Excuse me miss\" She said sweetly, the woman turning to face her with a smile. \"Hello there, how can i help you?\" She asked cheerfully. Vicky grinned and pulled you out from her cleavage, the journey alone had smeared what had been visible of your features to a blur between her breasts. \"I don't like the discolouration of this gummy material. i was wondering if you could dye it for me. It's for a school project\" She said with an innocent tone. She passed you over to the woman, She had dark skin and a very pretty face. The woman looked down at you and then smiled at your daughter. \"Of course, it costs $10 and we can have it done in about twenty minutes\" She said cheerfully. Vicky handed over the money, YOUR MONEY, told her what colour she wanted and the woman carried you off to the back areas. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tried to squirm for her attention but she was absent mindedly rolling you around in her hand and squeezing you like a stress toy. You were taken out back and to a small machine that looked like an ice cream maker. She popped you into the glass jar and stuck the mechanical mixing arm in. She poured some chemicals that smelt of fruit down on you and popped on the lid. You watched as she turned the machine on and you began to be kneaded and mixed, letting the chemical dyes mix in with you. Your daughter was in big trouble for this, gummy dyes were perminant without a solvent bath for hours, he would be stuck dyed until they could get the solvent. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were kneaded into yourself, losing sight of the outside world, then being stretched out over and over. Finally after twenty minutes, the woman popped the lid off and scooped your well mixed gunk out, rolling you into an orb and carrying you out to Vicky who was browsing the racks of gummy clothes, a bag filled with purchases on her arm, no doubt bought with the stolen money. The woman passed you over to Vicky who took you with a grin. \"thank you. have a great day\" Vicky said, holding you in her hands as she walked out. You saw her holding you in a full length mirror near the door. You had no visible features at all, you were totally...</span></div></div>",

Not to mention, you had been mixed up so much that you couldn't even wriggle as Vicky carried you home. You wondered what fresh horror your daughter had planned for you. Were you to be molded into the gummy dress she had intended to buy? Was she going to Smear you into your wifes favorite red yoga mat? You had no idea and no way of asking Vicky. When she got home, she quickly tossed her bag in her room, carried you down to the kitchen and put you in a saucepan. She turned the hob on at a low heat and began rummaging around in the drawers looking for something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she rummaged, you felt yourself softening, becoming less solid and more of a thick paste. It wasn't hot enough to melt you into a full liquid though, but when Vicky stood back up, you knew why she was softening you. In her hand was a turkey baster. It was a special one that resembled an oversized syringe rather than a traditional baster. She chuckled \"Oh this is going to be so funny\" She claimed as she stuck it into you and pulled it back, your body being sucked into the plastic tube. She kept pulling the end until all of you was sealed inside it. Vicky turned off the hob, placed you on the side and washed up the saucepan before putting it away, hiding any sign she had done anything. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that sorted she snuck up to the on suite bathroom you and your wife had. It didn't have a shower, it was just somewhere for Mckayla to wash off her make up and brush her teeth before bed. She grinned at you in the tube \"Mom bought some new toileteries yesterday but hasn't opened them yet. One of them was...this!\" She held up an unopened tube of cherry flavoured \"Super scrub\" toothpaste. Suddenly the cherry red dye made sense. You already had a cherry scent and taste, which was now probably enhanced by the dye. You watched as your daughter squeezed the entire tube of real toothpaste down the drain before aiming the nozzle of your prison to the now empty tubes opening. \"Mom's gonna love her new toothpaste\" Vicky said before pushing down on the plunger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnable to fight back, you were pushed into the empty toothpaste tube, your gummy body filling it back up until you were packed tightly inside. You saw your last glimpse of daylight fade as Vicky screwed the lid back on and placed the tube where she had found it. \"Hehe, good luck being found Dad...ill wait for you to tell mom on me hahahah\" She said, laughing as she walked away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou lay there in the dark tube, unable to move, make a sound or alert your wife in any way that you were not toothpaste. As it was a brand new tube, she wouldn't know any different. You knew you were in terrible danger. It would take Mckayla months to work her way through your tube, only letting tiny bits of you out at a time before spitting you down the drain. By the time she finished you off, you would probably reform about the size of a pea with the rest of your mass somewhere in a water treatment plant....</span></div></div>",

You pop your body out of the tube, finding yourself at about 6 inches tall after being used for a few nights. The real problem was that your body was still a distinct red color, it appeared almost like you were blushing all over and yet you definitely weren't. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I need to get to McKayla, she'll punish Vicky for doing this to me after she realizes I could've been lost for good down the drain!\" You venture out of the bathroom looking both ways before venturing downstairs. There you see your wife, blissfully enjoying a yoga session, listening to the instructor through her Bluetooth headphones. You had a great sound system installed so she wouldn't have to use headphones for your safety, but she always insisted on \"getting in the zone\". You ran as fast as you could to your wife, which was still incredibly slow at 6 inches of height. Just as you were going to reach out and interrupt your wife's downward dog, she kicks a leg back, sending you flying into the wall before your body crumples into a flat pile on the floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmmmm? What was that?\" Your wife asked aloud to herself as she removed one of her earbuds. She looked backwards to see your flat body laying on the floor. \"A red polka dat on the floor! How silly, I wonder how it got here...\" prodding you a few times with a sweaty foot inquisitvly, your wife began to feel you out before going into a squat and peeling you off with a fingernail. Laying in your wife's sweaty palm, you begged she could realize what had happened when she kicked you, and you began trying to display any type of sentience. Screaming on the top of your lungs, you managed to produce a short burst of vibration as McKayla poked your squishy body, your face shoved into her sweaty palm preventing her from seeing your eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This polka dot is super warm, it's radiating heat like a little furnace and even vibrates! It's red with heat! I know, this must be the latest gadget Thomas was telling me about! The pocket sauna!

By the time you came to your senses, your wife had slapped you hard, face first into the soles of her feet. All you saw was darkness and the hot stench of your beloveds feet pressed up against your nose and mouth, both of which had been split in two as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith her \"heat pads\" in place, Makayla went back to her work out, enjoying the comfortable warmth coming from underfoot. She stomped down on you, twisting and moving as she exersized. Sure enough, your body heat and her work out began to make her feet sweat like the rest of her. Your open mouths were forced to taste her foul salty sweat as it began to soak up into your gummy body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeing stomped on repeatedly, you lost track of time, only able to keep pace with the footfalls of your wife. Eventually though, she was finished and you heard her muffled voice as she spoke to someone, standing directly on you. She lifted one foot, peeling you off and placed you in what felt like a hand, though your vision was blurry from the sudden light. Then she peeled off the other and placed it in a hand as well. \"They are super comfortable sweetheart, try them\" You heard your wife say. Suddenly, your vision cleared and you saw the grinning face of your sadistic daughter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour face was visible to her, as Makayla had placed you face up in her hands, but your wife didn't spot you as she left to take a shower. You trembled in fear being held by Vicky, alone in the house gym room. \"Well well dad\" She whispered mockingly \"looks like you got out of the toothpaste tube and fell right into a new job. Mom says you are perfect for it...however, we both know you will end up reforming and then you cant do your job anymore...what kind of a daughter would I be, if I didn't help out my daddy\" She mocked and carried you to her bedroom, laying you down on her dresser and held up a little bottle \"Look what i got from school for a textiles project\" She said with a malicious grin. In her hand was a small bottle of Beta4, a chemical you had banned from the house, knowing what it could do to you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't spare much, i need it for my project, but i dont mind sharing a bit to help you out daddy..hmm but first..\" She pressed her thumb down on your facial features and began rubbing, smearing them until they blended in uniformly, leaving you vision very blurred. You felt a faint mist being sprayed on each half of you, your helpless body parts tensing up as your shape was locked in. Vicky squealed to herself with laughter seeing your shapes solidify. \"Hehe Mom told me to put her \"Heat Pads\" in her running shoes when I was done with them...I'll do that now Daddy. don't worry, i know you would be embarrised to do this new job of yours, it will be our little secret\" She laughed and scooped you up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarrying you over to Makayla's well worn running shoes, she casually tucked you into each of them, resting you in place ontop of the padded insoles, which were also red. You tried to scold Vicky and tell her how she couldn't treat you this way, but of course you were silent and inanimate. You watched her blurry form walk away and left you alone in the silent doom of your wifes running shoes. You knew that Vicky was very good at keeping her mouth shut when it came to you being trapped, but never before had she used Beta4 on you. Who knows how long you would remain your wifes heat pads for her feet without her any the wiser...</span></div></div>",

The sweat itself was being absorbed by your body letting you get the taste of your wives foot every day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was one such day, only four days after Makayla had gotten her new favorite foot padding she was just getting home from a run, chugging a water bottle before she was going to announce to her daughter that she was home.

As she asked you she bounced up and down in anticipation, throwing the assets on her front and backside into a fit of jiggles. You truly had wanted to do nothing more than clean up but looking up at your giantess wife's beautiful, beaming smile, you couldn't help but give in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure babe! I would love to! Just be careful not to squash me! I know how into these workouts you can get\" you responded to Mckayla. She quite literally jumped for joy, treating you to another show of her glorious body bouncing around, then looked back down at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yay! I've got this new exercise tape I've been dying to try. It's supposed to be a great full body workout\" Mckayla said to you as she walked towards the cabinet holding all of her workout supplies and videos. You took a moment to ogle her monumental ass as it swayed to and fro in front of you. While Mckayla was looking for the workout video she looked back and noticed your eyes basically glued to her rump. She simply giggled and said,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Drink it in while you can, Tom, because in a minute this booty of mine is gonna be drenched in sweat. And that is something that you definitely DON'T want to drink in\" Mckayla laughed out loud at her own joke. If only she wasn't so ditzy then she would have remembered the countless number of times that you practically have had to drink her butt sweat in, but you simply shook your head and chuckled along with her. After another minute it seemed she found the video. Exclaiming \"Aha!\" Mckayla grabbed it from the cabinet and walked it over to the small tv in the room. She bent over putting the video into the player, waving her enormous buns in your face one last time. Feeling flirtatious you stepped up on your tip-toes and planted a passionate kiss right in the jiggly flesh of her left buttcheek. Mckayla, surprised by your tiny kiss, let out a short gasp before pushing her buns back into your face. You felt the force of this playful bump from your wife almost knock you clean off your feet, staggering to catch your footing. You snapped out of you infatuated gaze and remembered just how much more powerful Mckayla's ass was than even your entire body, and took a step to the side. Soon enough you heard the cheesy exercise music start up your wife bounced backwards, flying past where you were standing a mere second ago. You were thankful that you moved a bit to the side because the booty bump you narrowly avoided could have easily sent you launching across the room. You looked up at your beautiful wife and she looked back at you, asking, \"You ready?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe exercise started off slowly enough, with some jumping jacks. You quickly began the routine and felt your blood flowing, not only from the exercise but from the close proximity to your giantess wife who had already placed 100% of her attention on her workout. You watched Mckayla's body bouncing outrageously with every repetition, also noticing that she had quickly built up her usual layer of sweat. Mckayla was evidently very into her workout as her left foot strayed closer and closer to you with every jump. Quickly, the video moved on from jumping jacks to squat jumps, and you heard your wife groan. Despite your wife being in wonderful shape, it seemed like certain exercises made her much sweater and more exhausted than usual. You on the other hand, we're breezing through the workout. Your incredibly light weight combined with moderate athleticism made bodyweight exercises like this one much easier than they are for your voluptuous wife. In fact, sometimes it seemed like the junk in her trunk combined with her enormous bust were what contributed most to this problem. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn one particularly emphatic squat jump, Mckayla put all of her energy into it and leapt high in the air! You were amazed at her ability for a split second, but almost immediately you noticed a large shadow looming over the exact spot you were at! You looked up and saw a meteor-sized shoe hurtling towards your tiny defenseless body. Mckayla was about to land right on top of you! You leapt as quickly as you could from the landing zone of her huge foot, but only your upper body was able to escape. Her full weight came down on your legs, crushing them flat onto the ground beneath you. Mckayla felt something squish beneath her foot and paused, looking down at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hah, laying down already? Come on Tim I know you can keep up!\" Mckayla said haughtily down to you, completely unaware that she was the sole reason you were laying down. You shouted back, \"MCKAYLA I'M NOT TIRED, YOU JUST CRUSHED MY LEGS\" for once shouting loud enough to get her attention. Mckayla looked down and said,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh shoot! I'm sorry Tom!\" and stepped off you. Luckily you had only been squashed for a second and you reformed almost immediately. You stood back up and resumed the workout. Quickly, the workout swapped exercises yet again, and you heard the commentator on the video say, \"Time to work those abdominals!\" You head Mckayla groan very loudly up above you, abs being her least favorite body part to work out. Mckayla looked evidently tired, but she said down to you,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Tom if you want to call it quits I totally get it, I mean I'm doing great I'm just making sure you're okay.\" You saw through your wife's obvious lie and chuckled. In reality, you were handling this workout much better than her, but just then you realized the second reason why you don't like to workout with Mckayla much...she was insanely competitive. In addition to the usual threat of you wife bouncing around you getting caught up in her exercises, working out with your wife almost always had to end with her \"winning\" in one way or another. For some reason she always had to beat you in whatever you guys were doing, even if that meant she had to take drastic measures... This competitive nature of hers lead to some of the only times that you can remember your wife intentionally squashing your minuscule body. Of course, she never was malicious with these squashings, but nevertheless they weren't out of the picture when \"victory\" was on the line for Mckayla.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite this knowledge you were feeling a bit cocky. Not only were you enjoying the workout but in your mind you could impress Mckayla with your apparent athletic ability. So quickly you responded, \"No way babe! I've barely even broken a sweat, unlike somebody!\" Mckayla gasped, and you saw her brow furrow with determination. You gulped as you realized that provoking your wife's competitive nature might not have been the smartest move, as the video commenced part two...</span></div></div>",

Looking upwards you saw Mckayla wipe a shocking amount of sweat from her face and then take a large sip of water. At this point as much as you liked the fact that your minuscule stature was actually useful for something, you were still praying that anything would get you out of the second half of this exercise video. And for seemingly the first time in your entire life a stroke of good luck fell upon you!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*RING* Mckayla's phone rung out loudly and your face lit up with joy. Quickly Mckayla paused the video and went over to answer. She picked up the phone and held it to her ear, you couldn't hear what the other line was saying but as Mckayla's eyes went wide you knew that it was something worthy of bailing on this workout. You breathed a massive sigh of relief knowing that this situation which surely would have ended poorly would be avoided. Just then, Mckayla finally responded,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't believe I forgot about the costume party! We'll get changed and head right over!\" Mckayla said giddily into the phone before swiftly hanging up. Immediately she turned and looked down at you behind her, speaking up again, \"Some of my friends from work threw a costume party on our day off and it's starting right now! It must have completely slipped my mind!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smile up and respond, \"Oh I had no idea either! I don't have a costume or anything!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer smile growing even wider and more radiant, Mckayla responded, \"Don't worry a thing, honey, I got us a couple's costume this year! I'll be right back I'm going to go get it!\" As Mckayla finished her exclamation she skipped out the room, stepping directly over you as you passed between her legs. As her massive body flew over yours you felt a bit demeaned, as usual when your two-foot body was put into a situation like that, but you knew that Mckayla never meant to hurt your feelings in any way so you brushed it off. Moments later you heard loud footsteps booming back down the hallway into the room and your wife's gorgeous, albeit still sweaty form appeared in the doorway. She quickly unfolded the fabric she had in her hands, revealing a large, light brown piece of cloth shaped like an animal of some kind. Seeing that you didn't recognize the costume immediately, Mckayla spoke up,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's one of those two person horse costumes like the ones in cheesy TV shows! See?\" At that point you finally recognized it in her hands, seeing clearly what she was talking about. It did look just like one of those stupid costumes that characters in old TV shows would use to try to sneak into places, and you couldn't help but laugh slightly. At least, you laughed for a second until your sixth sense for bad situations started to creep in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold on one sec, Mckayla, am I in the front or...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll go in the back! Here hop in hop in! We're going to be late for the party if we don't hurry!\" Mckayla quickly opened up the costume to reveal the interior to you. You desperately wished to protest but you could tell that Mckayla really wanted to get to her friend's party. Biting your tongue you climbed into the opening and stepped through the part Mckayla would wear and into the backside. Sliding your feet to the bottom you then stood up in the rear of the costume with a mountain of fabric hanging in front of you. Oddly enough when you stood up it seemed like the costume fit you exactly right, which was a rare enough experience for you to be able to recognize it immediately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhh, Mckayla? Two things. First of all it's pretty dang hot in here. And second of all... the suit is my size, there's absolutely no way you are going to be able to fit into it.\" You said through the layer of cloth. Mckayla was confused for a moment before examining the package she took it out of, reading it out loud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Two person horse costume... for children.\" She said while slapping her forehead for not reading carefully enough. As she stood there thinking about alternative ideas, a flash of inspiration hit her. \"Wait, a second, Tom! What if I just wear the costume up to my waist like some sort of badass centaur or something! Wouldn't that be cool?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThinking about it for a second you weren't considering what that would mean for you and you mindlessly responded, \"Yeah actually that would probably look great!\" Mckayla jumped with joy as her costume ended up working out after all. She quickly tossed the package aside before beginning to strip down her sweaty workout clothes all the way down to her bra and panties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope you don't mind that I took my clothes off, Tom, if it's hot in there like you said then I don't want to get all sweaty.\" The truth was that ship had long sailed, but before you could even respond you felt your wife lift up the fabric in the front and slide one of her meaty legs into the opening. Instantly she felt the suit material tight around her legs, but it seemed stretchy enough to accommodate her lower half at the very least. Mckayla then stepped her other leg in before attempting the monumental task of pulling the suit over her ass. The upper body and head of the suit hung loosely above you on the outside and wasn't really even noticeable compared to the spectacle that was Mckayla squeezing into a children's costume.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou, meanwhile, could only feel the fabric moving around you as you were stuck in the relative darkness of the rear section. The material allowed some light to permeate through the costume so it wasn't pitch black, but it still wasn't easy to see at all. Just then, however, the opening in front of you was lifted up towards the light and you could see clearly for the first time. However, the image that became clear to you was one you could probably draw from memory alone after so many years of marriage, the enormous ass of your wife. Just as quickly as you gained vision you lost it though, as her cheeks began to force themselves into the small opening of the suit. In an instant you felt the temperature inside the suit rise what felt like twenty degrees. Mckayla's rump was still very sweaty from the workout you two just completed, and as a result the tremendous heat it gave off turned your couple's costume into a personal sauna. You could feel the heat source getting closer and closer to your face as you attempted to back up and counter its advance. But quickly you felt the back of your head hit the back of the suit and you knew that there was no more retreating. With one final \"Hmph\" coming from your wife's mouth above you as well as a mighty yank on the suit, it finally slid past her but cheeks and secured itself tightly around her waist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMckayla breathed a sigh of relief before glancing towards the mirror on the opposite wall of the exercise room. She gasped before saying, \"Tom! This costume looks so cool! We look fantastic!\" While you appreciate her including you in her statement, for all intents and purposes she looked fantastic, you were barely even visible. And as Mckayla was having the time of her life checking herself out in the mirror, you were suffering a much worse fate in the hindquarters of the costume. As you could have easily predicted, Mckayla's huge ass filled up significantly more than the half of the horse that it should have, spilling generously onto your side. At your current state her bare buns were mere milimeters in front of your face, you could tell sadly by the smell of sweat and heat radiating off of them. Luckily, however, you had not been squashed quite yet and you used this opportunity to speak up to your unaware wife.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, so, Mckayla? You know I love your butt more than anything, but right now it's kind of invading my personal space.\" You reached up and poked her jiggly cheek with a finger before bringing your hand back down to your side. You thought about mentioning how sweaty and gross it was too but you never liked making your wife feel self-conscious about anything, even if it meant you had to suffer a bit in return. However, it seemed like your tone wasn't quite serious enough as Mckayla laughed in response,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh is it now? Well what if I said you were the one invading my butt's personal space, huh?\" Mckayla said cutely while shoving her butt backwards emphatically. Immediately you felt her warm, sweaty cheeks press your face into the back of the costume for no more than a second before returning to their resting place in front of you. You were about to reiterate the fact in a more serious tone but then Mckayla spoke up again, \"Just kidding, sweetie. I know being a horse's ass isn't an ideal costume, but don't worry I won't make you stay in there for too long! Just long enough for all my friends to see, sound good?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou breathed a sigh of relief at that at least, hoping that she would stay true to that word you responded, \"Yeah, sounds great, now let's go strut our stuff at this party.\" Mckayla smiled before reaching a hand back and patting your head through the fabric of the suit, unintentionally pressing your face into her ass once more before beginning to walk. Initially you were afraid you wouldn't be able to keep up with your giantess wife's pace, but the silver lining of having her ass in your face meant that as she flexed her muscles to take a step each cheek would alternate rubbing slightly against you. Quickly you got used to this motion and began to be able to predict when she would walk based on the slightest flex of her glutes. It wasn't a situation you were particularly proud of but it was better than tripping up behind her! As the two of you walked out of the house you thought to yourself that maybe it wouldn't be such a bad day after all... but you weren't entirely sure.</span></div></div>",

            ],
            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As you felt yourself being dragged along out of the house with your wife, you began to question your decision to go along with this plan. At that very second you were surprisingly unharmed, simply following the pace of Mckayla's steps and taking care not to make any contact with the ass that filled up quite literally your entire field of view. You would be the first to admit that her butt drove you wild, but you found it hard to maintain that infatuation in times like these where you found yourself stuck with it one way or another. And with each passing step it felt like the temperature would rise and rise, the source of which being the sweaty cavern between her buns. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe walk to her friend's house was no more than 10 minutes, but the fact that you were in a heavy, warm suit made it much feel much longer. The worst part was that you had no way of seeing the outside world in this predicament, only being able to hear slightly muffled sounds coming through the suit. But after a number of luckily accident-free minutes you began to hear the unmistakable bass beat of music, and you knew you were at the party. Quickly you reached your hand up through what little space you had and poked Mckayla in the ass cheek in an effort to get her attention. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AH\" your wife shrieked before turning around and scanning the sidewalk behind her. She had assumed some kid must have run up and touched her butt on a dare or something based on the sensation she felt, but was quickly confused when she saw nobody there. \"Hello? Whoever did that you should know it's not polite to touch a lady without her permission!\" Mckayla shouted out some broad message to the surrounding area, still not sure of what touched her before turning around. You could still hear her voice clearly enough despite and you facepalmed knowing that your wife had already forgotten about you before shouting up,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mckayla! It's Tom! I'm in the butt of your freaking costume!\" Mckayla was just able to make out your muffled words over the music of the nearby house and a lightbulb turned on in her head as she recognized you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Tom! I'm so sorry I couldn't see you! What's up?\" Mckayla turned once more and looked down at her own ass, still not really able to discern your form from the back of her costume. Her utterly nonchalant tone bothered you slightly until you realized that of course she had every reason to be relaxed. From her perspective she was just wearing an awesome costume, not hovering inches away from sweaty mounds of flesh that could fit her entire head between them like you were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just don't forget about me back here! It's getting really hot and I don't want to be in here too long!\" You shouted back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry Tom I won't forget! Just long enough to show off our sweet costume for a bit then you can hop out.\" You breathed a sigh of relief, but almost as if she had some unconscious sixth sense to unintentionally inspire dread in you, she continued, \"But the party sounds kind of loud in there so I don't think I'm going to be able to hear you! It's okay though I promise I'll let you get out whenever you want!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMckayla's last sentence struck fear into your heart, as any significant distraction to her usually meant a terrible fate for you, and loud music along with dancing seemed likely to be just that. Just as you were about to raise a concern you felt the huge right cheek in front of you flex its muscles, rubbing its sweaty skin slightly across your nose before the rest of her leg stepped forward. Immediately you knew you had to keep up or risk falling into her and you shut up to focus on the movement. Moments later you felt your wife's guiding legs come to a halt with you right behind them, and heard Mckayla knocking on the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn no more than ten seconds one of Mckayla's best friends swung the door open in a sexy nurse costume before shrieking with joy upon seeing her friend. \"Welcome, girl! You look smoking hot in that costume! Come in, come in!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMckayla flashed a big smile at the compliment before striding elegantly into the house, accentuating her walk for show, an action which caused her cheeks to rub against your face slightly once again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah, how did you get your back legs to move in such a realistic fashion like that? It looks almost like a real person is back there!\" Mckayla's friend asked curiously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's because it IS a real person! It's my husband, Tom!\" Mckayla responded and you let loose a breath of relief now knowing that at least one other person at this party was aware of your existence. It didn't seem like much, but with the forgetfulness of Mckayla this was actually crucial for you to know. \"If you want I can take him off so you can meet him real quick!\" For a brief moment you were utterly elated, your wife was actually giving you an opportunity to get out of this embarrassing situation! That was, until her friend responded,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you kidding! No way! I mean sure I would love to meet your husband of course but not until we've shown off your costume to everyone!\" With that response your fate was sealed and she quickly grabbed Mckayla's arm, yanking her towards the rest of the party goers. This sudden, jerky movement was not at all like the smooth movements of Mckayla's steps up until that point, and as a result you found your head quickly pressed against the back of the costume from the momentum before bouncing straight in the opposite direction and slamming your face firmly into the crack of Mckayla's ass. You felt your head squish slightly into the earthy-smelling flesh in front of you, but thankfully you were able to brace your hands against her thighs and yank yourself back off of her skin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you two got deeper into the party, the music got louder and louder, preventing both you and Mckayla from hearing each other at all. You began to feel very suspicious of this whole situation, combining both Mckayla's forgetfulness with her love to socialize was a recipe for disaster for you. The truth was, though, now that nobody could hear you things were completely out of your control. You could only sit back in your fabric prison and wait while staring at the enormous, now completely sweaty, prison guards right in your face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoes Mckayla keep her promise?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The party raged on with Mckayla bubbily bouncing from person to person showing off her wonderful costume. It seemed each person loved it more than the last and your gorgeous wife was eating up all the attention she was getting from her model friends. The music and surrounding chatter was far too loud for you to hear anything through the muffled fabric of the costume, but you would have been happy to hear that Mckayla was successfully remembering where you were! She told each and every one of her friends that you were nice enough to fill in the rear-end for her costume despite it meaning that you would be face-to-ass for the duration of your stay.  Some of the women poked fun at how \"lucky\" you were to spend quality time with Mckayla's fantastic ass, while others simply fawned over how good of a couple you two were. Mckayla's friends often glorified your wife's absurdly large, yet perfectly shaped rump, and for good reason. It was more than deserving of it. However, the fact remained that none of them ever had to have the up close and personal experience with it that you did. If they could experience 5 minutes of the soul-crushing pressure or the earthy sweat that those buns could produce then you firmly believed they would view it differently. Regardless, you couldn't hear any of the conversations happening in the realm of normal people as your entire world consisted of the damp ass-flesh frequently bumping into your face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTime flew for Mckayla and dragged on incessantly for you as she continued to make sure she talked to each and everyone she knew at the party. As it turned out, by mentioning you nonstop to each new friend she talked to she actually remembered where you were for once! She turned over her shoulder and affectionately rubbed a hand on the butt of her costume, which was actually the back of your head. Pressing your face slightly into her rump in what she thought was a flirtatious way simply ended up with more unnecessary butt sweat smearing over you. Mckayla sighed with happiness as she scanned the room, noticing that she had said hello to each and every person there. The moment was bittersweet, as she now knew her 15 minutes of attention would be over, but at the same time she could now let you out so you two could enjoy the party together! She looked down at the costume, noticing that there was no zipper in the middle to allow you to get out, only one in the front which would require both of you to take the costume off. Mckayla had no problem with showing a little skin, especially around her model friends who had seen her in practically nothing countless times before. Reaching for the zipper she grabbed it and quickly yanked the clasp downward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*SNAP*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMckayla's eyes popped open as she held up her hand... to see the clasp of the zipper had broken right off. Her mind first went to the costume itself as she was upset about her recent purchase breaking so quickly. The reality that she didn't understand was that she had been placing far too much pressure on the suit itself with her enormous, curvy body, and something was bound to give sooner or later. A few seconds later she finally realized the real travesty of shattering her zipper. Gulping, she looked down and saw the zipper zipped tight against the front of her waist, then looking back she faintly saw the outline of your head behind her rump. Panicking, Mckayla realized she had to tell you the situation quickly, and maybe you could give some insight about what to do. In a flash she bolted towards the bathroom, causing your head to ricochet off the back of the costume and then forward, slamming you into the crack of her ass. This time it was with such force combined with the high temperatures that you felt your face squash slightly into the inside of each cheek as well as the crack itself. You would have whimpered if you could as Mckayla's steps sent her enormous butt cheeks shaking to and fro, each one slamming into the other like a steamroller. You felt your face get cmashed as it now seemed like her ass was almost intentionally eating your head up. Seconds later she reached the bathroom and shut the door behind her, muffling the sound of the blaring music. She steeled her nerves and said down to you,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tom? I know this isn't what you want to hear right now but the costume is kind of broken... And I can't take it off.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour head was nearly neck deep in your wife's ass at this point but you could still barely hear her despite the circumstances. Needless to say you were furious, Mckayla promised that you wouldn't be spending long in this ass-filled hellhole but now it seemed like you would be. Out of sheer rage and willpower you slammed your hands into each cheek and shoved against her meaty cheeks as hard as you could. As to be expected, Mckayla didn't even budge an inch from the force of all your strength, but somehow you popped your now two-dimensional head free from her crack! Mckayla must have felt all of this as she let out a surprised \"OH\" once you came free. You then used your hands to pry your squashed face back into normalcy, suddenly restoring your ability to speak! This was perhaps the quickest recovery that you had ever made but you didn't have much time to bask in the glory. You shouted up at Mckayla,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mckayla! Let's go home now and just cut the suit off! I can't take it anymore do you know how god damn sweaty your ass is?\" You shouted up, loud enough to hear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no, Tom, is it really that bad? I'm so sorry I would have never put you through that if I knew!\" She said caringly down to you. The reality was she definitely should have thought about how sweaty her butt gets, but of course she happened to forget at the worst possible times for you. Nevertheless you were capable of talking, Mckayla was aware of your existence, and you had a plan to get free. So things weren't looking too bad for you after all!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright Tom I'll head home right now I promise.\" She said with another affectionate pat on your head, this time you manage to hold you head back enough to not slam into her buns. Immediately she opened the bathroom door and began walking out of the party. She ran into the host and said a quick goodbye without explaining the situation before exiting the house entirely. You kept up with her walking pace this time, her massive cheeks only grazing your nose with every step as opposed to chewing you between them. A fact you were currently very grateful for. Even the blazing sun beating down on your fabric prison couldn't damper your mood, despite the inundation of sweat it seemed to be forming on the ass of your wife in front of you. And nearly 10 minutes later you two returned home!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMckayla opened the door and walked inside, bolting for the drawer where she kept scissors. Your torture was nearly over as you heard her open the drawer and pull them out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay Tom, time to get you...\" Mckayla's sentence was abruptly interrupted by a ringing of her cellphone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*RING RING*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe reached into her pocket and pulled it out. The fact that she even had pockets yet your half didn't even have a zipper to free yourself annoyed you greatly, but you brushed it off. After listening for a few moments she spoke up again,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, what!? You sent pictures of my costume to the head photographer... and she loved it!? And she wants to do a photoshoot for a video-game tomorrow morning with me in it!? I can't believe it that's so amazing thank you! ... Okay I'll see you then!\" Mckayla hung up the phone and you couldn't believe your ears. Grinning ear to ear at the opportunity for such a fun photoshoot she then looked at the scissors in her hand and down at you before her stomach dropped once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no, Tom. I'm so sorry. I got caught up in the moment! I just agreed to do a shoot tomorrow first thing in the morning!\" She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well just cut me out and we can go get another costume beforehand!\" You responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The costume store is already closed and it won't open before the shoot tomorrow...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were stunned. Now your wife was telling you that you would be stuck in the costume for a minimum of an entire day longer. You had a myriad of words you would have liked to say to your wife right now, but you knew how important her job was to her, and asking her to bail on a photoshoot would be like breaking her heart. Sighing then steadying yourself you spoke up,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay, Mckayla. I understand. Just wear the costume until the shoot is over then take me off after. You're gonna look so hot in the costume and that's all that matters.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour kind words must have reached Mckayla as she quickly perked up her mood, \"Oh Tom you seriously are the best husband anyone could ask for! I promise this will be over soon! And feel free to grab my butt as much as you want while you're down there if you need to. I'm sorry I don't have much more to entertain you with.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smiled at your wife's attempt at making the situation seem better as you responded, \"Will do, babe. Just please try to limit the amount of sitting while I'm back here, okay? And I swear to god if you fart...\" you joked up at your wife and she giggled in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh god that would be like the world's worst hotbox now wouldn't it?\" Mckayla joked but was actually right on the money with her description. You had involuntarily taken place in one of these horrific hotboxes before and zero part of you wanted to do it again. \"I promise I won't! I mean... well I shouldn't need to!\" she finished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fact that she didn't guarantee you this with certainty terrified you greatly, but you didn't have much other choice. Taking a breath in you readied yourself for the upcoming long night and day ahead...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens during your stay in the costume?                                                             </span></div></div>",

Immediately, your conscience screamed at you to tell her no. Things were only going to go terribly wrong for you if she pitched in. However, her face was so alluring, and her cheerful smile was so infectious. After a moment of hesitation, you nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure thing honey.\u201d You said softly, already regretting uttering those words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYay!\u201d Mckayla exclaimed, as excited as a little school girl. She bent down and gave you a big kiss, her plush lips leaving a mark on your forehead, and a few drops of saliva ran down your nose. While you took a second to wipe your face, Mckayla put her headphones back in, and strolled to the corner of the room. You whirled to face her, feeling a tinge of fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMckayla darling. Are the headphones necessary?\u201d You inquired, but your question fell on deaf ears. Mckayla\u2019s music was blaringly loud, and there was no way she was ever going to hear you with them in. With a deep sigh, you began collecting discarded articles of clothing, and trying your hardest to stay as far away from your giantess wife as you could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe job proceeded relatively smoothly, despite your fears, but the peace did not last. You came to a sock that had been so sweaty and crusty that it was stuck to the floor. You dropped to your hands and knees, and gripped the fabric of the sock as tightly as your tiny arms could manage. Your squishy status made you weaker than a normal human being to being with, and your minute size certainly didn\u2019t help either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, you were beginning to make a bit of progress, and the disgusting sock slowly peeled away from the floor bit by bit. A triumphant smile spread across your face, but then a suspicious shadow washed over you and the sock. Glancing up in fear, you saw the towering form of Mckayla, standing right beside you. She had worked her way around the room and back to you, and you had been too distracted to notice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMckay\u2026\u201d Was all you got out before Mckayla, oblivious to your presence, took another step back. Her foot slammed down onto your face, squashing it flat. Your unknowingly wife didn\u2019t notice, though she did step off of you a moment later. Taking advantage of this time, you crawled away as fast as you could, which wasn\u2019t easy with half a smushed body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou crawled up onto the damp yoga mat from earlier, deciding it was a safe enough distance away from Mckayla. As you were beginning to reform again, you took note of your wife, who was grabbing a few things from a shelf. You couldn\u2019t quite see what they were, but they almost looked like\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMight as well clean all of these.\u201d Mckayla said aloud, interrupting your thoughts. You realized she was holding a stack of three extra yoga mats, but you didn\u2019t react fast enough. Your wife tossed the yoga mats towards you, clearly intending to stack them on top of the mat you were currently resting on. You screamed, but Mckayla was still blasting music, and she also wasn\u2019t turned to watch the tragedy she was about to commit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe heavy stack of yoga mats landed perfectly on the yoga mat already in place, and you didn\u2019t stand a chance. You were crushed as flat as paper under their weight, your squishy body reduced to nothing in less than a second. Everything became dark, and the pressure was more than enough to keep you in place. You couldn\u2019t move, reform, talk, or escape until the mats on top of you were moved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took Mckayla another thirty minutes to finish cleaning her exercise room, and by the time she finished, she had forgotten that she had even been working with you in the first place. She grabbed the yoga mats and the dirty clothes, carried them downstairs, and tossed them into the washing machine. You hoped she would see you before doing this, but you once more avoided her detection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wash cycle was brutal, and it still caused you endless pain and torment no matter how many times you were forced to endure it. The freezing water chilled you to the core, the constant spinning caused you to pass out after only ten minutes, and other articles of clothing constantly smacked into your body, which now resembled a tiny man logo on the yoga mat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dryer was no more merciful than the washer had been, and in fact, it was even worse. The high temperature partially melted your squishy body, and your liquid state was eagerly absorbed by the fabric of the yoga mat. By the time the dryer had finished, you were had been mostly absorbed into the yoga mat, which meant the only way you were getting free would be by outside help, or an extended period of time without anything crushing you, which seemed unlikely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dryer was opened, and your beautiful wife was there to greet you. She took every item out in turn, eventually coming to you. Her gaze rested on you for a moment, and a confused look appeared on her face. You tried wiggling and squirming, but could do nothing but stay still like a normal logo would. Mckayla rubbed her hand across the mat, yet felt only fabric as you had been absorbed into the mat. Your clothes had also torn off during the wash, making you appear naked, and blend in slightly. All of the signs were against you, but you still had hope.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMckayla eventually opens her mouth to speak, but what does she say?</span></div></div>",

She took a single earbud out but then turned around only to yell, \"Honey! I'm going to be working out so be careful!\" She then placed the Earbud back in and walked over to her mat, looking down once more at the logo, you, giving a soft chuckle before intentionally covering it up with her giant musky foot.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Thomas? My goodness! Is that you? What happened?\" Mckayla exclaimed, running her fingers over your body. She couldn't feel your body at all, you're lucky she saw you because feeling you while using the mat was out of the question at this point. Obviously, the wash and dry cycle had taken its toll on your body and you could do nothing to communicate back to your wife. She stared at you awaiting your response, you could only look back, dumbfounded that your wife would assume you were capable of talking to her in this state. After a minute it seemed to finally click that you couldn't speak and Mckayla began to think about what must have happened. You could see the ditzy gears turning in her head and after another minute she realized what she had done. \"Oh god! I totally forgot we were cleaning the exercise room together earlier! Crap I must have squished you to the mat somehow. I'm sorry sweetie, I really should be more careful\" she finally said. The intent was nice of her but you knew there was no way you could change her nature, or your body's nature for that matter. Her obliviousness and your squishiness were almost always a recipe for disaster, but you couldn't blame her. After all, you've pretty much gotten used to it after nearly 20 years of marriage. Your train of thought was interrupted by a ring on the doorbell. *Ding dong*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMckayla looked down at the mat in her hands and her eyes went wide. \"Thomas, please tell me you can get yourself off of there somehow\" she pleaded. You knew you were squished much too well for that, but you gave an effort anyway. You struggled and wriggled with as much force as you could possibly exert, and finally... nothing. Your body couldn't budge at all. Without Mckayla's help you don't think you would ever be capable of escaping your fused prison. Your beautiful wife stared down at you, praying to see some level of movement or a corner of you body peeling off, but after a few more seconds she didn't see a single thing. Just then the doorbell rang again *ding dong* and you saw obvious worry in her eyes. Mckayla was being awfully quiet, but as your eyes met she spoke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tom, I know this is the last thing you want to hear right now, but I invited three friends over for a little yoga sesh, that's why I was washing all the mats... and that's them at the door right now. We all need a mat each or else the carpet might burn our elbows and knees during certain poses!\" You couldn't believe your wife was more worried about some minor rug burn than your tiny body being completely crushed by her or one of her giantess friends. Sometimes you wish you explained to your wife better that being squished was not a pleasant experience, but you doubt she would remember anyway. Mckayla then continued, \"And I only have 4 mats total so one of us literally has to use you. I wish there was another way babe but I can't think of anything.\" You desperately wanted to be able to shout out \"JUST DON'T USE ME\" but sadly you couldn't. Also once your wife's mind was on one train of thought there wasn't much possibility of her considering other options. Your wife, with her hands tied in her mind and only one option to take, said \"So I'll have to use you... err this mat I guess, I don't know what to refer to you as right now hehe. Uhhh whatever I'll have to use you two for this workout and then I promise right after I'll work on freeing you. Okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had to admit you were a bit weirded out by your wife referring to you and a yoga mat as \"you two\" as if you were equal in her eyes. Her husband of nearly twenty years and a worn out old yoga mat should definitely not be in the same category, but you rationalized that in this state you kind of were. Just then Mckayla flopped the stack of three mats back on top of you, casting you into darkness, and you sighed. This definitely was not going to go well for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom Mckayla's perspective she was upset about being forced to use her husband like this, but in her mind there was no other option. So she tried not to beat herself up too much about the situation and set out to try and enjoy her workout. She strolled to the front door, holding the stack of mats for her and her friends, and opened the door. There stood three of her friends, almost as drop dead gorgeous as herself, clad in tight exercise outfits just the same as Mckayla's. A chorus of \"heeeyyys\" and other greetings rang out as Mckayla greeted her friends. They stood and chatted for a minute, you being crushed further in darkness under the other yoga mats. Eventually the ladies all walked to the recently cleaned exercise room and got ready for their workout. Mckayla handed each one a mat until she was only holding the one you were fused to. She looked directly at you and grimaced, realizing that she had squished you already, and mouthed \"sorry\" to you as she laid you down on the ground. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what routine are we doin today, girl?\" One of Mckayla's friends asked her. Your wife wracked her mind trying to come up with a routine that would squish you as little as possible. She responded, \"I think lots of planks and standing exercises today ladies, lets work our cores!\" You were thankful and proud of your wife for at least picking out a workout that wasn't too hard on you. And before you knew it your wife's enormous body cast an equally large shadow over your diminutive, crushed form. She slammed her forearms down far above you and balanced her weight on her toes on the other side. You were stuck smack dab in the middle of the mat, staring at your wife's exposed stomach between her sports bra and skin tight leggings. Your wife was getting a workout and you weren't getting crushed at all! This was actually the best case scenario for this situation, and you were very thankful for your wife's quick thinking (for once). Above you, your wife was evidently struggling with her workout. You couldn't see much past her sizable bust but if you could you would see her face struggling to keep up with the exercise. While she was in fantastic cardio state, her abs were relatively lagging. You watched your wife's body begin to quiver, as well as commence her trademark profuse sweating. After a few rounds of planks your wife was already soaked through with sweat. Beads of sweat ran down her stomach and dripped off the exposed skin, directly onto your body below. You were thoroughly soaked after only a few minutes and your wife hadn't even touched you yet. At that moment one of her friends shouted out, \"Whew this ab workout is great! Lets move onto another ab exercise, like... sit-ups!\" Both you and your wife simultaneously gulped. This wasn't the plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhh im not so sure we should do that\" your wife responded, half because she knew sit-ups meant demolishing your body under her ass, and half for her own sake. She was exhausted and coated in sweat already. You both prayed that her other friends would agree with your wife and not move onto that workout...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Oh come on Mckayla, I know abs aren't your thing but sit-ups would be the perfect exercise to make them stronger! Let's do it ladies.\" Mckayla groaned, she was already struggling as is. She was soaked with sweat and her abs were exhausted, working out those muscles any more sounded terrible. She was about to flip over and struggle through them, when she remembered you. She moved her body until her eyes met yours, her beautiful face looming over you. Even in her sweaty, tired state she still looked like a goddess to you. She mouthed the words, \"I'm really sorry about this\" and grimaced at you. She then turned her body over and went to sit down. For a brief moment her ass hung above your body, as you prepared yourself for what was to come. Her gigantic, jiggly cheeks loomed over you like two planets stuck in a collision course with your minuscule body. What's more, you saw that her light gray leggings were an entire shade darker than they had been at the beginning of the workout. Her sweat had soaked every square inch of them through, looking like they had just been submerged completely under water. You prayed that Mckayla would think of some excuse to avoid doing this to you but she wasn't that quick at thinking on her feet sadly. In a flash her ass plopped down on you, sealing you in a world of darkness, pressure, and sweat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMckayla felt horrible about exposing your body to her sweaty ass like this, she knew it wasn't going to be pleasant for you, but there was no way she could avoid it. She bit the bullet and dropped her derriere onto the mat, right on top of you. As her enormous buns made contact with the already damp mat, they made a powerful noise, startling her friends. The slapping of her huge cheeks onto the surface produced a loud clap, and the sweat-soaked fabric of her leggings squelched as some of their stored sweat poured out onto the surface, and you, below. Mckayla's face flushed with embarrassment, she didn't realize how big of an impact simply sitting down would have. She winced when she realized all of that had just slammed right on top of you, but even more so she was terribly embarrassed about doing that in front of her friends. Everyone froze for a second, until all 3 other ladies burst out in a round of laughter. In between fits of giggles one of her friends poked fun and said,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn girl you gotta be careful where you park that big thing! That could crush someone if you aren't careful.\" Her friend laughed even more at her own joke, until her other friend added, \"And jeez just how sweaty does your ass get Mckayla? I could literally hear the sweat coming out of there.\" Mckayla was incredibly embarrassed, but after a second she was able to laugh it off along with them. She added herself, \"Yeah trust me this thing can do some serious damage\" and laughed along with her friends. After they were done messing around they began the actual exercise. As Mckayla struggled with sit-up after sit-up the pressure would increase and decrease on top of you throughout the reps. It was complete torture for you, and your wife seemed to be laughing about it with her friends. Her sweaty cheeks had you trapped in utter darkness, but for some reason your sense of smell was still active even in your flattened state. So you were forced to take in the earthy scent emanating from her ass crack as she continued her exercise. You could do nothing more but wait until this was over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter nearly a half an hour more exercise and stretching, all of which seemed to require Mckayla's butt plopped right on top of you, it seemed like the ladies were finally finishing up. Finally, her ass peeled off of you and you were exposed to the light again. You were lying in a pool of sweat but you were grateful for the respite from tons of crushing force on your body. As your eyes adjusted your wife and her friends chatted some more, and one said,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey wait Mckayla, where's your little husband at? I haven't seen him since we got here. We didn't squish him as we walked in or anything right?\" All of the girls began scanning the ground and their feet for you, until one girl's eyes fell on the little man shaped logo on Mckayla's mat. She stared for a second, then her eyes lit up and she exploded into a fit of laughter. \"Hahahaha oh my god Mckayla, is that Tom stuck to your mat right there?!\" she pointed at your form as all ladies turned to look at you. Just as your eyes became accustomed to the light you saw the faces of four beautiful women, your wife included, staring down at your destroyed body. Once again all of the ladies broke out into laughter, your wife joining them so she wouldn't look suspicious. To cover her own ass, something that you were used to doing physically, Mckayla lied and said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh whoops sweetie, I didn't see you down there. You know you gotta be more careful around me when I workout!\" This just made her friends laugh even more until one shouted out, \"All that talk about how your ass could crush someone was more than just a joke, girl! Your little husband was taking the brunt of that booty-beatdown the entire time we were working out. Oh man I'm surprised he's even alive down there.\" The girls seemed to find your predicament absolutely hilarious, and even though you could tell your wife was genuinely worried about you, she had to go along with her friends so they wouldn't make fun of her anymore. Sadly this was an issue with your wife on occasion. You knew she never wanted to squish you but she could be terrible at giving into peer pressure when she was hanging out with some of her friends. You hoped now that her friends would leave so she could drop the act and work on freeing you. With luck, one of them said,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay I think we have to go now. That was a great workout ladies, let's do it again soon. And Mckayla, good luck with your little sticker-husband, see you later!\" Your wife walked her friends to the front door, and the second she closed it behind them sprinted back to make sure you were okay. In her rush, right as she entered the room she caught her toe on some carpet and fell flat on her chest, her massive bust landing square on top of your body and squishing you one last time. Mckayla quickly lifted herself off of you and apologized profusely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh jeez Thomas I'm sorry about everything that just happened. My ass was so sweaty and you had to suffer under it for like 30 minutes. I really appreciate you being a trooper and toughing it out for me though. That was a great workout at the very least. I'm going to free you right now though, I have an idea that might work.\" Mckayla then ran out of the room, you heard the bathroom door open as your wife evidently got something from there, and you saw her running back. She knelt down over your body, and you saw she was holding a tub of heated wax. She said, \"Okay Thomas I usually use this stuff on... more intimate parts, but it's so sticky it might do the trick! Peeling you off of the wax itself might be tricky, that stuff is intense. I once got a little bit on my panties and had to throw them away because the wax was stuck on there so well! But at least you'll be off the mat, and that's better, right?\" Mckayla shrugged, scooped a glob of hot wax out of the tub and spread it over your sticker-form. Your body tingled as you could feel yourself being stuck to the wax itself, and after a minute Mckayla reached down, used a nail to peel a corner of it off, and ripped as quickly as she could! She looked at the wax and saw...</span></div></div>",

Mckayla immediatly began brainstorming how she could remove you from the wax...<br>\r\nShe could microwave the wax! Oh but that would probably be painful.<br>\r\nShe could use a hairdryer to melt you down! But that would take hours and Mckayla knew she didn't have the attention span for that...<br>\r\n\"AHA!\" Mckayla shouted practically blowing your eardrums out. \"I'll make a cozy fire and we can cuddle while I wait for the wax to melt!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had to admire Mckayla for choosing the safest idea she could think of. Or at least so she thought. Your wife cuddles you around her on her lap and turns on the television playing an old silent film from the 40's. Silent movies always put Mckayla to sleep however and soon you were left alone on the lap of your giantess wife. Sitting right next to the fire, you could feel the wax beginning to melt off of your body. However Mckayla also had an impact from the heat, while watching the movie, you feel a massive \"raindrop\" fall from above. Mckayla had begun sweating all over you in her sleep! Some sweat drops were nothing to wake up the deep sleeper Mckayla, and you feel your now sweaty and liquidy body begin to drip onto Mckayla.  By the time Mckayla is awake she had completely forgotten why she was sleeping next to the fire and you were no where to be found. \"Oh well,\" Mckayla thought and thought about what else to do with her day.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Mckayla seemed puzzled by why the fireplace was on in the first place, she wasn't cold at all. In fact, her body was sweating quite a bit due to her naturally sweaty tendencies and the added heat from the fire. She figured that you or maybe one of the kids started it and she must not have remembered. Shrugging it off she thought, \"Oh well, might as well turn it off now\" and she stood up to go put it out. When she stepped one foot onto the ground she noticed something a bit off. Mckayla furrowed her brow a bit in thought and looked down at her feet, only to see a pair of tan socks. \"Huh, I could have sworn I was just wearing a pair of my old white gym socks. In fact, I don't even know where I got these tan ones.\" She added, \"But they sure are comfy though! They feel extra padded and amazing! I wonder what they're made out of?\" but little did she know they were now made of her tiny husband.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn't believe the day you had up to this point. You had just gotten over being a human logo on Mckayla's yoga mat, and now you had become no more than a pair of socks to her. The whole process happened so quickly, and in your recovering state you could do nothing about it. Mckayla slept by the fire in her well-meant but poorly executed attempt at freeing you from the wax, but the fire proved too much for your weakened body and you quickly melted. You couldn't move or make a sound, you could only watch as your body slowly dripped down off of her lap, down her legs and directly into her white gym socks below. Your liquidy body was absorbed into every fiber of the socks, and turning them a shade of light tan. Oddly enough though it seemed that your upper half of your body had been absorbed by the right sock, and the lower half of your body was absorbed by the left. When the whole process was over you ended up in utter darkness, which likely meant whatever was left of your face and eyes were stuck right on the sole of her right sock. This was a truly terrifying situation for you. You had been squished onto Mckayla's socks, underwear, bras, basically anything, countless times, but this was the first time you had been truly absorbed. The fibers of her socks had soaked you up like a paper towel. You truly couldn't tell where the sock ended and you began. Not to mention the layer of sweat already built up in Mckayla's socks as well. You were mentally freaking out when Mckayla took a step. You saw the carpet beneath you move far away, only to come slamming back into your face a second later, crushing you with the monumental weight of your wife. You prayed that she would somehow remember her husband soon, but you weren't so sure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMckayla turned the fire place off and walked out of the living room, smiling and giggling at just how comfy her socks were. She even hopped in a place a few times to test out just how padded they were. \"Jeez these socks are so awesome! I'm gonna wear these like every day!\" Mckayla said far above you. Your stomach dropped and you were quickly losing hope. But just then Mckayla said, \"I wonder if Tom knows where I got these ones, I'll go find him and ask!\" You felt a slight glimmer of hope! Maybe her memory would be jogged when she isn't able to find you! Mckayla began stomping around the house, excitedly looking for her husband. Every step felt like an elephant had landed directly on you, as more and more sweat began to accumulate on her soles. After a number of minutes she gets frustrated and says, \"It seems like I can never find him when I need him! I wonder where he spends so much time at?\" you heard this and mentally facepalmed because you spent a vast majority of your time crushed or being used by your wife, it was just her terrible memory that prevented her from knowing this. Mckayla continues, \"I'll check for a brand name or logo or something\" and stares down at her feet. The tops look like just regular tan tube socks, but then she checks the soles. Checking the left sole first, Mckayla put all of her weight directly on top of you, adding to the crushing force that you were already receiving. But a few seconds later you felt the weight lessen, and quickly your world of darkness was replaced with the face of your gorgeous wife, staring directly at you. But the question is, was your face visible enough on her sole or was it just too blended in?</span></div></div>",

She ran upstairs with little regard to treading lightly as she answered the phone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You want to meet up for drinks? Sure I'll be right out all I need to do is put my shoes on!\" Right as McKayla hung up the phone she felt on edge. \"Aren't I forgetting something...something important\" McKayla thought aloud. Deep in thought trying to remember she began tapping her foot thinking. Over and over your face was slammed into the floor, McKaylas socks still damp from her workout leaving a mist of sweat on the hardwood. \"Whatever it is im sure it's nothing that can't be taken care of once I get home!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMcKayla headed out with you along for the ride, stuffed inside some old shoes without a second thought. She returned somewhat tipsy 3 hours later. It was 9 O'clock at this point and she was toast from a long day. Walking directly upon you  McKayla headed up to the bedroom. What happens to you?</span></div></div>",

Surprisingly you could fall asleep like this having been in situations like this before even with your wife's foot smell taking up all the air around you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou woke up flying through the air you could see your wife running around the room in a sports bra and panties, you couldn't help but admire how beautiful she is as she pulled a fresh tank top over her head. You suddenly remembered the situation you were in and started trying to flail to show her you were in her socks but you had more control than you realized and managed to flip yourself onto your face just as McKayla sat on the bed to pull up her pants. you tried to flip yourself again but your wife's hand grabbed you and foiled that attempt as she brought you to her feet. seeing your wife's feet brought back some memories but thankfully she had just showered and her feet smelled more like strawberries than the putrid smell coming off of her shoes. You tried to wiggle again but you were being pulled up onto her foot facing the floor you could feel you head and chest stretch as she set her foot down to grab your other half. You felt her hands on your lower half and began to 'kick' but McKayla couldn't even see your efforts bellow her breasts as she put on her sock without looking. When McKayla stood up you could feel a much stronger impact than last night but before you could ponder that you saw the worst thing possible, your wife's lucky marathon shoes she only wore them when she's training for a marathon and during the marathon. You moved past the maw of the offensive object until you tasted the sweat that leaked from the insole, you could feel your lower half in the other shoe as she tapped her foot to make sure the shoes were on correctly it felt like a punch to the gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lucky I found these super comfy socks yesterday my lucky socks just sprouted a hole and I was hopping to find some new ones before my next charity marathon\" McKayla chirped to herself as she walked out the door to begin her morning training jog. Every step was a different kind of torture, when she stomped your face a new wash of sweat rushed into you taste buds, but when she stepped on your lower half it was almost twice as painful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMcKayla was in heaven her new socks were so comfortable and they were keeping her feet from feeling so sweaty even if she was starting to sweat hard everywhere else she decided to push herself and extended her run for an extra hour. You however could feel the sweat from her foot soaking into your body after a short while and wished you wife would end her workout and discover you.</span></div></div>",

She saw your house a little ways a way and knew her workout was almost over. She continued, thinking, \"Thank god it's almost over. I can already tell how funky I must be from all this sweat. For some reason though these socks are the absolute bomb! Usually my feet are tied with my booty for the sweatiest parts of my body but right now they feel relatively dry! I've definitely found my new pair of lucky socks for the marathon.\" Mckayla finished her thought as she came right up to the front door. She swung open the door, glistening like an absolute goddess from her run. Normally you would love to see your gorgeous wife right after one of her workouts, but you were tragically unable. She took a few steps inside and saw her daughter sitting on the couch, just watching some tv. Mckayla quickly kicked off her stinky sneakers and plopped her feet, as well as you, up on the coffee table. Vicky immediately plugged her nose when she was hit with the pungent scent of your wife's post-run feet, before she said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eww mom go take a shower, that smells so...\" but before she could finish her sentence she took a quick look at the sole of Mckayla's foot and saw your unmistakeable face looking sadly right at her. You pleaded as much as you could with your eyes, but Vicky only responded with a round of uproarious laughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What were you saying, Vicky? And what's so funny, sweetie?\" your wife said up to your daughter. Mckayla stopped laughing before realizing her opportunity. She responded,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh nothing, mom. This movie just always makes me laugh\" gesturing to the romantic comedy she was watching. \"It's about this ditzy lady who's always searching for love, but can't seem to find it, even though it's been under her toes the whole time!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour wife looked puzzled and responded, \"You mean under her nose, right?\" giggling at her daughter's silly mistake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah, whoops! I don't know what got into me!\" Vicky wasn't the best liar, but your wife's unobservant nature let her get away with it with relative ease. She took another peak at you before giggling again, and your wife said,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, do you know where your father is? I feel like I haven't seen him all day long.\" Mckayla asked Vicky. Your malicious daughter shot you a look as if to say \"watch this\" and said back,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah, he had to go away on an emergency work trip for a while! He didn't even have time to tell anyone besides me. He wanted to say good luck with your next marathon though, and he said he'll be with you even if you don't realize it.\" Mckayla was a little sad that her husband had to leave her so quickly, but simultaneously happy that he cared enough about her to wish her luck on the marathon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww, that's sweet of him. I feel like he's always with me one way or another.\" Mckayla responded to Vicky. She meant that you were always with her in spirit, but quite frankly you almost always were with her one way or another in body as well. \"Alright well I'm going to go hit the shower, I'm sure I'm pretty stinky after that long run.\" Mckayla finished saying as she removed her sweaty feet from the coffee table and slammed them down into the carpet, wriggling her toes happily at the soft surface. She began the short trek to her room and closed the door behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeemingly miles beneath your giantess wife you couldn't believe what had just happened. Vicky was literally the only person aware of your predicament at the moment and she exploited the situation just to make your life hell. You simply couldn't understand how your daughter grew up to be such a mean-spirited person. Now you had no idea when your wife would realize you were underneath her, if she did at all! You could live out the rest of your life as her lucky socks! Your body, soaked thoroughly into each of these white socks, now tank because of your presence, would be nothing more than an article of clothing. You mentally sobbed and prayed to every god you could think of to get you out of this situation. The few more steps into your bedroom answered your prayers with more crushing pressure, and the soaking of more foot sweat being rapidly absorbed by your body. Suddendly, you felt your world shift as Mckayla peeled you off of her feet with a sickening sticky sound. You forgot that your face was still visible, duh! Maybe she would see you right now and remember that her socks were actually her husband! Just then you heard Mckayla say far above you,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Boy these socks are a little bit ripe, but they're easily the best ones I've ever worn! So supportive, yet they keep my feet nice and dry! They're going to serve me even better than my lucky socks did before! I'm gonna put them right here on the ground and leave them exactly there every day, when I'm not wearing them of course. I can't possibly risk washing them or the luck might wash away too!\" Your wife narrated out her entire thought process, almost as an omen to you. You cursed your wife's superstitious nature. Good luck socks aren't even a thing! In the past her good luck socks only served as a stinky obstacle for you to avoid, but now her desire to keep this luck was effectively keeping you prisoner. Chelsea flopped you face down on the ground, not once flipping you over and giving her a chance to see your face. Your world became darkness, and time seemed to drift by.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first night went by very slowly, the mind-numbing boredom of sitting facedown in the carpet for an entire life, being kept company by no more than drying sweat and stench, all kept you up. But eventually you managed to fall asleep, whatever that meant in your current form.The next morning your wife woke you up by grabbing you quickly, and immediately shoving her tremendous foot into each of her halves. You saw her beat-up running shoes approaching you next as you braced for impact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe days began to pass by the same way, the cycle repeating of being worn, soaked, crushed, and placed in the same spot on the floor became your entire reality. You soon lost track of time, but if you had to assume you would say a week of this torture had gone by before something miraculous happened. One night in the middle of the night you were awoken to the sound of your giantess wife rusting around in bed. After a moment you heard her mumble, \"So thirsty\" still half asleep as her gorgeous form stepped out of bed. Unknowingly to you and her, your sock form was in between her and the sink to get water. And by some stroke of luck her gargantuan toe hooked onto the sock your face was on and flipped you upside down! The room was dark but considerably less so than the pitch black carpet you were accustomed to. You were ecstatic as you quickly scanned your surroundings. You caught sight of Mckayla's tremendous booty jiggling and wobbling as she walked naked to the bathroom to get some water. This was a stroke of luck, maybe Mckayla would notice you! Just then you saw Mckayla's nude body walking out of the bathroom, right towards you, rubbing the sleep out of her eyes. Completely oblivious in the dark, her huge foot stepped directly on your face, but this barely even phased you as she treaded on back to bed. In the morning it will be light and she will finally remember me!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning your wife awoke with a yawn, before a huge smile grew on her face and she said, \"Finally, it's marathon day! I've been training for so long!\" She sprung out of bed, slid on a pair of panties and a bra before sauntering over to her favorite lucky socks. Her eyes drifted downward, ready to grab her all-time favorite socks again, but suddenly her eyes met another pair. And a nose, and a mouth. She recoiled for a second while covering her mouth. She couldn't believe it but there was no mistaking it. That was her husbands face on the sole of her sock. After weeks of forgetting her memories of noticing her husband before going out with her friends came flooding back and she looked sickened by what she figured out she had been doing to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh. My. God. Thomas?\" Mckayla paused briefly, \"Have you been my socks this entire time!?!?\" she practically screamed down at you. \"I can't believe this, I'm so stupid and unobservant. How do I always end up doing this to you, babe?! I feel like such an unobservant idiot.\" You, meanwhile, were beyond happy to be recognized, but you felt bad at how hard your wife was taking this. But then, she added, \"Shit. Shit shit shit. Thomas, the marathon is today! I've been squishing you for a week, there's no way you can reform quickly enough to get out of there, right?\" You felt a sense of dread as you followed your wife's train of logic. She stood above you, considering her options. Her toes began to drum across your face as she got lost in her train of thought. \"Oh shoot, sorry again Tom, I didn't know you were right there\" realizing she was pounding you with her simple toe-tapping. Finally Mckayla spoke up and said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tom, I hate to tell you this, honey. But I kinda don't have any other options. I have to wear you one more time for this marathon.\" You were absolutely dumbfounded and livid at the same time. \"I don't have any socks that are nearly as comfortable or sweat absorbent as you! You're literally, like the perfect socks. And if I go back to regular socks after training in the perfect ones, there's no way I'll perform as well. And I know you've always supported my marathon running...well now you're physically going to be supporting me too,\" she added with a giggle, \"so I promise I'll just use you one last time before working on freeing you. Okay?\" Mckayla waited for no response as her feet slid you on one last time\" Her shoes followed after, and quickly the pounding of her walking began again....</span></div></div>",

A short conversation later and your wife was back to pumped up for her marathon and she took her starting position stamping your face into the ground. You were in a world of hurt, McKayla had chosen to use you for her marathon and you were already battered from just the week of training but you had hope McKayla had noticed you and promised to get you out so if this was going to be your last stint as socks you could resolve to support your wife every way that you could right now. You could feel the sweat soak you as time went on and McKayla jogged at a steady pace as the familiar taste settled into you and the pressure of the feet above continued to mount.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMcKayla had started the race strong but she was feeling it now at the quarter way mark she was still ahead of most and the leaders weren't out of sight she was starting to slow down, not that her position mattered much but she felt like getting closer to first gave the people who donated for her a sense of satisfaction. You can't tell how long it's been but you can feel the titanic feet taking slightly slower steps, you figured if she finished faster you could get free faster so you started moving doing anything you could to make McKayla notice you were supporting her. Suddenly McKayla's running rate rocketed back up and you were disoriented from the sudden speed boost and frequency of feet slamming into you but you figured if you keep at it you wife will be inspired to free you faster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMckayla was now gaining and they were past the half way point, as she drank her water she noticed how not only had her socks been able to absorb all the sweat from the marathon but it almost felt like they were giving her a little massage and her legs didn't feel like she'd been on a run half of the size of how far she'd come. You on the other hand were practically exhausted but you had resolved to continue as long as your wife even if the shoe you were in was burning your taste buds and nostrils now and your body was punished repeatedly by your titanic wife's feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe finish line was approaching and you had inadvertently started meditating to the footsteps that were your world, the movement you were doing as well as McKayla's running had steadily increased but you had blocked out all the pain you had been feeling as long as the rhythm was steady. McKayla could see the goal and no one had crossed yet she was out in front and was going to win a marathon for the first time but just as she thought that, her friend from before passed her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"not fast enough Kaykay.\" she shouted, Mckayla refused to give up at this point so she went into a final sprint. Your 'Zen' was immediately broken and your body couldn't help but spasm as the full wight of hours of running fell back onto you as well as the frantic foot falls that pushed into you poor body now. McKayla crossed the finish line just seconds before her friend. Completely overjoyed she ran and hugged her friend, her children and you wished you could have been a part of that but right now you just wanted out from under her but her next words filled your completely exhausted mind with dread.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lets all go get ice cream and celebrate my victory!\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After being stomped beneath the feet of your unaware wife while she enjoyed her ice cream, McKayla arrived home and finally began removing her tennis shoes in your room. \"Ahhh, the worlds luckiest and...stinkiest pair of socks around\" your wife said as she caught the smell of your sock body. Weeks of being sweated into by your gorgeous wife had taken their toll on your body's typically great natural smell. \"Well, I guess I don't need your great luck for a while, my amazing lucky socks. Time for you to enter the hall of fame!\" Your wife laughed to herself as she peeled you off and discarded you into the laundry hamper face up. Pleading with your eyes for your wife to notice you did no good however as she stripped out of soaked spandex and underwear and unceremoniously dropped them right onto your face. Humming away, you heard your wife run a shower and leave the room. <br>\r\nFor a week you were left buried at the bottom of the hamper, days after days of underwear and even other socks were dropped on top of you before the fated day came...laundry day. Your giant wife grabbed up the hamper and began the trek to the basement to wash her clothes. Swaying side to side with her movements, she reached the laundry room and plopped the hamper down. Feeling your world slam into the ground you feared what could happen next. Reaching through the hamper article by article, your wife finally reached you. \"That's where I put you my lucky socks! It's finally time for your bath before we can get back to work! I know you miss me but I'll see you on the other side!\" Your wife giggled as she dropped you into the washing machine. Burning hot water scalded your eyes and you began to taste the soap. At least you finally got to smell something other than your wife's dirty panties and sweaty feet. A few hours later it was time to be moved to the dryer and your wife plopped the whole load in and ran it. The heat of the dryer felt intense on your body, and you feared what could be happening to a squishy person such as yourself. You felt your body melting almost before coming together with your other half. You were whole again! In your squishy heated state however you were essentially just a ball being spun through the dryer. </span></div></div>",

Tom, what are you doing in the dryer?!\" Your wife'a giant hand reached into the dryer and roughly grabbed your body before lifting it out. You were in shock that your wife not only noticed you among all her clothes, but recognized that your ball like form was you in the first place! McKayla held you up facing her, and what you could currently call your face stares back. She looked as gorgeous as ever, albeit a bit perplexed at your situation. But it just felt good to see your wife's face without a layer of sweaty sock fibers or a yoga mat obscuring your vision. McKayla waited a moment for you to respond, before slapping her head and remembering that you couldn't talk at the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh duh, you can't tell me anything right now.\" McKayla said while stifling a giggle. \"Okay I'm just gonna go put you down so you can relax and focus on going back to being my cute husband and not this weird fleshy ball.\" McKayla carried you to your bedroom, placing you down on some drawers facing the center of the room. Again you were impressed, McKayla put you somewhere relatively safe instead of on the bed, chair, ground, or any of the places that her body parts just loved to slam into. She kissed your form and walked out of the room, returning moments later with a basket of laundry to fold. She dumped it all out on the bed and began to fold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Tom I hope ya don't mind i take care of some chores while you reform. I don't want this stuff to get wrinkled.\" McKayla quickly got to work, expertly folding both her clothes and some of yours that were mixed into her hamper. You saw your tiny (compared to her) blue shirt pass through her hands, recalling the time that McKayla accidentally thought it was a handkerchief. You walked in on her blowing her nose with it and immediately threw it in the hamper when she set it down. Next came your white long sleeve shirt, looking surprisingly spotless! This caught you especially off guard because you remember the day that McKayla soiled that one too. You were bathing in the sink with your shirt laid out on the countertop nearby. Out of nowhere McKayla barged through the door and slammed her ass down on the toilet, paying no attention to you. Soon enough her terrible deed was done, and you heard her exclaim, \"Shit no toilet paper?\" before frantically scanning the bathroom. Sure enough her eyes stopped on your fresh white shirt... One gross act and an awkward conversation later that shirt was wadded up in the hamper as well. Remembering these moments made you shudder, but at the very least you weren't wearing those shirts while they transpired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMcKayla moved onto her own clothes quickly, each of those stirring up their own harsh memories for you. You figured by this point in your marriage you had been swished by or stuck to practically every item in your giantess wife's wardrobe. You heard McKayla mutter something about not seeing her new favorite tan socks, but brushed that off because things were looking up. Some time passed and you felt your body pop back into its normal human shape! All of your body parts aligned, your mouth last of all. As soon as you were capable you stood up on the dresser and shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"McKayla! I'm me again!\" McKayla just finished folding the last pair of socks and immediately turned around. She flashed you her patented radiant smile and ran over, scooping you up and hugging you against her massive breasts. After a few affectionate kisses she finally pulled you off her body and asked you,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So why WERE you in the dryer with my clothes?!\" McKayla asked, evidently oblivious of the entirety of the torture she had inadvertently put you through. You thought for a moment, took in the deepest breath you could, and said in one breath,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You squished me onto your yoga mat then used me then peeled me off the mat using wax but then I melted and seeped down into your gym socks and you discovered me then forgot about me then trained for your marathon using me then finally ran your marathon on top of me before putting me in the wash where my body melted off the socks and reformed back together.\" You finished gulping for air. You wanted to get the explanation done quickly partly because it was funny but also partly because you were sure McKayla would soon forget it. Her ditzy brain took a moment to process all the info before she finally responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my GOD. I did what?! For how long?! And those super comfy socks were actually... you?! You quickly responded to stop this line of pointless questioning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes that all happened McKayla, but ya know what? Forget about it. I'm back and whole now, I know it was all an accident. Just try to keep better track of me babe. OH and never believe anything Vicky tells you about me... ever.\" McKayla simply smiled and nodded back, enveloping your face in another passionate kiss. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I'm glad your back as yourself again!

Come on, Ryan set up one of his videogames for all 4 of us to play in the living room.\" Mckayla tossed you some of your freshly washed clothes and you quickly pulled them on your naked form. You hopped down from the dresser and pursued your wife who was already walking down the hallway. You intentionally stayed a few steps behind to watch her butt cheeks as they jiggled with every step. Mckayla caught notice of your staring and gave her rump a light slap to taunt you before blowing you a kiss. But soon enough the flirtatious fun was over and you had gotten to the living room. You scanned the room and noticed that Ryan had actually plugged in your old Super Nintendo! You looked further and saw the words \"Mario Kart\" flashing on the screen. For a moment you rejoiced in the opportunity to play one of your favorite games from the past, but then you looked at the seating arrangement. Ryan was sitting cross legged on the floor in front of the couch, and Mckayla plopped her sizable rear on the couch cushions behind him. To his left lay what you assumed to be your controller, but behind it sat Vicky, grinning ear to ear and eyeing you mischievously. You mentally gulped and paused before walking over. Your controller laid practically between Vicky's large feet, her gym-sock-clad toes drumming the ground ominously. After a second of thinking, you mustered up the courage to say,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey uhh guys, why don't we all just sit on the couch together instead of me and Ryan on the ground?\" You hoped that someone would agree with you, but your hopes were dashed as your wife responded,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not sure if that'll work, Tom. The couch would be a little cramped with all four of us on it at once, and you and I already have difficulties sharing it when it's just us two\" Mckayla added with a wink. \"And, no offense to either of you, but you two are the shortest in the house so it just makes sense for you to sit in front of us. If Vicky and I sat on the ground who knows if you could even see past us!\" Mckayla's logic was, for once, sound. You couldn't do anything else to argue with her as both of your children nodded in agreement. You begrudgingly walked to your spot on the floor and sat down, grabbing the controller. Vicky's feet boxed you in on either side, preventing you from seeing much other than the screen in front of you. Even worse, you smelled a slight stink already emanating from your daughter's giant socks, crinkling up your nose in response. Almost like she was reading your mind, Vicky said,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry dad, I hope my feet don't smell too bad for ya, I would hate for them to distract you from the game\" she said while laughing. To the rest of your family the laugh seemed cute but you knew it foretold something more ominous. Before you could retort, Ryan quickly zoomed through the menus and started the game. You had to pick your character and before you knew it the race had started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost immediately, as you expected, Ryan shot ahead of the rest of you guys by miles. As usual, it became a race to see who would get 2nd, 3rd, and 4th place. Mckayla, in her endearing ditziness, ended up completely turned around and driving the wrong way. She simply laughed it off and kept playing, happy to see the rest of her family having fun. But that left you and Vicky, neck and neck racing for that second place spot. The competition was so fierce you almost forgot about the stinky socks surrounding your body. That was, until you pulled ahead of her. You threw a red shell, hit Vicky's cart and zoomed past her, cheering at your good fortune. Almost immediately though you saw two huge objects moving out of the corner of your eyes. In an instant, Vicky's feet slammed together over your body, crushing you and preventing you from driving. Vicky had done this act so slyly that nobody in the family had noticed. Even if they had looked, it simply looked like Vicky was using one foot to scratch the other, you were utterly hidden from sight. You sighed, assuming that this would spell your loss, but surprisingly Vicky separated her feet! Your crumpled form fell to the ground, where you laid before reforming quickly. You looked up at Vicky, puzzled, and she simply stuck her tongue out at you while smirking. You didn't understand what inspired your usually deceitful daughter to show you some mercy, but you were thankful for it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou quickly picked up the controller, and what came next could only be described as a miracle. You zoomed around every corner, got all the best pickups, and raced all the way back up to tied with Vicky! You heard her huff loudly when she noticed your comeback. She was a bit ahead of you now and the race was nearing its end, Ryan having finished already was playing yet another game on his phone while waiting for the rest of you guys. Little did Vicky know, you had an ace up your sleeve... You pressed a button and zapped her cart with lightning, leaving her spinning out as you raced past her. The finish line was just a little ahead, you were going to beat her! But then all of the sudden...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm, I feel like I can't see the tv too well, I gotta move closer\" Vicky said ominously above you. Immediately you jerked your head up to see her huge, pajama-clad ass looming over you like an eclipse. Instantaneously Vicky fell all the way to the carpet, her cheeks completely obliterating you beneath them. It was only a small scoot for Vicky to fall off the couch, but it utterly destroyed your squishy body. Vicky shifted her rump around on the ground, enjoying the feeling of you smushed beneath her, and grinned. Your character had obviously stopped moving and Vicky raced past you, reaching the finish line and getting second place. She bounced happily, doing a little victory dance on top of you, still nobody else in the family being aware of your plight. In fact, almost a full minute later Mckayla drove slowly through the finish line, taking the 3rd place spot. You heard her say, albeit muffled beneath your daughter's ass,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow I got 3rd?! I always get last! Looks like you have to step up your game Tom!\" The rest of your family laughed along with her as she continued, \"Let's play something else now! What about, Twister!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVicky smiled at the idea, hoping that she could get away with the evil act she had just pulled off. Then, Mckayla spoke up again,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"....\"</span></div></div>",

You just finished reforming when it was your turn, Mckayla and Vicky having already gotten right hand dots on opposite sides of the board. \" Okay dad left hand Blue.\" you reluctantly stepped on the mat and placed your hand on the nearest blue dot right in the center of the mat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom left foot Yellow\"  Mckayla moved her body facing away from you and placed her foot on the dot. \"Vicky Right foot Green\" your daughter slammed her foot down just inches away from you on the green dot in in front of you. the game continued on like this for about three turns before Mckayla's ass was now hovering over you, just waiting to fall and Vicky was under her stomach reaching for the other dot, you on the other hand were almost flat on the board so that you could reach and you hand unwisely chosen to do so facing up so you could watch for danger. It was at this point you noticed Ryan had lost all interest in watching the game and was playing on his phone while he spun the thing. \"Okay mom, Right foot Blue\" Mckayla's foot reached back to find a spot, bumping into Vicky's leg causing her to loose balance and fall in your direction, dragging her mother along for the ride.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were completely squished underneath the weight of two women mashing you flat instantly but you knew you were against something soft as the two girls giggled at their falling and untangled themselves you found you were stuck to..</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Ha! You fell first, Vicky! It looks like I win this round!\" Mckayla shouted as she lifted herself up off the mat. Both Mckayla and your daughter were laughing wildly at their fun game as they untangled their bodies from one another. You, on the other hand, weren't having quite as good of a time to say the least. Your entire world was darkness as your face was planted firmly in your giantess wife's crack. Your body stuck out utterly squashed facing sideways across Mckayla's right ass cheek, your feet reaching the outer half of the massive globe. It truly was a testament to Mckayla's most blessed asset that your entire body could be squished head to toe like a sticker on only one of her cheeks. However, this unfortunate angle of crushing meant that neck and head were compressed deep onto the inside of her cheek. So when Mckayla stood up, her ass jiggling tremendously from her laughter, her left cheek slammed back together with its partner and crushed your head even further. From an outside perspective only your shoulders to your feet were visible on her ass, your head utterly swallowed by the cleft of her ass. You groaned mentally, it hadn't been more than a few minutes since you were plastered to Vicky's butt and now it was your wife's turn. You began to wonder why you agreed to join in on family game night at all...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What!?\" Vicky said back to Mckayla, dusting herself from the fall, \"It was your clumsy stomp that caused me to fall in the first place! I mean jeez mom I figured you would be a little more careful with your steps after being married to dad\" she added, lightheartedly joking at her mother's clumsiness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope, all that matters is that you fell first! Any complaints you have you can tell to this!\" Mckayla quickly responded to Vicky's retort and spun around, pointing to her gigantic backside. From the muffled bits and pieces of the conversation you could hear from your wife's vice-like ass crack you could tell her competitive side was showing in even this friendly family game. You mentally chuckled briefly at this aspect of your wife's personality, but your thoughts were broken up by Mckayla's huge booty beginning to grind your head even worse. You couldn't tell what was happening but far above you Mckayla had begun a little victory dance, bragging in your daughter's face. Vicky, annoyed that Mckayla always had to win any physical competition, glanced down briefly at her butt. There she saw, clear as day your minuscule form flattened horizontal on her massive ass cheek like a streak of blue and tan color across Mckayla's black leggings. Vicky burst into laughter immediately and Mckayla turned around, a bit confused at how well Vicky was handling her loss. Vicky finally stopped giggling long enough to say,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, Alright. You may have won this round but it's safe to say that Dad DEFINITELY lost\" before pointing a finger towards your wife's rear. Mckayla, puzzled, looked back over her shoulder. Often times the sheer size of her butt prevented Mckayla from being able to see you but the angle of your squishing this time left you comically crushed across her whole cheek. Mckayla was stunned for a second, before, much to your horror, bursting out into laughter as well! She clutched her stomach and roared with more laughter, her booty jiggling dramatically along with her. After a good while she managed to stop laughing as well, long enough to say,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh I'm sorry sweetie but this just looks too funny. You literally look just like a design on my pants\" she said as she broke into another fit of laughter, \"I guess in hindsight Twister wasn't the smartest game for you to try to beat me in... but I don't think I have to tell you anything about hindsight, do I? You've got the best HINDsight in the house!\" Mckayla burst into laughter at her own joke, pointing at your head lodged deep in her crack. Vicky joined your wife in her fit of laughter as they both seemed to be loving this moment. You were completely shocked at your wife's disregard for your well-being at this moment, but quickly you thought back to your wife's competitive nature. Her need to always win physical contests lead to the few times she has intentionally squished you over the course of your marriage. You would have gulped in fear if you were capable, because you had no way to tell how Mckayla would act when she got like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Vicky is right though hun, if you're underneath my booty then you had to have hit the ground before I did, so you did lose! And there HAS to be some kind of punishment for losing, so...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You hold your breath as you hear a set of footsteps getting closer and closer to you. A few cabinets open and close to your left, as well as a few drawers. Meanwhile, you're sitting in darkness underneath a layer of clothes that you tossed upon yourself. Unfortunately, this must have been another load of dirty laundry as the smell of dried sweat still lingered on the sports bras and panties that surrounded you. You regretted choosing this hiding place but it was too late to change now. After a few moments you heard a couple more footfalls closer to you and soon enough the clothes above you were lifted one by one. After a particularly stinky pair of booty shorts were lifted off of you light flooded back into your vision and far above you stood the grinning face of your beautiful wife. You gulped as her hand reached in to grab you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woohoo, looks like I win AGAIN!\" Mckayla shouts out and quickly Vicky comes running. She reaches the doorway and you see a dejected look on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww man, I really wanted to find him. Well, I guess you did win fair and square, mom. What are you gonna do to him?\" Vicky asked inquisitively. If she could not stick you somewhere for a week like she planned then she could at least take some solace knowing what other punishment you were in store for. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, I'm not sure yet sweetie, but don't worry it will be fitting for my cute little loser here.\" Mckayla pinched your cheek as she said this. You were feeling a mixture of fear at what was to come but also anger at just how relentless your wife could get when she was in one of her competitive modes. You didn't have an opportunity to voice your opinion as Mckayla quickly crushed your body in her hands, giggling. She said something to your daughter but your crushed state prevented you from hearing it. Soon you felt yourself swaying in your wife's hands as she must have started heading back towards the bedroom. You two arrive in the bedroom and you feel yourself carelessly tossed on the bed. In a moment you reform just enough to see your wife towering over you, still grinning with satisfaction. You try to speak up and break her out of this aggressive mood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright sweetie, you definitely are the victor here, I'll admit that. No need for any punishment to teach me that lesson.\" Mckayla simply nods her head,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope! You aren't gettin off that easily! I won and you lost, there has to be some consequence!\" Mckayla sounded strangely excited to be administering this punishment to you, almost like it was all a game to her still. She then quickly grabs you again and says, \"I can think of something that I've been craving for a long time and I know it's not your favorite thing to do... but you don't really have a choice right now babe.\" Mckayla flattened your arms and legs down against the bed, leaving you face up looking towards the ceiling and herself towering above you. At that moment you see Mckayla begin to strip away each article of her clothing. Despite this threatening situation you were awestruck as usual at Mckayla's goddess-like figure, a fact which she quickly catches notice of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, maybe you won't mind this as much as I thought, Tom.\" You still didn't know what she was referring to, until Mckayla turned around. Seeing her tremendous ass hang over you like an avalanche waiting to fall finally made something click. *Oh please no* you thought to yourself. Mckayla was going to force you to do something that you had only tried once before, and it did not go well. You were going to have to eat her ass. Mckayla looked over her shoulder at you, barely being able to see past her bodacious rump. She grabbed a massive cheek in each hand and pulled them apart, revealing the chasm of an ass crack that had swallowed you up countless times before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think you know what to do by now.\" Mckayla said with a wink towards you before dropping her entire weight onto your body. Each one of her butt cheeks squashed your already-flattened arms and legs underneath her, while your body lined her butt crack. With the sliver of light that remained you saw Mckayla's terrifying, yet admittedly well-cleaned asshole right in front of your face. You recoiled in fear slightly, but there was nowhere to run. You had to face your fate and hope Mckayla would snap out of this mood and realize the torture she was putting you through. You timidly stuck your tongue out and made contact. You felt Mckayla's body shudder all over you as this evidently felt great for her. But thanks to your wife's naturally sweaty tendencies, especially around her booty, this wasn't quite as great for you. You licked more, not really sure of what you were doing but apparently it was working. Mckayla was in heaven far above you, writhing with pleasure as she enjoyed the sensation without any care for her well being. She snuck a hand underneath her ass and slammed it against the back of your head, squashing it slightly into her as she felt another jolt of sensation. You feared for the extent Mckayla would take this to, as it seemed to just be getting worse and worse...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Mckayla was positively elated at her performance during that marathon. She never once thought she would be capable of actually winning a marathon, but somehow she did! She mentally pat herself on the back for a few moments before thinking, \"Something about these socks is magic though. It almost felt like they started helping push every one of my steps to be faster and faster. I don't know what brand they are but these are the best lucky socks of all time!\" Mckayla's inner monologue was broken up as your family, her best friend, and herself arrived at the local ice cream shop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't believe you pulled ahead of me at the last second!\" Mckayla's friend said to her, opening the door to the store. Mckayla responded, \"I honestly can't believe it either! You're normally way faster than me! I think it had something to do with these awesome socks I'm wearing. I've never felt so supported in a run before!\" Mckayla's friend shot her a confused look. She didn't understand how a simple pair of socks could have made that big of a difference in her running ability. She then spoke up, \"Special socks? Let me see I want to check what kind they are!\" Mckayla nodded, \"Sure I actually want to find out myself. Vicky, Ryan, here's $20 go get in line and grab all of us some ice cream\" she concluded. Your children walked towards the register as Mckayla and her friend walked towards a nearby table. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the dank sauna of Mckayla's shoe you were having a much less pleasant experience. Despite the stinky and crushing circumstances, you had willed your sock-body into providing enough movement to actually help your wife win the marathon! You were a bit surprised at how much of an impact you had, and felt a twinge of pride. The brief good feeling you had after this thought was immediately stamped out, literally, as Mckayla slammed her foot down, simply taking another step. Even after suffering through a marathon just walking still felt like being steamrolled repeatedly. After a few minutes of walking you began to hear a conversation between Mckayla and what you assumed to be her friend. From your muffled prison you made out enough of the words to figure out she wanted to check on you! It stung a bit hearing each woman refer to you as only socks, but you let it slide because neither was aware of your presence at the time. Just then, you felt the pressure on you lighten significantly! Mckayla must have sat down! On cue, the darkness of you prison was lifted and Mckayla took off her shoe!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See, check 'em out!\" Mckayla said, aiming the sole of her foot directly at her friend. Her friend immediately plugged her nose, assaulted by tremendous stench emanating from Mckayla's damp foot. After recoiling from the scent though, her gaze shifted to the massive sole in front of her, and right there, clear as day was your face looking right back at her. Her friend's eyes widened immediately. She had been wondering where you had been this entire time, and at this moment she had just found out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhhh, Mckayla? Where exactly is Thomas right now?\" she asked, full well knowing the answer. Mckayla took a few seconds to think, scouring her thoughts until it finally hit her. \"Holy. Shit\" she said grimly as she turned her leg and faced her sole towards her face. Just the same as her friend saw you moments ago, Mckayla's beautiful eyes locked with yours. \"THOMAS I'M SO SORRY\" she exclaimed while running a hand over you. She couldn't believe that she had forgotten about her husband yet again. She began to mentally chastise herself, but her friend interrupted her thought by saying,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell, Mckayla.... your husband was willing to become a pair of socks for you just to help you win this marathon?! That's awesome! Especially considering the stink that those dogs can whip up. I wish I had a husband who would do that for me.\" Mckayla smiled a bit at her friend's statement. She began to shift the focus off of beating herself up and more towards how wonderful of a husband you really were. No matter how many times she crushed you, forgot about you, or turned you into some object accidentally never blamed her and always took it like a champ. This time she set out to make sure she wouldn't forget about you again, so she turned and asked her friend,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks! He really is the most supportive guy ever. Right now quite literally!\" she joked as both of them laughed. \"But to be honest I have a problem with forgetting about my little guy sometimes. Is there any way...</span></div></div>",

Nadia is very tan with a athletic build and she showed it off in her running gear and unlike your wife Nadia was in workout mode year round, and not a light one according to Mckayla. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNadia set you down on her coffee table and started talking \"Alright tom, I guess take your time to reform I'm gonna relax a bit, I still can't believe you pulled this, I can't imagine you were having fun being stomped for that whole marathon.\" oh that's right she still thinks you agreed to be Mckayla's socks for the marathon and Mckayla hadn't corrected her. \" Makes me wonder what you feel like.\" she said wistfully and you forced your tired body to shake in protest, it didn't go well. \"Tom, what are you trying to tell me? Did- do you want me to try you on, Tom?\" you weren't in the best state of mind and you wanted to protest so instead of staying still you wiggled your 'lower' half. Nadia pulled herself back trying to think, obviously you were trying to communicate but Nadia was a bit smarter than most when it came to this sort of thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay Tom, I think I might be projecting onto your wiggling around so lets make this easy if you understand me shake your whole body.\" you force your body to move a bit through the herculean effort to communicate. \"alright Left will be no and right will be yes.\" you wanted to protest as you couldn't see what side of you she was on or which side your other half was to you but she continued before you could muster the effort. \" I want to see what you feel like on my feet, are you okay with that yes or no\" you didn't move for a moment as your best guess was spotty as to which part was which and you hopped that not moving would count as no but no such luck. \"Tom if you don't answer I'll just assume that it's yes cause I know you can answer me.\" You mustered the effort and wiggled your top half hoping that it was the part of you that would be no, unfortunately things were not going your way as they often didn't. \" I- I'm not sure what to say, I didn't think you'd be willing and all considering well, thanks.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNadia peeled off the sock she had worn during the marathon, you could hear the wet peeling sound and the stink that fallowed as she set the sock on the table next to you. You mentally whimpered as you felt Nadia grab your lower half and place her foot at the entrance, the slickness of the sweat covering it getting absorbed as it slid into place, your upper half wasn't much different as you saw the tan foot coming to you the difference is that this half had all of your taste with it. The concentrated sweat of running a marathon made her sweat particularly sour and she scrunched her toes within you and made a soft moan. \" Ah! nothing like fresh socks after running for so long, and dang Tom you make some great socks like the best, so breathable and comforting.\" Nadia exclaimed \" It almost feels like the soreness from the marathon is slipping away.\" Nadia played with you for a bit more giving herself a massage through you before making some dinner for herself, with you still on of coarse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she went to shower she peeled you off and set you aside in her room on a little pillow, not even acknowledging you after she walked back in the room she collapsed on her bed naked. your on the pillow all night wondering whats going to happen.</span></div></div>",

Especially since you don't exactly have eyes that can close right now. She wrinkled her nose at your aroma, then her eyes went  wide in shock. She picks you up, turning you from hand to hand and asks \"Tom, is that still you?\" You shake your whole body the same as you did last night in response. You were getting a little dizzy from her turning you over and over in her hands to investigate you. \"Wow. McKayla had told me you could stay squished into things for a while, but she never said it could last through a whole night with nothing keeping you from reforming. Let alone all night plus however long you'd been stuck before the run. I should ask her what to do, maybe you need help...\" she says, utterly astonished. You strongly shake yourself in response while tumbling between her hands, wanting her to get your wife's help immediately. You'd been crushed far longer than a few hours before, but McKayla probably forgot all about it like she does everything else. Either way, she was your best hope of escape from the socks since you'd been unable to reform even a tiny amount on your own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNadia dropped you on the bed then scrambled around looking for her phone. You started planning how you'd thank your wife once you were yourself again, but Nadia froze before slowly turning to look at you again. Hesitantly, she picks you up and asks, \"Wait, what if... Tom? Are you still socks because... you LIKE being socks?\" You frantically try to shake your head negative, but there's not really a way for her to tell if the shake was for yes or no. And unfortunately for you, confirmation bias was slowly settling in her mind. \"I mean, you've been stuck waaay longer than she ever mentioned. She said you always reformed yourself as soon as possible with her. Even after things like this where you agreed to be squished. But now you've been had all night on my pillow to...\" her eyes went wide in surprise at what she was thinking. 'Tom, is it just that you don't want to be HER socks? Yeah, she always tries to protect you, but she's almost always the one that ends up flattening you. I mean, how many times have you been rescued by ME because she had forgotten you ...\" You shake, in agreement this time having missed the words she emphasized, as she keeps mindlessly turning you and passing your halves between her hands. You couldn't really deny it after all. Your wife was a forgetful klutz, but you loved her anyways. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou find yourself looking at her her face, now filled with a somehow intimidatingly hopeful expression. \"You know I've never liked your, well, condition. Worrying about a squishy guy is just not my thing, and the few times I've crushed you, you always reform quickly. Especially when I complain you might ruin my socks when I step on you. And everyone knows how much I love my socks. This time though...\" an excited smile starts to form on her face \"This time, you're not a squishy guy flattened on my sock. You ARE socks. And you stayed as them with me, even after almost a full day... Tom?...\" Your heart sinks as she asks you, \"Does this mean you DON'T want to go back to McKayla? Do you want to stay as MY socks?\" You shake as hard as you can at the prospect. Her feet were probably worse than McKayla's! She rolled her eyes and giggled though, \"I don't mean forever, obviously. You can change back anytime you want to, just like usual. But until then you'd be my favorite pair of lucky socks. I'd wear you all the time, and promise I wouldn't wash you until absolutely necessary\" She laughs again as you keep shaking, \"Afterall, I wouldn't want to wash out all that luck you've already got in you. I wouldn't want to hurt Kay, but there's no way she hasn't forgot about you. You'd be able to stay with my feet as long as you wanted.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took half of you in each hand and looked hopefully between each. \"Okay Tom, same as last night. Shake left or right. Left means I've got this all wrong. I'll leave you on the pillow while I go to work so you can reform, and then I 'lltake you back home. But right,\" she bites her lip in excitement, \"shake right and I'll know you want THIS to be your home. I promise I'd wear you all the time, only taking you off if I absolutely have to. If McKayla asks, I'll just say you must have reformed while I was asleep and left. I even have an identical, squashed face free pair of socks I can show her if I need to.\" The room was still spinning from the way she'd been handling you since waking up, and it was impossible to focus on anything. Her expression though went serious as she said, \"But Tom, if you shake right, I mean it. I won't think of you as Tom anymore. Your new name will just be Lucky. Lucky the lucky socks. I still can't believe you might want this, but I'll give you the full experience if you do. Maybe this full body shaking Is just you begging to rub my tootsies. Well if you choose me, I'll be sure you to put you on right away anytime you shake. You deserve it for being such lucky socks. So which is it Tom, left to be human, or right to be socks?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou try to focus through the vertigo she unwittingly gave you, but you're still wishing you had a stomach so you could just throw up. For reasons besides sweaty feet this time. \"Come on Tom, or Lucky. I told you last night, if you don't respond, I'll assume you want it.\" You know from her voice she means it, so you roll the dice and guess...</span></div></div>",

You tried to tell her vigorously shaking the other half of you body while Nadia sat on her bed. \"calm down Lucky, I'm putting you on now just like I promised. Save some of that energy for pampering my feet will ya.\" You whimpered, knowing that Nadia was completely convinced by her own wacky idea that you wanted to be her socks bringing you down to her feet. They weren't so bad right then she had just gotten ready for bed after all but the feeling of her foot filling both halves of your body had a sort of finality to it this time as she admired how you felt rubbing her feet together and purring. She was obviously thinking about something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohh, I know I was gonna go to bed but I was turning in early\" that sounded bad \"You know lucky, I do have a 'breaking in' workout I usually put my lucky socks through. You know make sure they can handle me...\" You panicked unintentionally wiggling your body, giving a light massage to her feet. \"Oh, so you do like it when you're in use, I was worried that you might just want to be more lounge socks. Let's get started right away!\" You felt her, standing up putting her weight on you once again. She walked over to her old sneakers and sliding you into them, unlike her feet the shoes were ripe with her stink. After your reprieve from feet the taste was fresh to your tongue and the warm shoe was already warming up the feet that dominated your world. She was moving jogging in place. \"sorry we aren't gonna be able to do the whole thing but a late night run aughta be enough to hold you over until tomorrow when I can REALLY break you in lucky.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as she was moving again your body practically pampered her feet, every drop of sweat absorbed into you and every foot fall hammered your new position home. this marathon nut friend of your wife was going to treat you as her lucky workout socks for who knows how long. by the time her run was over you were feeling like she had trampled more than just your body with her casual jog.</span></div></div>",

Slamming her running shoes on top of you her friend quickly pointed out, \"Um, McKayla you're crushing him again...\" to which she quickly bent over and began apologizing profusely again. You were just grateful to be off the floor, who knows what could'be happened if McKayla had forgotten you in an ice cream shop appearing as nothing more than a discarded pair of socks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I need to keep you on me at all times, babe! No more getting left around for me to crush you!\" You beamed so happy McKayla was being so considerate. All you wanted to do was wiggle a bit to tell her you love her but after being her yoga mat and her socks for weeks you couldn't move a muscle. \"The perfect place to put you will be right in my pocket! I could never forget something in my pocket!\" McKayla begins to try and slide you into her pocket but is met with resistance by her phone. \"Oh no babe I always keep my phone in my front right pocket, you know how I am with habits! I'm just gonna slide you into my back pocket, okay?\" Without waiting for any kind of sign, not that you'd succeed in giving one anyway, McKayla began to move you around to her back pocket. McKayla was wearing a new pair of spandex that has the tiny zipper pocket centered in the back. Undoing the zipper. McKayla stretches the fabric of her spandex to shove you In before plopping her ass down in the chair. McKaylas friend began to laugh as she noticed some sweat pour out of the back of McKaylas bottom but didn't say anything as she didn't know how else to keep McKayla from forgetting you. McKaylas derri\u00e8re was much sweater than her feet and none of the sweat had been absorbed like you had been doing for her feet. The earthy stench of sweat had built up and you sock body only made McKaylas massive ass heat up even more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon arriving home McKayla stripped out of her pants letting them land in a thick plop on the bathroom floor. Hopping into the shower, all of the stress and worries of the day melted off of her. You wish you could say the same about your body dropping out of her socks but luck seemed to always be against you when serving McKayla was involved. Upon exiting the shower and drying off, McKayla picks up the discarded running tights and throws them into the clothes hamper before throwing her dirty panties and sports bra on top. </span></div></div>",

She dumped you into the cylinder and then dumped a mix of McKayla's and her own clothes on top. Water and soap filled up the washer and began to spin you madly but something miraculous happened the pushing forced your sock halves together again! You were sure to be noticed now that you had reconnected you were so happy you initially didn't even notice when Vicky changed the clothes into the drier, but as things started to heat up you noticed something dangerous happening, you were melting again! you internally groaned your body was still beaten from the abuse earlier just like before and you were starting to come out of the socks. you're vision was to blurry as you were dripping so it was impossible to see what you were absorbed by now but as it soaked you in and the drier stopped you were just under your previous sock prison.

You mentally sighed in relief as you gazed up at your gorgeous wife and her friends. From your flattened stature on the floor you could see your wife's originally grey yoga pants had rescinded into a dark practically black shade from layers of sweat. <br>\r\n\"Let's start with burpees!\" McKayla instructed. 'Oh god' you thought, as McKayla quickly dropped her body onto the floor into push-up position, sweat spraying off of her from the impact. Drop after drop falling onto your smushed body. As McKayla began her push-up, her massive breast slammed into you before she quickly sprang up onto you, crushing you beneath her feet. This process repeated many dozens of times and you quickly realized why this yoga mat was so torn up from only weeks of use. <br>\r\n\"Alright girls let's get going with jumping jacks!\" Hearing this made you feel good as obviously McKayla wouldn't do jumping jacks on her yoga mat, especially if her beloved husband was below her. However Mckyala was so absorbed into her workout she had already disregarded any thoughts of her yoga mat containing a living person, and she wasn't going to move all the ladies yoga mats just to change exercises, so before you knew it Mckaylas huge sweaty feet were presssed onto your face yet again. Just as quickly as the foot hit you it moved off, every time it moved off you were met with a dozen sweat droplets. Each pound from McKaylas foot began to obscure your vision yet you didn't quite know why...it turns out that the massive amount of McKaylas sweat was eroding the layers of dirt on the old yoga mat, having the dirt wipe off onto McKaylas feet as well as your smooshed body. <br>\r\nAfter over a hundred jumping jacks, McKayla finally finished, exhausted from her workout she sat down as fast as she could, eager to take a break. Her sweat soaked yoga pants couldnt take any more liquid so you sat in a pile of McKaylas filth, her sitting creating an indent of sorts in the mat, causing the sweat to all pool around your face. <br>\r\n\"What an amazing workout girls! Feel free to stop by anytime and do this again!\" The girls all patted each other on the back for surviving their intense workout. Each girl dripped their way out of the house as you sat in your pool of sweat. Moments later, McKayla returned to the workout room, breathing a heavy sigh of relief. <br>\r\n\"Time to cleanup I suppose...Tom already cleaned this room once today Id feel awful subjecting him to my sweat again! My little man is such a trooper, always there for me and loving my body despite its stinky, sweaty tendencies.\" Despite the horror of your realization McKayla had forgotten you, you couldn't help but agree with McKayla and it made you happy you were somewhat on her mind.<br>\r\n\"My god these mats are filthy. I thought Thomas had just washed them! Oh well...\" McKayla says as she begins stacking them up, not even taking the time to wipe off the sweat accumalated by her friends. \"Oh gosh, my mat is by far the worst! I think it was a nice tan color when I bought it and now it's a Uniform black! It sure does absorb dirt well!\" McKayla hadn't even been able to see you underneath the layer of dirt from her feet! You blended in just like a regular mat! \"My mat is so dirty I'm just going to have to...\"</span></div></div>",

For the next few hours, she did nothing but watch TV, not even sparing you a second glance.

She was merrily enjoying her life, all while you suffered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Vicky returned home from school. She entered the house, waved hello to Mckayla, and started to head upstairs. Mckayla realized it was time to stop watching TV, so she placed her hands on the couch and pushed herself onto her feet. As she did do, her hand pressed down onto your face, and she gasped loudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOH! I almost forgot!\u201d Mckayla grabbed the yoga mat and rushed after Vicky. \u201cHey Vicky! I have something for you!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah?\u201d Vicky asked, walking back down the stairs. Mckayla dumped the yoga mat into Vicky\u2019s arm.

Her eyes widened, and she looked at Mckayla in confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is your yoga mat, right? I washed it for you, so it should be good as new!\u201d Mckayla beamed, proud of her hard work.

They engrained this funny logo right into the fabric of the mat. One hundred percent just a simple design, but it adds so much, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d Vicky explained, while Mckayla nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe order one for me sometime?\u201d She asked, before sauntering off. Vicky walked back up to her bedroom a moment later, closing the door behind her. After taking a deep breath, she looked down at you, a wide, Cheshire grin on her face. You knew what that grin meant. You had seen it before, and it spelled trouble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow dad, I don\u2019t know how this happened, but I think it\u2019s the first time you\u2019ve ever been delivered to me on a silver platter, so to speak.\u201d Vicky laughed cruelly. \u201cI was having a pretty shitty day up until now. I flunked the calculus test. But lo and behold, I get home, and my whole day turns around! You won\u2019t be able to punish me for screwing up the test, and I get one of the best chances to torment you that I\u2019ve ever had!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVicky dropped the yoga mat onto the floor of her room, and stood towering above you. You mentally quivered in a mix of fear and anger, staring up at your giantess daughter. In this predicament, she was like a goddess to you, and your fate rested entirely in her sadistic hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI mean, mom even gave me to you herself! She thinks that you belong to me, like you\u2019re nothing more than a possession. And, thanks to my own quick thinking, she\u2019s utterly and absolutely convinced that you\u2019re just a silly little design on my personal yoga mat. She\u2019ll never doubt my actions, or my words.\u201d Vicky leaned down and grinned widely, a sight that would haunt your dreams for years to come. \u201cShe\u2019s not going to save you. Ever. Only I can save you\u2026and I won\u2019t.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVicky chuckled to herself and walked to the other side of the room, taking care to purposefully plant a foot on your body as she walked over you. Her feet did not smell good, but thankfully the heavy weight only pressed down on you for a mere moment. After that, you couldn\u2019t see Vicky anymore. You could only hear the sound of her laughter, and the sound of rustling clothes. You also heard the faint sound of Vicky talking on the phone with someone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later, Vicky strolled back into view, standing above you with a confident smirk on her face. She had changed into workout clothes, which consisted of a sports bra and pink booty shorts. The attractive curves she had inherited from Mckayla were on full display, and you felt extremely uncomfortable viewing your daughter for such a sensual angle. Of course, you had had much more intimate experiences with her in the past, but you preferred to block those from your memory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSeeing my fresh new yoga mat has inspired me to get in a nice, hot, sweaty workout. Thanks for the love dad. I know you\u2019re always looking out for me!\u201d Vicky sneered. \u201cAnd, I\u2019ve even invited over a friend! Twice the fun!\u201d Vicky left her room after saying that, leaving you to ponder what she meant. A sense of impending dread rose within you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTen minutes later, Vicky returned to her room, carrying a second yoga mat. Entering behind her was none other than Lily, Vicky\u2019s best friend, and the person you feared. Lily was a curvaceous beauty, and an intense athlete. She was one of the best players on both the soccer and swim teams. Worst of all, Vicky loved to get her to unknowingly torture you. Somehow, Lily was constantly oblivious to your presence, no matter the scenario. You couldn\u2019t recall ever properly introducing yourself to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDressed in her typical exercise fair, Lily entered the room and closed the door behind her. Her bountifully blessed body looked spectacular in her tight tan leggings and midriff bearing tank top. Lily happened to glance down, eyes locking with your own. She smiled cutely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAww. What a cute little design. I like it.\u201d She said to Vicky. Vicky grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI knew you would. That\u2019s why you can use that mat.\u201d She told her. Lily\u2019s face lit up, and she stepped onto the mat. Her toes danced excitedly along your head, pounding into you over and over. Vicky took her place on the spare yoga mat, shot you a devilish grin, and gave Lily the thumbs up signal. Their exercise session, and your hell, was about to begin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

Not a day goes by without you having to be scraped off the bottom of someone's shoe, or drag yourself out of the toilet after going through someone's digestive system. You've been through so many perils that your body has suffered a great deal of damage, with you currently standing at less than half of your original height. Most of this has to do with how your dad, Max, has raised you. He isn't a bad father by any means. He makes sure your fed, clothed, and taken care of. The problem lies with how he deals with your condition. Rather than being extra careful and protective, your dad's always encouraged you to toughen up and tackle your problems head on, rather than relying on the kindness of others. This has never worked in your favor. Once when you were a kid, you overheard a girl making fun of you. Rather than brushing it off, you confronted her about it and wound up becoming her lunch for the day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou've never known your biological mother. She and your father divorced not long after you were born and he took custody of you. You've had several maternal figures in your life, though, in the form of your dad's many girlfriends. He finally settled down a few years ago, though, marrying your step-mother, Catherine. While she found your condition odd at first, she quickly warmed up to you... though, you have had quite a few \"accidents\" around her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne person you certainly haven't warmed up to was your annoying step-brother, Chris. It's not that he was a bad kid. He just never took any of your perils seriously, seeing you as some living cartoon character. You were often unwilling fodder for his stupid online video project, \"Bendy Benny\", which consisted of him forcing you into some humiliating predicament and filming it like it were a cartoon show.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only time you felt truly safe was when you were with your girlfriend, Talia. She's been your best friend ever since childhood, and you started dating recently. You met in junior high when you were paired together for a science project. The two of you quickly bonded and have been inseparable ever since. That's not to say that no one's tried to come between you. You've encountered rivals for Talia's affection multiple times and had to endure a lot to get where you were, but you love her too much to let her go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToday, your parents are heading out on vacation, leaving you and Chris by yourselves. Chris is able to take care of himself, so all you need to do is avoid him for the next couple of weeks as you're left unattended.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat will happen today?</span></div></div>",

Her house was only a block away, and you had made the trip many times before, so you weren\u2019t terrified. That wasn\u2019t to say you weren\u2019t scared, as accidents always seemed to happen with you, but you were still going to make the trip anyway. Talia was worth it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou left your house, happy that you didn\u2019t run into Chris on the way out, and then headed in the direction of Talia\u2019s house. You liked to walk in the grass, as it provided some nice protection from the dangers of the sidewalk or road. After five minutes, you were standing at the front door of Talia\u2019s house, and so you knocked politely on the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo one answered. You knocked again, but still no one answered. A tiny tinge of fear grew within you, but you shoved it back down. Talia had clearly overslept, something that she tended to do often. She had a few forgetful tendencies, and one has a habit of forgetting to set her alarm each night. As such, you had no easy way of getting into the house, but there were always other ways of achieving your goals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou trekked around to the back of the house, and strolled up to the back door. Talia used to own a small pug, and so there was a doggy door installed into their back door. She gave the dog to her best friend after you had a traumatizing accident with it, so it wasn\u2019t a problem. She insisted on keeping the doggy door for your convenience though, hence why you had come back here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter crawling through the doggy door, you found yourself in the kitchen. Faint music was drifting from somewhere nearby by, and investigating the noise led you to the living room. Talia\u2019s mother was in the room, working up to some kind of exercise program on the TV.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTalia\u2019s mother, Teresa, was an incredibly curvaceous woman, with a beautiful body. Her tight sports bra and leggings strained to contain her curves, and you found it hard to look away. Eventually you peeled yourself away, and left the living room. You had had many terrible experiences with Teresa, and usually tried to avoid her as much as possible. She tended to be oblivious and ditzy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took you almost ten minutes to scale the flight of stairs up to the second floor, and you were a bit out of breath when you reached the landing. At the same time, Talia\u2019s bedroom was only a few more feet away, and the door was slightly ajar, so getting inside wouldn\u2019t be hard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe real challenge would be trying to wake your girlfriend up. Talia was a notoriously heavy sleeper, and so it would take a great deal of effort to wake her. Most likely, you would have to climb her bed and scream in her ear or something to wake her up. Letting out a sigh, you started walking towards her bedroom door, passing by the bathroom door on your way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You walked up to Talia\u2019s door, and managed to push it open just a crack, which was really all you needed. Her room was pitch black, with only a little bit of light shining in from the hallway. There was no way you could turn on the lights, or open the shades on her window, so you just had to make do with the scenario you had been presented with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you approached the bed, you saw a pile of slightly dirty clothes lying on the floor beside Talia\u2019s bed. There was no doubt that it was Talia\u2019s discarded clothes from the previous day, which meant she was most likely sleeping naked. She often did sleep naked, and despite how many times you had seen her naked body, it always made you a little bit embarrassed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPart of the blanket was draped off the edge of her bed, and so you were able to fairly easily scale up onto the bed. Sure enough, Talia was spread out across her bare, as naked as the day she was born. She was lying on her stomach, her face pressed down into her pillow. The covers were completely off of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou began walking alongside her until you reached her left leg, which was stuck out straight across the bed. You hopped up onto the leg, aiming to just quickly climb over it and be on your way. However, your foot slipped on Talia\u2019s slightly sweaty flesh, and you lost your balance. You stumbled around like an idiot for a few seconds, before falling forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour face smacked into Talia\u2019s sizable rear end, pressing into the jiggly flesh of her ass. This caused Talia to groan, and she shifted slightly. Realizing how dangerous your situation was, you went into panic mode. You flailed around, trying to stand up and roll away from your girlfriend\u2019s butt. All you could do was fall off the side of her butt, and land right beside her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, Talia\u2019s massive body rose up into the air, and you realized that she was rolling over. Her weight caused an indentation in the mattress, and you weren\u2019t able to find your footing in time. You raised your arms in a futile attempt to protect yourself as Talia rolled onto her back, and her humongous butt crashed down into you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour body was flattened immediately, not standing a chance at all. Talia\u2019s flesh pressed down hard onto you, and you were shoved face first into her left butt cheek. In seconds, your body had been crushed down to a sticker on your girlfriend\u2019s rear. The pressure was immense, and you felt your squishy skin begin to adhere to your loving girlfriend\u2019s sweaty butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis torment continued for another hour, until finally Talia\u2019s eyes fluttered open. She yawned, stretched her arms, and rubbed the sleep out of her eyes. She then swung her legs out and around, plopping them down onto the floor. Her butt swiveled across the fabric of the bed, harshly grinding you in a circle as Talia moved to stand up. With horror, you felt your clothes tear free from your body, leaving you stark naked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTalia stood up, taking a moment to get her balance. She stretched her legs for a bit, and then opened up her closet and picked up her dirty clothes from the previous day. She tossed her dirty clothes into a hamper, and then gathered up her blanket from her bed. In the dark bed room, she didn\u2019t notice as she scooped up your tiny clothes along with her blanket. She then tossed the blanket into her hamper too, erasing all traces of you ever being in her house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTalia dug around in her clothing drawers for a few minutes, eventually settling on a cute black blouse and black leggings. She grabbed a matching pair of black underwear, and begin dressing herself. She clipped on her bra, and slid the panties up her leg. The tight fabric constricted around you, forcing you further against Talia\u2019s fleshy ass, and also hiding you from view. The pressure and pain only doubled as Talia\u2019s wiggled her black leggings into place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce fully dressed, Talia dragged her hamper downstairs and into the basement, where she dumped everything into the washing machine. After starting the wash cycle, Talia sauntered into the kitchen, where she fixed herself breakfast and checked all of her social media accounts on her phone. After thirty minutes, she cleaned up in the bathroom and plopped down in front of the TV.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of Talia\u2019s weight pressed down on you, and you could feel the pores in her flesh begin to cling to your gummy body. You were enduring immense pressure, as well as high levels of heat emanating from Talia\u2019s body. It wouldn\u2019t be long before your squishy self would be absorbed right into her butt cheek. You couldn\u2019t believe how quickly everything had gone horribly wrong. Today had promised to be such a fun day.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Suddenly, you thought you heard a faint stomping sound coming from somewhere in the house, and so you paused. As you listened, you could definitely hear the stomping sound, and it was growing louder and louder, and getting closer and closer. It took you way too long to realize that it was Talia\u2019s mother, Teresa, heading up the stairs. She had clearly finished her workout.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo sooner had you connected the dots than the beautiful bombshell milf herself appeared. She scaled the final step and turned the corner, obviously on a path towards the bathroom. Somewhere in the back of your head, you remembered that you were standing in front of the bathroom door, but your full gaze was on Teresa\u2019s voluptuous body. You couldn\u2019t tear yourself away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTeresa took a few more steps closer to you, and then you saw that she was rubbing her hands against her eyes, trying to clear away some sweat. She wasn\u2019t even looking where she was going, and would surely not spot you way down on the floor. Now you were paralyzed with both fear and awe, and your legs refused to budge. Teresa lifted up her left foot, and it hovered right above you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a quick and decisive blow, Teresa took a powerful step forward, and your squishy body was crushed flat as paper. Your body buckled into goop, and your face was smooshed into Teresa\u2019s sweaty and dirty sole. To make matters worse, Teresa had yawned loudly right as she stepped down, drowning out the \u201csquash\u201d sound your gummy body had made. The soft carpet had also dampened the feeling of your body against your foot, preventing her from feeling you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlissfully unaware of what had just transpired, Teresa walked into the bathroom, locking the door behind her. She stripped out of her sweaty exercise clothing and then climbed into the tub. Your body was caught between the smooth floor of the tub and Teresa\u2019s dirty foot. All of your girlfriend\u2019s mother\u2019s weight pressed down on you, and the torment was insane. Your body was quickly becoming engrained to the bottom of her foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour condition only worsened as Teresa showered. She stayed on her feet the entire time, not giving you even a millisecond to reform and escape this fate. The hot water from her shower only succeeded in liquefying your body slightly, which sped up the process of you being absorbed into her foot flesh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNear the end of her shower, Teresa lifted up her foot and rubbed the bottom of her foot vigorously with a wash cloth. The harsh wash cloth tore at your body, easily and efficiently ripping your clothes off and sending them spiraling down the drain. With that done, Teresa set her foot back down, crushing you once more. All sounds were drowned out by the roaring water, except for the faint tone of Teresa humming merrily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith her shower done, Teresa climbed out and dried off every inch of her sexy body, including her feet. The towel scratched at you as it went by, but you were too engrained into Teresa\u2019s flesh to be freed so easily. Most of your body had been absorbed, and it would take considerable effort to free yourself at this point. First off, you had to be noticed, and that would be difficult fused to the bottom of someone\u2019s foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTeresa slipped on a bra and panties, not even bothering to properly dress herself. Unaware of her daughter\u2019s boyfriend trapped under her left foot, she swung open the door to the bathroom and skipped out into the hallway. She was having a wonderful day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh! Hello dear!\u201d Teresa smiled, seeing Talia standing in the hallway. Talia was still naked, and was wobbling slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMor\u2026mo\u2026ugh\u2026\u201d Talia grumbled, pushing past Teresa and heading into the bathroom. Teresa shook her head and grinned, and then walked downstairs. Every single footfall sent ripples of pain through your body, and you mentally screamed in agony. Being shoved face-first into her foot didn\u2019t help either, as you had no idea what was going on around you since your world was pitch black.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTeresa made it to the living room, where she plopped down onto the couch and grabbed a book. She lifted her legs and set them on a small footrest, finally giving you proper time to breathe and not suffer. For twenty minutes you tried in vain to reform, but you just could not. Teresa had really done a number on you. You would probably need outside help to escape this horrible situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTalia finally came downstairs, dressed in leggings and a casual blouse. She was refreshed and happy, back to her normal peppy self. She waved hello to her mom as she walked through the living room, her gaze drawn to her mother\u2019s feet for the slightest moment. As she was leaving the room, she hesitated for a second, and looked back at the sole of her mother\u2019s left foot. She thought that maybe there was something there. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does Talia do next?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Talia's gaze lingered for a few moments more on her mother's left foot. She felt like there was something she should be noticing about it but couldn't quite put her finger on it. It looked a bit different, but maybe her mother had just recently applied a new kind of lotion or exfoliated it. Eventually she shook the feeling, but right as she was about to turn around and disregard her suspicion, Teresa called out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you looking at sweetie? Is there something wrong with my outfit?\" Teresa looked confused at her daughter, waiting to hear her response. Talia said back, \"Oh no, sorry mom. It just looked like there was something stuck to your left foot but I can't see anything. Didn't mean to worry you\" and she left the living room. Teresa laughed briefly at her daughter's statement before going back to her book. She read for a few more minutes, but then a thought began to creep into her head. After her workout she did feel the tiniest squish under her sole right before going in the bathroom. Teresa thought long and hard about what it could be, maybe a stray washrag or sock on the ground, but she couldn't quite figure it out. Finally after some time had passed, a light bulb flipped on in her head, and she said, \"Oh no, not again\" as she quickly hurried to the bathroom. Her feet slammed onto the carpet, her pace indicating that she must be in a rush. To you this might mean she realized what she did to you!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTeresa reached the bathroom, then closed and locked the door. She steeled her nerves for a second, fearing that she may have crushed her daughter's tiny little boyfriend. Eventually she lifted her left foot onto the counter, and inspected it. Initially it looked like nothing more than her normal sole, but she decided to take a closer look just to be sure. Meanwhile, you prayed that she would notice and let you free. You couldn't tell but by the way your body folded over on itself the tiniest tuft of black hair was visible, also glued to the middle of her sole. When Teresa saw this tiniest clue her dreaded suspicions were confirmed. She sighed and said,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"God damn it, how does this always happen to me.\" You heard this and you were elated. She finally noticed you and would begin the process of taking you off. But Teresa interrupted your train of thought with something that chilled you to the core.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen up, umm, Brad? No that's not it. Is it like, Bug? Yeah I think that's right. Okay listen up, Bug, I don't know what happened to make you stuck to my foot like this, but uhh I have no idea how to get little tiny guys unattached to me. And I would ask Talia for advice, buuuut that isn't going to happen.\" You were flabbergasted, why was Teresa being like this to you? She even thought your actual name was Bug! You thought you and her had a great relationship before this, but then she continued, \"It's not that I don't like you, Bug. It's just that, well, my daughter would hate me if she found out I did this to another one of her boyfriends. You see, Talia has always liked squishy boys for whatever reason, but I have just had the worst luck ever with all of them. It all started when she was in elementary school and she brought a tiny guy, just like you, over for a play date. He was such a cute boy, but he just had to get close to the blender while I was making myself a milkshake. Somehow I knocked the little dude in when he was trying to sneak a taste and well... I ended up blending him up and drinking him. Right as I finished the last drop I noticed a slight hint of flavor that I didn't remember putting in my milkshake. Then when Talia came in the kitchen to ask where her friend went, I put the pieces together. I felt so terrible about it that I told Talia immediately, and she did not take it well. I apologized so many times, but she wouldn't forgive me! She didn't talk to me for the rest of the day! It was one of the worst days of my life.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could not believe Teresa's speech to you. She was seriously going to leave you as part of her foot for the rest of your life just so she didn't have to face her daughter being mad at her. This was unbelievable! She was actively ruining your entire life just to avoid a small confrontation. You thought Teresa was finished, but she went on to add,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Since then I've tried my best to avoid you guys whenever she brings you around, but for whatever reason you tiny people are just pulled to me like you're magnets! First, there was her middle school boyfriend who was sitting on the lounge chair out back... I can't help it if I like to tan naked! How was I supposed to see such a little guy on the chair! He should have been watching out for my butt!\" Teresa was evidently flustered by the situation as she began to spill secrets that not even her daughter knew. She continued, \"Then there was her boyfriend freshman year of high school. I don't know why he was in my bikini top in the first place, but by the time I discovered him on the underside of my boob there was no way I could free him. Ugh, why do you people stick to my skin so easily?! I don't get it!\" Teresa paused for a second to calm herself, \"It took a while but eventually they both tanned with my skin enough until there was no trace of them at all anymore. And sure their parents were worried, but why would they think to inspect my body for their sons? I feel really bad, but as far as bodies go, I'm sure the little guys aren't too upset to be stuck to mine. Well maybe the one stuck in my ass doesn't love his life too much but he's got to be used to it by now. And I'm sorry, Bug, but I guess you're the next one to join them. This is the last time I'll be talking to you so try to enjoy your life on my foot. I mean, you're providing my left sole with a nice bit of cushion so bam! You're already serving a good purpose! You should be proud of that. Now, I'm going to put makeup on you until I can find the time to tan both of us, so my daughter doesn't notice. Good luck, Bug! Both me and Talia will miss you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that Teresa swiftly applied a layer of foundation to you and sealed your fate. Barring a change of heart in her, there was no way you could ever escape this situation. This was by far the worst thing that has happened to you. Someone who you thought had liked you was willing to destroy your future just to save her own skin. Your only hope was that her conscience would one day win her over, but that was only a dream. Teresa placed her left foot back on the ground, crushing you firmly on the bathroom floor, and you wished you could cry. She then walked back toward the living room where Talia was now sitting and plopped down next to her on the couch. Talia turns to Teresa and asks her,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Mom? This is a weird question but was that thing on your foot earlier possibly my boyfriend? Ben has a habit of getting squished to things and I just wanted to make sure that wasn't him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTeresa began to sweat immediately, and she responds...</span></div></div>",

They gave a small chuckle as if you were wearing a clown suit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe know that! We can't take either of you with us because we just want some us time on vacation. You\u2019re 18, we can leave him with you.\u201d Catherine said, reassuring you by setting two fingers on your shoulder, squishing it a bit. She quickly removed her fingers, and it reformed in a minute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, leave the normal 10 year old with an 18 year old that's a foot tall and gets squashed, worn, eaten, or sat on a daily basis. It's the same thing as abandonment.\u201d You shot back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you will make you feel better, i'll call Talia\u2019s mom and tell her to come check on you guys every once in awhile. Your dad said, picking up the home phone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile he was doing that, Catherine went up stairs to continue packing, you decided it be best to go back into your room and play video games. Each stair was a pain, but you finally managed to reach the top, about 15 minutes later. The door to your dad and Catherine\u2019s room was propped open, and you could see Catherine packing her jeans and shirts into a rather large suitcase. Shaking your head, you push open the door to your room, and climbed onto your bed. There were some advantages to being a foot tall though, as your T.V. was like a cinema screen. Pushing down onto the button to the remote, it came to life. Digging around for the controller to the console, you couldn't seem to find it. Your dad had to custom order you a smaller version of it for you, so it was always a bit difficult to find in the mass of blankets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead of your controller, a note was in its place. Catherine had taken your remote, probably in one of her drawers in her room. She wanted you to \u201cSpend some time with Chris, so no video games while we are gone.\u201d according to the note. This was no problem, since you could just steal the controller back when they left. Turning your tv off, you climbed back down off the bed, and opened the door to check if they left yet. Not seeing the light on and the door shut, you darted over to their room, and cracked the door. Nobody was in there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou heard commotion in the living room, so you snuck over to the stairs, and looked down. Your father and Catherine were walking out the door with suitcases. Giving them a wave goodbye, you darted into the empty room, and began to scale the large dresser. Beside the dresser was an open suit case, so they apparently weren't completely finished yet. You needed to be quick. Reaching the top, a drawer open about an inch, containing various pairs of panties and bras sitting right below you. Inside one of the bra cups, you spotted your tiny controller. Climbing through the gap, you stepped onto the cup, causing it to tip, sending your controller somewhere in the tangled mess of panties and what not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door downstairs had opened and shut again, they were coming back! Knowing you would be grounded for life if Catherine found you snooping around in her underwear drawer, you made a mad dash for the opening of the drawer. The thump of someone's feet were getting closer as they climbed the steps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBen, i'm sure you're mad at me for the controller thing, but it's for your own good okay?\u201d Catherine\u2019s voice rang out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grabbed ahold of the top of the drawer, hauling yourself up and over the drawers face. In your panicked rush to get out of sight and hide from catherine, you had forgotten how gravity and a hard surface affected your squishy body. With a silent splat, You had landed on something tan and soft. Whatever it was, you blended right in. Looking around, it seemed to be a hollowed rectangle with rounded edges, and a zipper around the top portion. It was the suitcase! Hopefully Catherine wouldn't be able to see you in the\u2026 open suitcase\u2026. bollocks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatherines looming figure appeared through the door, and she hastily began to pack the rest of her clothing. Clothes began to fill part of the suitcase, until something tan coloured blocked out the light, and you could feel your body peel off the suitcase onto whatever had hit you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDammit, i needed that.\u201d Catherine said, lifting it and you out of the suitcase.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat exactly were you stuck to?</span></div></div>",

Thankfully enough, it was encased in a wrapper so you knew you wouldn't be eaten any time soon, but since your mother was taking the breakfast bar on vacation, it stands to reason you wouldn't be getting home any time soon. You felt both you and the breakfast bar get stuffed into your mother's pockets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully, it seems you are slowly starting to reform, although the speed was certainly something to be desired. You knew you couldn't yell at your mother, lest she finds out you were snooping around in her room, so you decided to stay quiet and wait until you reform, although that could potentially take so long you reform inside the plane to London. Although that wouldn't be that bad, considering staying home with your step-brother alone would ensure being tortured for his dumb video project.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had made up your mind at that point. You would stay with your mother throughout the trip but stay hidden at the same time, ensuring that nothing could go wrong. At one point you could probably call Talia and let her know what was happening so she doesn't worry about you. Another benefit to this plan other than staying away from the demon child is that your   step-mom was smoking hot. More than once had you intentionally stayed quiet as she sat on you or walked into the washroom while you were taking a shower for the chance to feel her curves and see her take a shower respectively. Your size situation certainly helped with that problem as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou slowly but surely reform, going through your moms trip to the airport by taxi, luggage checking, and patdowns. Thankfully, you were basically unseeable on the breakfast bar, so the guard let her through. You finally deformed when your mother sat down with your father in the flight area preparing for the trip. Of course, you immediately tried to hide somewhere and chose to hide...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA: Under your mother, sneak under her rump as she scooches back. (Not gonna be found, but you're gonna be stuck most of the flight unless she uses the washroom.<br>\r\nB: In her handbag, which leads to the potential of being found but lets you leave when on the airplane easily. <br>\r\nC: With another family in the same flight area, you can find your family when on the flight, right? </span></div></div>",

She then said, \"Thank god I found these, my current panties are way too uncomfortable to wear for this entire plane ride\" and began walking to the bathroom. She shouted to Max, \"Hey I'm going to change real quick then I'll be downstairs and we can leave! Hopefully we aren't too late!\" In an evident rush Catherine stripped her leggings and underwear off, grabbing you off of the counter, your squished body blending into the already tan material. Before you knew it she slipped her feet in the leg holes and you were rapidly ascending towards her ass. Almost immediately you felt that these panties were a bit too snug for her sizable rear end and your body, along with the backside of her panties, disappeared between her cheeks. Your step-mother then slid her leggings up her legs, adding another layer of pressure onto your already squished body, as well as casting it into darkness. From deep in her ass you heard her yell, \"Coming now honey!\" as she began to move. Catherine quickly grabbed her remaining luggage and ran downstairs, grinding you up in her crack as she moved. Soon enough you felt her slam her ass down into what had to be the passenger seat of the car, and they were on their way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe situation had gotten out of hand fast. In only a few moments you had gone from 1 foot tall boy to a pair of panties for your 28 year old step-mom. Even worse, she had no idea that you were even underneath her. Your mind was racing a million miles a second, trying to figure out exactly what to do. Your little body was only squished onto the panties, you haven't been absorbed into them luckily, so you retained some ability to wiggle. Even though any significant movement would be severely buffered by Catherine's large cheeks, you could most likely get her attention if you tried hard enough. The real dilemma was not knowing what would happen if you did get her attention. Evidently, your parents were running late to their flight as is, so you doubted that your step-mom would even have an opportunity to take you off if she did discover your location. Moreover, Catherine would be livid that your 10 year old brother was home alone without supervision, and it was all caused by the fact that you couldn't wait 10 minutes to play your video games. It was a tough decision to say the least, and the constant pressure of your mother's jiggly butt chewing you up was not helping you think. Before you could make a decision on what to do you felt the car stop and she got out of the car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point both of your parents were hustling to make it to the plane on time. Luckily for them the security checkpoint wasn't very long and they soon approached the plane. They got to the gate only minutes before it was going to close and hustled onto the plane. Meanwhile you were absolutely discombobulated in Catherine's ass. The pounding steps of her running to catch their flight were absolutely demolishing you, squishing you further and further into her panties. Finally she plopped her rear down onto what you assumed was her seat on the plane and breathed a sigh of relief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whew, we made it! Now we can sit back, enjoy this 10 hour flight, and we'll be in England before you know it!\" Catherine said happily to your father. From deep down in your ass prison it was hard to make out exactly what she was saying but one thing was clear, she definitely said the flight would be 10 hours long. You would be trapped in this dark, dank crevasse for nearly half a day, enduring whatever sweat or possible farting your step-mom produced throughout the flight.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You had almost completely forgotten that you had school today, so you gathered up your small amount of belongings and headed out the door. All you carried was a tiny little Ziploc bag, which held a pencil, eraser, and a pen. It pretty much served as your makeshift backpack, though it was still a pretty heavy load to carry around. You made it work though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bus stop wasn\u2019t very far away, only two blocks. You trekked through the grass beside the sidewalk, wanting to avoid as many people as you possibly could. It made your journey a little more difficult, but it was better than being crushed flat under someone\u2019s shoe, that was for sure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, the bus stop was within your sight. A small group of students were already there, waiting patiently for the bus to arrive. Most of them were on their phones, which just reminded you how sad you were that you were too small to have a phone of your own. You approached the group of students and stood beside them, a few feet away just to give yourself a bit of space.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo your surprise, you didn\u2019t see Talia anywhere, so you assumed she was probably taking a sick day at home. This scared you a little, as Talia was your guardian angel, but you had made it through school days without her before. Your thoughts wandered to Talia, and a goofy smile spread on your face as you pictured her cute smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were ripped back to reality by a deafening \u201cstomping sound\u201d, and the whole ground seemed to shake. You turned around to find your small bag of supplies trapped under a thick black boot. Glancing up, it appeared the some goth girl had arrived at the bus stop, and hadn\u2019t noticed either you or your tiny pack down on the ground. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bus pulled up to the stop, and the students began piling in. The goth girl stepped off of your pack, and you dodged her boot as it came back down. Your eraser was smushed, and the pencil and pen were snapped in two. Groaning, you abandoned the bag and raced to the curb, leaping and landing on the first step of the bus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDodging a few more stomping feet, you made it to the first seat of the bus, which was almost always available. You scaled the metal leg as you had done hundreds of times before, and flipped up onto the vacant seat. You took a moment to breathe a sigh of relaxation, catching your breath. The bus began to close its doors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWAIT FOR ME!!!\u201d A distinctly feminine voice cried out, and you instantly recognized it as your living girlfriend, Talia. Talia dashed down the sidewalk and up the steps onto the bus. She looked frantically for a spot to sit, and her eyes rested on the front seat. However, her eyes rested on the front seat, and not on its tiny occupant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTalia took her backpack off and tossed it onto the seat, where it landed beside you and took up the half closest to the window. She then turned around and began to sit on the seat. As her huge, leggings clad ass began to descend onto you, you were paralyzed with fear. Glancing to your left, you saw the empty aisle of the bus. To your right was Talia\u2019s backpack, which was slightly open. You could also fall down in front of you, onto the ground. All you knew was that you had to make a decision, and fast.</span></div></div>",

You held your hands up meekly, knowing full well that your minimal strength would be tremendously overpowered by the simple act of Talia sitting down. Just as you felt the soft fabric of her leggings and the soft, squishy flesh of her buns hit your hands her descent stopped dead in its tracks. After a brief pause she quickly stood up to her full height and glanced around, looking for who was talking to her. After a moment she glanced down at her seat, seeing you waving frantically up at her. She flashed a radiant smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh god Ben you were almost a sticker on my leggings for the day...again.\" Talia said cutely down to you with a giggle. She then grabbed your body in one hand, and plopped her ass down on the seat you previously were sitting in. The audible smack her derri\u00e8re made onto the bus seat concerned you a bit with its force but at least this time you weren't underneath it. Talia held you up to her face and said,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You excited for schooo today?! It's still hard to believe how much they've changed for tiny, squishy people like ya! It's pretty awesome!\" You responded with a half-hearted smile and a nod, both happy to be with your loving but air headed girlfriend, and also nervous about living another day around (relative to you) giants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTalia was referring to the changes made to your highschool on behalf of the influx of squishy people such as yourself. Although you were born squishy and have survived up until this point in a world pretty tough on someone of your size and durability, there has been a recent trend of more and more squishy humans. Some claim it to be from a type of flu, others say it's a genetic predisposition that is just randomly flaring up. Regardless, your school saw it fit to make some slight adjustments to the layout of the school and rules to try to make itself stand out as accommodating for the more durability-challenged folks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpecial walkways were outlined on the ground for squishies, certain seats in the cafeteria, in classrooms, and at sporting events were reserved for squishies, and much more. On paper this sounds like a great way to limit the inevitable squishing that you and others like you would suffer at the hands (and other body parts) of your regular-sized peers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut in reality, it did not do as much as you hoped it would. For example, the \"squishy walkway\" in the halls was separated by nothing more than a thin line painted on the ground and often zig-zagged across the normal sized walkways, forcing you guys to cross paths with the non-squishy people anyway. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe designated squishy seats and lunch tables fell short just the same. They were often arbitrarily marked sections of seating that squishy students would pile into, with again, nothing more than a painted line separating them and the regular sections. These pitfalls in the system have led to countless instances of you being squashed flat beneath all body parts of the girls of your school. In fact, you've had so much experience with it that you couldn't help but categorize the different attitudes of the regular sized girls of your school. You figured doing this not only would give you a good chuckle but also help you avoid getting crushed as much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst and foremost were what you called, the \"ditzes\". These girls were either so dumb or so carefree that it almost seemed like they would forget that they went to school with squishy people at all. The ditzes would constantly forget about the squishy seating and pathways and parade their giant bodies across both. These girls could squish a 1 foot tall guy like you underneath their foot or rump and probably not even notice. Moreover, they would see what they thought were empty seats and simply plop their asses down, often squishing any number of squishy people beneath them. You tried your best to call out to these girls whenever you could, just to make them aware of your presence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second group consisted of the indifferent girls, you called them the \"so-so's\". These girls were aware of the squishies but wouldn't go out of their way to avoid you either. They could either be nice or mean, but either way the squishy people like you weren't a priority. Sometimes you wished they would pay you a bit more respect, but in reality they weren't too bad. Especially compared to the last group...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe third category of girls that threatened your malleable frame were what you referred to as simply \"the clique\". These ladies resent the fact that the weak, tiny, squishy people get so much special treatment in their school. They will intentionally walk through the tiny paths, sit on the tiny benches, and basically do everything to make your life hell. The clique members were usually popular and could go from simply messing with a squishy person for a second to crushing them flat or eating them. This group you avoided at all costs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour awesome girlfriend was one of the few girls who didn't pertain to any of these categories you made, and that was why you liked her so much. You'll admit that's occasionally she can fall into the ditz category, for the most part she was just a regular girl who liked you back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSurviving amongst all these other  ladies was a bit chaotic, but ultimately you assumed that at least you finally have some squishy-favored policies to help you out. After this deep daydream you were abruptly woken up by Talia far above you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ben? For real snap out of it dude we've gotten to school already\" she said with a laugh down at you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh wow sorry Talia I totally spaced out\" you responded. She carried you off the bus and to the entrance of school. Immediately you heard the bell ring and a wave of students began migrating to class. What does Talia do?. </span></div></div>",

The only reasonable option left was to jump off the seat, so you did. The seat wasn't that far away from the floor of the bus, so you didn't squish to it. The bus lurched forward as soon as you landed and you rolled back under a couple of seats, stopping when you slammed into a familiar black boot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gothic girl looked down to see what hit her boot, and saw you there, lying at her feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh?\" she said smiling with an eyebrow raised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked up and saw her. She had black pigtails with the ends died blue, a very pale face, black eyeshadow, black lipstick, and a black choker necklace. You actually found most goths unattractive, but this one was definitely different. She also wore a black band shirt, black fingerless gloves, and black skinny jeans that displayed her curves perfectly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe leaned forward and put her hands on the edge of her seat, still eyeing you with a sexy smirk. She raised her boot over you and stepped down, twisting it on top of you slowly. You wanted to scream out in pain, but you were flat as paper and still under her boot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I haven't played with one of you squishy guys in a while.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe continued to crush your body under her black boots for the remainder of the bus ride, grinding you into the floor of the bus for almost 20 minutes. As the bus neared the school, she took her foot off of you and moved it to your right. You started reforming but as soon as you got close she slammed her bare foot on your upper body, crushing the air out of your lungs. Her foot landed so your head was between her big and second toes, so when you breathed in, you got a big ole whiff of gothic feet. She twisted her foot on top of you again, this time grinding you into her milk white sole. When she lifted her foot again, you came with it, and she lowered it down back into her tall black boot. The bus came to a stop just as she finished buckling the last buckle on her boot, and she stood up with her book bag, waiting to exit the school bus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe used you as an insole for the rest of the school day, and without socks, too. Somehow, her foot didn't smell that terrible, and you quickly got used to the pain of being repeatedly stepped on. Most of the time she was sitting down at a desk, so you only had to deal with the smell and whenever she decided to squeeze your head between her toes.

You work in quality control at Harper Gummy Works as an inspector, and you made the mistake of handling one of the orbs of gummy with your bare hands.

He told you that his mother, the company\u2019s founder, recently revealed to him that she had a similar situation happen to her when he was a child, but she was keeping the effects at bay with a medication. Unfortunately, she has been missing for over a year and he hasn\u2019t been able to contact her.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You needed to take your two wonderful daughters, Harley and Amanda to school before you did anything else today. Harley had a driver\u2019s license, but you figured it would be a quick and easy way to spend a bit of time with your daughters. You had already eaten and gotten dressed, deciding on a black t-shirt and black shorts. You could hear Amanda and Harley getting ready upstairs, so you just waited in the kitchen for them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Harley descended the stairs and walked into the room. She was dressed in a cute purple blouse and purple mini-skirt. Her already quite impressive curves strained against the fabric of her outfit, which was probably a bit too snug for her. She was blossoming into an incredibly curvaceous woman, a fact both she was very proud of. Harley took after your creative talents, and participated in many stage shows at school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda walked in a few minutes after her. She was wearing a loose t-shirt and tight leggings. Despite being twelve years old, she was a bit of an early bloomer, and her more womanly features were starting to take noticeable shape. Amanda had already been asked out on dates by many boys at her school, though that might\u2019ve had a bit to do with her being the star player on both the Soccer and Track teams.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce both girls had started to eat their breakfast, you told them that you would be out in the car waiting for them. They nodded, and so you left the house and got into the driver\u2019s seat of your car. It was an incredibly hot day outside, and the inside of the car was like a sauna. You wiped some sweat off of your brow, but otherwise just decided to push the thought out of your mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes, you suddenly remembered what happened to gummy in extreme heat, but it was just a little too late. Your arms were already turning to jelly, and your feet were beginning to melt. You screamed, and tore off your clothes, tossing them into the back seat of the car. You still weren\u2019t cooling down, so you turned on the car and started the air conditioner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe air conditioner took several precious moments to kick in and spread cool air around the car, and by then your fate was sealed. Your body had dissolved into a puddle of goo resting in the seat. After a few more minutes, your liquid state cooled, and your body hardened, but you were still a small lump of gummy. It would take a while for your full body to regrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, you heard the front door of your house slam shut, and you knew that Harley and Amanda were on their way out to the car. Sure enough, the driver\u2019s side door was opened, and your beautiful older daughter stood beside you, her giantess form towering over you. You had never been so terrified of anything in your entire life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh. That\u2019s weird. Mom did say she was going to drive us, right?\u201d Harley inquired, speaking over her shoulder to Amanda. She had yet to make eye contact with you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think so. Maybe she had an errand to run.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe.\u201d Harley shrugged. \u201cOh well. We\u2019ll be late if we stand around here any longer. I\u2019ll drive.\u201d With that, Harley shifted her body to the side, and began to descend into the car. She had no idea that you were even there on her seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou opened your mouth to scream, only to find your lips partially deflated. Only a muffled groan escaped your lips, and the sound was just drowned out by the air conditioner. Your eyes widened in fear as Harley\u2019s gigantic ass grew closer and closer. Her mini-skirt was blown back by the air conditioner, leaving you to stare straight at your daughter\u2019s smooth, tan flesh. She was only wearing a skimpy purple thong, leaving most of her ass exposed!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crash landing came, and you didn\u2019t stand a chance. Harley plopped down onto the driver\u2019s seat, and your body was smashed under her jiggly, right butt cheek. Your daughter, in her haste to get into the car, and partially because her butt absorbed the shock, didn\u2019t feel a thing. She simply gripped the wheel and grabbed the gear shift.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda slipped into the passenger\u2019s seat, and the two girls began driving off to school. They never once glanced at the back seat and saw your discarded clothes. For the ten minute drive you suffered under Harley\u2019s ass, her entire weight slowly crushing the life out of you. The temperature rose, and sweat dripped off of Harley onto you. The pressure she was exerting began to take it\u2019s toll on you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt your body began to melt once more, and there was nothing you could do about. You tried to scream, wiggle to freedom, or reform, but you had no options available to you. In the simple act of sitting in a seat, your daughter was unknowingly sealing your fate. The sweat of her butt cheek adhered to you like glue, and you to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time Harley pulled the car into the school parking lot, you were nothing but a tattoo on your daughter\u2019s butt. Thankfully, you had not been fully absorbed into her flesh, but it would definitely take quite a bit of effort to peel you free at this point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarley climbed out of the car, her mini-shirt falling back down and covering you up, hiding you from sight. She waved goodbye to Amanda, who sprinted over to the middle school. Harley walked into the high school and off to her first class, blissfully unaware that she was taking her mother along with her.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>With an impending sense of dread hanging over you, you got into your car and drove off to work. There were so many ways that things could go horribly wrong while there, but you just had to stay positive and hope that everything would turn out okay. It was your job, and you needed the money. Your children depended on it, so you would do it for them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pulled into the parking lot and headed into the factory. You said a few nervous hellos to different people walking in and out, and scurried to the factory floor as quickly as possible. You had been assigned to the drop-off section of the factory today, which was where raw gummy material was unloaded and dropped onto the conveyor belt to be sent across the factory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe truck of raw gummy material had yet to arrive, so you dropped your purse down and pulled up a chair. Your heart was beating faster than it ever had before, and you were sweating profusely. It was incredibly hot this far back in the factory, and you were soon breathing heavily. You wiped at your forehead, and glanced at the clock against the wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, you felt an odd sensation on your hand, and watched in horror as your pinky finger began to melt and drip off of your hand. You gagged, and stood up violently, knocking your chair back against the wall. You dashed over to the nearest water fountain, unknowingly kicking your purse and sending it spinning into the back corner, hidden behind a few boxes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou dunked your hand under the cool water of the fountain, desperate to keep it from melting to goo. You hadn\u2019t even anticipated this happening, and had no plan for how to deal with this. While you were distracted, a factory employee strolled around the corner, carrying a huge stack of boxes. She couldn\u2019t see where she was going, and so she collided right into you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were knocked backwards, and you tripped over your own feet and sprawled out onto the floor. The huge tower of boxes fell down, and you were helplessly crushed underneath. The girl quickly gathered up her boxes, unknowingly stepping all over you. Her sharp heels tore at your flesh, and ripped your clothes to shreds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the girl had stacked her boxes, she finally spotted you. With a curious expression, she peeled you off of the floor, and a quick squeeze convinced her that you were nothing but simple gummy material. She tossed you onto the conveyor belt without a second thought, which thankfully hadn\u2019t begun to move yet. Using all of your energy, you struggled and squirmed, trying to reform.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you could make much progress, the truck filled with raw gummy material finally arrive, and it pulled up into place. The back of the truck opened up, and a slide popped out from inside. A giant mountain of gummy orbs rolled down the slide, pilling on top of you, which kept you flat and hidden from sight. With the gummy in place, the girl smacked a button on the control panel, and the conveyor belt roared to life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and the rest of the gummy orbs began to be carried down the belt, and you were powerless to do a thing. You mentally screamed and screamed, hoping someone would save you from this fate. Crushed under the weight of the other gummy orbs, you couldn\u2019t reform or escape at all. The worst case scenario had come true.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne by one, mechanical arms picked up the gummy orbs from the pile, and carried them away. Finally, only you were left, and a giant claw grabbed you before you could reform. It crushed and rolled up your body, until you too were a simple orb, your tan skin making you look like a normal tan gummy orb. The claw placed you back down, and the conveyor belt continued carrying you along.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour face was mashed and mangled, but one eye was still poking out. With horror, you saw the conveyor belt approached a fork in the road. You knew that one lane would lead to where gummy clothing was made, and the other would lead to where gummy toys were often assembled. You tried squirming some more, but only succeeded in moving about a millimeter. At this point, you truly were doomed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens to you next?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Sadly, no miracle occurred to save you from the horrible fate you had been set up for, and the conveyor belt continued to carry you forward. A mechanical arm grabbed you, lifted you up, and dropped you down onto the path that led to the \u201cToys\u201d section of the factory, and you helplessly rolled down the tube, mentally freaking out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour orb like form dropped down into a large bin filled with gummy orbs of assorted colors. Another mechanical arm grabbed you, and whisked you across the factory. Down below, you could see the workers in the factory going about their mundane jobs, unaware of the horrors you were facing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe robotic arm dropped you down another series of tubes, and these sent your body rolling into a much smaller crate of gummy orbs. You recognized this as the Gummy Doll Assembly room, where specially trained workers crafted gummy dolls of the highest quality. It was only a few seconds before one of the aforementioned workers strolled over, and peered down into the crate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is a pretty slim selection of orbs.\u201d The worker sighed, brushing back a strand of her long blonde hair. She was exceptionally pretty, with an attractive body and cute face. A small nametag read \u201cFelicia\u201d. \u201cThis one looks to be in good shape.\u201d She said, lifting you up out of the crate. \u201cThe tan color makes it easy to work with at least.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelicia carried you across the room, and sat down in front of her desk, dropping you onto it. Without wasting a second, she gripped you tightly, and expertly crushed, stretched, and molded your body. Her hands worked at an incredible pace, and it wasn\u2019t long before you had been formed into the shape of a little girl, albeit at only one foot tall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelicia felt no shame in seeing your naked body, as to her, you were nothing more than a simple gummy orb. She was holding you down tightly, which prevented you from moving. Right as you opened your mouth to scream, she dunked you down into a huge tank of liquid that was sitting by her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sunk under the liquid, and Felicia\u2019s powerful hands kept you from thrashing around. Slowly, you felt your skin begin to harden, your gummy features freeze into shape. You panicked, recognizing that this was Beta4, and screamed at the top of your lungs. All this amounted to was a few bubbles billowing on the surface, which Felicia failed to notice. Within a few minutes, you were frozen in this one foot tall state.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelicia pulled you back out of the tank, and gave you ten minutes to dry. She chatted casually to her friend beside her, while you stared up at the ceiling. You couldn\u2019t move. You couldn\u2019t talk. You couldn\u2019t reform. You had never been so powerless and helpless in your entire life. This girl had turned you from a proud mother of two, into a picturesque child\u2019s play toy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter ten minutes, Felicia turned her attention back to you, grabbing a few specialty tools from a small drawer. With a bit of force, she curled your lips into a small. She pulled at your gummy head, and formed what was essentially two pigtails. She dyed the pigtails black, and ran a red ribbon through them. She also crushed your breasts flat, and overall flattened most of your natural curves, making you more closely resemble a younger girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then popped open a container of make-up and leaned in so close that you could smell her strawberry mouthwash each time she exhaled. With cautious precision and perfection, she added copious amounts of black eyeliner and eyeshadow to your face. She painted pitch black lipstick onto your plush lips, and added the slightest of blushes to your cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLastly, she withdrew a paint brush, and dipped it in white paint. Over the course of the next thirty minutes, she painted every single inch of your body in the white paint, including your private areas. Not a single spot went untouched. When she was finished, your skin tone had been changed from a pleasant tan to a deathly pale.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelicia rummaged around for a few minutes, before retrieving a miniature goth dress. The dress was a mix of black and white, with a few tinges of red. She slipped the dress onto you, and it fit tightly on your body. She also popped on tiny black heels onto your feet. Every part of you was made of gummy, and so Felicia gave you another quick soak in the tank of Beta4 when she was finished. Everything was now bound to you, and your only hope was through the rare Beta4 solvent, which was only commonly found at this very factory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you were pulled back out, Felicia couldn\u2019t help but smile. You were beautiful, and easily the best doll that she had ever made. She was blissfully unaware that the one foot tall gummy doll she was holding was a real person that she had just doomed to this fate. Felicia was about to send you off to the packaging department, but she felt a certain connection with you, and almost didn\u2019t want to give you up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does she eventually decide to do?</span></div></div>",

You had had no idea his mother, Trish, had been missing for over a year. That sounded extremely serious, and so you wanted to do anything you could to help your boss. Not just because you wanted some kind of raise or promotion, but because you were a caring person who tried your hardest help everyone in need.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou headed to the factory, though you were able to convince one of the security guards to follow you around as you asked for information and help. The added presence of the security guard helped you to feel safe and secure amidst all of the dangerous machinery and hundreds of employees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the first few hours, you were barely able to get any information at all. Trish was Jack Harper\u2019s mother. Trish was an incredibly sexy woman. Trish had disappeared one year ago. These were all things you knew. You were about to give up hope when you stumbled upon an employee named Gloria.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMiss Harper? I remember her.\u201d Gloria rubbed her chin. \u201cIn fact, I remember the last day I saw her.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWHAT?\u201d You nearly screamed. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell Mister Harper?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI didn\u2019t remember until recently. Do you want to hear or not?\u201d Gloria huffed, and you calmed down. You gestured for her to continue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGo on.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay. She was walking around the factory, organizing some boxes and crates. Then, someone came up and told her that a special request was placed to have gummy material personally delivered. Since she wasn\u2019t too busy, Trish saw to the delivery herself. She took a box of custom-made gummy material and left the factory.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you know where it was that she went?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBarely. I think the order was placed by\u2026by a\u2026someone rich. Last name\u2026Courtney? Court\u2026house. That\u2019s it. Courthouse!\u201d Gloria nodded to herself, pleased she had remembered the name. You gave her your thanks, said goodbye to the security guard, and left the factory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce in your car, you entered the name \u201cCourthouse\u201d into your phone, and found an address. You raced off to the place where the address directed you to, not even stopping to think of one simple question: If Trish disappeared for a year after going to this house, what made her disappear?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe house in question turned out to be a humongous, sprawling mansion, larger than any you had ever seen. It was beautiful, but there was also something haunting about it. A polite doorman let you park your car out front, and then led you into the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello ma\u2019am.\u201d A cute maid bowed as you entered. \u201cMy mistress will see you in the art room.\u201d You followed the maid through a twisting series of hallways and corridors, until you finally entered a large art gallery. Hundreds of priceless painting lined the walls. Gold statues guarded each entrance and exit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the middle of the room were two comfy chairs. One chair was occupied by a shiningly radiant woman, who oozed charm and innocence. She had long, beautiful blonde hair, and dazzlingly blue eyes. She was wearing a tight, full length dress that hugged her modest but still attractive curves. The dress was a mix of red and tan, forming an interesting and eye-catching combination.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood morning!\u201d The woman waved cheerily. \u201cTake a seat.\u201d You walked in, feeling a slight tinge of panic, and sat down. \u201cWhat can I do for you\u2026miss\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTrinity. Trinity Wakeman.\u201d You answered. \u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTrinity.\u201d The woman smiled, and there was something unsettling about her large grin. \u201cThat\u2019s a beautiful name. My name is Elise Courthouse.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve come to ask you about a woman named Trish Harper.\u201d You began, and the Elise\u2019s smile wavered. \u201cShe apparently was last seen heading to this mansion. Do you know anything about her?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElise paused for a moment, and then stuck out her hand, as if to offer a handshake. Feeling awkward, you reached to return the handshake, only for Elise to lash out and grip your arm roughly. She squeezed tightly, and your squishy arm was smushed flat in her iron grip. She let you go, and you sunk back into your seat in horror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh what irony this is. And to think, I thought today was going to be boring.\u201d Elise laughed, a cold and heartless laugh. \u201cMiss Harper did visit my mansion, one year ago. Imagine my surprise when I give her a hearty handshake, and her hand is flattened within my grip. Of course, I used to be quite\u2026intimate\u2026with her son, so I\u2019m familiar with the whole gummy condition.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe box she had delivered contained some red gummy material I had specially ordered, and Trish herself kindly offered to be a bonus dose of tan gummy material. Once she was nice and squishy, I molded the two halves together, and formed this!\u201d Elise stood up, and gestured to her beautiful dress. You screamed, connecting the dots. \u201cThis was supposed to be her son, but Miss Harper serves the purpose just as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou monster!\u201d You jumped to your feet and turned around, only to see two maids blocking the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou can\u2019t leave now dear Trinity.\u201d Elise purred. \u201cYou know too much. Besides, my mind is already RACING with ideas. I\u2019m getting rather excited.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou saw that the situation was quickly spiraling out of control. You had to escape this crazy woman before she did something terrible to you. Your children were counting on you to be there for them. However, what choices were even open to you.</span></div></div>",

You smiled and rolled over, but suddenly you smacked straight into a giant foot. You never understood why your roommate decided to place your bed at the foot of her bed, especially because her feet always ended up hanging over onto you practically every night.

She groaned in her sleep  as you felt the massive foot rub roughly over your head and body, unknowingly using your little form to scratch an itch on her sole. You could only laugh at the situation, not letting such a minor event sour a good morning (despite the somewhat sour scent coming from these feet) and rolled out of bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour name is John Hurtz (22); optimist, squishy man, &amp; entrepeneur. Ever since you have been little you've been crushed, eaten, or molded into something of use by the rest of your friends and family. Your mother, sisters, even friends had all used you either intentionally or unintentionally at one time or another, so it was something you had gotten used to. After years of these experiences, rather than living in fear of them you have actually done quite the opposite. You've embraced them! You know based on your luck that you'll spend your whole life being treated like an object more than a human, so you decided to turn it into a career! After four years of studying business at college, you and your now roommate, Chelsea partnered up and make a living by renting you and your squishy properties out to anyone willing to pay the price! They can use you as clothing, household objects, companionship, whatever they can think of as long as they have the money. The one rule is that the longest someone can rent you out for in a row is one week. You initially were worried about one of these women simply keeping you as soon as they got their hands on you, but that's where your roommate Chelsea comes in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChelsea Singleton (22) is your best friend that you've known since freshman year of college. She stepped on you without realizing it during your first attempt at going to the gym, and took you along with her for an entire volleyball practice until later discovering you're battered form stuck to her workout shoes later in her dorm. Initially she laughed at you upon finding you, but after detaching your body from her shoe and talking to you while you reformed you realized she was a sweet girl at heart. By the time you looked human again you were the best of friends. Chelsea loves teasing you for being so tiny and often pranks you by squishing you or using you herself, but at the end of the day it's all in good fun and she has never done anything malicious towards you. And boy are you lucky that she hasn't, because the size difference between you two is tremendous. Chelsea is a 6 foot 2 inch blonde bombshell, and even not compared to you everything about her is larger than life. First off, her ass, sculpted by years of playing on volleyball teams is easily capable of covering your whole body with either cheek, or swallowing you up between the two. Her breasts followed suit, sticking out far from her chest and dwarfing your body as well. And last, her feet, wearing a size 12 shoe, each foot was quite literally as tall as your entire body. Hardly a day goes by where you don't find yourself crushed by one of these body parts, whether it be on purpose or accident. But hey, despite all this you two are thick as thieves and neither of you would ever want anything too bad to happen to the other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChelsea manages the customer interaction, and in the event that she feels like a customer is trying to steal you or take advantage of you in any way not agreed on, it's her job to get you back safe and sound. And this is a job she takes very seriously, so with her on your side you two started this business of renting you out! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn this fine day you...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Today you remembered that you actually have a client scheduled! You were excited but also a bit nervous. After all, from what you've already dealt with as a 1 foot tall squishy guy you assume that you'll be prepared for whatever comes, but every customer is different. After your wake up cuddle with Chelsea's large foot, you hopped down from your bed and began the trek to the kitchen. Everything in the apartment is set up for your roommates 6 foot 2 inch frame, so needless to say things took you a bit more effort to do. You walked past some of Chelsea's clothes strewn about on the floor, a pair of tan leggings, some athletic tops, and some pairs of socks that she had clearly exercised in. But soon you were out of the bedroom and walking down the hallway. At that moment you heard a powerful yawn echo out from the bedroom, knowing that it can't be anyone else but Chelsea you stop and turn around looking for her. In a few seconds her goddess-like figure walks through the doorway towards you. Her legs extended up far above you, ending where her oversized shirt hung over them. Even with her loose fitting clothing you could make out Chelsea's ridiculous hourglass figure, and were stuck staring as she continued walking. By the time your gaze was pulled away from her body to her head, you noticed that she was rubbing the sleep out of her eyes and yawning again! You realized that this meant she clearly couldn't look where she was going, but right as you opened your mouth to yell, the tremendous shadow of her right foot loomed over you. \"Wait Che..\" was all the noise you made before her enormous sole slammed down onto your minuscule frame. You were immediately squished flat to the sole of her foot, making an audible squishing sound. Immediately Chelsea stopped walking, leaving all of her weight on the foot crushing down on you. A few seconds went by and you started to hear a giggle from far above, which quickly turned into full laughter, and you were freed from the darkness as she lifted her foot up and looked at it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn John, I've been up for 5 seconds and you've already squished yourself to me? This is gotta be some kind of record for us.\" Chelsea said down to you, smiling and laughing. \"Well, I'm heading to the kitchen anyways so you can come along for the ride!\" she added and she quickly dropped her foot back down on the floor. You knew Chelsea loved messing with your tiny stature more than anything, so you cursed yourself for giving her such a prime opportunity. Immediately her foot began slamming you repeatedly into the hardwood. The nonchalant stroll of your giantess housemate was enough to obliterate you underneath her. She reached the kitchen and pulled open the fridge, grabbing the milk and some cereal off the shelf, setting it all down next to her laptop on the table. Quickly she sat down and began eating her breakfast while checking her emails. She crossed right leg over her left and you were brought out of your world of darkness once again, hanging a few feet above the ground. Evidently Chelsea had forgotten about squishing you and was too caught up in her breakfast and emails to remember you, so you decided to relax. After all she would have to take you off eventually. Almost immediately though your relaxation was ruined as Chelsea slammed her foot down in excitement and shouted, \"Someone wants to rent you out John!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe read a bit more and burst out into a wild fit of laughter, saying, \"Oh my god John you won't believe this. You remember my old volleyball teammate Aimee? Yeah she wants to rent you out as underwear for her upcoming volleyball tournament!\" You began to panic upon hearing the name Aimee, that was a name you could not forget. Out of everyone you had met in your life, nobody's ass had been able to surpass the size of Chelseas... except this girl. It was legendary to say the least. But as much as you loved to look at it, that thing seemed to have a gravitational pull on you. Countless times she had crushed you with underneath or between it, so the thought of voluntarily becoming this voluptuous girl's underwear seemed like a one way ticket to pain. You attempted to wriggle or shout up at Chelsea to turn it down, but in your smushed state you could do nothing. Just then Chelsea said, \"John? What do you think?\" and waited a moment before remembering where you were. She said, \"Oh yeah, duh, sorry bout that pipsqueak. I know my foot is your size but that doesn't mean you have to be married to it.\" She lifted her foot up and worked with her nail to quickly peel your body off. You came off in one flat, insole-like shape and she flopped you down on the table. Chelsea gave you practically no time to reform as she said, \"Well I'm gonna say yes for you because it's been forever since I've seen Aimee!\" She sent an email confirming her reservation of you as panties, then closed her laptop, staring directly at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay John, ready to engage panty mode?\" Chelsea said giggling as she picked up your flattened body and began molding you in her hands. At first it didn't seem to bad, like a gentle massage, but then she seemed a bit annoyed and said, \"Ugh it's so hard to flatten you with my hands sometimes, dude\" and plopped you down onto the table. She quickly stood up, turned around, and lifted up her shirt, revealing her gargantuan ass to you. Only a small thong ran down her crack between the two masses of ass flesh, but you had only a second to appreciate its beauty before she dropped it suddenly on your tiny form. *whump* Her ass smacked down straight on top of you, crushing you with the second body part of the day, as she began to twist and grind it on top of you. With every twist you felt your body flattening further and spreading out nicely. It was like kneading dough to Chelsea, but instead of dough it was her tiny roommate, and instead of hands she was using her buns. In a minute she lifted her ass off you and turned around. When you saw a big smile on her face you realized she must have accomplished her goal. She said, \"There we go, the perfect thinness to make some comfy panties\" and grabbed the edges of your body. Very quickly you felt your arms stretched out and tied together, as your torso and legs were squished into two diamond like shapes. Almost immediately Chelsea had turned you into a pair of cute, tan panties! She held up her masterpiece and looked it over for a second before saying, \"Oh shit, I think I accidentally put your face in the wrong spot... Yup, uhhhh so John your face is kinda right in the middle of the ass part... and facing in.\" Chelsea briefly considered reforming you but her laziness kicked in and she said, \"Eh, whatever. You can handle it, right?\" You were outraged at Chelsea for this entire ordeal, but you had still not regained your ability to speak, so he question was met only with silence. She responded to herself, \"Boy you're sure quiet this morning, but I guess you would be complaining if you didn't want me to do this so it must be okay!\" and set you back on the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChelsea went back to checking her computer for a few minutes, all the while eyeing your panty-form. After a few minutes she said, \"Oh man I can't resist this opportunity John, I gotta try you on!\" and snatched your body running to her bedroom. Your world shook as she ran quickly and you flopped around in her hand. But quickly enough she dropped her panties to the floor and you felt one of her legs brushing past you. The other followed suit as you looked far above you. There, Chelsea's shelf-like ass hung over you like two boulders, waiting to crush you between them. You felt yourself rising, only to find yourself quickly tightening around her thick, soft thighs. With a few grunts you were stretched across Chelsea's skin, and in a moment you felt yourself shoot up past her thighs and immediately sink a bit between her cheeks. Above you, Chelsea said startled, \"Jeez John, you fit a little bit snug back there! Has my ass gotten bigger or have you gotten even smaller? I thought I was making some normal panties but you ended up as a thong!\" Chelsea's really loved poking fun at your minuscule size compared to her as she continued, \"I can't believe your entire body isn't even enough to cover my cheeks... if you are this tight on my booty then Aimee might never find you inside of hers!\" Chelsea laughed hysterically at her own joke, her beach ball like ass cheeks jiggling and quivering all over your stretched out body with her laughter. She said finally, \"Alright well......</span></div></div>",

Aimee answered and she was still stunning as ever her Black hair framed her face in the right manner to make her look innocent and her assets were nothing to sneeze at, though her breasts weren't as large her booty clearly made up for it, the fact that you were going to be pressed face first into that booty did nothing to diminish your initial reaction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey girl, where's John I thought I was renting him out not just getting a visit from an old friend\" Aimee asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well he was so excited to get a call from you he had me turn him into your order right there at the house.\" Chelsea said stretching you out with her hands, you were going to have a talk with her about this after this job. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAimee grabbed you out of your partner's hands, \"Well the tournement doesn't start till tomorrow but if he's that excited I guess I should get right to it.\" she said slapping her sizable rear. you wiggled in her hand to try and get her attention and tell her you don't want to do this but she mistook you wiggle as approval. \" Okay John calm down i'm the one paying for some unbreakable panties for the week.\" she dashed off to her room with you in hand you noticed her booty shorts that barely covered her massive booty as she removed them her rear separated to reveal a tan thong that had been compressed so much you couldn't make it out against the shorts. The thong to was swiftly discarded as you were brought to the floor but before you were pulled up Aimee spoke \"John thanks so much for doing this I know I'm paying you and all but I bet you get a lot of offers and I'm just really grateful you'd choose me over someone who might not have had as well you know\" she said before pulling you up into the depths. unfortunately for you you got stuck about half way up and Aimee and to pull and yank to get you all the way on, this stretched you even farther than you had been and you had basically disappeared in her crack and you could feel her tiny booty shorts coming up behind you. Aimee had to hop a bit to get the shorts on and as they compressed her cheeks around you, your world became her Legendary Booty and you wished you could have refused this job because as she started to walk and her ass cheeks rubbed you from ether side you knew it would be a long week.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Damn John you really are a comfortable guy\" Aimee said with one hand caressing her booty short covered butt cheek, \"You sure you weren't born to be a pair of panties?\" she added with a giggle. \"I mean I do remember you always ending up around my big buns one way or another back when Chelsea was on the volleyball team. But now instead of getting squashed by it you're at least serving a good purpose! I mean, if I were you I would be pretty stoked! It's not often that people find the career that they were literally born to be.\" Aimee concluded her assumption with a giggle. After a few more seconds you heard her say, \"Oh shit I actually have to get going right now! Well, I'll try not to forget that you aren't just panties but I'm going to be pretty focused on this tournament, plus it would be weird of me to talk to my clothes. So if I do forget then just keep on supporting my booty! Thanks again, little guy. You're saving my ass here... literally.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that you felt Aimee's hands stop caressing her own ass. Deep down in the dark prison of her gargantuan rear end you could feel your body pushed to its limits. In most situations your malleable body could bend and stretch as much as it needed, but for the first time in a while you felt like it couldn't. Her comically voluptuous hips tugged on your arms as they wrapped around her waist, while her planet-like ass crack chewed up your torso and legs inside of it. Aimee's derriere dwarfed you with such ease that you felt yourself sinking deeper and deeper inside of it. Like quicksand, her butt cheeks chewed up your body with every agonizing step, as your head was your only body part still sticking barely out of her crack. Slowly but surely you felt your head following your body, deeper and deeper. You had started off in the shape of panties, albeit very cheeky ones, but shaped around Chelsea's ass. Now, obviously Chelsea's buns were no small fries themselves, but compared to Aimee's they definitely were. For this reason you felt every step transforming your squashed form more and more into a G-string like shape. After a minute of walking, it seemed you couldn't hold out and longer, and your head vanished completely between her buns. Your world became darkness as you were consumed by her giantess-level crack. Moreover, being an athletic girl, Aimee's booty gave off the slightly earthy smell of butt-sweat, a smell you were all too familiar with. Between her cheeks you were being completely steamrolled, until you felt Aimee stop walking quickly and make an audible huff far above you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, what the hell, John? I thought I rented out a pair of panties, not a thong. I've got tons of thongs already I don't really need another one dude.\" Aimee said matter-of-factly far above you as she dug her long index finger down her butt crack. It took her a second but she found your diminutive form deep between your cheeks. You felt her hook a finger around where your chest and face were before dragging you roughly out of her cracks. She tried to stretch your body back into panties shape but it was no use. You realized then that her rear was quite literally too big for you to handle. It would sooner eat you up completely than permit you to act as regular panties. Aimee took a few more steps and this time you felt yourself slingshot even quicker back between her cheeks, resuming your position as a G-string. Aimee groaned above you, \"Seriously, dude? I thought you were going to be good at this! I mean its your job! Like, stop going in my ass!\" She dug your body out again before saying down to you, \"You know what...\"</span></div></div>",

Still I think your gonna wish you could have covered my butt instead of slipping between it cause I got an intense week ahead.\" Aimee said matter of factually and so Aimee continued walking with you wedged far up her crack. All the sound from the outside were now muffled to you as the sound of Aimee's cheeks grinding you became all you could really hear, but you could tell from the compression that she was driving to her destination now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"hey girl! bout time you showed up you were almost late\" you could hear another voice faintly<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"don't worry, I was just getting a special delivery.\" Aimee said slapping her rear causing your 'workstation' to shake as she walked to the arena. there wasn't much talking after that but a whole lot of motion, it felt like Aimee must have been a blur on the field because you were being ground even farther into her booty, every time she ran for the ball it felt like a steamroller going over you and when she was bending over out of breath, you were almost glad that you couldn't stretch across her expansive ass because that no doubt would be painful. The sweat started to accumulate after about five minutes but your body ever dutiful soaked up every drop causing you to taste the salty flavor and sting your eyes. You couldn't tell how long had passed but by the time the match was over you had been beaten far worse than the opposing team, and you only knew the match was over because the girls were hitting the showers and Aimee was sliding you off of her hips. One of the girls who was lingering behind got a good look at you and gasped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aimee, did you know your thong is a little guy!\" she shouted Aimee casually looked over her shoulder to see her teammate holding you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"oh, yha I met him back in collage, he's running his own little service thing, I paid him to be my panties for the whole tournament. He had the option to opt out of any job he doesn't want but come one have you met the guy who can resist this booty.\" she said slapping her back side. her teammate was aghast with shock it had never occurred to her that that was an option.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Can you give me the number, I might want to give this a try.\" she said before setting you back on the bench. Amiee finished washing herself and slipped you right back up her booty without a word. the next week went as much the same but without any break from the grinding cheeks besides when Amiee was in the shower, and you thanked her for showering, your body was basally beaten. Yo almost missed as your G-string form was handed back to Chelsea and you were set out to reform on the table. When about three hours had passed and you had only managed to inflate into the shape of regular panties Chelsea was playfully concerned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow a week under the legendary booty really did a number on you John, maybe you want to stay like that, Amiee was super satisfied with your work and she might consider you again for her next tournament.\" you tried to wiggle in anger but couldn't even succeed at that you had to put all your effort into reforming. \" anyway we actually have another client coming up two days from now, she just wants to try how this feels for her so she's only renting one day and she wants to do the molding herself, and she payed for the any mold option. I'll show you a picture and tell me what you think after you reform 'kay\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChelsea pulled up the picture and it was...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Your Aunt Brianna never visited often when you lived at home and she didn't attend any family functions so after going to collage you hadn't seen her in a number of years. She looked just like you remembered though, her hair was dyed bright pink and she was blowing a kiss to the camera. Her large curves weren't hidden either with the low cut top and little short shorts showing off her body. Bri was an oddity for you growing up, she would come over to your house and seemingly by some magic she was the only woman that never accidentally got you under them. Despite numerous close calls she was always somehow able to keep her generous figure from pounding you like a pancake. She was your mother's youngest sister making her not too much older than you, maybe by about eight years. You didn't know what she wanted to do with you, or your business but you needed to hurry up and tell Chelsea to cancel that meeting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took all of the next two days for you to get back in shape to talk and after explaining the situation to Chelsea she got a nervous look. \"Well you see...\" you narrowed your eyes, Chelsea had already tested your patience with the whole Aimee fiasco but you had to drop it and sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it Chelsea, I'm not mad I'm just a little put off by you making these decisions before asking me.\" Chelsea gave a guilty look and resigned herself to explain what had changed in the last two days.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay well, it's just since she already pre paid I sorta... talked her into getting more days. Like she clearly doesn't know you're her nephew or anything it's just, how am I gonna explain this over the phone when we are supposed to meet in like an hour.\" You nodded, it was kind of rude to cancel with no explanation an hour before a meeting. You thought about it for a moment before deciding that the best idea was to go to the meeting and explain to your Aunt in person.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA short trip across town brought you to Bri's apartment and you were starting to get nervous about having to explain everything to her. Chelsea knocked on the door and there was a shout from inside that she should just come on in. You both entered the apartment to find everything clean and neet, Chelsea sat on the couch but you figured that would just invite disaster for you so you opted to get up on an uncomfortable looking desk chair that was in the room next to the couch. That was when Bri walked into the room, of course she was wearing just some yoga pants and a loose fitting shirt but before either you or Chelsea could say anything her eyes fell on you. She darted across the room, and you suspected that she must have recognized you but that wasn't the case. \"What-\" Her yoga pants read Juicy on the back as they compressed you into the chair and she started adjusting her rump to smear your body across the chair. Chelsea was stunned and could only watch as your voluptuous Aunt used her ass like a steam roller to turn you into a chair cushion. Satisfied with her work Bri swiveled the chair and leaned back in it to talk to Chelsea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm so glad you got here on time, and the little guy was right where I wanted him. You really are professionals\" She caught wind of Chelsea's stunned look. \"Is something wrong? I pre paid right everything is already set up you said.\" Chelsea didn't know what to say so she just nodded at the assertion. \"Well then if there is nothing else? I'll see you in a week\" She shifted on top of your face really grinding her ass into you and the chair. \"god I'm glad you talked me into extending my time, you were so right he feels [i]Amazing[/i] even on my old desk chair. I have stuff to do though so please if you would get going.\" Chelsea was surprised by the assertiveness of it all and unfortunately for you was easily shuffled out of the building by your Aunt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe moment that the door was locked behind her you were starting to get a sense of dread that this week might even be worse than your last one. Bri sighed and then began rolling the chair you were attached to back into her room, unlike the pristine look of the living room, this room was trashed, cloths were all over the floor and the only light was coming from a computer screen with some sort of game loaded up. \"Time to get some real grinding done, Thanks for the help little guy I haven't been able to sit in front of the computer as long as I wanted since my chair was so uncomfortable.\" You gulped internally, you had conversations with Bri before about games but you had never really gotten into them and clearly she downplayed her own involvement whenever she was around your family. You saw her strip out of her already sparse clothing leaving her in only a bra and slamming her naked rear right back on your face.She wiggled to get comfortable again clearly enjoying the way it felt with bare skin even better. \"ooh that's so good I might even break my twelve hour record, hang in there okay little man I've got more for you to do this week than just pad out my gaming chair. I've got a new cushion coming in tomorrow so I'll have to find something else for you to take care of for me.\"</span></div></div>",

You query how she'd take the news knowing she's using her nephew, though it meant little now. Once the music from her game commenced playing, Bri sat back in a lounging pose. Her full weight rested on you. Above Bri was doing a quick setting check, making sure the graphics set to the highest level. The sound of her computer fan ran at extreme volume levels indicating it was too much to handle. \"Man it's getting hot in here,\" she declared fanning herself to cool off unaware of her own doing, as her ass began producing a mild build up of sweat, producing a foul odor around you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had no moment's to prepare for this new burden as Bri actively shifted around as she starts playing her game immediately. She must be either great at the game or lucky, as with each time Bri would win she bounces her big bubble butt down in the chair pummeling, even more, air out of your lungs and flatting you further, which took Bri sometime to notice from your body slowly losing it's supporting comfort. \"Oops sorry, Not sorry! My little cushion. I get so wrapped up in my game. But, you probably know how that is,\" your Aunt replied ending with a soft giggle as you endure submitting under her enormous naked ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHours pass by, and Bri ass accumulated to a cesspool of sweat. The little foul air that was once tolerable became an unmanageable ordeal. Your nose was burning with the scent of Aunt's ass, as the rest of your body worked on absorbing large quantities of it. Bri seemed not to mind this one bit, as you were far past a seat cushion now, and finding you transition to an ass sweating rag, so quickly did make her comfortable, allowing her more time to focus on the game at hand. \"Phew,\" Bri exhaled, pausing her game, whipping the sweat from her brow, \"Your doing a splendid job back there. But I have this itch,\". Bri told lifting her leg, pushing your face in the farthest reaches of her ass. You gagged having your face smeared across your Aunt's asshole. You scream thinking of this likely couldn't get any worse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA massive gust of wind blew in your face, as Bri sighed with relief and composure, \"Man that stinks! I've been brewing that one for a while,\" as she pulled out her hand to pat her plump belly, leaving you wedgied between her cheeks. Later in the night, after using your body to mop up more sweat and inhale the few other pent up farts she had, Aunt Bri finally finished her game. \"Wow! That was great, and I even beat my twelve-hour record,\" she responded sitting up, the room echo's by the sound of leather peeling off her sweaty body that joined the two. Bri looked down expecting to find a butt print of you memorialize the achievement. But, her sweating was so potent you stuck to her ass like glue as she peered over her shoulder to find you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Comfy little guy?\" Bri asked shaking her ass toying with knocking you off, \"I see, charmed by my big old booty. Well? I can't blame you! So I guess you can stay there for the night,\". Not that Bri even desired to help you to begin with, or hoped you fell off as it seems fitting to have you fastened on her butt. \"Get me out of here,\" You yelled, into the bowels of her ass, trying your best to force yourself a chance of freedom. Aunt Bri bit her lip, enjoying the slight tickles at your weak attempts of escape. \"You know what I got a brilliant Idea,\" she announced loudly. You knew by her seductive tone of voice this was about to get severely worse. Bri grasped a piece of you from each side and proceeded to pull you to fit around her large curvy waistline.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt your body stretch to limits on end from the outside. There wasn't enough of you to support Bri idea, as most of you squishy body already were trapped in her ass. She grabbed another lump towing you to between her thick legs to cover her privates before flattening you smoothly out altogether, \"Wow! You make decent underwear too,\" Bri giggled as she felt your body abruptly shake. Bri guessed it was nothing, but when she took the first step, you snapped undone, shooting deeper between her cheeks. \"Eep!\" Bri squealed while jumping from the sudden riddling in her ass, \"What's the big idea,\" she stated trying to pry you out, \"Too good to remain panties?\". You felt her violently plucking as you weep from your smelly prison, no matter how hard your Aunt tried you seemed very thickened in there. She tried once again to fasten you up even tighter than before but experienced the same outcome.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAunt Bri was becoming dissatisfied by her hired little man's lack of service to her demands, reaching for her phone she quickly dialed up Chelsea to complain. Of course, it being the middle of the night she didn't count the matter as Bri was distraught. \"Just wait till I get your manager on the phone,\" Bri huffed tapping her foot with anger as you jiggle from the movement. \"She's calling Chelsea? She's calling Chelsea!\" you became joyful, your girlfriend will surely get you out of this mess, and you'll be far away from your beautiful young Aunts clutches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Hi I'm calling to complain about your squishy worker! He's lodging himself in my ass and won't do the task I want.\" She screamed over the phone sitting back down, in her blind rage she exaggerated the details quite a bit. Chelsea was picturing the worst, and perhaps something terrible might have happened as she half dressed herself taking her purse to drive back to your Aunt's apartment. Bri heard the knock on her door as she rolled herself to open it just enough for Chelsea to slid in. Your girlfriend was out of breath as she rushed over here. \"What's..\" Chelsea exhaled hunched over, \"What's the problem,\" she asked standing up seeing Bri without any underwear to cover herself. Chelsea glanced away after seeing she also dyed her pubic hair bright pink, supposing to match her hair color.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, sorry for the late call? I may have been upset. But it's your little guy's fault,\" Bri said with an unsettling tone, she had claim down a bit but was still very annoyed. \"Uh, What exactly did he do?\" Chelsea claimed. Bri sat up and did a quick demonstration as she wanted from you for the third time to make you panties to fit her gorgeous body only to disappoint. \"See! He keeps doing this. I want my money back,\" she said with irritation. Those were gold words you were excited to hear all Chelsea had to do now is free you and head home. \"Hold on a sec!\" Chelsea bumped in quickly saying, which made you worry what was to occur now, \"We don't really do refunds? But, I can help you with your dilemma,\". Your Aunt Bri did a swift grin and see how much she could milk the worth, \"Well as much as I would enjoy that. I don't see how that helps reflect on my experience. I'd much rather have my money,\" she explained underneath a devilish grin. You knew this was a trick as your Aunt Bri was always Childishly obnoxious at times to gain things. Chelsea was busy thinking about how the two of you'd get by for the next month with concern, \"Ok! Ok! How about I help you out, and give you another two weeks free of charge,\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Deal!\" Bri replied hitting the jackpot, as you cursed Chelsea not seeing through the ruse, and now lent to your unaware Aunt for a total of three weeks. \"So do you mind?\" Chelsea asked kindly for Bri to deliver you over, which she laughed too. \"You're gonna have to get him because of my bum too big to reach into and obtain myself.\" Bri spread her cheeks apart, as Chelsea grabs you, which wasn't easy as the horrific smell got to her. You cry as you peel of abandoned prechewed gum, but at least you got to see Chelsea lovely face.  You reeked in the stench of Bri rank ass as she offered to clean you up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBri impatient to have you like panties didn't mind you having a delicate off-putting scent.  Chelsea got to work molding you, as Bri sat in her gaming chair waiting, \"Can you make sure to put his face in the backend I have trouble back there and I figured it could be useful to have him working while as my underwear.\". Chelsea saw the dread in your eyes having to endure her large ass more, but had to make sure Bri was happy. \"Sorry, John!\" she whispered spraying you with a bottle on Beta-4, \"Here you are,\" she said handing you over. Bri was rapturous pulling you up her meaty thighs, \"He's a little tight,\" she whimpers as you were locked tightly around her waist. \"Thank you! Thank you! I'll be sure to call you if I need anything else,\" Bri said pushing Chelsea out the door with hurry. \"Ok! But take this,\" Chelsea remarked handing over a bottle of solvent, \"It's to..\". Your aunt Bri slammed the door on Chelsa face before she could explain, entering her room Bri tossed the bottle with no care where it lands or what it did she had no use for it, as she picked the wedgie that was your face riding up her bum. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBri shook her ass a few good times to test out how well you hold, \"You are stuck, Well good!\" she exclaimed with an arrogant tone, \"Maybe if you behaved, then you wouldn't be in this mess.\".  Bri jumped into bed landing her ass to crash down upon you. \"We're going to have fun tomorrow. I'm meeting my sister to work out,\". You eyes shook realizing she's going to wear you to visit your mother. You know she would be wouldn't happy of discovering your daily work life, even worse being worn by your Aunt currently, so close to her privates no less. You try fighting, but the Beta-4 held you in panty form. \"I knew you are happy, Goodnight!\" Bri said drifting off to sleep leaving you in servitude to her ass.</span></div></div>",

You could feel cold milk spill out from the bowel, landing on your entrapped form. Bri must have been in a hurry, for eating messily. Covering herself in leggings that visibly showed you and a tank top she grabbed from the hamper she left her house. \"Hey, Sis! Sorry for being late. I can't wait to tell you about,\" Your mother stopped Bri from talking \"Save it! Tell me as we work out,\" you hear your mother say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two enter the changing room as your mother proceed to undress, \"You're not changing clothes?\" she asked her younger sister almost knowing the answer already from the rancid smell she carried. Bri explained about her day yesterday, about your job, how she paid you for services while retaining your identity a secret seeing that your Aunt didn't know it was you either. \"So this guy rents himself out, and you pay his girlfriend? Don't that make him almost like a prostitute and his lover his pimp?\" your mother proposed. Bri laughed telling her sister she's overthinking it. Though you never pictured your life like that it almost fits the description. \"Well, I'm glad my son doesn't do these perverted things. He's a sweetheart!\" You mother said proudly. Bri rolled her eyes, \"Yeah, but can you imagine if he did?\" she giggled, unknown you were already being subjected to it. \"Maybe I can borrow him? You know to try out?\" You mother suggested her younger sister. She never wanted to reduce her son to being something for her amusement, But seeing if some random guy is willing to put himself in that spot.  Aunt Bri giggled seeing her older sister inquiry. She wasn' keen on the idea as she paid for him and is enjoying wearing him \"Maybe?\" as the two walked out the changing room..</span></div></div>",

Our team still needs your support after all and I've still got you for the whole week.\" Aimee looked disappointed as she slid you off, taking a bit of effort to maneuver you around her hips again she in inadvertently snapped you back into the 'regular panties' shape as she pulled down. You tried your hardest to call out to her and warn her that she wasn't supposed to give you to anyone else during her time, there is an extra fee for that, but you couldn't move your mouth as she held you up to the girls on her team trying to judge who you would fit best. Aimee slid on her back up pair and started walking to one of the girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Kimmy, I know you're not super into the whole lucky clothes superstition being team captain and all but I got these lucky panties and they don't fit me quite right do you think-\" Aimee was suddenly cut off by a hand and you could finally see the girl that she intended you for, and you recognized her in an instant, she had been a senior one year ahead you, Aimee, and Chelsea but she was a no nonsense kind of girl. Kimmy is a tall, leggy brunette with a nice B-cup and a good looking booty but it isn't overly large like Aimee's. Thinking back you remember Kimmy helping you out of some situations in collage but mostly she managed to avoid you, in fact Kimmy was probably the only girl on the team to spot you on her own things every time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aimee I'm not dumb and I'm not sure where you found him but I know that those are John, I heard something about him taking a job but that doesn't matter.

It was different than with Chelsea or Aimee as Kimmy stretched so did your body to cover her, and you weren't being sucked into her crack either, maybe this week wouldn't be so bad after all.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You thought about it for a second before remembering obviously that it was Saturday! You turned back around to look your bed, custom made for a foot-tall guy like you, as well as look at the size 12, slightly damp, and pungent sole that loomed over you like a guillotine. Climbing back onto your bed, you decided that you should wake Chelsea up and start your fun day off. You knew well enough by now that Chelsea could sleep in forever given the chance to, so many times you had to wake her if you wanted anything. More often than not this activity ended up very, very poorly for you, but that didn't stop you from trying. You slowly reach our your hands and scratch the bottom of the sole lightly, sending a shock of tickles to Chelsea. She groaned slightly and wiggled her foot in response to your stimulation, but you stayed steady and went for another round of scratching. This time Chelsea groaned even louder and stirred visibly. To your surprise she muttered out in a half-asleep voice,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mrmph, ugh, quit cuddling your girlfriend down there dude, I'm trying to sleep!\" Chelsea said down to your in a sarcastic but lighthearted tone. You knew she was just messing with you but it still hurt a bit to realize that her foot is actually the appropriate size to be your girlfriend. You sighed but couldn't let Chelsea know that her burn had gotten to you. You resumed scratching her sole furiously as you shouted up,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For the last time your foot isn't my girlfriend! I'm aiming for something much, much bigger\" you retort, jokingly referring to her gigantic derriere. Chelsea smirked, knowing that no matter how annoying you were being that she always had a trump card for your little roast-sessions. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh she isn't now, but what about her twin? I think they might be interested in a THREESOME\" Chelsea's voice slowly built over the course of her sentence, finishing loudly. At the exact time that she ended her sentence you saw another wrecking ball sized foot sliding your way. Simultaneously, you felt the original foot you were touch curl its massive sole around your back, pulling you straight towards its mirror image across from you. In an an instant both size 12 feet slammed your body together, utterly squashing you flat like a piece of cloth between them. Chelsea giggled, grinding one sole against the other in circular motion. She did this for a minute before lowering her feet into her regular sleeping position. You felt yourself rip off of one sole but at the same time adhere even tighter to the other. Her foot returned to its perch directly above your bed as you were forced to look out from the perspective of an insole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah some peace and quiet, perfect.\" Chelsea said in the same sarcastic tone meant to make fun of you. She broke character right after, however, saying more clearly, \"I'll get you off in 5 more minutes, John, I just gotta rest my eyes for a second.\" You gulped with fear, knowing the extent of Chelsea's laziness would almost surely result in you staying on this foot-prison for much longer than you had hoped. You attempted to wiggle furiously, but it was to no avail. After no more than 30 seconds of attempted escape on your part, you heard audible snoring bellow out from far above you. You mentally facepalmed, knowing that Chelsea had fallen fast asleep, and from the looks of it, you were along for the ride. You resign yourself to this current fate, taking the time to appreciate the fact that Chelsea's foot was at least sticking out from under the covers and giving you fresh air. Almost as a direct response to your thought, Chelsea shuffled slightly and flipped the sheets back over your bed and her feet. Immediately you were cast into darkness as temperatures began to skyrocket. At this point you could only pray that Chelsea would remember all this when she woke up, and even if she did would she be in too playful of a mood to let you free or would she show you mercy?</span></div></div>",

She finished eating and then went back into the room to change, you got treated to stepping on her discarded panties as she put on new ones and then sat down on her bed lifting you up to talk to you again. \"so, you're probably wondering what I wanted help with, well, my new insole hasn't come in yet and the old ones in my running shoes are really worn out, they should be in today but... well I need to go on my morning jog and you were already buddied up.\" and with her explanation out of the way she slipped some socks on over you and started walking again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could feel her foot slip into the shoe and stomp down and smash you even farther as she headed out the door to start her jog.</span></div></div>",

Before you could think of something Chelsea walked into the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Mrs. Hurtz\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nyour mother interrupted her \" Dear what have I told you call me Madison\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Right so you want to know about our business I can tell you all about it\" Chelsea put on a sly grin and winked at you \" John get us some tea I'll tell Madison how we do business in the next room\" you wanted to protest but your mother had already taken the hint and walked into the living room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you gonna tell her.\" you whispered and Chelsea grinned and leaned down to your level her breasts hung in your field of view.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" I have the perfect cover, I'm going to tell her we rent out gummy materials for various purposes but only for one week at a time, that way it matches up with our actual business model  she would't suspect a thing.\"  Chelsea explained and raised back to her full height. \"Now if your done staring at my tits, I'm going to talk to your mom cause you wouldn't get even half of that out before you end up under her butt or shoe.\" you wanted to protest but she was right your mother was not the most observent of people.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nyou sigh and go poor some tea which takes a little bit but you're accustomed to the effort and you carry the tea in for your mother and partner. Madison Hurtz was a healthy woman in her mid Forties with long curly brown hair and she keeps a tight watch on her figure so her assets are impressive but not quite as large as Chelsea as your mother only stands 5 foot 6 inches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"-And our costomers use the matirial for whatever they want, bras, insoles, panties, stress balls, skirts, and exsetera, then they bring it back after a week or less if they only wanted to try it.\" Chelsea finished explaining to your mother just as you opend the door. Chelsea spotted you and grabbed the tea while you pulled up you own seat. your mother looked thoughtful for a moment and then smiled like she had an idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" I'd like to rent some of your matirial then, for the maximum time if I'm allowed\" your mother stated simply and you almost spit your drink out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure you want to do that Madison, I thought you didn't like gummy stuff.\" Chelsea tried to rationalize.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's only because I'm usually worried that i've stepped on my son and I don't see why I shouldn't, I'd like to support my son's buisness\" Madison said placing her hands on the table.

An insole was the best option you could get, Chelsea?! Do you understand how smelly my mom's old shoes are!?\" You were a bit annoyed with Chelsea's handling of the situation.

Plus, she didn't even know it was going to be her son under her left foot the entire week so there was no chance of her taking it easy on you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry John, I don't know what to tell you. I already said yes for you soooo.....\" Chelsea drifted off without finishing her sentence as you looked up and saw her gigantic foot, dwarfing you underneath its shadow, \"we probably shouldn't keep her waiting, ya know?\" As Chelsea finished her statement so matter-of-factly, her foot effortlessly squished your diminutive, 1 foot stature with tremendous force. She grimaced a bit as she felt your body squish under her sole and between her toes a bit. No matter how many times she squashed you it always felt a little strange feeling your gummy form contour and flatten to the body part she stomped you with. She lifted her foot and saw your face looking up sadly at her. \"Haha, you always look like a little cartoon when you get squished. It's pretty funny. But hey nice work! You look like an insole pretty much immediately!\" Chelsea finished saying and flipped to show you yourself in the mirror. You had to agree with her, your body flattened out under her large sole exactly the way she wanted it to. Just then Chelsea realized something,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh shit, wait we can't give you to her with your face like this. She'll recognize her own son immediately.\" Chelsea said worriedly, trying to think of a solution. As she did she began to nonchalantly toss you up and down in her hands, forgetting you were the insole she was holding briefly. After a few more moments of thinking, a lightbulb clicked on in her brain. \"I got it!\" she exclaimed as she set you down. She returned in a moment with a makeup bag as she roughly picked you up again. You saw Chelsea grab a large brush and package of tan foundation. Soon enough she looked at you and said, \"No turning back now\" and began brushing all over your face. In a few quick moments a large smile grew on her face as she flipped you around to face the mirror yet again. You weren't entirely sure how you retained your sense of sight underneath all this makeup but what you saw in the mirror was horrifying. You looked exactly like a tan insole. There wasn't a trace of human left visible. Mentally you applauded Chelsea's work but at the same time you feared for the suffering that was coming next. On cue Chelsea set down her makeup and walked back into the living room where your family was hanging out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here you go, Madison! One gummy left shoe insole, yours to use!\" Chelsea said happily to your mother as handed you over. You looked up at your mother and saw her eyes light up. She was evidently very excited to replace the missing insole, obviously unaware that her replacement was her only son! Quickly she slipped off her worn out left sneaker and held you over it. Your sense of smell was immediately assaulted as you felt the warm, pungent odor pierce your nostrils. You had no time to process this assault as your mom roughly slammed your body into her shoe. In a split second you deeply regretted your choice of business venture, but there was nothing you could do about it now. For the next week you were basically wouldn't be a human being anymore. You were quite literally an object whose only purpose was to provide support to your giantess (in comparison to you) mother's foot. As you were growing accustomed to the dank, thick, smelly environment that would be your temporary home, the small bit of light shining through was blocked out. In its place lay the 5 wiggling toes of your mother's left foot. You mentally gulped as her car sized foot slid into her shoe, feeling the already cramped space get even tighter. The sole of her foot settled right on your covered up face as her toes wiggled happily. You felt your body contour to every line of her foot, adjusting to be a perfect fit immediately. Briefly you took a moment to pause and think about the fact that you really were perfect for this line of work, almost like it was your destiny to be an item rather than a person. You shook off these morbid thoughts though as you heard your mother exclaim, albeit muffled from your perspective.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow this is absolutely incredible. It feels perfectly broken in yet supportive at the same time! It even feels like it's absorbing my foot's sweat immediately! I love it!\" your mother was thoroughly impressed by her new insole. She never knew just how effective gummy material was! Just then she continued, \"This is so amazing, I think I need to replace my right shoe's insole with one as well! You have to have some more gummy material right?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChelsea's eyes widened and she began to sweat, trying to think on her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, uhh about that Madison...\"</span></div></div>",

I'll try and come up with some other solution. This material is malleable and I could shape it however I want while I'm renting it for the week, right?\" Your heart sunk as you imagined what your mother could possibly have in mind. Hopefully Chelsea explains that your mother should not remold the gummy for insurance purposes or some other excuse that will save you from getting lost.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep, feel free to mold it or use it for whatever you'd like for the rest of the week! We pride our gummy material on being supremely absorbent of sweat and odor and also providing maximum comfort and malleability for any purpose!\" Chelsea beamed giving the typical sales pitch she's given dozens of times. It wasn't until right after she said this that she remembered you wouldn't want to be used for anything horrible with your own mother. 'Oops,' Chelsea thought 'I'm sure he'll be fine, Madison won't want to move little John around he's too comfortable as her insole.' Chelsea shrugged off her mistake giving herself affirmation in her decision to let your mother use you however she wanted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fantastic Chelsea I'll be sure to give your gummy back by next week then. Thanks again!\" You felt your smelly home begin to shift as your mother walked towards the door. Squish after squish flattened you into the worn sneaker, every step purging sweat from the bottom of the shoe washing it over your flat body and face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon arriving home, your mother actually took you out of the shoe. She looks you over stroking your gummy body. \"Maybe I was wrong about gummy material. I could use this for tons of things....\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You were now less concerned with being found as your mom had found a pair of fabric scissors and was bringing them close, you tried to wiggle but her and was holding you down. *Snip!* It didn't hurt nearly as much as you suspected but now you were in half, you noticed your tongue was only on the bottom half from where she had snipped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"now I can have that supportive feeling under both feet for my trip to Disney,\" she said to herself as she slid your two pieces into her well worn shoes\" Girls! we're going\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'Oh god Disney, she's gonna be on her feet the whole time! not to mention my sister's will be there, I'd better make double sure not to get discovered and just hope mom doesn't mention my business to them.</i>you could hear thudding right before the familiar socked feet smashed you into place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey mom, wern't you gonna get 'big' bro to come with us?

I'm so gonna squish him to something dumb next time I see him.\" Allie complained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Alissa! don't threaten your brother like that, he loves you and I'm sure that he's bought you something very special with all the money he's going to make and besides your actual birthday isn't for another two weeks young lady. Now hurry up with your bags Susan is waiting for us with Heather.\" your mother said stepping out onto the warm concrete heating your back and causing just the slightest bit of sweat to form on your taste buds. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusan is your oldest sister at twenty-five standing head above your mother and other sister's at six foot one. She has strait brown hair that she let get incredibly long and she as the same proportions as your mother but they appear smaller on her larger frame.Susan was the sister you hoped most to avoid ever since you were both very young she has thought it was funny when you got into the worst situations, often when you were stuck for more than a week at at time it was Susan's fault.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeather was your 'nice' sister she was two years younger at twenty-two. Heather, everyone says, inherited all the best looks from both sides of the family she keeps her strait blond hair short and she's all around 'bigger' than you mother but she is constantly worried that she's gaining to much wight so she tries to workout every chance she can but mostly dose yoga and stuff like that. she was nice and always helped you when she found you squished and such but she was kind of ditsy and would just not notice you most of the time. Heather was actually the one who gave you the idea to start your business she would sometimes ask you for permission to do some stuff and explained her reasoning and eventually you agreed to some of it but she always respected your decision when you said no.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA short car ride, and a long walk and you were in the air port. you had a moment of rest as you had to be passed though the scanner thankfully to the machine you were nothing more than a set of insoles and you were right back under Madison's feet for the rest of the ride.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter you touched down and your family were checked into the hotel room your mother decided to go for a jog to stretch after a long flight unfortunately for you, had managed to fall asleep on the plain without much pressure on you so you were awoken to heavy foot falls and sweat on your tongue.</span></div></div>",

Think about it if your son had just walked up to you and said 'hey mom, this girl I care about is missing and insole so I offered to replace it till she can get a new one.' That would be like a contradiction to everything he tried to avoid as a kid. plus he said he didn't want his sister's bugging him to give them a discount or something like that.\" You couldn't hear all of what she said but most of what she said was right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison tapped her foot in thought, unintentionally jostling her son causing you to not hear what she said, \" well when you put it like that it makes sense, I suppose if it is really what he wants then I'll keep my reservation and John can stay my insole until I buy some new ones next week, he really is comfortable.\" she said thinking about you in a whole new light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well um I guess have fun with a little man in your shoe.\" Chelsea replied dumbly almost in shock from Madison's interpretation of what she said. Madison then happily skipped out the door and it felt like she put extra emphasis on stomping your shoe. You were confused at where she was going did your mom intend to keep you even though she knew it was you?!  On the drive home you got your answer,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" John I can't say that I understand why your doing this but since this is what you wanted I'll give you the full insole experience, I go to the gym on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday so I guess you'll be joining me and don't think I'll be taking it easy you know I have to stand all day at work as well. God I forgot how comfortable you were under my feet, now that I know you wanted to do this for me I can just bask in how good this feels.\" She moaned sending a shiver down your spine, this was about the opposite of what you wanted, not only were you going to be under your mom's smelly feet all week without her taking it easy on you but now she was going even harder because she thinks you want to support her foot. well you guessed you only have yourself to blame and you could relax for now it was only... Crap it's Monday today and the beginning of the day at that! Madison must be on her way to work now, think where dose she work it was, as a tour guide she really was going to be on her feet, and her son, all day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe smelly sweaty shoe that encompassed your world was on the move now slamming you down and lifting you up, not that you weren't used to this kind of stuff but of all the feet you had the displeasure of being under your mother's had to be one of the smelliest, seconding only to a pair of boots that she owned from the days when she was a party girl. You could faintly hear your mother giving the tour speech several times but you couldn't help but over hear her conversations when she stopped moving to try and distract yourself from having to drink up the foot sweat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Owie, my feet hurt\" you could hear the voice of a younger woman say. \" how do you just keep going like you do Madison\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I've been doing this for a long time but if your feet still hurt in a few weeks of working here look up my son's business, he provides wonderful service and his name is John with my last name.\" Madison said, well she was drumming up business for you even if it was as an insole for this girl you didn't know.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrue to her word after work she headed off to the gym and you got so soak in more sweat and it seamed like your mom had started to recommend your services to all of her gym friends without actually telling them what you did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nall in all besides the legendary stink the week under your mother wasn't as bad as it could have been and she didn't even tell your sister's about it. soon you were being handed back to Chelsea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"oh god, Madison did you wash him at all.\" Chelsea coughed<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"of course not silly he was my insole he spent the whole week inside my shoe\" your mother laughed  and Chelsea shrugged. you were allowed to reform and washed yourself of the horrid smell, thankfully your body's natural scent quickly over took it.

You got out of bed, not a moment sooner too. As a step forward, your predictions were correct, Chelsea's foot dropped down on your tiny bed, breaking the little thing in half, as she remained asleep peacefully without any knowledge. You watched as her foot lift back into the sheets as she groans, turning over, with bits of your bed falling off her sole, you got a bit upset since the business hasn't been so great lately and are unable to afford a new one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sighed profoundly blowing off steam that was festering inside you just now, with not much to be said when the person to argue against is gigantic compared to your tiny form, you decided to leave it be and get some breakfast. Traversing the apartment floor was strenuous as ever with the massive piles of unwashed clothes, Chelsea threw around made another reminder of your current living arrangements. You approached the kitchen cabinet, climbing the poorly strung together ladder made of match sticks, and heading over to the spilled box of cereal. You chewed on a piece of cheerio that was more than enough of a meal to fill your stomach, only wishing to have a little milk to wash it down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe loud bustling footsteps of Chelsea shook your entire body as she walked past with laze scratching herself, finally awake, wearing nothing at all. You visibly blushed regarding Chelsea being in a relaxed manner, her sensual body gleaming in the sunlight as she exited the bathroom, brushing her teeth with one hand, digging through the mounds of clothes for something clean to wear using the other. You knew it was mostly sweat giving her the shine, and the reason she was currently nude since last night was unbearable hot. Chelsea started to grow closer to were you now resigned, and knowing her temper if she caught you spying at her naked, you were in a world of hurt. You hadn't much time as the ladder was yards away. You looked over the counter, eyeing a pile of her clothes to land on safely, without many options you jumped, screaming as the wind blew you around like paper, but falling in the designated target.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou opened your eyes, gasping with the thought of being hurt. However, forgetting your invincibility, you glared at your surroundings, breathing in the noxious fumes. \"Come on,\" you choked, covering your mouth, recognizing you landed in a set of her panties of all places, without much time even to escape you raised into the air with the pair falling back into a wet spot of Chelsea's lingering body fluids. Outside Chelsea sniffed the set you refuged in slipping one leg in then proceeding with the other and forcing them upwards past her thighs. You shouted up to Chelsea, begging her to stop a moment as her nether region grew in your view, and with one might tug, you where plastered between her bottom lips tightly with no room to move or breathe as the air thickened with tangy taste odor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChelsea felt a slight itch brewing between sex. She certainly wasn't in the mood currently, so that left her only one other understanding as she reached inside, pulling out her tiny roommate. \"What the hell! Why are you resting my dirty underwear? I assumed you were sleeping still in your bed?\" she asked with a raised eyebrow, genuinely upset at her perv flatmate. \"It's not like that! I woke up to your stinky foot in my face and went to get some breakfast honest,\" you recounted to Chelsea, as her hand began to squeeze the air out of you. \"I guess I can believe that?\" she stated, dropping you on the table with a heavy splat, \"But listen, John, we need to talk about our living conditions. At this point, I don't think we will make rent?\" she clarified as she pulled over a size two small rocker shirt over her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know!\" you agreed with her looking at the state of the apartment, \"I was thinking...\" you were about given an idea when Chelsea already began opening her laptop. \"I had been too, and I've taken this online course to make a website. Well, was taking  I might have dropped out after two weeks,\" Chelsea said, carrying it over to show you. The laptop hovered right over you. The heat of the fan almost melted you there, but luckily you ran in time dodging the incoming disaster. You hosted yourself up to see the screen, which right away looked to be produced poorly except you couldn't let Chelsea know that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh,\" being astonished by the horrors viewed before your eyes, it the only thing you could express. Even though you were not impressed, Chelsea felt proud of her accomplishment, \"So I set us up a home page linked to a private Facebook account where people can message me. It'll then take data from people's accounts from search history based on squishy people and refers to them to us, won't it be great,\" she smiled expressing. You glanced at the subscriber count already at a hundred, and twenty-two people likes and growing. \"Yeah\" you faked laughed \"Except a lot of these people don't look like our usual past customers is all,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChelsea gave you the most prominent puppy dog eyes she muster, which quickly made you persuade into trying out her idea. \"Ok, fine, we can give it a shot for a few buyers?\" you huffed under your breath, \"So who are some of the people asking!\" Chelsea smiled, \"Good, I'm glad you see it my way. These people are gonna pay alotof money to rent you!\" she boasted, \"Well, the first girl looking for you to be a pair of insoles for her upcoming marathon. Supposedly one of her friends talked bout an incident where a gummy person got in there shoes. Next, is some gamer teenager wanting to discuss about you being a set of panties for them?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first two girls already didn't sit well in your stomach as you walked away to relax. Chelsea began to name off two more. \"Oh, here's a rich single woman looking for you to be an accessory in a fashion show she's holding, and this other one from a wealthy man wanting you to be a swimsuit for a lavish gathering party for their trophy wife.\" Chelsea giggled before she went dead silent to the lastest message, \"WOW! Look at this! Some lady willing to pay 20,000 to own you for two weeks,\" Chelsea gasped. \"TWO WEEKS!\" you quickly ran to see the buyer, your golden rule was only a week-long buyout, but twenty thousand dollars was not something you probably pass by for right now. \"Chelsea!\" you screamed at her, \"Did you not look at the client! THAT'S MY MOM!\". Chelsea blushed as she remained casual, \"Ture, but she doesn't know it's you? We can wear a disguise she'll never find out\". You couldn't believe how casual Chelsea was to these customers giving out requests you weren't comfortable with until you remembered why you were doing this in the first place. maybe give one a shot and see how it goes from there. \"Ok, Chelsea will try one out and go from there...</span></div></div>",

I got the days mixed up and we need to pay NOW not next week. Thank god we got that up front. Okay, alright, I'll go take care of this and be back in time for the tail end, I've already got her contact info and everything so if you figure everything out before I'm back I can pick you up at the end of her time.\" She was already shoving her shoes on and opening the door before you could even protest about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chelsea how long...\" And she was gone. well crap, you could do negotiations but how could you manage that when you didn't know how long you were going for and what she expected... maybe you could tell her to wait for- *DING DONG*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo much for that, you just hoped you could be convincing to this girl or at least stall her until your 'enforcer' got back. You didn't let the door ring a second time and managed to buzz her in from your spot on the couch. You swallowed a little when you saw her, glistening with sweat and dressed in workout gear, tight compression shorts, sports bra, long white socks she was chugging water when the door swung open. She stepped in briskly and scanned the room to find you waving. \"Oh hey~ I thought the girl was gonna be here to talk about how I wanted to do this?\" She sounded genuinely interested and non-malicious<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou chuckled nervously \"Well, she had to step out. I'm the one that's going to be doing the job anyhow so you know. I might as well be the one cutting deals with how we do this.\" She perused her lips like she thought she could ask something of Chelsea that she couldn't ask you to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sooo, I get to choose how to mash you up right? Like where your face and stuff goes.\" She blushed asking you as if actually discussing this with you embarrassed her. It actually made you feel a lot better about it and answering her honestly and not stalling  was made that much easier as she made herself that much cuter in your eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeh, I know some girls that would rather face me away from them or specifically having my face towards them.\" You shrugged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe nodded and got closer. \"And you're totally fine with this? Like, being my Insoles and you're not gonna like, yell at me and try and sue me or something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't exactly want to go with  this type of client but you had been offering yourself up so the practiced answer you could give... \"As long as none of the set out conditions from when you signed up with Chelsea are broken I've waived any rights to sue. Now if you do break the rules Chelsea will be on you like white on rice but other than that you're totally fine.\" She was now sitting next to you and kicking off her shoes. Steam rose from them but the socks and shoes looked clean and new, you had smelled worse in fact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh thank gawd! I was so worried, I need this edge to beat my Rival, I know her brother agreed to help her so If I don't match her advantage for advantage she's gonna steam roll me. Let's get started then.\" She seemed to have gotten over her nervousness and reached out to grab you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wa-\" You weren't able to stop her before she squeezed the air out of you and started flattening you out with her hand paying special attention for some reason to your face, but she got to talking while she did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like I wasn't sure at first if I should go for this cause I didn't want to have it be like, a guy that wasn't into it or whatever but I guess I am paying for the privilege.\" She explained while working her fingers on your mouth to pull your tongue out. \"I can't be sure but Bella, that's my Rival right, she has a squishy brother so she would know, says that the worse it is for the squishy the better you end up performing. So like when I messaged your girl and she was cool I didn't know if you would be cool so you really put me at ease here. Especially since you're going in like both.\" You tried to wiggle around to let her know that she was misguided for that first part but it was the second part that made your blood run cold. You had been 'divided' a few times before and it wasn't pleasant, the sensations stayed with you but if your other half got too far away... you were gonna loose some height. You can't believe Chelsea would have just agreed to everything this chick wanted without thinking about it! The more pressing issue at the moment though... she wanted to make it as uncomfortable as possible for you which usually meant pain of some sort and she had already yanked your tongue out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe twisting was new, nobody had ever thought twisting you apart would have worked before but she was doing it right at your waist and surprisingly it worked much sooner and with much less pain than you would have thought. You realized immediately what she was thinking though as she worked your halves into the 'feet' shapes to make sure your crotch was directly under the ball of her foot and graciously she let your eyes see out of the heel of the other one. You made one final push to protest her as the wave of steam actually hit you from her shoes, now that you were close you could see the faint indent on the white insole. She of course hardly noticed your movement and continued to insert you into her shoe. \"Okay so, time to test you out. oh god I feel awkward talking to you when you're like this. Umm, I think I'll not cause I don't want anyone to know and like enjoy your week I guess? I don't know how you're into this but I'm hoping it helps at least.\" Wait a week! She was renting for the MAX time and the marathon was probably at the end of it! She started inserting her foot back into the shoe and you hoped Chelsea could come back and save you in that moment but sadly all you got was the socked foot pressing you tightly filing your mouth with the taste of her sweat and finally the intence smell of her foot. It wasn't that bad, you had worse but it totally dominated your sense of taste and smell. On the other hand you felt her left foot slide into place over your lower half gently pressing down until she stood up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith her weight brought to bare and how athletic she was you could practically feel the shift of her muscles as the ball of her right foot pressed into your tongue. It was painful but any thought of that was obliterated when her left foot lifted off, mashing your crotch under it and having you knowing this week would be one of the worst you had ever experienced if someone didn't save you soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohh, That does feel different! I hope I see some improvement as I train.\" She drummed her toes as she stood at the door which unfortunately for you did feel rather nice, her toes were apparently able to lightly massage your dick even if her steps were crushing the important bit. Just as she went to step out though the voice of salvation reached you, although Chelsea had been failing you could still hope.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Gloria, done already? I figured the talks would take longer.\" She asked without truly asking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tanned athlete smiled genuinely. \"Yep, he said he was cool with it so I'm getting back to training, He already feels great.\" She started to jog in place, making you overwhelmed with the pain so much so that you couldn't hear the next part of the conversation, you couldn't even tell if she started moving or if she was just smashing you in her light fake jog.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>With permission of the previous author:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh look, it's another  possible clients, and she even would take you for as long as possible in heir service!\" she shouted excitedly. <br>\r\nIn your mind that was on the one hand  indeed a good thing, concerning your chronic lack of money. \"Hmm maybe i should take riskier jobs for the purpose of bringing food on the table.\" you thought absent minded while your friend read the remaining service conditions at the end of the mail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well this sounds very promising\" she said . She picked you up softly and caring as she was, so you had a clear view on the laptop screen.<br>\r\nWhat you saw, made you swallow hard:<br>\r\nIt was an tall, extremly curvy woman in her early 30s in a very tight (not to say skintight) black bikini with blond hair reaching up to her shoulders. She had a pretty face with shining big blue eyes and a smile every man would melt for. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was Elvira, the older sister of your former student exchange partner, Agathe (Agy) from Germany.<br>\r\nWith fear you thought back to this journey mostly because of this woman and her sister Agathe, a curvy cherry-red headed woman with long hair and a body most woman would die for: She was nearly as curvy as her older sister with a cleavage you could drown in and an ass so big most chairs in the public might be a little to tight for her  ( which you unfortunately  witnessed under her in a cafe, joining her and her friends for 3 hours! Which happened a few times on this trip, not only because she was imitating her older sisters style to dress, which meant in general:  low cut tops, and much skin to see whenever possible for her without her going \"against good morals\" since they lived in a small town in the nowhere of Bavaria, in the south of Germany. It was also the first time in your life when you came in contact with alcohol, especially during the Oktoberfest, which you experienced  squashed in Elvira\u2019s much too tight, nearly bursting Dirndl. What made matters worse was the fact that anytime she spilled beer, it landed right on her huge stuffed cleavage, the beer running down her huge breasts, finding his way into your mouth and all over you (which made you wonder if you absorbed some of the alcohol with your skin) while getting more and more crushed and drunk with Elvira jumping, drinking and singing with her friends.  Being that drunk made it even more difficult to communicate with them for you,  and leading to even worse outcomes of communication.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth of them seemed to have the strange idea that there was literally no option to squashing you or turning you into their clothes to stay \u201csafe\u201d with them. This might have been partly your fault, since you didn\u2019t speak the language very well.<br>\r\nMostly these accidents were a result of a huge language barrier, since you didnt speak any german and they spoke rarely English, but they were claiming that they understood you mostly well. In general you couldn\u2019t find out much of these two girls personalities, since you only stayed for one week, mostly squashed by their curves. But you couldn\u2019t help and think that Agy knew more English than she admitted. While you read her mail, you shuddered even more since she planned on going on vacation in Hungary with you joining her as her Bikini bottom. \u201cDid they find about your business or is this just a strange coincidence\u201d? You wondered. \u201cWhat would they make out of this, since they already thought you are treated like a bra, thong, cushion for safekeeping even before they found your website?\u201d your thoughts were running through your head. \u201c I don\u2019t have to do this crazy trip first to Germany and after that with heir (or them?) to Hungary\u201d you calmed yourself down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c WOW Europe\u2026 I really envy you for such a nice destination\u201d Chelsea suddenly said. \u201c But I don\u2019t think it will turn out profitable with all the costs the vacation adds to our normal running costs, unless we ask her to take you even longer\u201d she smiled at you enthusiastically. \u201cLets see what my calculation program says about the amount of time for this job!\u201d<br>\r\n You were just shocked about your good friends reaction, was she really throwing all your safety principels like the maximum of a week or the distance out of the window, just to make more money??<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that she grabbed you from the laptop keybord, unfortunately closing her first around you, which made it impossible for you to protest, and tipping something in the program. <br>\r\nAfter a never ending moment of fear and tension the computer showed the outcome of the calculation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1) 3 Weeks from now it is, this includes being in Germany in October...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2) The System showed an error when Chelsea tried to book the order, but what kind of error ( does the system protect you or is it somehow even worse?)<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You reformed and got dressed reluctantly walking out of your room to observe the girl who was sharing your apartment. Still in nothing but a long T-shirt and panties that barley covered her expansive booty she was cooking breakfast she was Candice Love a collage freshman like you, and some would think she is the perfect girl, but they didn't know her like you did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are Jesse Iron: 20 years old, Born with an Ironic name and Three older sisters you had been about as successful as you could be, standing only two and a half feet tall and a body that buckled under pressure. You managed to get into a nice collage on scholarship, due in part to you 'disability' and you hoped you could start a 'new' life without all the things that you normally dealt with, unfortunately it wasn't meant to be. at first everything seemed to be going alright baring the science teacher who seamed like she had an unhealthy(for you) interest in you and the hottest girl in your class wanted to talk to you in the first week, but as luck would have it that girl is Candice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCandice Love: 20 years old and smoking hot. She has long dark red hair, with green eyes, nice big DD boobs, and a booty that puts them to shame. she isn't all that tall being only around 5'2\" but that's more than double your own height, she would be a great girlfriend if it wasn't for one little personality quirk. Candice is really into S&amp;M and she doesn't exactly give you a choice in weather or not to participate, a partner that will not break no matter what you put them through is hard to come by and you find it hard to argue with her. She wants to really test the boundaries of what you can take and she always gets super hot when she's squishing you. You got swept into this 'relationship' with Candice and you haven't worked up the courage to try and leave, no telling what she would do to you then.</span></div></div>",

If you have any questions, message me, or Derp, and we will try to help you if we can. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah Mcbride (17), after an incident involving a sick, not so ordinary girl from her school, Sarah caught some kind of virus or flu from her on the last day of her year in highschool. The next morning, she wakes up to find herself squishy and malleable. She lives with her oblivious mother Ellis (36), her father Price (37)... but he's often away on business for some clothing factory. She also lives with her devil of a twin sister Kasey (17), and her perverted little brother John (13). Her best friends are Ashely Williams (16) and Jane Priest (17). <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThomas Malthus(41) lived a moderately normal life for being 2ft tall and being extremely malleable. Ever since he was adopted at the young age of 7, he never found out who his parents were. As a kid, his foster-family treated him like an actual human being, and never took advantage of his squishy form. Skipping toward 32 years, Thomas(41) had married his long time girlfriend Mckayla Jacobson(39) and had two kids: Ryan(14) and a spoiled-rotten girl named Vicky(17). Luckily, his condition never passed onto his kids. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen Peterson(18) was born with ability to be squished, frozen, liquidated, and even baked into other things. With a bit of luck, he managed to survive being underfoot a family of giants. Due to his condition (and constantly losing part of his mass in accidents), he averages out at about a foot tall. He never let that stop him though, and he started to date his best friend Talia(19). He lives with his father Max Peterson(37) and his step-mother Catherine(28), though they are leaving for a vacation without him in London, England, leaving him with his annoying step-brother Chris(10).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrinity Wakeman(42) is a mother that supports her two kids Amanda(12) and Harley(16) by working full-time at a clothing factory for Harper\u2019s Gummy Works as a Gummy inspector. Her husband Alex(40) works at the same factory, but works in management. Her best friends are Becky Gilmore(37) and Stacy Alexander(26). One day she touched a gummy orb that was \u201csweating\u201d with her bare hands on accident. Next morning, she hand found herself to be very malleable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few rules before we start:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPLEASE use proper grammar. I could tell you how many times I've been reading a story like this and see \u201cShe fond u, and now u her slave\u201d and end the story off there. I mean, I see what you were trying to go for, but don't be that guy. Nobody likes that guy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlease, no one sentence chapters. Unless of course it's a bridging chapter. (do try to limit those)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharacters can not die. Simple as that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo links please... It gets kinda aggravating. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStory is rated 18+ so yeah... fair warning. I'm cool with just about anything.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</td>",
