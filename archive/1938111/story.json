            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It is a warm summer day, you are Steve, 19 years old, and in your last year of school. Your best friend is named Tom, who you also go to school with. He is of your age and has a brother, Josh, who just turned 16. Tom really is a good guy and you come along with him pretty well, but you can not stand his brother and often you ask yourself how brothers could be so different. Tom is a nice, gentle guy who is friendly to everybody he knows, while Josh behaves like a selfish, arrogant prick that likes picking on people whenever he feals like it and, having his looks and knowing it, is popular with the girls, who seem to find his toughness attractive. Often Tom would stand up for people Josh is picking on, and they would have quarrels. When you see this, you frequently think Josh is an idiot, that needs to be tought a lesson.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, it is a friday after school, Tom is sick, and as you leave the school you see his brother waiting for you in front of the gate. 'Hey Steve', he sais. You kind of didn't like the idea, that he wants to talk to you and don't stop your walk, while saying 'Sorry Josh, no time. A friend of my is gonna visit me at my place in a few minutes.', but he follows you and sais 'That's no problem, I'm not gonna stay at your place for long.'. As you look at him a little puzzled he kind of grins and explains 'You know my brother is sick, and he asked me to go over to your place and borrow a book of yours for a homework he has to write.'. 'Which one?' You ask. 'That one about great britain and world war two.' 'OK, come with me, I'll give it to you' You say, as you know Tom writes a paper on Winston Churchill and you have at least two books that partly cover the topic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the ten minutes walk to your parents house you don't talk a word. You kind of feel uncomfortable having this bully, who you despise with all your senses at your home, and you know exactly that he also despises you, because you are not a mindless self-centered idiot like himself. That you just lied to him about a friend coming for a visit, and the fact that you parents aren't at home doesn't help to make you feel better either, but not helping Tom iss not an option. As he walks next to you, you can not help but recognize the shape of his body. He does not have giant weight-lifter muscles, but is of average height just like you, maybe 1.80, slim and athletic with broad sholders, well defined muscles on arms and legs and, as far as you can see from a glimpse, also on his chest. A functional, energetic, young body, you think. Tanned skin, curly, brown hair and dark eyes. You can understand why he the girls like his appearance. As it is a hot summer day, he is barefoot and weared flip-flops, and you realize that he hobbles a little bit while walking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'OK, here we are. Wait a second, I'll go upstairs and look for the book.' you say. You figure, that letting him wait outside is the first step for getting rid of him as quickly as possible, but he makes clear that it wouldn't work out. 'Aaw man, can't you let me in for just a second? I hurt my ankle yesterday playing basketball and it would be great to sit down for a second.'<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Sit down in the living room, I'll be right back.' you say, close the door behind him and go to my room. You look for the two books you want to give him, find them and leave your room again. 'Now get him out of here as quickly as possible...' you think, and realize that this scenario really makes you feel uneasy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you enter the living room, Josh is sitting on the couch, his flip-flopped feet on the table and a glass of cola in his hand. At first you can't believe what you see and all of a sudden you feel that you look pretty stupid as you stare at him, the books in your hand. 'Sorry man, but my ankle hurts so bad I just had to ease the pressure on it a little. And as I got thirsty, I thought it would surely be no problem if I went to the fridge and got me a drink. You know, it's awfully hot in here. Don't you guys have an air conditioning, Stevie?' he says, leans his upper body forward in your direction and grins. As you can see now, he really must have sweated a lot, for his back left a wet patch on the couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look at Josh who grins self-confidently, while you think about your next move.

You decide it's not worth the hassle, just the be polite and get him out the house as soon as possible. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPutting the books down on the table. You walk to the kitchen. Open the fridge and scan its contents. Grab the first thing drink you see, a can of 7-UP. Returning the living room the see Josh as made himself comfortable. His T-shirt thrown across the other side of the couch, before you can make a comment though Josh tells you 'No, I don't like 7-UP. Get me a Coke.' Gesturing to the empty Cola glass on the table, next to his feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stare blankly at him for a moment. Is this guy for real? Whatever. Still not worth the hassle. Before you go you pick up the empty glass, you repeat the procedure, this time taking a can of coke out, after returning the 7-UP, washing out the glass and pouring the coke in. You return to Josh. 'Here' holding out the glass for him. He doesn't even look your way, too busy staring and the ceiling with that smug look on his face. 'Table.' Josh bluntly replies. Biting your tongue you place the coke on the table. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou find you don't know what to do with yourself. You don't trust him on the room on his own but him and his t-shirt are taking up the couch. You should just move the t-shirt, but it's his. Then it hits you, you're<b> scared</b> of him. a 16-year old, 2 years your junior. It's not hard to see why his cocky attitude and his well toned physique ,that he is showing of to you. Still, he doesn't stop you feeling any less ashamed of yourself. Before you know it the better part of a minute as pasted and you're still just standing there, gawping at his six-pack. Panicking you start to think of something to say but Josh gets there first. 'Man, he foot is hella sore. You mind giving it a bit of a rub, Stevie?' <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWill you?</span></div></div>",

Now, rub my foot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven that pathetic victory didn't last even a minute. As you bring yourself to kneel before this ruthless bully. \"Good boy\" he taunts, with a chuckle. Trying to rise above it, you bring yourself to remove his flip-flops. Hitting a wall of stink from his feet causes you leap backwards. \"Oh, don't be such a pussy. Sure it smells bad, just get used to it.\" You bring yourself closer and getting to rubbing his damp, sweaty feet. Starting with the left one. You feel him staring at you the intensity of his gaze his burning through you. You try to ignore it by focusing on his feet. Anything about them, the way they look, the way they feel even the way they smell. Humiliating as it's less so than having to look Josh in the eye whilst performing this task. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Next.\" He says. After 10 minutes of serving his left foot. Stretching out he softly slaps you with his right foot. Waking you from your focus on his feet. You find yourself stunned once more, unable to find the words to call him out on touching your face with his disgusting foot. He laughs once more your motionless face, mouth slightly a gap. Slapping you again, harder this time. \"Come on, next.\" Josh repeats. This time you obey his command. If you somehow hadn't gone red in the face from embarrassment before and you are now. He won't stop pushing to see how far you'll bend for him. You draw the line after the foot rub. You tell yourself, then he goes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stevie, man. We should do this more often.\" Josh said, offhandedly. \"I thought we agreed you'd stop calling me that.\" I coldly replied. Proud I'd found my words. \"Oh, gimme a break. I'll call you what a want.\" Unable to think of a reply and remain silent. After a moment a stop massaging his foot. \"I didn't tell you to stop.\" Josh tells me, slightly rising his voice. As he flicks on the sports channel on the TV, putting the remote on the table. I remain still for only a fraction of a second before I return to rubbing my enemy's foot. \"Good boy\" I get once more, as a response. \"As I was saying we should do this more often, where are your parents? Out? For the weekend right? Bro told me. We should spent it getting to know each other. Now, bow down.\" Josh was constantly keeping me off-guard. I bowed to him. Gently replying \"Yes. bu-\" \"Good. Lower, still in the way. Boy.\" So I lowered myself further. My face more directly in front of his right foot, which was on top of his left.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe left me in silence for the remainder of the foot rub. Even in the awkward position I was in, once I let myself forget it was Josh's foot I was rubbing I managed to relax. Josh hadn't gave me any room to think. I still needed to protest him staying for the weekend. It would be a like a personal hell.</span></div></div>",

Sorry again.))<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh's foot stared at me as I rubbed it. This had been going on for a good hour now. Josh had seemingly forgotten about you by the time the game he was watching finished. \"Man, I'm hungry. What're you making Stevie?\" Without daring to look up you mutter into his foot that you were \"just gonna order in.\" \"I see, I think you should cook, you can cook right?\" \"Yeah.\" \"Then you can cook for me. Surprise me, just make it good. What you ain't got you go get at the store.\" realising you need to speak up <b>now</b> if you want him gone you manage to raise your eyes up to meet his. Seeing his smug grin, arms behind his head, showing off his abdomen, still somehow glistening with sweat. He looked so sure of himself. He knew he was going to get what he wanted. He knew you wouldn't stop bending for him if he kept the pressure on you. You resign yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Josh.\" you mutter, returning to his feet. Only for Josh to pull them away. Manoeuvre himself around the table, to your side. You turn your body to face him. Remaining on your knees before him. You find yourself flinching when he gets too close, but hold your ground. Craning your neck up to met his gaze hurts, his crotch his almost in your face when Josh asks \"So, you're just not going to stand up to me, huh?\" after letting those words sink in, you lower your eyes once more, settling for looking at his crotch. Josh chuckles \"good boy, now, I'm gonna take a piss. Where is toilet?\" Pointing behind you Josh lifts his foot and places it on your face. Still damp on your face after transferring so much of his sweat onto your hands. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kiss.\" you pucker up immediately. Josh slowly increases the pressure on your face until you begin falling backwards until he slams your head into the floor. Before walking past you. You lay still for a moment. Not sure what to make of what happened, before getting up to make Josh's Dinner. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You awake to the feeling of your mobile phone alarm clock vibrating on your face. You have always been a heavy sleeper, so it put you in quite a problematic situation, when Josh told you how he expected to be woken up by you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, he decided to take your bed. 'Thanks for letting me sleep in your bed, Stevie. I know the floor is hard and uncomfortable, so I really appreciate it.' You didn't push back. 'I know you would have offered me anyway, because you want me to understand how much you respect me, right?'. He loved playing this charade of bossing you around, taking your stuff, making you do demeaning things, and all the while acting like you were just two guys hanging out together. 'Yes, Josh...' He wasn't surprised by your answer, just took it as the way it was supposed to be. That was on Friday night, while he ate the dinner you prepared for him, and you were sitting on the floor at his feet listening to your growling stomach. At this point it was already more than obvious, that Josh could walk all over you and you would just take it. So he did. You slept on the floor next to your bed for two nights without fighting back, and on Sunday night Josh decided to push you even further than before. 'You know why you are sleeping on the floor buddy? I tell you why. That's because it's really important to you to have me know just how much you respect me, buddy. Because some guys are just better than other guys, and it's allright to face that fact. You know, Steven Hawking is better at thinking about physics-stuff than I am, and Jamie Oliver is better at cooking, and Usain Bolt is better at running really fast. Nothing wrong with admitting that. And although I'm two years younger than you, I already am just much, much better than you on every dimension imaginable, Stevie.' You didn't respond, because you just didn't know what to say. <br>\r\nSo Josh went on. 'But that's O.K., we can still be buddies, as long as you face the facts, behave accordingly, and show me the respect I deserve. First of all, you should be thankful that I let you sleep in the same room as I and don't just, you know, have you sleep in the bathtub or something. That's pretty nice of me, right. Now, tomorrow is a Monday. I hate Mondays, dude, and therefore I like my Mondays to start of especially well. So I thought of a nice way for you to make that happen, and at the same time show just how much you respect me.' You didn't like where this was going at all. 'Tomorrow morning you will wake me up by kissing the bottoms of my feet. That's going to feel really nice for me, and it'll be a perfect expression of the respect you have for me, for being so much better than you.' 'But... come on Josh. Do I really have to...' you tried to interrupt, but he just cut you off. 'Shut up dude. It's silent time for you when I am speaking. I want to be woken up by the feeling of your lips being pressed nicely and obediently against the bottoms of my dirty feet. That's what's going to wake me up tomorrow, and I don't want to hear an alarmclock going of. No idea how you are going to accomplish that, but I don't really care, figure it out yourself. Now, I have decided that I'm going to lock up the room for the night, because I don't want you walking around the house. I just think we aren't good enough buddies yet for you to have that privilege. So this is your final chance to go potty. Hush, dude.' <br>\r\nIt seems strange to think back to that situation now, but Josh had just established so much of his dominance over the course of the weekend, that you didn't even know how to deny these degrading orders. You rather felt relieved that it was only his feet, that he ordered you to kiss. Ashamed, you hung your head and walked to the bathroom as you were ordered, having Josh's chuckles in your ears only add to your humiliation. 'Hahahaha, you little twerp...'. When you were back in your room, he allowed you to take a blanket and a pillow to 'get comfy with', and you lay down right next to your bed. You took your phone out, turned on the alarm clock and set it to vibrate only. Then you put it on your forehead, so it would wake you up for sure, without making a lot of noise.<br>\r\nJosh locked the door and turned the light off. While walking from the door to your bed he took of his shirt, and just threw it around the room carelessly, before he stopped right next to where you were laying and looked down at you. 'How you feel, dude? Nice and comfy down there? Already looking forward to waking me up tomorrow?' You wanted to look away, but with your phone on your forehead you couldn't move without it falling down, so you had to look up at Josh standing there bare-chested, just grinning down at you. You felt unbelievably stupid. 'Sure dude, whatever...' You just wanted him to get in bed and finally leave you be for the night, but it didn't appear to be your choice. <br>\r\n'Yeah, of course you do, hahahaha... Look, I'm going to do you one last favour before going to sleep. So just close your eyes and wait for your surprise.' You quickly closed your eyes, not in order to obey him, but to take the chance to avoid the look of him towering above you. 'Right buddy. Gonna give you something to dream about now.' You barely had time to think about what that was supposed to mean. All you heard was what you now know to be the sound of fabric rubbing against skin and Josh's body moving. Then you felt something soft falling right on your nose, and all of a sudden you were overpowered by Josh's harsh, masculine scent. You didn't know what to do, and actually freezed up and went completely limp for the fracture of a second, before realizing that you had no choice but to lay still and just take it. You took another breath of the terrifying manscent and finally recognized what just happened. 'Yeah, that's what you like, ain't it buddy? You know I prefer to sleep naked, so why shouldn't I put my clothes to some other use during the night? Looking forward to tomorrow already, Stevie. Now just relax and smell my sweaty boxers, that'll give you something to dream about.' <br>\r\nYou didn't know what to respond at all, and just layed there, quietly sniffling to yourself for a moment. Josh didn't seem too pleased with this. 'Eh, you still awake? Or did my scent knock you out right away, dude?' he chuckled. 'No, I'm still awake, dude..' you barely managed to say. 'Yeah. Than thank me for sharing my scent with you.' Inadvertently you took another breath, answering 'Thank you, Josh.'. 'Hahahahaha, you little twerp.' With that he snuggled up under the bedspread, leaving you to yourself and his scent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the memory of the weekend still burning inside you you quickly turn of your vibrating mobile phone, in order to not wake up Josh. With a strange and unwanted, but yet undeniable sense of awe you realize that his boxers still smell as intense as they did yesterday, when he placed them on your nose. You can't tell why, but the realization is strangely humbling.<br>\r\nYou slowly sit up, your back aching from the uncomfortable night on the floor. Josh is still silently sleeping in your bed. Lying on his back, his feet look out from under the covers, wide and strong and dirty. The door is locked, you know what he expects from you, his scent is still in your system.<br>\r\nIt's Monday morning, and Josh wishes to be woken up by you. School starts soon. What are you going to do?</span></div></div>",

And there's only one way to convince him that you dare. You get up on your knees, and position yourself in front of your bed. Josh is still lying naked under the covers, sleeping silently. You raise your head until you look directly at the bottoms of his filthy feet, and their stench is starting to fill up your nose again. You don't want to do this, but you know you will. Deeply ashamed of your own cowardice, you pucker up, move in closer and place your lips on the bottom of his left foot. You feel the faint layer of dirt on it, and inadvertently take a breath. His mighty footscent is all you smell now, and no matter how hard you try you remain unable to disconnect from that sensation. You are kissing the dirty feet of a younger boy sleeping naked in your bed, and they stink. You feel shaken to the core and completely emasculated. <br>\r\n*Kiss*. Nothing. You put your lips on the ball of his right foot. *Kiss*. Nothing. You keep alternating between his feet, placing obedient kisses on each of them as he had told you to, allthewhile trying to ignore their stink. Nothing happens, Josh is still sleeping like a baby. What if this is not going to wake him up? Should you say something? But he explicitly told you that he wanted to be woken up by you kissing his feet... The realization that even all your thoughts circle around Josh getting what he wanted, while you are down on your knees serving him in the most debasing way is deeply humbling, and you feel just stupid. <br>\r\nYou continue kissing his stinking feet for ten more minutes before he's starting to move and stretch his body. 'Morning buddy.' he greets you, sounding like he had slept very well and being in sunny-boy-mode. 'Good morning, Josh..' you reply in between kisses. 'Uuuuuugh...' he yawned. 'Wow, dude, you're good at kissing feet, it feels awesome. I hope you don't mind the stink, hahahaha.' he laughs while rubbing the ball of his right foot all over your nose. You just take it, too embarrassed to answer. 'Hey dude, tell me again why you are kissing my feet, although they are dirty and they stink and stuff and it must be just totally humiliating for you to do.' Josh asks with a huge grin. He just can't stop pushing your buttons, and you feel too weak to tell him anything but what he wants to hear. You place a timid little kiss on his left arch, and answer 'It's the right thing to do Josh. I want to show you the respect you deserve. I just respect you so much, and I want you to know it.' *Kiss*. *Kiss*. *Kiss*. 'Yeah, right. I'm really glad to hear you came to face the facts here Stevie-boy. Some guys are just better and deserve special respect. And you respect me so fucking much that you kiss my stinking feet just because I tell you to. Uuuuuugh...' he answers casually and yawns a deep, relaxed yawn.<br>\r\n'You know, it's so cool we spent this weekend bonding and now we're getting along so well.' Josh explains as you keep kissing. 'Now that we both know where we stand, I'm sure we're gonna be just the best of friends. You just keep showing me the respect I deserve, and I let you hang out with me. That's so cool. I really feel like we are buddies now. Don't you think so too, Stevie-boy? You're my little buddy?' 'Sure, Josh. I'd love to be your buddy...' you lie. 'Awesome dude. So great to know we got an understanding here. Now, stop kissing my feet. I know, I know, you'd love to go on for hours. But we can't be late for school just because you love my footstink so much, hahaha. But don't worry, you'll get back to my feet eventually, and we will find plenty of other ways for you to show me how much you respect me.' With that he just casually pushes your face away with his foot. Although your face is finally free, his mighty footscent is still filling up your nose and you feel like it will never be free of it again. Every breath you take stinks of Josh's filthy feet. You are thoroughly humiliated.<br>\r\n'Fair warning buddy. Keep your eyes down now, if you don't want to compare yourself to me on yet another dimension on which you can't even dream of competing against me.' You know what he means, and quickly turn your eyes to meet the floor. Josh puts away the bedspread, gets out of the bed and walks over to the door naked and unlocks it. 'Come on buddy, it was nice of you to kiss my stinking feet for me, but now we don't have any more time to waste. Chop chop, buddy, time to...'</span></div></div>",

Chop chop, buddy, it\u2019s time for you to kiss my ass.\u201d Josh says confidently. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shuttered at what he just said and had to do a double take because you weren\u2019t quite sure if you heard him correctly. You didn\u2019t dare look up at him. Or his naked form which you found to be repugnant. <br>\r\nYou hated how you could see his feet and the cuff of his low sagging balls in your peripheral vision.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh noticed the confusion on your face and grinned, standing in front of the door completely naked and without shame in a hyper masculine stance with his legs spread apart and his hands cupping his balls. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNah, you heard me.\u201d He confirmed, knowing exactly what he was asking for from you and what you were thinking of it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe turned around seamlessly and pointed toward his back with both of his thumbs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think it\u2019s time you showed me the respect I REALLY deserve and kiss my ass.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mind started rushing a mile a minute. You were so disgusted with his command, let alone with his demeanor. You played back what he said in your mind almost instantaneously. <br>\r\n\u2018I think it\u2019s time you showed me the respect I REALLY deserve and kiss my ass.\u2019 <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn\u2019t believe it. Licking his feet was one thing. Yeah, sure they were a little stinky and unclean\u2026 even putting up with his cruel comments. But this? This was on a whole different level. If you kissed his ass, you were pretty sure your life would be over. You always thought \u2018Kiss my ass\u2019 was just something men say right before a fight. You didn\u2019t ever even imagine anyone would actually do that. <br>\r\nThere was no way you could go through with this proposal\u2026. not that it was exactly an offer. To literally kiss the ass of a younger man...To do so would be to truly be spineless. To be a nothing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou remember the deal we made just a second ago don\u2019t ya? If you want to keep being my friend and hanging out with me, you have to show me the respect I deserve. You won\u2019t let me down, will you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWill you?\u201d</span></div></div>",

I have no doubt you\u2019re making my ass look spectacular right now compared to your face... not that my ass needs any help. Your face actually needs the help. It looks like an aborted fetus. It\u2019s probably best that I\u2019m covering it up. I know no ones watching but like, I feel like I\u2019m doing the world a favor somehow. Maybe the sun is shining more clearly outside or the mirrors in your house won\u2019t break or some shit.\u201d Josh said laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t you think?\u201d He asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh grunted when you didn\u2019t respond and kept on playing your video game. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGet wrecked pussy.\u201d Josh said, throwing more concentration on the video game and less at your suffering and humiliation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe majority of your face was lodged between his ass cheeks touching his fetid, clammy ass flesh. With closed eyes you sniffled, unintentionally wafting in a large portion air that smelled of straight ass and let out a few emotional tears. You wished he would let you up, but you continued to just lay there silently while Josh had both fun and frustration. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFucking bullshit!\u201d His body lurched up and slammed back down on you several times as he reacted. \u201cFaggot ass campers!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt his muscular ass settle back into place, molding around your face like it was the cushion to Josh\u2019s throne. Uninvited but here for the party his coiled and filthy dingleberry ridden pubic hair pressed into your face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat felt like forever went by with you like this, feeling his every movement, feeling like your head was cracking from under his weight. The tears, the sniffles you stifled not only to avoid the earthen scent of Josh\u2019s ass but also to avoid his mocking commentary. It finally all came down to a moment in time. Another moment that had past. Another moment where Josh made you his bitch.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAwww fuck yeah!\u201d He yelled as you felt his body muscles tense up victoriously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFucking number one!!\u201d Josh yelled. \u201cI\u2019m the best! What else is new though right, pussy-boy?\u201d He asked you, now shifting his focus again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHahaha, I can\u2019t believe your still down there. I can\u2019t believe your down there in general!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh got up slightly and moved his ass off of you, letting it linger overhead barely a few inches away as he looked back at you with his typical condescending grin. His pearly whites flashed and his lips tinged in a hint of humor. You saw the gleam of enjoyment in his eye as he looked down at you like you were lesser. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDude your face is literally becoming my skid mark. Ain\u2019t it great?\u201d Josh asked rhetorically. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOnce a piece of shit always a piece of shit I guess, huh turd-lord?\u201d Josh asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wished he could just leave you alone. Your whole body was red from embarrassment and the only consolation was that no one was here to see how low Josh had made you fall. But that didn\u2019t stop him from talking about it and it didn\u2019t stop him from slowly lowering his ass back down on you and then grating his putrid crack back and forth all over your face while you lay there doing nothing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWeird to think just an hour or so ago you were like...thought of as a regular person right? I mean, I guess you were always a sack of shit, no doubt about that - but now I\u2019ve exposed you for the scared little pussy you really are huh? I mean, just look at it for a second...Me up here having a blast on your...errrr...sorry... this USED to be yours. I meant to say me up here having a blast on MY new console while you\u2019re down there like the human embodiment of pig shit that you really are.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t you oink and squeal for me, piggy?\u201d Josh asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou lay there, completely unwilling to follow this new line of command from him because it would only further to degrade you, but yet part of you was almost screaming at you to do what he said. You weren\u2019t sure  </span></div></div>",

The longer Josh is staying in your house, the more difficult it will be to get him out again, and now he has already gotten comfortable on your couch, for what looks like a long afternoon of sports and massages...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou try to think of a clever way to end this, but you can't think of any. Your position certainly doesn't help you to think creative and strong thoughts, on your knees in front of that bully massaging his sweaty foot. Since Josh ordered you to bow down so that he could watch the tv-screen and forced you into direct proximity to his feet, you decided to bow your head even more than necessary, looking down to the ground. It feels like buckling to the most extreme extent possible, but it's the only way to avoid staring straight at his disgusting feet and getting completely lost in the impenetrable wall of awful stench emenating from them. Josh doesn't seem to mind your cowering position, for the last 10 minutes ignores you completely, focusing on the television instead. You give your best to think of a phrasing that would come over as assertive and confident, but the mere knowledge that you have been dominated into this position by a bully two years younger than you is so humiliating that you have serious troubles thinking a straightforward though. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n~Josh, I have been very nice for long enough now... I... I...~ No. you can't start it of like that, that just sounds too weak, <br>\r\n~Listen Josh... it... ehem... I, I have things to do today... I, need to go to the... the... grocery store, and...~ Your thoughts are cut of by Josh kicking the top of your bowed down head, snidely remarking: \"You're not doing a good job, Stevie. Put some more effort into the massage. After all, I'm allowing you the honour of serving at the feet of a real man.\", followed by an arrogant chuckle. With a sort of confused horror you realize yourself instinctively bowing even lower, and applying more pressure to his feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n~What am I doing? I can't cower even more, it can't go on like this forever. I need to end this now, get up, and tell him to leave.~ you think, desperately trying to psych yourself up and boost your confidence. ~Yeah, time to find your balls, Steve! Josh, that's it! I'm... I'm not rubbing your filthy feet anymore. You get up and leave right now... ... ! I, I ... I don't want you around here, so... get out of... ehm... my house before I call your older brother, and put you in a lot of trouble!! Now, take your shirt, and get out of here!! NOW!!! ... Yeah, that's it...~ <br>\r\nYou still feel weak and confused, but at least now you have the strong words in your head. <br>\r\nYou prepare yourself for your stand. It's time.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You decide to breath in deeply on last time before you speak up, your head still bowed. But instead of calming your nerves, you only manage to inhale a dose of the potent footstench you avoided earlier by taking only flat, tiny breaths. But your decision is already made, and by the time Josh's stench hits you like a hammerblow you have already stopped massaging his feet. You desperately try to stay strong, but can't help but leave a disgusted little \"Uugh...\" come over your lips. In an attempt to get up to eye-level you raise your head and inevitably stare right into the bottoms of Josh's broad feet, emanating the potent stink now filling your nostrils and filthy from a whole summer day in flip-flops. As you back out a bit to avoid the stench and try to make eye-contact with Josh, you feel the whole situation sinking in. <br>\r\nThese were the feet you just spent what felt like an eternity massaging, on your knees. The dirty, stinking feet of a younger jock-boy, who just got into your house, occupied your couch and put you on your knees right in front of him. Without you fighting back. You tell yourself that you would speak up now, and end this once and for all. But all of a sudden you feel weaker and more pitiful than ever before.<br>\r\n\"Josh.. that's... that's it... ... !\" you manage to get out. You don't know whether to be proud that you finally spoke up, or embarassed that your words sounded so strong in your head, and yet so paltry spoken out. Then you raise your head to meet Josh's gaze. The athletic teenager is just sitting there unimpressed, relaxing on your couch and looking down at you scornfully. You had planned to throw him of by making an assertive start, but your words sound weak even to yourself, and Josh is radiating an amount of confident smugness you were unable to imagine anyone displaying, until now. <br>\r\n\"I... I'm not rubbing your... ... feet anymore...\" You try to keep his gaze, but Josh just glances down on you so arrogantly that you just find yourself unable to do it. You were unable to stand up to the jock-boy who made you rub his smelly feet. You avoid his gaze for a moment, and when you fixate him again you find the right corner of his mouth raised and his eyebrows lifted mockingly, as he leans back, puts his hands behind his head and puts his muscular body on display.<br>\r\n\"... You get up and... ... you... you... y...\" As you look at the impressive physique of this 16-year old you lose your last hope. Josh just watches with a sneer as you hang your head in shame and the first tears start coming to your eyes. \"... ... leave... right now... ... ...\" you stammer out humiliated.<br>\r\n~Find your balls Steve!?~ Who were you kidding. You were no match for your teen bully, and he knew it as well as you did. All the boy had to do in order to demonstrate that was to show off his muscles and watch you grovel. That was all it took to break you.  <br>\r\n\"I, I ... I donn wanyou roun... ... ... hea... ... so... ... ...\" your voice is a whimper now, and Josh silently enjoys your pathetic display, as you don't know whether to continue hanging your head in shame to hide your tears or look him in the eyes as you 'speak up' to him.<br>\r\nYou know you are making things worse with every word you're saying, but you just can't stop talking, in the desperate attempt a miracle will happen and help you safe your face somehow.<br>\r\n\"Out... outtamy house... be... be... before... ... ...\" As you sheepishly look up at Josh again, you see him not even looking at you anymore, instead smugly and contentedly taxing his biceps while he flexed, like there wasn't anything unusual about an older guy groveling at his feet, humiliating himself in a helpless attempt to speak up to him.<br>\r\n\"... ... T... t.. tellyao... olldabro... ...\" you manage to whimper, before you lose it and just kneel there sobbing uncontrollably.<br>\r\nIt all sounded so smart in your head. Yeah, threatening the 16-year old with telling his older brother about how he dominated you... Great choice, Einstein. Now as you kneel, totally intimidated in front of your teen bully cockily flexing his guns after that empty threat of yours, you feel like a stupid child threatening a grown up with running to your parents. As degrading an experience as you could possibly imagine, never before in your life had you felt this inferior.<br>\r\nFinally, you find the courage to look up at Josh again, who did not say a single word during all of this. You find him still looking down at you smugly. \"Are you done now, Stevie?\" he asks slowly and firmly, his voice dripping of contempt and scorn. The tears start to come again and you just manage to produce a shameful nod. \"And what do you think is going to happen now, eh!? Look at you! Down on your knees, crying like a child. Aren't you, eh? Was that supposed to be your big standup to me!?\"<br>\r\nYou hang your head in shame again, as his mocking stare pierces you. The way you have failed to stand up for yourself is bad enough. But the scorn, and the rhetoric questioning with which the boy pulls you into a mock debate with him make the situation almost unbearably humiliating. After all, how could you answer with a shred of dignity to his questioning, after what just happened. <br>\r\n\"PA-THE-TIC!\" The word cuts right through you like a razor. \"Look at me, boy. Look at me while I am talking to you.\" You comply, and look at the handsome teenager. \"Absolutely, pa-the-tic. That's what you are. Eh, boy!? HAhahaha...\". Josh obviously enjoys the situation, and intents to milk it to the fullest, now even raising his finger while lecturing you. \"Pathetic whimp, trying to stand up to me, not even able to produce one coherent sentence without stammering. Should just have done what you were told?! Instead of questioning the orders of a REAL man. Huh, pathetic whimp!?\" the arrogant teenager mocks you.<br>\r\n\"Would have thought coming into your house, bossing you around to hand me drinks and rub my filthy feet would have been enough to teach you your place. Huh, whimp?! I am already more of a man than you ever will be, pathetic boy. Understand me!? Answer me, boy!\" Josh sneers, emphasizing his point with a few swings of his finger. \"Yes... Josh...\" you whimper weakly, completely destroyed, as he leans back contentedly and chuckles once again. <br>\r\n\"Since you havn't learned your place yet, I guess I need to teach you a good thorough lesson, about what it means to be a real man, little bitch! When I am done with you, you will know how to respect your superior, boy! Now, let's take of where we left it. With you being put right were you belong, kneeling at my dirty feet. Hahahaha. Or do you have a problem with that, whimp?!\" Josh seemed determined to rub his superiority in your face as much as possible, constantly asking you for affirmation and verbal submission to him. And he enjoyed every second of it, while you just wanted to sink into the ground, due to the humiliation of being treated this way by a younger boy, without fighting back. \"Yes... Josh...\" \"Hahaha...\" Weakly, you take your old position, your head bowed as to avoid his horrible footstench, with a whimper you put your hands back on his feet to start the massage.<br>\r\n\"Oh, come on Stevie, it's not that bad.\" Josh claims. \"After all you have learned your place now, eh? And since we have this sorted out once and for all we don't need to worry about this anymore, because we all know where we stand.\" he grins down at you. \"Now, tell me: Who is your master, Stevie?\" \"You, Josh.\" you say, as he cockily enjoys your verbalized submission to him before, almost casually, adding: \"Good thing you know it by now, Stevie. But the thing is, I can't just let you pull of that pathetic punk stunt of yours and let you get away with it. You need to respect the only man in this house. Now, since you declined to rub my feet, and you dared to talk back to the only real man in this house, you are going to get two punishments, boy. Look at me!\" he exclaimed smugly, again wagging his finger up and down. You meekly comply.<br>\r\n\"First, as you have dared to talk back you are not allowed to say anything until further notice. No more talking from now on, it is silent time for you, young man!\" You shortly sob at the humiliating way you are adressed by the younger boy as he, smiling arrogantly, just enjoys his dominance to the fullest. \"Second, you obviously need a thorough lesson in what it means to serve a real man, and what it means to be a real man, little bitch. Now, there you are again, right were you belong. At my superior feet! Look at them, boy!!!\" Slowly you raise your head, until you're looking at the bottoms of the teenagers filthy feet again. \"Now, these are the feet of a real man. And they STINK, boy!!!\" Josh begins lecturing you again. \"This will be your punishment for being a little whimp, who is not able to stand up for himself. A good whimp has to be able to recognize his master by his scent. So now, you are going to sniff my STINKING feet, boy! You are going to smell these bastards until you are unable to think of anything else but the scent of your master's feet. The STINKING feet of a REAL man, you little bitch!\"<br>\r\nLeaning back, the boy smugly watches your inner struggle for a moment. You look up pleadingly one last time, not daring to speak up again, and meet his smug gaze. Than you meekly comply, and obediently put your nose on the ball of his left foot, inhaling timidly. \"Ugh...\" The stench is overwhelming, and you sob one more time before inhaling again, this time deeper, in order to please your bully. How humiliating. \"Oh, bytheway, you need to look me in the eyes while you grovel. A lot of nonverbal communication needs to be made, and I want this lesson to really sink in for you.\" the cocky jock-boy informs you. You meekly comply and look into his face. Unwillingly you look into his handsome face scornfully looking down at you, as you obediently put your nose on the bottom of his right foot again, inhaling deeply. He was right. It STINKS of man.<br>\r\n\"Hahaha. PA-THE-TIC!! Hahahaha!!!\"</span></div></div>",

How can the feet of a 16-year old teenager smell like this??~ you wonder, while Josh triumphantly watches you performing this absing task. *Sniff*... *Sniff*... *Sniff*... ~So unbelievably potent...~ His powerful stink is making you lightheaded, easily driving you into passivity and submissiveness more and more with every sniff you take. *Sniff*... *Sniff*... *Sniff*...<br>\r\n\"Yeah, that's it, Stevie.\" Josh chuckles. \"Looks like you can be an obedient boy after all. Haha. How does it feel, smelling the feet of a real man, boy? Eh!?\" he inquires, looking at you with raised eyebrows. \"Bet you have never smelled that potent stench before, have you, boy? Bet it's FUCKING humiliating, eh!?\" he asks scornfully, degrading you even further, knowing full well that you are not allowed to speak, and therefore not allowed to answer his arrogant rhetorical questions. All the while you meekly continue smelling his feet and looking straight into his eyes. *Sniff*... *Sniff*... Sniff*...  <br>\r\nHis mighty stench is dominating more and more of your sensual experience now.You faintly notice Josh grinning above you, as your field of vision becomes more and more blurry. You fell your tortured nose make contact with the sole of his mighty foot again, fell the faint line of dirt on it and grimace before inhaling again. *Snifffff*... His footodour invades your nose again, and you shiver in intimidated obedience before the power of your bullies feet.<br>\r\n\"Yeah. Like that, huh?! Like having my mighty feet in your face? Weak little bitch! You are going to smell these bastards until you will forget everything else! When I am done with you you will understand the power of a REAL man's feet!!\" With that he slowly but forcefully rubs the ball of his right foot over your nose. You loosen your neck muscles and obediently let your head be pushed around by his smelly foot. Maybe it's the pressure Josh applies or maybe the movement going on, but all of a sudden his stench seems doubled... trippled... quadrupled in intensity. You meekly inhale until you can't take it anymore, and slowly attempt to pull your head back.<br>\r\n\"Keep your head still, Stevie. Don't you think you can get away with the sort of whimpy sniffs you've been given me until now! Keep your head still, weakling!!\" The teenagers stern eyes resting on you, you submissively comply and endure him further rubbing his foot all over your nose. You keep inhaling his overwhelmingly intense footscent, until it becomes too much to bear, you atart to tear up again and let out a sob. <br>\r\n\"Now, quit acting like a little whimp!\" Josh scorns you. \"This is your punishment for being too pathetic to stand up for yourself. Now, be a man about it! Take your punishment like a man, instead of like a whiny little bitch!! Pathetic boy! Good-for-nothing footsniffer!\" You hang your head in shame and just take the verbal beating. Finally Josh is done, looking down at you with contempt. <br>\r\n\"You have just proven once more, that the most you can ever hope to achieve is to serve the feet of a real man, boy.\" <br>\r\nBy now the 16-year old had manage to refer to himself as the real man, and to you as just a boy or even less than that for so often, that you recognize yourself questioning the validity of this assertion less and less. Of course you know that you are older than him, but after the treatment he had put you through and your inability to stand up to him you can't help but feeling a lot less of a man than you did before. You look up at your jock-bully again who is staring you down like dominating older guys and reducing them to be his footsniffers was the most normal thing imaginable to him. <br>\r\nAfter leaving out a noise of disgust while investigating your kneeling figure, he decides to talk to you again, arrogantly raising his finger. Still dizzy and confused by the effect of his powerful footscent you look up at him. <br>\r\n\"Look at me, little boy! This was your gentle introduction about what it means to serve at my feet! Now I will see wheather you learned something from it, hahahaha. You will now get back in position at my filthy feet, and continue sniffing like the lowly footboy that you are. Sniff, like I tought you to!! Big boy sniffs, not those whimpy boy sniffs you gave me earlier, eh?! And when I rub my foot over your nose you will be a big boy and take it all in. And in your thoughts you will thank me for teaching you this first lesson about what it means to BE a REAL man, and what it means to SERVE a REAL man. You little bitch!!\" And with that the cocky teen ends his verbal beating, leans back on your couch again and waits for you to obey. <br>\r\nReady to continue the abasing ritual, you lean forward and make nose-contact with his right foot again, meeting the all too familiar but none the less horrifying wall of stink. ~How is it even possible the feet of a 16-year old boy could produce a stink this... dominant and humbling??~ You catch yourself thinking once again with a whince as you take the first sniff. All of a sudden you feel the weight of Josh's foot and leg pressing down on the back of your neck, as he forcefully uses them to pull your face closer into the bottom of his right foot. For a moment there, you actually think about fighting out of a reflex, helplessly flailing your arms around. But you give up within a second. You'd stand no chance against this cocky athlete in a real fight. You know it immediately, and obediently let your arms hang limp to your sides. Within a flash your nose is buried right under his toes and all of a sudden you're in a world of stink again, your pathetic complaints against this treatment easily muffled by the fleshy sole of his foot dominating your lips.<br>\r\n\"Mmmmmmmppfffff...\"<br>\r\n\"Silence, little bitch!! Now, what did I tell you about making whimpy-boy sniffs again, eh!? Since you are not going to listen, I will make sure you stay down here until you know how to behave. You are going to smell these mighty feet until you have forgotten anything else in the world, whimp!!!\" With this the cocky teen starts rubbing his filthy foot all over your face again, and you feel the intensity of his mighty stink magnifying immediately, just as you feel slowly but surely how the focus of your perception begins to reduce to your senses of touch and smell.</span></div></div>",

Now!' you say, trying to sound assertive and self-assured, but your words sound weak, even in your own ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh just leans back, confidently looking at you and says 'Relax, man. I can't go home with pain in my ankle. I could slip and break my leg, and we don't want that, do we? Because than I would feel bad, my brother wouldn't get his books and write a bad paper which would make him feel bad too. And all of this because you had a little temper you could not control.

He sighs with delight and wiggles his stinking toes as you stand there dumb founded holding his filthy flip flops. <br>\r\n\"Hey Stevie do you mind just going and giving them a bit of a clean for me?\" He asked pointing to his flip flops \"And then I'll get out of your hair.\"<br>\r\n<i>Finally</i> you thought, you'd do anything to get him out of here.<br>\r\n\"Yeah sure Josh.\" you reply with fake sincerity and head towards the kitchen.<br>\r\n\"Aw thanks Stevie-boy.\" He calls out condescendingly to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn't believe how your weekend had started out, you were now in your kitchen on a Friday afternoon with a pair of sweaty stinky flip flops with a sponge scrubbing the sweat out of your younger 16-year-old bully's shoes. After about 10 minutes you are pretty happy that Josh would be happy with his shoes and would leave you to enjoy your weekend. You can't help but feel relieve that he will be leaving so you walk back into the living room with a smile on your face.<br>\r\n\"Here you go Josh, all clean for you. I'll see you Monday at school.\" You say trying to get him to leave.<br>\r\n\"Just before I go Stevie, my feet are still killing me. Just jump down there and give them a bit of a rub.\" He said, he didn't even ask just told you to.<br>\r\nYou bite your tongue at this demand he is really starting to annoy you. The thought of rubbing his filthy sweating feet makes you sick but you answer...</span></div></div>",

Surely he doesn't think that you will actually get on your knees wash his feet then rub them.<br>\r\n\"Josh I don't want to wash your feet either. I have a lot of stuff to do I really think you should just go home and rest.\" You try to convince him.<br>\r\nYou can see him tense up, he is starting to get mad but then he spots your Playstation. <br>\r\n\"What game are you best at?\" he asks pointing towards it.<br>\r\n\"I don't know, one of the racing ones.\" you reply confused.<br>\r\n\"Good then, load it up. If I beat you then you get down and rub my feet.

He can't help but laugh at you as you burn a bright red.<br>\r\n\"Sorry Stevie sometimes I forget my own strength.\" He says sarcastically. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou start up the Playstation and and put in the game. Josh doesn't even move, leaving his feet on the coffee table while wiggling his stinking toes. He put his hand out waiting for you to bring him his control. You oblige without creating more issues. He lets you choose all the settings as he says he has never played. You choose your favourite car and track and give him bad advice so that he chooses a worse car than yours. The game starts and you are easily in control, you are leading way out in front on the first lap, and then even further in front on the second. He whinges that the game is unfair and broken but you just smile confidently and keep racing. You are easily going to win, you see the finish line and decide that you are finally going to get some revenge on him so you try and make your car do a spin across the line but as you do you stuff up and the car roles over. Josh starts laughing so hard as he starts to gain ground on you as you maniacally press all the buttons trying to get back onto the track. <br>\r\n\"This foot rub is going to feel sooooo good.\" he laughs, wriggling his stinking toes again as his car passes yours and finishes the race in first place.<br>\r\nYou can't believe it!

I want a rematch, double or nothing or something.\" You squeal starting to sound very desperate.<br>\r\n\"Double what you idiot? How do you double a foot rub?\" He asks talking down to you.<br>\r\nYou didn't know how to answer, you just couldn't possibly get down on your hands and knees and rub the pair of his sweaty, stinking feet thats disgusting. He was 16 years old, 2 years younger than you! You begin to stammer and stutter trying to come up with an answer. <br>\r\n\"Tell you what Stevie. You either get down there and rub my feet like you agreed to or I'm going to beat the shit out of you.\" He demanded.<br>\r\n\"I'll kiss your feet.\" you panicked.<br>\r\nJosh burst out laughing. \"What?!\"<br>\r\n\"If I lose again I'll kiss your feet.\" You tried to sound brave but it's nearly impossible to sound brave while saying that sentence.<br>\r\nHe was laughing so hard he had to hold his sides, through fits of laughter he agreed to the bet.<br>\r\n\"Kiss my feet? That is a very strange bet Stevie is there something you're not telling me?\" He asked with a wide smile.<br>\r\n\"No!

You start the game again, you have to admit you are pretty nervous, your hands are sweating. You are cursing yourself inside. Why the hell would you bet that? It doesn't matter you will easily win. The race begins and you are off to a good start, his car just can't keep up. For the first time he pulls his feet off the table and sits forward he really wants to win this one. You are quite easily leading after the first lap, you spin out on the second and he hits the front you start to panic but quickly regain the lead. The race is closer than you thought it would be but you are winning on the last lap, you get to the last corner and Josh bumps you and you drop your control, his car passes yours on the final corner and passes the finish line in first place. He throws his arms up in the air in celebration and looks at you making kissing noises before bursting into laughter again.<br>\r\n\"Get down and kiss my feet Stevie-boy!\" he cheers through the laughter.<br>\r\n\"Hey that's not fair you bumped me!\" You cry.<br>\r\n\"I did not loser, you dropped your control, probably on purpose so you could smooch my feet.\" He said again still laughing.<br>\r\nYou couldn't believe it, you lost again! Theres no way you could kiss his feet.<br>\r\n\"Don't worry loser, I'll let you build your way up to kissing them. You still owe me a foot rub beforehand.\"<br>\r\n\"But, But, But...\" you couldn't think of anything to say.<br>\r\nJosh stopped laughing and grabbed you by the shirt. \"Get down there now. You lost you loser.\"<br>\r\n\"Okay, Okay!\" You said in fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stood up as he put his feet back on the coffee table with a sigh and relaxed into the couch. He wiggled his toes as you kneel down in front of his feet the foul cheesy smell is already filling your nose. You try your best to hold back from crying you can't believe you are doing this, but maybe just maybe if you do a good job he wouldn't make you kiss his feet...surely?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sweat has dried and become sticky as you start kneading away at right sole he sighs in delight and laughs again at your expense.<br>\r\n\"That feels really good Stevie-boy...you may have found your calling in life.\" He says patronising you. <br>\r\nYou have no comeback. Anything you say right now would have no effect. It's hard to sound tough or smart when you are rubbing a younger boy's filthy feet. Your train of thought is interrupted as you hear the sound of his iPhone taking a photo. <br>\r\n\"Hey what the hell?\" you scream.<br>\r\nJosh just laughs hysterically in response.<br>\r\n\"Sorry Stevie you just look so good down there below my feet.\" he says.<br>\r\nYou let go of his feet and demand he deletes the photo. This just angers him as he sits up and threatens to beat the shit out of you if you don't keep rubbing. You get back down and keep rubbing his foot, your hands stink of the same foul odour his feet do.<br>\r\n\"If you play by the rules the photo wont see the light of day. Piss me off again and it's going straight to Facebook.\" He says firmly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sit in silence as he closes his eyes and leans back on the couch, after 10 minutes he tells you to switch foot.

Your knees were beginning to get sore as you still kneeled before him rubbing his dirty, stinking feet. You had never felt so humiliated. You were rubbing the sweaty feet of your younger bully and were too scared to do anything about it. You wished that you had washed his feet first when he gave you the chance. That was a wish you never thought you would want. He pulled his right foot away from you and presented you with his left without even acknowledging you. You didn't bother arguing, you immediately went to work, kneading and wiping at the foot. You couldn't believe this was happening, you prayed that the picture would never see the light of day and hoped that no one would ever find out what was happening....but someone giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked up to see Amy, your girlfriend, standing at the entrance with her bags. She was beautiful, tall, skinny with thick, long chocolate hair. Way out of your league! <br>\r\n'What the hell is going on?' she laughed in amazement, looking on astonished. <br>\r\nYour face burned a bright red, you forgot you had asked her to come over for the weekend because your parents were away. You had hoped to have sex for the first time, not only with her but ever. That didn't seem likely after this. Before you could respond Josh filled her in.<br>\r\n'Oh Hey Amy, Stevie lost a bet and now he has to rub my feet.' He said. <br>\r\n'That's disgusting! Why would you bet that?' She asked you as your face increased in brightness.<br>\r\n'That not all...' Josh laughed. 'He then bet again, and now he has to kiss my feet. You're just in time for that actually.' Josh laughed hysterically again. <br>\r\n'What the fuck Steven? That's disgusting!' She said. 'You kiss his feet and you will never kiss me again.' She continued matter-of-factly.<br>\r\nYou stammered trying to answer but couldn't find the words.<br>\r\n'Too bad for you Stevie, a bet is a bet.' Josh said threateningly.<br>\r\nWhen Amy realised you weren't going to say anything she took matters into her own hands. <br>\r\n'Josh he is not kissing you feet.' She said.<br>\r\n'Yes he is, he lost fair and square...unless you want to play for it?' he asked motioning to the game paused on the screen with a smile.<br>\r\nYour hopes raised! Amy was actually quite good at the game and had played a fair amount with you.<br>\r\n'Do it Amy please.' You said weakly, still instinctively rubbing Josh's feet. <br>\r\n'Fine. If I win you leave and he is not kissing your feet.' She said annoyed. <br>\r\n'No, No, No. He already has to kiss my feet. There is nothing in that for me.' Josh replied.<br>\r\n'Well what are we doing then?' She asked.<br>\r\n'If you win, I'll leave and Stevie-boy doesn't have to kiss my feet. But if I win, Stevie has to make-out with my feet while you make-out with me.' He said cockily. <br>\r\n'You are gross Josh....fine lets go.' she agreed without even asking you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy sat down close to Josh and picked up a controller, seeing your girlfriend sit next to your bully while you rubbed his feet made you even more embarrassed. The game started but you couldn't see as you were busy staring at Josh's dirty soles. Who won? </span></div></div>",

He leaned back into the couch and couldn't wipe the smile of his face. <br>\r\n'Come on.' he said waving Amy over. <br>\r\n'How long do I have to do this for?' She sighed as she scooted closer to him.<br>\r\n'As long as you want, the only rule is Stevie has to make-out with my toes for as long as you make-out with me.'

She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe leaned over the top of Josh and they started to kiss each other passionately, Josh pointed down at his feet threateningly and you reluctantly started sucking and kissing Josh's feet. You couldn't believe what was happening. Your young 16-year-old bully was making out with YOUR girlfriend while you made out with his dirty, sweating, stained feet. The taste invaded your mouth almost making you gag, the more your tongue moved around his toes the more grime and toejam that ended up in your mouth. Thankfully you thought this wouldn't last long until you decided to look up...Amy was showing no sign of stopping as she seemed to be in complete bliss while Josh held the back of her head and made out with her passionately. All of a sudden she mounted him, sitting across his crotch as they made out, she started naturally moving her hips with the passion of the kiss. You continued to suck Josh's toes as your life fell apart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter 10 minutes Amy finally unlocked lips with Josh and leaned back breathing heavily, still mounting him.<br>\r\n\"Wow...you are a great kisser.' She said in complete bliss.<br>\r\nIf it wasn't for the slurp your mouth made as you pulled Josh's toes out she probably would have forgotten you were there. She cupped her mouth and eyes went wide.<br>\r\n'hahahahahahaha' she couldn't help but laugh.<br>\r\n'How was it for you Stevie-boy?' Josh asked before hysterically laughing. <br>\r\n'Steven, I'm sorry I forgot...were you really making out with his feet that entire time?' she asked still trying to stop giggling. <br>\r\nYou reluctantly nodded your head which made her burst out laughing uncontrollably. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she says...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Okay, let's begin, first Amy spit on Dog's face!\" Josh said with a smile on his face.<br>\r\nAll of the sudden Amy looked at you and spit on your face. Meanwhile Josh took a seat at your couch putting his feet on the table. Oh no, you know what this means, more foot licking and sucking.<br>\r\n\"Perfect! Now let's turn up the volume a little bit. Dog, lick my feet, with long licks, from my heel to my toes. Amy, if he doesn't cooperate force him, and take this rope and tie his arms and legs so he won't move a lot.\" Josh's words were like wishes to Amy, she tied you up and put your face in Josh's feet. You started licking up and down, up and down, while Amy's hands were holding your hair, she push your head up and down as well. <br>\r\n\"Keep that rythm Dog. Amy come over her! Next to me on the couch.\" <br>\r\nAmy ran out to Josh's side looking at him like if he was a God.<br>\r\n\"Kiss me slave\" Not a second pass when all of the sudden Amy was kissing Josh. Your \"girlfriend\" truly loves this.<br>\r\nJosh pulls Amy's head so they don't kiss anymore.

Amy pulled out Josh's dick, its massive, way bigger than yours, Amy's eyes showed amazement and amusement. You could only stop licking Josh's feet.<br>\r\n\"You will suck this but, tell Dog he has to continue licking\" Josh told Amy.<br>\r\n\"Start fucking licking again you stupid idiot! Or I will beat the life out of you!\" Amy said in an desperate way.<br>\r\n\"No\" you replied.<br>\r\nAmy stood up and faced you.<br>\r\n\"Look Steven, this is the first time I'm with a REAL man. Don't ruin this for me you bitch boy.\" She punched you in the face and kick your nuts. <br>\r\n\"HAHAHAHA WOOOOW slave! That was great! I think you earned your reward. Come here to suck and lick my cock.\" Joshed screamed.<br>\r\n\"Yes master! Thank you master!\" Amy happily replied.<br>\r\nAmy took a seat next to Josh in the couch, she looked down at his enormous penis. She grabbed it with both her hands and kiss his tip, then she started locking all around it, she took dedication to this. She started sucking on Josh's cock.<br>\r\n\"Come on Dog, lick my feet, if you do it I'll finish fast and you won't have to see your girlfriend sucking me off HAHAHA\"<br>\r\nYour body moved by his own, you pulled out your tongue by instinct and started licking. You were truly defeated.<br>\r\n\"Ahhh this is the American dream right here. Are you enjoying your self Amy?\"<br>\r\nAmy stopped sucking Josh to replie.<br>\r\n\"Yes master. But...\"<br>\r\n-\"What slave?\"<br>\r\n\"Master... can you... penetrate me?\"<br>\r\nYour body stopped, but continue licking, this was your new life.<br>\r\n\"Hmmmm let me think about it. Okay!\"<br>\r\nJosh pulled his feet out of the table, he pushed Amy to the table so now you two are face to face. Amy was in a doggie position.<br>\r\n\"Take a look at her face dog. This is what true pleasure looks like\" Josh screamed at you.<br>\r\nHe started fucking Amy with all his strength, Amy looked like if she was going to die, but of ecstasy.<br>\r\n\"Yes master yes yes yes yes.\" Amy shouted<br>\r\nJosh stopped.<br>\r\n\"Let's drop this slave master thing between the both of us Amy, I know you wanted this the moment we first kiss. Steve boy will be OUR slave, but you and me, we'll be partners in crime. You and Steven will still be boyfriends in the public eye, but in privacy Steven belongs to me and you'll be my girlfriend or my sexual toy.\"<br>\r\nJosh's words were the way your life is going to be from now on.<br>\r\n\"HAHAHA I accept Josh, let's continue. I love you and your enormous cock.\" Amy replied.<br>\r\nThey continue fucking while you observed, after one and a half hours they were about to finish.<br>\r\n\"Kneel next to Dog!\" Josh orderd.<br>\r\nWhat is he doing? From out of nowhere Amy kneeled by your side with her tongue out. Oh no! Josh cumm all over your faces. There was a lot of cumm everywhere. Some of it in your lips, all over Amy's face, on the floor and on Josh's tip.<br>\r\n\"Lick it off Dog clean your face, your girlfriend and your floor\" Josh said with a relaxed voice.<br>\r\n\"WHAT? NO!\" You replied.<br>\r\n\"Are you sure Dog?\" Joshed said with a treating voice.<br>\r\n\"FUCKING YES!\"<br>\r\n\"Okay, Amy clean the floor and then hold Dogs head\" Josh said.<br>\r\n\"Yes Josh, come here idiot\" Amy graves your head and she put her fingers in your mouth holding it open. <br>\r\nFuck, no no no, not this.<br>\r\n\"You had your chance dog, you were only licking Amy's face and the floor, now suck off the rest of the cumm in my cock\" When Josh ended he graved your head and pull it to his dick, Amy pushed your head to his dick as well. You tried to fight but Amy's fingers were in the way, Josh's dick was in your mouth... this is a new low. He grabbed a cellphone and took a photo, in the photo you could see yourself sucking Josh and Amy helping him. <br>\r\n\"Listen to me, you trie something funny and this photo will appear all over social media.

And now you are going to leave!' With this you grab his right arm. He looks at you and meets your gaze. 'Be careful, little buddy. I have let go your impudencies until now, but if you go on like this, I will have to teach you a lesson in respect that you are never going to forget.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are frightened by his words, but do not want to give up so easily. You hold on to his arm and try to pull him off the couch, and feel his upper arm muscles grow and become hard as he resists without any effort. 'Better think about this real good, you're starting to upset me, stupid boy. But I will let it go if you give me a convincing apology, little buddy.' While saying this he moves his feet and kicks his flip-flops off, so that they fly through the living room, all the while looking straight into your eyes. 'Aaaaah yes, that feels so much better. See? I didn't even need you to get rid of my shoes. So maybe I don't have any use for you after all?' As he says this you loose it. You pull his arm with all the power you have and try to grab his hair with your left, screaming 'Now I'm going to show you...'. You don't get any further. All of a sudden Josh is on his feet, easily shakes off your hand of by making a quick circle with the arm you are holding on and rams the palm of his hand against the middle of your upper body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'That bastard tricked me! His ankle is allright!' you think, as you stumble backwards fighting to catch your breath. 'What, huh? What are you going to do to me now, little buddy? Hahaha...' With this he steps forward and delivers a roundhouse kick to your face in one elegant, fluent movement. All of this goes so quick that you don't really see it coming. All you feel is a sudden burst of smelly, vinegary air before the sweaty ball of his foot connects with your cheekbone and sends you tripping to the side. The pain is terrible and you sweep up your arms in shock to protect your face from the next attack. Josh shows no mercy and fires a straight kick right into your unprotected stomach which presses all the air out of your body and you double over in pain, letting a weak, pitiful 'Ooooooooohhh...' come over your lips.<br>\r\nYou want to signal him that it is over, that you are finished and he won, that he should please stop kicking you, but you can't speak or move the slightest muscle. You are done, and both of you know it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

Without a hurry your superior opponent leads his left hand between his legs and scratches his balls, before he puts it under your chin and forces your head upwards to look into his eyes. You want to avoid his gaze, but you just can't. His beautiful dark eyes lock with yours as he puts a confident smirk on his face and raises his right fist. He holds it there for a moment, as you prepared for the pain that is coming for you. The message is clear. 'You tried to fight me, and therefore you deserve punishment. I'm going to finish you now, and there is nothing you can do to stop me, weakling.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe lets it sink in a little, enjoying the power he has over you. Than his fist flie in your direction and painfully connects with your chin. Your vision blurs as you drop to your knees and then fall over on the ground in a barely conscious, zombie-like state, looking pathetic with your eyes and mouth wide open, absolutely unable to move. All you perceive is Josh chuckling above you and one of his feet in the sight of your vision, standing next to your head. 'Haha, that was fun, don't you think?' You feel like crying. You want to sink into the ground and stay there forever. 'I'll go take a piss. You stay right where you are, I'm not done with you yet, loser.' With this he walks away, leaving you alone in your humiliation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou try to think of something positive, to regain your strength to get up and run away, lock up in your room or call the police... Damn, how miserable are those thoughts? Running away from the small brother of your best friend? Or even worse, having to explain the police that you were beaten senseless by a 16-year old boy?? No, that would be pathetic!! You have to make sure noone would ever get to know anything about this. Finally you feel like you are strong enough to move again, and try to get to your knees. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis is when Josh returns and decides to... </span></div></div>",

You feel so helpless, as he slowly raises his leg and inflicts a powerful trampling kick into your stomach with the ball of his foot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Uuuuuughhhh...Ugh..Eehhhh...' You moan weakly as your tormentor puts more pressure on your stomach by leaning forward and resting his arm on his upper leg. 'No, I told you to stay right where you are, whimp. You understand?' You grimace and nod in pain as he grinds his foot deeper into my body. 'Good.' he says. 'I have longed for getting you under my control since the first time I saw you, pathetic weed. And you were really stupid enough to attack me. Hahaha, I can't believe it.' With this he takes his foot out of your stomach and puts it under your chin, forcing your head into your neck until you are sure your muscles started to cramp. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe strong stench of his footsweat hits your nose, and makes the whole situation all the more ashaming. 'How does this feel, huh? Getting your head kicked around by a younger boy?' You are unable to answer, just let out some pitiful moans, but in fact it is the most degrading experience of your life.

'Hahaha, you should see yourself lying on the floor, whining like a little boy. This must be so embarassing for you to know that you are no match for me, and that I can do to you whatever I want now.' He releases the pressure a little and puts his foot on your chin, his toes slightly touching your lips. He studies your face with an amused and cruel look on his one, as the smell of his foot sweat grows stronger. 'Uuugh...No...' 'HAhaha!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turne your face to the right side, but there is his other foot standing right beside your head. You try to escape by turning your head left, and he punishes you by pressing his foot on your cheek, distorting your mouth into an obscure grimace, so that your saliva drips on the living room floor. You try to beg him to stop abusing you, but due to your deformed mouth all you can get out is a hideous 'Ooorrlllll...'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'You have to work on expressing yourself, if you want me to even notice the unimportant, pitiful messages you are trying to deliver, pathetic loser.' Josh's eyes gleam in excitement while he says this, and it is obvious that he is enjoying your miserable position and the power he has over you. 'OK, I feel like I should be graviouss and give you a chance to speak out some of your pathetic ideas.' he says, taking his foot of your cheek and looking at me with fake interest. 'Please, Josh...please stop...tell me what you want, and...' 'Hahahaha...' he laughs, as he begins slapping your cheeks with his foot, snapping your head from left to right, inflicting small painful stenches. The casualness with which he does this is nearly too much for you, as he makes it obvious that he is just toying with you for his own pleasure, enjoying his superiority and the humiliation he is putting you through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally he stops, putting his toes on your cheek in a nearly gentle way, but the look in his eyes remains stern and his voice is commanding as he says 'You know it. You still owe me a thourough, convincing apology for your impudent rudeness, stupid boy.' You can't believe the words coming out of his mouth, but he makes it clear that he means exactly what he says. 'I'm sure you know exactly what I mean, don't you, loserboy?' he says, gently rubbing his foot on your cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe is right, you know what he means. In the school there are rumours going on about the way he likes to treat people that do not show him the respect that is necessary in his eyes. As far as they say, he loves demonstrating his superiority in many ways, none of them likely to be enjoyed by his poor victims, and it is more or less an open secret that apologizing to him means a lot more than offering a handshake and saying 'Sorry I disrespected you, it won't happen again.' You know, if you agree with this it is probable to end in complete obedience and utter humiliation for you. You know it, and he knows that you do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Josh increases the pressure on your face again you snap out of your thoughts and come back to the grim reality. 'Don't tell me that this is not a fair offer, loserboy. Admit you are the loser and give me a simple apology, show me the respect I deserve.' As you look up at him he seems like a god to you, towering over your weak, destroyed body with a cool, confident smirk, hands on his hips and a foot on your face, strong, mercyless and unbeatable. But you fight with yourself. You feel weak and vulnerable and close to tears. You know, if you reject he will punish you. If you accept, he will make you submit to him completely.

IF YOU HAVN'T LEARNED PROPER RESPECT YET, I'M GOING TO TEACH IT TO YOU!!' <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith this Josh simply drops down on your body with his full weight, driving all the air out of your lungs, pinning you to the ground. You start to struggle helplessly as you feel his firm, strong ass on your stomach but he easily slides forward on your chest and pins your right arm under his knee.<br>\r\n'Please no...no more...' you mumble weakly as he grabs your hair with his left, pulling your head up and slowly raises his right hand. 'You leave me no choice but to get physical again. I thought you might be smart enough to learn from the last beating you received, but if you beg me to continue your obedience lesson I will do it for you.' <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he says this he fixed your left arm under his leg, making you effectively unable to move. Than he sits there for a while, quietly looking down at you and your pathetic attempts to break free. Calmly waiting until you realize the hopelessness of your struggling and give it up, he makes sure to look you right in the face. 'You got anything to say, pathetic whimp?' You just grimace and trie to move your head in embarassment to avoid his firm gaze. 'No?? Hahaha, as you wish.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith this he starts slappping your face with his right hand back and forth, like you are his bitch, receiving a well deserved punishment. At first you try to fight it by moving your head away and trying to jiggle out under him, but he sits firmly on your upper body and holds you tightly by your hair, so that every movement only makes it more painful. So finally you give it up, accepting the superiority of your opponent, accepting the complete humiliation of being slapped out of your mind by a younger boy, who easily proved to you that you are no match for his kicking skills. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSLAP SLAP SLAP SLAP SLAP! 'You're enjoying this, whimp?' SLAP SLAP SLAP!! After what seems like an eternity your tormentor stops beating your head around and puts his long, surprisingly strong hand on your face, pushing his palm down on your mouth and nose, forcing your head into your neck without haste, holding it there, testing your resistence. As his firm grip makes it difficult for you to breath, you smell the strong, sweaty scent of his hand, and the roughness of his touch makes you realize that his skin must be dirty and unwashed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat will happen next?</span></div></div>",

Do you understand, buddy boy?' You try to answer, but as your words are muffled by his strong hand you only manage to produce a pitiful 'Mmmmmhhhpfff...'. Ignoring your paltry utterance, Josh continues speaking. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'You remember you talked about my feet, don't you? What's the matter with removing my shoes when I kindly ask you to do it? Why do you have to make such a big deal out of doing me this tiny favour, huh?' He is really rubbing it in now, and by the calmness of his voice you can tell how much he is enjoying himself. 'What's so terrible about touching my sweaty flip-flops, pulling them of my feet and placing them aside the table, huh? You don't even have to touch my feet to do it, in case you're terrified about that. You made such a big deal out of it, and now look where it brought you. You were stupid enough to think, that you could throw me out of here, how idiotic is that, hahaha. If you had just given in to this friendly request none of this had happened, stupid weakling.' <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou want to scream out of shame and humiliation, as this is an obvious lie.

Do you want me to apologize because my feet stink, huh? Do you really expect me to do that?? Who do you think you are, judging other people by of the smell of their bodies??'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith this he releases your head, grabs you by the hair again and starts delivering another series of hits to your face. SLAP SLAP SLAP SLAP SLAP SLAP SLAP!! As he does this you start losing it. Your last reserves of energy are gone, you can not keep it together anymore and start to cry out of feelings of utter humiliation that came along with this merciless demonstration of power. Realizing your whatery eyes Josh stops the beating, looking at you with fake concern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Oooh, look at you, crying already? Haha. That'll teach you to make remarks about my smelly feet. The slapping was just meant to put you in your place, you know, because I knew you couldn't take some man-sized punches, but you're crying now already? What a disappointment you are, loserboy, hahaha...' he says, savoring the scenery without losing his confident calmness. 'That's the thing about a real man's feet, you know? A man's walking around all the day, and he's sporting, it's hot, and then his body is starting to sweat, and especially his feet sweat a lot and they start to smell. That's totally natural, and nothing he should have to apologize for, don't you think, deadbeat?' he says, slowly scratching his balls before rubbing his hand on your face again, smothering you thoroughly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel completely humiliated by now, lying on the floor, having your face roughed up and smothered so casually by a stronger boy who did just spend the last 5 seconds scratching his crotch, and being taught a lesson about sweaty feet while his ones are less than a good kick away from your face. 'You got it, little buddy?' 'Mmmmhmmpf...' 'Oooh, have anything of value to say?' Finally, as he removes his dirty hand from your face you have an opportunity to speak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Please...Josh...I want to...apologize...to you...' You stutter helplessly. Your punisher raises his browes in fake surprise and calmly lets his beautiful dark eyes rest on your face. 'Oh yes? For what?' He really expects an answer. You can't believe it.  'For being rude to you earlier...for not...' You swallow a bit of saliva, meanwhile he finishes your sentence. 'For not removing my shoes when I ordered you to do so.' '...Yes...' you mumblec meekly, deeply ashamed by his choice of words, and a huge, arrogant smile appeares on his face, as he decides to seal the deal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Get your knees up, I want to sit comfortably on you. And go on telling me what you're sorry about.' He ordered. You obey, and he slides back until his ass comes to rest on your stomach, and he can lean against your legs, slowly putting each foot next to one side of your head. His dominant footstench hits your nose again, and a single tear runs down you cheek.

I wish my girlfriend could see this, would make her super horny for sure, hahahaha. But OK, I don't want to be cruel.' with this he slowly moves his foot from your forehead over your temple, to your right cheek, under your chin and on your throat. You gargle as he applies a little pressure, enjoying the symbolic gesture to the full. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I will give you the possibility to give me the proper, thorough apology that you owe me, and afterwards we can be friends again, OK pathetic loserboy? But before that, I just want to hear from you who the winner of our fight is.' 'Aaaarrrgh.. You are!' 'Who?' 'Yoooouuuuu...' 'Yeah, of course I am. As if you had the slightest chance to beat me, weed. Look in my eyes while I am talking to you!' You do, deeply ashamed by the sight of the stronger, younger boy sitting on your stomach, one stinking foot next to your head one right on your throat, his broad upper body leaning forward so his dark eyes could look straight into yours, enjoying himself calmly but with obvious excitement. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'And who are you, weakling?' 'I'm...the loser..' You mumble weakly, as you know that is what he wants to hear. 'Damn right you are. Your hideous attack was no match for my strong muscles and superior technique. You aare no opponent, you are a punching bag, hahahaha.' In your thoughts you beg him to just bring it to an end, to do to me whatever he wants but to do it now, so it would be over soon, but you know he is enjoying this way too much to finish it quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'And what happens when we have a winner and a loser, loser? Don't break your head about this, I'm going to tell you. I bet you're still dizzy from your beatings, haha. When we have a winner and a loser, they play a game. It only has one simple rule: The winner commands, the loser obeys. Do you understand, loserboy?' 'Yes...' You say poorly. 'And I think from now on it would be appropriate if you call me Master, or Sir. Just as a sign of your respect for me, you know, that's a tribute a loser has to pay to someone from who he learned an important lesson.' You feel that it is pointless to argue, as you are playing his game now, and he is making the rules. 'Yes...master...' You whimper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You obey, seeing how Josh slowly puts his right and then his left flip-flopped foot on the living room table, all the while looking at you with extreme confidence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Allright then. Remove my shoes, bitch.' Having a cold shudder running down your back from the tone of his voice you shift your gaze downwards again, sowly walking around the table, touch his left shoe and slowly and carefully pull it off his foot. All the while you look aside the table, as if I could make this act less degrading by paying less attention to it's execution. You carefully place the shoe next to the table, remove his right shoe and place it next to the left. 'Yeah, there you go little buddy. See, was that so difficult? You could have avoided the whole punishment if you had just done what I ordered you to do in the first place.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I know, I am so sorry, Sir.' Josh chuckles in amusement at your humble attempt to please him. 'I think we have fucked around long enough now.' he says and the rudeness in his voice signales you that he is going to get serious now. 'You know what is coming for you now, don't you loserboy?' You do, and you know there is no way you could possibly avoid it. 'Get around the table.' Silently, you do so, until you stand opposite to the couch on which Josh is sitting, your gaze still directed at the floor as you do not dare to look in his eyes. 'On your knees, boyservant.' You obey and have to grimace a little from the strength of the cheesy smell from both his feet that hit your nose, unmercifully knocking it up, kicking it into another sphere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Look at me, loser.' he says calmly. You slowly rise your head, vaguely perceiving two strong, broad feet lying on the table in front of you before your eyes lock with Josh's. He doesn't do anything for a moment, just basks in the symbolic power of this situation as you submissively kneel at his feet waiting for his command.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally it comes, as he scratches his crotch with his left hand, saying:  </span></div></div>",

Your face still red from the slaps and the embarrassment you crawl over to the TV without complaint. 'Put Soul Calibur 3 in your PS2 and bring me the controller. I want to slap some more people around and you look just about roughed up enough already. So let's give your rosy cheeks a small break, shall we? Hahaha...' You turn PS\" and TV on and insert the game, but when you want to crawl back he interrupts you. 'Nuhh, dude. I don't want the controller to touch the ground. Carry it over here with your mouth.' 'Josh, come on...' 'Oh shut up dude, we both know that you're gonna do what I say. Now put it in your mouth and carry it over here.' He grins with a hint of disbelief, as you comply, carry it over to him like a dog with a bone in his mouth and put it down on the couch table next to his feet. <br>\r\n'Now, get me a chair over here. You may use your hands this time, haha.' He puts his hands behind his neck and contently watches you crawl over to the living room table where you remain for a short while, insecure how to continue. You put your hands on it and start to get on your feet, only to be interrupted by Josh again. 'Nuh, guess again, dude.' 'But, you said I could use my hands.' 'Right, but I didn't allow you to get up on your feet.', he grins. 'Ah, come on. Why...' 'Because I say so. You want to argue again? Then just get up on your feet and see what happens.' He looks you dead in the eyes, smirking arrogantly and you look away immediately. 'Good boy.' While watching you awkwardly push the chair over to him on your knees he chuckles condescendingly, and recognizing that he is getting close to cracking up from laughter sends rushes of blood to your head. 'Hhhh......hahahaha... Look at you... hhhahhh... how sorry you are... hhhahahaha...' he struggles to control himself, as you obediently place the chair next to the couch table, getting more ashamed of your own cowardice by the second. 'Hhhhhh...hhhahaha... Kneel down at my feet again, wimp...  hhhah... and prepare for your apology... hhhha...hhhh...' Josh starts shaking with laughter as you obey and grudgingly await further commands, your face mere inches away from his smelly feet. <br>\r\nAfter laughing about you some more he finally manages to calm down at least a bit. 'Hhhhahaha... huuuuuuh...' he breathes out deeply and starts to speak again. 'Look up. Look at my feet, dude... hhha... ready to apologize? Hhahaha... If you want to do yourself a favour, then bow forward, take a good, deep whiff and remember it well... h... because my feet are the most pleasant thing you're gonna smell until you're done apologizing.'<br>\r\nHe see the ball of his left foot approach as he pushes his closer, stopping about an inch from your baffled face. You inevitably take in a whiff before moving your head to the side in disgust and confusion which makes Josh crack up again. 'Uuuuugh...' 'Hhhhh... hhhhahahahh... hhhhhaha... Last chance, boy, hhhh... do yourself a favour hhh... hhhhahaha...' ~No way...~ you think. 'Josh, look... just let me apologize now and let's get this over with. What do you want me to do, man...' Your head turned away to avoid his foot you hear Josh get up from the couch more than you see it, and his hand grabbing your hair catches you by surprise. 'Aahh.. look.. I'm sorry I...' you try again, but are quickly cut off. 'Shut up dude... hahaha... hhh... sorry... hhha... but I'm still trying to get over how pathetic you are hhhh....hahahhhh....' Still trying to control his laughter your bully effortlessly ignores your attempts to fight back, manouvers you behind the chair and has you sit down facing away from it with a solid push against your shoulder. <br>\r\nFor a short moment you are on eye-level with his shorts again before Josh jerks your head backwards and pushes it into the free space in between the chair's seating area and it's backrest until the back of your head rests on the cushion and you find yourself looking upwards towards the ceiling. 'Josh...' 'Shush.... hhh... hahaha...' All of a sudden his muscular shape appears in your field of vision, standing above your face legs apart ready to take a seat, laughing down at you and enjoying his power-trip. <br>\r\nFor a second your eyes lock and you want to open your mouth, but half along the way you recognize that you have no idea what to say. Then he sits down harshly and abruptly, using your face as his personal cushion, firmly covering your mouth is with his ass and burying your nose under his balls. You can smell his intimidating scent immediately and start to flail your arms around helplessly in an attempt to push him off, while shouting at him with full force. But your efforts are futile and Josh remains firmly seated on your face not moving an inch, while your screams are easily muffled by his muscular ass. 'Mmmmmmmppppppfffff!!! Mmmmmmmmmpf....' Josh just looks down at you smugly, meeting your muffled protest with a new wave of laughter. 'Hhhhh... hhhahah.... hahahahhhh...yeah... hahahh... now you're allowed to talk again. Try arguing again with me now, bitch! Hahahahahahhhhh...' <br>\r\nYou fight desperately as his scent forces his way into your nose and gets more and more overwhelming by the second. He is a clean guy, but it is a hot day, and he has been sweating. 'Mmmmmmmppffffff!!!' you scream again in humiliation but Josh doesn't move an inch. 'Mmmppfff...' 'Hahaha... like that? Eh?? Answer me, bitch!! HAhahaha... hhhh. Damn you're pathetic dude, hahaha. But look, here's how we're gonna do it. You still owe me an apology, hahahaha... So if you want me to let you up again you better stop whining, take your punishment like a man, and accept your place! Because you damn sure won't get up until you have properly apologized and shown me the respect I deserve!' Josh declares as he glares down at you smugly and self-confidently. 'Answer me!!' he demands arrogantly. 'Mpf...' you meekly mumble into his ass.<br>\r\n'Hahahaha... pathetic! Hhhhhh..haha... Now, enjoy the scent, wimp. Hahaha... hhhh...' With this Josh grabs the PS2-controller and starts gaming, and no amount of flailing your arms, trying to push him off or mpfing into his butt gets you any of his attention, as you get more lightheaded and weaker by the second, inhaling more of his potent scent with each breath you take. It is hopeless. You face the humiliating truth. A guy two years younger than you has easily subdued you and now your face will serve as his lowly cushion, your nose buried in the crotch of his shorts, ignored, for as long as he feels like it. Until you have taken your punishment and apologized properly.<br>\r\nTime passes slowly while you can do nothing but listen to the sounds of the fighting game he's playing, obediently sniff his crotch and consider how to apologize to end this degrading ordeal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally you decide to try to apologize by...</span></div></div>",

'What a rude thing of you to judge other people for something as natural as the smell of their bodies. How can I avoid getting my feet sweaty, huh? Don't you actually know anything about the human body?' he snarls down at you. 'That's what happens when guys are guys, being on their feet, walking around all the day, doing sports. Than a guys feet start to sweat and they start to smell. It's unpreventable. Who do you think you are to judge me on this?!' <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel desperate. Though you degraded yourself enough to admit that he was right beating you up you do not feel him replying friendly or with gratitude. Instead he just seems to talk himself in rage. 'I know Josh... I am sorry...' you stutter helplessly. 'That's not going to cut it, boy. You still have some begging to do. If you want me to stop beating you you better admit, that I am superior to you, since I handled your pathetic ass so easily.' He lets go of your hair and slowly starts walking around you, as you hang your head in shame. 'Yes, Josh... I admit that you are... superior to me...' you stammer. 'How do you know, loser?' he sneers. 'Because you...' you desperately look for words to put this mildly, but you know what he wants to hear. '...beat me up...so easily...' 'Hahaha, right, loser. You were not an opponent, but you made a pretty good punching bag. Maybe I'll come back on that use of yours later, haha. Now, who won our fight?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'You, Josh...'. 'And who is the loser?' 'I am...' you reply silently. 'Say it properly, boy.' he demands, and you obey, humbly admitting 'I am... the loser...'. 'Hahahaha, you really know your place now, right loser? How appropriate, haha.' he chuckles, as you crumble in shame. 'Now, to come back to your rude remarks about my feet.' he slowly stops his walk in front of you, self-confidently propping his hands on his hips. As your head is still bowed you cannot see the look of self-assured dominance on his face, only his strong feet stopping right in your line of sight, and you shudder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'So, loser, do I have to repeat my lecture about respecting other peoples bodies, or do you think that you got the message by now?' Josh asks sarcastically, and his words make you feel like a stupid child, having just received a lecture from his parents. Only did your parents never beat you to teach you anything, and they did never humiliate you to prove their supremacy. Yet now here you are, kneeling in front of a 16 year old boy having been beaten up, and lectured about respecting his sweaty feet, forced to stare at them right now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'No... I respect the fact that... you have the right to decide about your body... and about whether it should smell... I respect that your feet smell... And I should not have complained about it... I am sorry Josh...' you whimper, as he chuckles at your humble attempt to please him. You dare not to raise your gaze and to look Josh in the eyes, so you just keep your eyes down, directed at his feet. By now you can vaguely smell them again, the feet of the boy that beat you up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can not help but think back at the moment when he kicked you in the face. It all happened so quickly, so surprisingly that you had no chance to react. You did not think that it could happen so fast, but all of a sudden the lowest part of his body was in your face and his scent forced it's way into your nostrils. How humiliating to be treated like that, and seconds later it was over, you were defeated and the boy laughed at you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd now you are obediently kneeling at his feet. Having a close look at them for the first time, you wonder how a boy his age could have feet like these. Josh is a fit boy, but even in relation to the rest of his body his feet are looking remarkably strong. Not that they are looking extremely big, but firm, strong, functional, and in relation to the overall size of his body extremely broad. 'Not surprising that these tools sweat a lot...' you catch yourself thinking, as Josh's voice gets you back in the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'So you're sure you don't mind the scent of my feet? Because I would not want to make you feel the least bit unconfortable, boy.' your tormentor mocks. 'No... I don't mind it... It 's completely natural for a guys feet to smell...Nothing to feel uncomfortable about...' you reply, completely shattered, knowing that your words don't make a difference anyway. 'That's what happens when guys are guys, right loser?' Josh rubs it in. 'Yes...' 'Say it.' he commands. 'That's... what happens when... guys are guys...' you obediently reply. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel the rough touch as his right grabs your head by the chin, lifting it up, shifting your gaze upwards to his crotch, stomach, and the broad upper body to finally meet his eyes, confidently and totally aware of his dominance looking down at you as you kneel at his feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

Then, with a casual but solid push he drives you on your back, and as you fall your gaze shifts towards the ceiling. The next moment your opponent appears above you, as he slowly walks around you and places his right foot on your chest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment he just enjoys the situation, and you turn your head to the left side. 'So, you don't mind the smell of my feet, do you?' you hear and the pressure on your chest eases. You shyly turn your head to see what happened, and catch a glimpse of Joshs mighty foot about five inches from your face. 'Good. then smell it.' he says, and his foot comes crashing down on your face. You try to turn your head away, but you are too slow, and the ball of his foot plants itself firmly on your nose. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mouth opens and you want to protest, but this mercyless demonstration of power makes you loose your breath. The cheesy stench of his masculine foot forces itself into your nose and you begin to struggle. 'Hahahaha, you don't mind the smell of my feet, right?' Josh chuckles evily. Your struggles get more desperate, and in the attempt to break out of this degrading position your right hand wraps around his ankle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs a result the pressure on your face only increases. 'I thought you don't mind the scent of my sweaty feet, and now you are fighting against it? What a bad boy, have you been lying to me?' Josh smirks arrogantly. 'Get your hand away and take this treatment like a man. Otherwise you will regret it believe me, buddy.' he threatens.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe strength of the footstench in your nose becomes almost unbearable, and the strong foot on your face holds you firmly in place.

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">Okay people, this story is going to be primarily a Male on male story. The focus is not on sex (although it is explicitly not taboo), but on scenarios about various forms of domination and humiliation, at the moment mainly involving Steve being beaten up, verbally dominated and foot-dominated. (Other things I have in mind right now include foot smelling, kissing, licking, body or muscle worship, facesitting, ass and crotch kissing, pissing, faceslapping, beatings, wrestling and fighting domination, use as sparring dummy, punishment lectures and verbal humiliation, bondage or objectification, to name just a few.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI'd be glad to see you contribute to the story with the existing or with new characters (also females), but please don't delete any of the two main characters from the story or make them passive side characters for too long. <br>\r\nAlso, if you want to contribute, please abstain from the following:<br>\r\nscat, severe injury, blood, girlification, sissification or diaper-play, shrinking or magic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApart from that do, what you want and try to keep it descriptive and alive (So please no one-liners, if possible).<br>\r\n(I added a lot of 'other' categories, because most of the time I'm only allowed to post two alternative paths at the ending of the chapter. Feel free to enter and write on especially the 'other' categories, but be sure always to create a new 'other' subcategory to ensure the possibility to developing the story in different ways.) <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Bytheway</b>, If you have ideas about how you would want the story to progress or what you would like to see happen in general, about what kinds of characters you would like to see introduced or about specific things being done or said, then please don't hesitate to PM and tell me. I'm not judgmental and always curious for input. So if you don't feel like writing yourself and your idea tickles me enough, I might just do it for you :).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFINAL DISCLAIMER:<br>\r\nI'm writing about this stuff because it pushes my sexual buttons, NOT because I am advocating people should give in to their dark and destructive impulses and endorse them as a foundation for how to live their life on a daily basis. Kink responsibly, distinguish playtime from reality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis being said, I hope this story may appeal to some of your dark sides, and that you enjoy reading, reviewing and writing it.<br>\r\n(And if you do, feel free to check my tumblr-blog where I might post from time to time - <a class=\"blue2roll\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.tumblr.com/blog/redhead3710\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.tumblr.com/blog/redhead3710</a> )</td>",
