Just yesterday, Charlie had managed to find a Golden Ticket that had been hidden in one of the millions of bars of chocolate that Wonka had sent out. This particular contest had thrown the whole world into an uproar because the grand prize that the Golden Tickets had promised was a rare look inside the factory. The note on each ticket read as follows:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Greetings and Congratulations to the lucky finder of this Golden Ticket from Mr. Willy Wonka! You are cordially invited for a special tour of my prized factory to take place on the first of October at exactly Nine A.M. and DO NOT BE LATE. You are formally and sincerely requested to come alone to the front gates of my factory at precisely the time stated. A world of surprises and wonder await you, but you must bring this ticket in order to enter. Congratulations again and rest assured you will have a time you will never forget!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharlie stopped for just a moment to check the time on the big clock in the town square, exactly ten minutes to nine and the factory was just on the next block. Charlie quickened his pace and double-checked his pocket to feel the Golden Ticket again, just to convince himself that it wasn't a dream, but in spite of the fact that it wasn't, Charlie still couldn't believe how quiet it was. Despite it being such a big day, there wasn't a soul in site. No children on their way to school, no shop keepers opening up for the day, simply no one at all. Charlie finally tuned the corner and saw.... </span></div></div>",

One was a rather chubby boy with brown hair, dressed in a black shirt and shorts and matching shoes. Another boy was there, the shortest member of the crowd, was dressed in a cowboy outfit, complete with hat and gun in a holster by his side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Clearly the dramatic type.\" Charlie thought to himself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other two were girls of about the same age and height, but upon closer inspection, they seemed to be polar opposites. One was wearing a red dress with white stockings and black shoes, while the other was dressed in a similar fashion, only she was dressed in blue with brass buttons down the front, and a red belt around her middle.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning.\" Charlie said as he approached the group. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning.\" The girl in red said as everyone turned to notice Charlie. \"Do you have a Golden Ticket too? she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Charlie brought out his ticket for proof. \"Did the rest of you win the contest? he asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We sure did.\" said the boy in the cowboy suit. \"I'm Mike TV. What's your name?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Charlie. Charlie Bucket.\" Charlie said as they shook hands. Charlie blushed a little, as he was not used to introducing himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Veruca Salt.\" said the red suited girl as she extended her hand. Charlies' eyebrows lifted as he shock her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Salt? Hey are you related to Salt's Nuts at all?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yes. My daddy's the president. He says the company could be mine one day.\" Veruca replied with a rather jaded smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Violet Beauregarde.\" said the girl in blue, grabbing Charlies attention and his hand before he could put it down again. \"That over there at the gate is Augustus Gloop. He got here first and all he can talk about is chocolate.' She said with a smile. \"Personally I want to know if there's any gum to be found in this place.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"BONG!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe little crowd jumped as the clock in the center of town started to chime off the hour of nine. Everyone looked around but there was still no one to be seen, when suddenly the gate swung open by itself, revealing a path through a large courtyard ending at the front door to the factory. Before the other kids could process what happened, Augustus tore down the path straight towards the factory, the kids right after him. Just as they reached the front door, it swung open revealing....  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

Or this tour is gonna be shorter than a Saturday morning cartoon.\" Mike said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe five children made their way to the door, Augustus reaching it first. Upon closer examination, the door appeared to be a large heavy constructed almost sole of metal that had been painted black with only a single handle to indicate that it could open at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hurry, hurry!  I smell something!\" called out the excited boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharlie lifter the handle on the door and pushed on the door, which opened with considerably less ease than was expected, but what was on the other side of the door that was the most surprising. As the kids walked into the room beyond, their eyes grew big at the site that awaited them. Giant mushrooms that dripped with whipped cream and custard, giant lollipops sprouted from the ground, candy canes and giant gummy bears grew on trees, and running through the room was a river, a literal river, of liquid chocolate! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door closed behind the kids and they looked at each other, and all at once they scattered! Charlie grabbed a candy cane off of the first bush he could reach, Veruca began to scoop some cream off of a nearby mushroom, Violet set to work on getting a giant gummy-bear out of a tree, Mike chose a lollipop, and Augustus...</span></div></div>",

Let the others have the little things, he was going for the big prize. Augustus charged headlong for the miracle of confections and practically fell on the riverbank. The greedy boy dipped his lips into the brown ambrosia and the instant it hit Augustus's taste buds, he heard a rhapsody!  Augustus had tasted hundreds of tasty things in his life ,but nothing in the world could've prepared him for this! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAugustus's hand brushed against a strange plant growing next to him and noticed that the plant was actually a bundle of multicolored straws. Grabbing one, Augustus stuck it as far down into the river as it would go, and began to drink. Every sip of the lake was pure bliss as it made it's way down his throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe this place isn't so bad after all.\" said Veruca as she licked the cream from her lips. <br>\r\n\"Yeah, even without a guide, I could stay here a while.\" said Mike <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then that the others noticed that Charlies' mouth was hanging open. Everyone's gaze shifted towards the river and Augustus and they were all met with a most peculiar site. Augustus was still greedily slurping up the chocolate from the river, but he looked decidedly heavier than he did earlier, in fact he looked rounder! In fact he seemed to be getting bigger right before their eyes! Augustus's belly was already impressive, but it was beginning to fill out his shirt at an alarming rate. Also his back was rounding out. Not one of the other children could bring themselves to speak a word as they watched this peculiar change come over their companion. Augustus continued to drink from the magical river without noticing the effects on his body, not even when his limbs began to be absorbed by his expanding mass. His arms were pulled in up to his wrists, and his legs all the way up to his ankles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, this was not the only peculiar change to be noticed about Augustus. The others had to blink and rub their eyes at the fact that as Augustus was now being elevated off the ground by his expanding body, Augustus's shoes seemed to be showing signs of strain. Before the observers could properly comprehend the absurdity of what they were seeing, there was a mighty \"POP\" and the tested shoes exploded off of their owner, exposing a pair of giant feet that were swelling as fast as the rest of the boy was! Augustus grew and swelled and ballooned until at last, the straw was lifted out of the river by the elevation of the boys head from the ground. There in the place of Augustus Gloop, the greedy boy who thought only of eating, was a gigantic black-clad orb with a little head on one end and a massive pair of bare feet on the other, which gad grown so much that they were as long as their owner was wide and to scale across!</span></div></div>",

An enormous ball with a stubby pair of hands, a giant pair of feet, and a seemingly tiny chubby head, laying on on its side, or rather Augustus' former front. Veruca was the first to find her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha... What on earth?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened?\" Mike asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMotivated by curiosity, the little group approached the swollen boy and saw that Augustus was still furiously sucking away with the straw in between his lips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like he's still hoping for the best.\" commented Violet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold on, listen!\" Charlie said suddenly. In spite of the nearby rushing river and chocolate, as well as the whistling noise of Augustus slurping through his straw, the sound of footsteps was in the air, and they were making enough noise to signal the coming of a small army!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Quick, hide and we'll  see who it is.\" Ordered Veruca.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about Augustus?\" Asked Charlie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Leave him there! He's too big to hide!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharlie and the others gathered behind a large bush that had Gummi Bears growing on it, and peaking out from behind a lime-flavored one, the remaining four golden-ticket-winners watched in silent perplexity as eight truly bizarre figures came into view. Each of them was no more than three feet tall and each was dressed identically in white overalls and brown shirts with striped collars and cuffs as well as matching stockings and shoes. However. the most amazing aspect of the strange little men was that each of them sported a orange face and bright green hair! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who are those little guys?\" asked Violet. <br>\r\n\"Do you think that they work here?\" asked Mike<br>\r\n\"That would make about as much sense as anything else?\" replied Veruca.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy now the odd little workers had surrounded the Augustus ball and were examining him from all angles. Augustus himself had finally started to take stock of his current situation just as a strange music began to fill the air. Charlie and the others looked around the room for some sort of source, but found none as the odd little figures started to sing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOompa Loompa, do-ba-dee-doo,<br>\r\nI\u2019ve got a perfect puzzle for you.<br>\r\nOompa Loompa, do-ba-dee-dee,<br>\r\nIf you are wise you\u2019ll listen to me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDrinking and drinking from river so sweet,<br>\r\nin-flates you in-to a ball with huge feet.<br>\r\nYour appetite has sure taken it's toll,<br>\r\nand now you have to roll, roll, ROLL!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(While we tickle your big feet.) <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOompa Loompa, do-ba-dee-da,<br>\r\nGiven good manners you will go far.<br>\r\nYou will live in happiness too, <br>\r\nlike the Oompa Loompa, do-ba-de-do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd to the amazement of the hidden watchers, The group of workers began to roll the big footed ball of Augustus down a pathway which led behind the waterfall. As soon as they were gone and the kids emerged from their hiding place, they all pondered their next move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Should they split up or stay together?</b> </span></div></div>",

Work progresses.\" There was also a tacked-on bit of clear plastic with dates, times and other obscure data scrawled in bright orange wax pencil, likely by whomever was experimenting with or tending the grass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What an odd idea,\" said Veruca, liking the sound of it. If she hadn't worn tights for the outing, she'd have given it a proper try right then. She considered at least kicking her shoes off for a bit, and then blinked to consider the shoes themselves. The black leather Mary Janes had taken on a markedly blue tint that couldn't possibly be a trick of the light, as Veruca regarded them from several angles in surprise. Even more intriguing, she could see that her white stockings were turning the very palest shade of blue, the effect crawling over her ankles at a snail's pace but unmistakably rising.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So now I'm to turn blue before I get out of this place?!\" Veruca demanded of the empty room, not putting much venom in it; the idea seemed more amusing than outrageous. Licking her lips, she was shocked and pleased to discover a faint taste of blueberry. What a wonderful effect! Astonishment somewhat smoothed away the rough edges of her spoiled brattiness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn her fascination, Veruca made up her mind to...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"All the same,\" Veruca said aloud, \"I'd as soon be on my way out of this place altogether.\" She was remembering the fate of Augustus and wondering if perhaps this creeping blueness in her tights wasn't a prelude to a similar outcome.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThree resolute steps from the plaque, Veruca stopped as a remarkably pleasant feeling encompassed her feet, rather like having a good stretch after wearing shoes all day. A look down revealed her stockings were now pale blue to the shins, but nothing appeared out of order. That delightful sense of foot stretchiness continued, seeming to redouble with every step she took. Another three steps, and Veruca couldn't ignore the fact that her feet were bigger - and her shoes and tights along with them, apparently, as there was no sense of binding or restriction. Proceeding with slight squeaks and rubbery ease, Veruca promoted her wide smile to open laughter, wriggling her toes with satisfaction even as her feet and shoes expanded to the size of swimfins. She might have felt a little concerned about this development if her foot growth hadn't felt so thrummingly, elastically comfortable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust at the moment her foot size was becoming an obstacle to easy steps, a five-string banjo launched into a breakdown overhead, likely in that windowed gallery. Casting a suspicious look back and up, Veruca still couldn't see anyone. It was probably one of those little guys from earlier. Her smile diminished to a smirking scowl. What had they sang earlier, rolling Augustus off? \"<i>While we <b>tickle</b> your big feet</i>.\" It hadn't made an impression on her before but, now that she had some sizeable feet herself, Veruca gulped. Foot expansion might be a strangely congenial experience, but foot <i>tickling</i> didn't strike her as a welcome conclusion to an enjoyable stroll.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not <i>me</i>, you won't!\" Veruca declared, making determined (if somewhat clumsy) strides for the door that led out. A fiddle took over for the banjo, the music mocking her. Nevertheless, shoes now the size of generous cradleboards, Veruca made the steps up and out with grace and speed, pivoting her heels so the door could swing open between her gigantic feet. While she might be ungainly in the short term, Veruca could feel herself getting accustomed to her new feet, however physically impossible the entire affair seemed. She thought she could put on a burst of speed if her surroundings allowed for it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPrepared to sprint to freedom, Veruca looked through the open door to see...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"How on earth?!\" Veruca complained, finding herself right back where she'd started. She was, once again, immediately across the river from the passageway she'd first explored. The hallway had been ruler-straight, so how had she gotten turned around so easily?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if on cue, Mike came back downstairs, Violet emerged from the bushes, and Charlie walked out from behind the waterfall. Had they all been misdirected as well? Perhaps they were being toyed with, offered escape where none was possible. Looking down, Veruca saw her feet had decided to call a halt at the size of dugout canoes. Not literally, but they <i>seemed</i> that big. They were in fact as long as she was tall and, for all their comic dimension, still retained a certain dainty symmetry. Veruca went up on tiptoe and felt like a giant, amazed at the continuing facility of her giant feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharlie, Mike and Violet gathered around, each having been prepared to jabber about their lack of success in finding an exit only to instead jabber about the condition of Veruca's feet. Rather than being embarrassed, Veruca was quite foot-proud and showed them off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I could probably kick through the walls at this point, if I wanted to,\" Veruca informed the others with a grin of self-satisfaction. She attempted an abbreviated kick with her right foot just to show she could... and her right shoe fell off with a solid \u00ab<b><i>clump</i></b>!\u00bb, nearly landing on Mike.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, watch it with those!\" Mike complained, unholstering his cap pistols.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll squash you like a bug!\" Veruca teased, smirking. Mike bailed into her discarded shoe for cover and came up firing, seeming to think his intent trigger-pulling would be enough to lay her out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Something's happening!\" Violet observed, peering at Veruca's feet. \"Your stockings are blue, by the way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hadn't noticed!\" Veruca shot back, rolling her eyes. All the same, things did suddenly feel a bit strange. Wiggling her toes about, Veruca felt a sort of crackling in her stockings and heard an alarming creak from her left shoe. It was as though the juicy bluegrass had saturated her footwear, but now she was drying back out and the shoe and stockings weren't up to their task. Veruca actually had time to explain both her theory and encounter with the grass before her left shoe sundered into leathery fragments and her stockings peeled apart like onionskin, leaving her barefoot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My feet are blue, by the way!\" Veruca told Violet before the other girl could beat her to the punch. And they were, though only as palely blue as the stockings had been. The pampered and pedicured Veruca had no qualms with their appearance even now, but Violet was provoked to conduct other than admiration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get her!\" Violet shouted, pouncing. Mike didn't need any further encouragement, leaping out of Veruca's right shoe and joining in. Charlie stood by, baffled, until Veruca landed on her backside and started squealing with laughter, at which point he smiled and joined in as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop this at <i>once</i>!!\" Veruca commanded in her most patrician snarl, but the effect was muted as she had to catch her breath between giggles and guffaws. Her big feet had made her feel superpowered just minutes before, but now betrayed her completely. She couldn't stand up, couldn't run, couldn't jump, and couldn't even knock that irritating Beauregarde girl to the ground when she swung a sole at her. Having been a little awkwardly kayakish before, now Veruca's feet were like boat anchors. And there was no safe harbor among these six hands!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kitchie kitchie kitchie!\" said Mike, taking the time to gloat down at Veruca between tickle attacks. Charlie and Violet offered no verbal hectoring, but instead shared laughter as they had fun demolishing Veruca.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVeruca, despite being ticklish, wasn't accustomed to being tickled. Her brattiness had long since made such gentle playfulness impossible with her parents, and anyone not related to her generally had an urge to sock her rather than tickle when she was having one of her tantrums. But in this instance, Veruca's famous temper deserted her completely. While she was more than happy to kick, wiggle and flap her gigantic feet around in a futile attempt to protect them, she did so in what was, for her, a curiously rageless fashion. With her eyes squeezed shut and tears rolling down, Veruca had to admit to herself that it was just a little fun... while remaining an intolerable annoyance and assault on her dignity, of course. She at last quit with all her twisting, fist-swinging and head-banging to finally lie back in helpless laughter. A crease of tickish torment settled over her brow in mute appeal for respite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She got tickled til she gave up!\" Mike shouted in triumph, hands on his knees as he bent to regard the submissive Veruca.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She should have to beg for mercy first,\" said Violet, making as though to get back to tickling but actually waiting for Veruca to blubber out a plea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, now what's going on?\" Charlie asked, having noticed something.</span></div></div>",

I wonder where these stairs go?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFollowing her inner voices, Verruca ascended the stairs until she came to a room that had a large picture window with a series of control panels underneath it. Looking out of the window, Verruca was able to get a full view of the strange golf course below. Veruca remembered that she hadn't noticed any windows in this area when she was down in the golf course, and she realized that this must be a one-way window so that whomever was working these controls would have a good view of anyone in the lower room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis caused the wheels to start turning in Verruca's' devious mind and she decided....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   </span></div></div>",
