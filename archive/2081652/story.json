You ignored it, mistaking it for a brief draft. What else could it be, right? Oh how wrong you were, and didn't even know it yet... How could you know that this was the start of something bigger than anyone would have guessed? You were just your average American teenager with long brown hair, green eyes, and...admittedly a little paler skin than what might be considered healthy. Your mom always said that you should get out more, instead of sitting behind a computer monitor all day playing Minecraft, World of Warcraft, and whatnot... You couldn't help that you liked making things in Minecraft, or beating the pants off some poor sap in PvP with your level 85 death knight when you weren't partaking in a raid and keeping your party from being wiped with the very same death knight. (the irony of your character keeping her comrades from death despite her class' name being death knight wasn't lost on you) But when you did go out, your personality made sure you did not go unnoticed...despite the lack of any significant curves to speak of yet. Perhaps puberty will change that once it finally hit, although you were unaware that it was beginning to do so right now...and may never stop... Your maid, Beverly, noticed that you had just been standing there, motionless as a rock aside from the shudder earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Miss Megan? Is everything alright?\" She asked in her ever friendly, calm tone with a slight tinge of concern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're snapped out of your thoughts and reply, \"Oh! It's nothing, Beverly, thank you. Although I must admit, I had the strangest dream last night...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeverly gave a slight inquisitive look as she asked you, \"Really? Do tell, Miss Megan. I would like to hear what it was.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou described your dream...</span></div></div>",

I have no idea how I got there, but then I felt really good. When I looked down at myself, I had boobs! Honest to goodness boobs! And then... I...\" You trailed off, not quite sure how to put the next part.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeverly continued with her slight inquisitive look, tilting her head as she asked, \"And then you...what? You can't just leave this intriguing tale on a cliffhanger, Miss Megan. What happened?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sighed and then continued to describe your dream with, \"I...started growing. Slowly at first, as I didn't notice what was happening until I started looking down at some boy. I think he might have been in his senior year, so maybe three years older than me? Anyway, once I noticed that I was growing, everyone started to run away from me as it picked up in speed. Soon I was as tall as the tallest skyscraper, and then my body started destroying everything in sight as I continued to get even bigger... And then, just before my head outgrew the atmosphere...I woke up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeverly's smile faded after hearing out the rest of your dream. While she was aware that you secretly always wanted to grow bigger, especially in the curves department which you sorely lacked aside from a very slight pudginess in your belly, (hours exercising your fingers on a keyboard =/= actual exercise) your maid was concerned about what were to happen should that desire become reality given the description of your latest dream. She cleaned off the table from your breakfast together earlier, (you had insisted that she have her meals with you since the first time you met her. She was like family to you, and wished for her to feel the same) and proceeded to the kitchen to attend to the dishes. You followed her, knowing that when her smile faded, something troubled her. Finally, Beverly voiced what was eating at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, you dreamed that you had become a destructive giantess. Do I have that right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded slowly, and then responded worriedly, \"Yes. Beverly, you know I would love to become a giantess, or even just a little bit taller. But never, and I mean never on my grandmother's grave, would I want to be the destructive kind. That dream scared me for what I could do like that... But thankfully, that sort of thing never happens in real life, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you discussed the matter with Beverly, you noticed that your pitiful excuse for a bra and panties were starting to feel a tad...uncomfortable. You put it off as being effectively the same bra and panties you've had since you were twelve or thirteen. What was the point in buying new ones when the old ones still fit? Unconsciously you fiddle with the straps a little, completely unaware that your virtually flat chest and backside were beginning to gain a semblance of definition. And that you had gained another inch, putting you at 5'10. \"Huh, this bra fit just fine when I put them on this morning...\" You mumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour thirty-five year old maid returned to her usual smile. With this development, she saw an opportunity to get you out of the house and away from your computer monitor, if only for a little while. She said, suggesting, \"Perhaps it's time for you to go shopping for new clothes? By the sound of it, your old ones are on their way out, Miss Megan.\" Beverly then put the now clean and hand-dried dishes away where they belonged, then proceeded out of the kitchen to perform more of her duties. You decided to...</span></div></div>",

You had planned on playing some Minecraft, but really that could wait. Besides, even a gamer girl such as yourself needed to get out and interact with the real world. So you reluctantly hopped into your limousine, (you aren't old enough to drive, and you disliked flaunting your fortune for fear of being labelled with the stereotypes that go with it. Or gaining 'friends' that just stuck with you because you had money and lots of it) and told the driver where to go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The mall, please. And please park in the usual spot once we get there.\" To which the driver nodded in his rear view mirror and replied, \"Of course, Miss Megan.\" before he started the engine and drove to the mall. On the way, your body imperceptibly grew another inch, putting you at 5'11 now though you were still oblivious to, and you chest and butt swelled out a teensy bit more to which you were also oblivious to aside from the further discomfort from your bra and panties. Now, if these five inches gained so far had happened all at once, you might have noticed something by now...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the limo arrived at the mall, the driver parked it in the back parking lot as far out of the way as possible, as per your usual request. Unfortunately, your best friend Sara saw you getting out of the limo. You were letting yourself out as you didn't want to waited on hand and foot all the time; once in a while was more than enough, though you could never honestly say that the limo ride was ever unpleasant... Still, you hoped she wouldn't recognize you... \"Megan! Megan, is that you? I didn't know that you were rich!\" Sadly, that hope was in vain. You turned to her, and not knowing just how close she was, ended up with a face full of her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSara was a towering 6'5, easily the tallest girl in school. Most of the staff had to look up at her. One of the most well endowed girls in school, with DD boobs that left boys pining like puppies should she lean forward in their direction, and wore outfits that teased the very limits of the dress code. Her ass was also nice though nothing to write home about. And with blonde hair and blue eyes, she could be suspected to be a ditzy air-head...except she wasn't. Not the best grades in class, but she was far from brainless. How such a bombshell and a slightly pudgy stick that usually described you became such best of friends, many would never know. The secret was that the two of you had been friends since kindergarten. And even back then she was tall enough to look as though she had been held back a grade.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi, Sara...\" You answered back halfheartedly, once you got your head out of her cleavage. \"Guess my secret's out... Yeah, I've got money and lots of it. But I don't like to flaunt it as then people may get the wrong impression of me. And don't get me started about 'friends', who would only like me as long as I have money to leech from...\" Sara's expression turned to one of understanding. \"So that's why you never invited me to sleep over at your house when we were in grade school? I can certainly understand your concern, but I believe most of the friends you have now like you for you. Just be yourself and don't give a care what anyone else thinks. Now, how about you and I do some shopping?\" You look at her quizzically before she quickly added, \"I'll pay for my own stuff, of course!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling relieved that your best friend wasn't angry at you, you agreed to go clothes shopping. You oddly found it not so hard to keep up with Sara's long strides in her high heels today, but otherwise thought nothing of it. It was Summer, so beach clothes were in, and after buying a couple pairs of somewhat bigger bras and panties, and a few other things, Sara practically dragged you into the swimsuit boutique that was her favorite store and away from Electronics Boutique, your favorite store. She insisted, \"Megan, I was shopping here last week and I saw this cute little outfit that is totally you! If we're lucky, it's still there!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKnowing that you'd get further talking to a rock than convince Sara to let you go, you relented and stayed put in the store until she came back from the back with the outfit she was talking about. \"See? It's totally you!\" She beamed. When you looked at what she brought out, you were alarmed to find that it was...</span></div></div>",

There was no mistaking it: from the shape of the bottom piece to the cupping shape of the top piece to even the thick, slightly darker cyan string that also bordered the bikini, this was exactly the same one. It even looked like it would fit you perfectly! You were completely stunned, and perhaps a tad scared. Was your dream actually a vision of what was to come? That your destiny was to destroy everyone and everything you ever held dear and much of what you didn't necessarily as you outgrew the Earth, and that this...thing was the start of it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSara saw your reaction and looked concerned, asking, \"Is...something wrong? I thought you liked cyan... Well there is that frilly pink swimsuit that I'm sure would look great on you...\" The very thought of wearing anything pink snapped you out of your trance violently. You hated pink with a passion. You didn't care if any of your servants had pink, or even Beverly, but nearly anything pink that by some freak of nature ended up in your room did not last long, and almost immediately found its way to the garbage upon discovery. Your mother tried to put you in a pink dress once when you were little. It was horrible. You muttered out slowly between clenched teeth, shaking in little-seen rage, \"Pink? I...hate...pink...Hate it...hate it...hate it...HATE! IT!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSara, startled for only a moment despite having seen this beast of rage before as it appeared only very rarely, and knowing that it was really almost all bark, just dropped the subject nonchalantly with, \"Ookay then. Forget I said anything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou very quickly calmed back down. Surely an article of clothing couldn't be a harbinger of doom, right? You figured your paranoia was being caused by poking at the Puzzle Box of Yogg-Saron too many times. Besides, you did absolutely love it...maybe you were destined to wear it? You apologize for your outburst and explained your reaction...sort of, with, \"Sorry about that... Never liked that color. As you've just seen, you could say that pink makes me see red! He he he he...he he...he... Okay, bad joke, I know. I had a dream about this very bikini. And I mean this exact bikini. But I'm surprised that it actually exists!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSara, overjoyed that you liked it though a bit surprised to hear that you dreamed of a piece of clothing, (a paladin or death knight's gear certainly, but never something that would exist in real life) insisted, \"Try it on! Maybe you were meant to wear it? Though honestly I would have expected you to be dreaming of taking on the Lich King solo or something like that...\" You decided that it couldn't hurt and took it into the store's change room. While in there, your breasts expanded into a full...A-cup. You were surprised by this development, too surprised in fact to notice you were now 6 foot even. \"Well now I know why my bra was bugging me earlier...It's about damn time puberty started...If I was going to still be flat by the time I'm twenty, I would have paid for breast augmentation. Better fake than nothing, but real ones are more than welcome!\" You said while admiring yourself in the bikini of your dream. As you suspected, it fit PERFECTLY. You stepped out of the change room and gave a twirl before your best friend, asking, \"Well? How do I look?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSara clapped her hands in approval, and said, \"Almost like a goddess! And would you look at that!\" pointing to your boobs. Your mind was still getting used to them despite still seeming flat next to the monsters that were Sara's pair as she continued with, \"My best friend is finally getting a rack of her very own! You've still got a long way before challenging my set of twins, but I'm happy for you! In fact...I'll buy that bikini for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were floored by this news. You had completely expected to get suckered into paying for Sara's haul of clothes once she found out you were loaded, and yet here she was picking up your bill. \"Really?\" You asked, to which Sara nodded and answered, \"Yep! Consider it a belated birthday present! Stupid flu preventing me from coming to school on Friday...and it was the last day of school, too!\" Best. Day. Ever! And now that your secret was out with Sara, you saw no reason why not to finally give her that sleepover. Not that you planned on making this a habit, but this was something special. You returned to the change room and decided to forgo the old bra and panties, as they no longer fit right, and put the rest of your clothes on over top of your new bikini which was much more comfortable. Once out of there, you headed for the counter and handed the inventory control tag and price tag over to the woman working the till. \"I'm wearing this out of your store, and my friend is going to pay for it.\" You explained. The woman considered calling the manager over to see if she was allowed to do that, but since you provided the price tag for her to ring in she treated it just like any other purchase.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA lunch at the food court later, you and Sara were back out in the parking lot. You asked your friend, \"Hey, do you want to finally have that sleepover tonight? Since you know my secret, and I don't want to kill you,\" You joked, and then continued with, \"I don't see any harm in having a guest over. In fact, I think my maid, Beverly, would be happy to have a guest over! And you get a free limo drive, which you might only get to experience on prom night otherwise...and that's like a few years from now! What do you say?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSara was delighted at your offer, but knew that ultimately the decision was not up to her, and said, \"Hang on, let me check with my mom. She drove me up here and would bite my head off if I didn't check in with her...\" She walked over to a blue SUV and asked the older blonde bombshell that was her mom if she could sleep over at your place. She was standing by the door, but even she had to look up at her daughter, though from what you remembered, her dad was a giant of a man at like 6'9. The few boys that succeeded in following your friend home likely peed their pants and ran away screaming like little girls at the mere sight of him, considering he was built like a bulldozer. Finally, Sara returned with her mother's answer.</span></div></div>",

Yes!\" Was Sara's answer. You were so happy you could just faint. You considered calling Beverly to let her know that you'd be having a guest over, but since dinner wouldn't be for another few hours or so, there was plenty of time for her to prepare dinner for three without being informed first. The two of you walked over to your limo and you gently tapped the driver side window to get your driver's attention, who was reading today's newspaper. He turned one eye to the source of the tapping, then calmly folded up the newspaper and unlocked the rear door for you. He was genuinely surprised to see your bombshell of a friend entering after you, and said, \"I see we have an extra passenger. Does she have a name, Miss Megan?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded, and replied with, \"This is Sara. She's my best friend since kindergarten, and she's coming home with us for a sleepover! Home, please, Alfred.\" And with that, Alfred started up the limo once the door was closed and pulled out of the parking lot, headed for your house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the limo pulled in to your house, which was really a small mansion, Sara's eyes went wide. \"So this place is yours, Megan? Wow...\" She remarked in awe. You nodded and responded, \"Yep. All mine. It's been in the family for as long as I can remember.\" Sara turned her head to you in complete shock, saying, \"WHAT?! You live here all by yourself?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...kind of. My mom passed away when I started preschool. Cancer. My dad took it really hard, and one day while I was in kindergarten, he had simply...left. Thankfully, Beverly has taken care of me, and I've been pretty responsible. But enough of that. I want you to enjoy yourself while you're here!\" You said, as Alfred opened the door for you and Sara to exit the limo. You noticed him looking at your friend's chest for a brief moment before he shook his head in disbelief. Those monsters tended to have that effect; either they made people stop thinking with their brains, or made them ponder just how her back didn't give out supporting the twins. You reasoned her father's genes confided impressive strength even in proportion to her stature without having to look like a body builder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeverly was there to greet you when you came in, and was surprised by Sara's presence. \"We have a guest sleeping over. Beverly, this is Sara. Sara, this is Beverly.\" You introduced, to which both women shook hands with each other when your maid offered. Beverly had also noticed something...different about you than this morning. Your chest sticking out farther than she remembered, sure, and she dismissed that as you wearing something better than your old undergarments. But there was something else that she couldn't quite pin down. Nevertheless, she bowed respectfully as she excused herself to prepare the guest room. And give it a much needed dusting. You spotted her putting on a face mask before she disappeared into there. \"Right. That room hasn't been used for awhile...\" You muttered to yourself, to which Sara giggled slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the day went on, you decided to strip down to your new bikini. It really was too nice a day not to, and you wanted to proudly show off what your best friend had bought for you today. The other new clothes were placed in your room...and subsequently ignored. Heck, you were considering returning them, this bikini felt so right for you. Once Beverly finished with the guest room, covered in dust, you showed off the bikini to her. She approved, commenting, \"It looks very nice on you, Miss Megan. Now if you will excuse me, I do believe I require a bath. I trust you can manage on your own for half an hour, correct?\" She winked, knowing very well that you were. You and Sara played in your pool, the latter jokingly confiding her disappointment in the lack of a pool boy to tease, to which you snorted in laughter. As the two of you goofed around in the pool all afternoon, you shrank...in your tummy, that is. The slight pudge from your belly seemed to migrate south and to the back as your butt became curvier in the same amount. As your bikini bottom still fit your body perfectly, you were none the wiser.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDinner rolled around, and you, Sara, and Beverly ate very well. You even managed to convince Alfred to join you three at the dinner table. Sara for her part seemed surprised at how normal everything was presented, but must have reasoned that you didn't care for the fancy treatment and let it be. Despite all the (albeit minor) growing your body had done since this morning, you ate exactly the same you normally would...if not slightly less. After dinner, you played some card games instead of video games like you had originally planned to do today, and you were having a blast! By the time you and Sara were ready to call it a night at 11 PM, you tiredly saw her off to the guest room before heading into your room, and then promptly fell asleep as soon as you hit the bed, too tired to even change into your PJ's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was probably for the best, for they'd surely not fit you through the night. While you slept, you had a similar dream as last night's, but your body grew 3 inches, putting you now at 6'3 Your Pokeball sized breasts ballooned to B-cup, and all the while the bikini continued to fit perfectly. In the morning, Sara went into your room and woke you up giggling like a madwoman. That soon changed as you groggily got up...and up...and up. She then dragged you to the closest bathroom, to which you didn't resist as you wanted to head there anyway, and demanded that you splash your face with water. You did, and then once fully awake you stood back up...then did a double-take at what you saw in the mirror. You were only a full 2 inches shorter than Sara!</span></div></div>",

Your friend Sara, on the other hand, was apparently worried. \"Megan... You're nearly as tall as I am! Even I never grew that much overnight to get to where I am now! Are you alright? Maybe we should take you to the hospital...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou appreciated the concern, but you only felt good. Great, even. You should be feeling achy all over, and yet you didn't. You turned to your friend, looking her effectively in the eye for the first time since...well, ever, and responded, \"I am, thank you, Captain Obvious. I'm fine, Sara. In fact, I don't think I've ever felt this good. And maybe it's just a freak growth spurt and I'm done? Regardless...I don't think any doctor could tell me what's going on. Also...\" You gulped, preparing to spill another secret of yours. Your friend knew this much about you, you may as well abolish this secret as well as you continued with, \"I...kind of like this. Heck, if this never stops I might just love it. I've always wanted to be a giantess. There, I said it. Laughter of such weirdness in 3...2...1...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it never came. Naturally, Sara had no idea that this was your dream as you never told her until just now, but she smiled instead of bursting into laughter. \"Really? You've always wanted to become the biggest thing out there? I suppose that you're also going to tell me you've always been secretly jealous of my walking wet dream of a figure, right?\" You looked away slightly, staying awkwardly silent, which Sara noticed and said, \"Wow. I-I had no idea. I guess you've always been in my shadow, even when we were kids... I liked you because you liked me, not my body exclusively. But hey, as long as whatever is happening to you isn't hurting you, and you're enjoying it, by all means. I want to see YOU gain a figure that puts ME as second-best if you were my size. At least, I'd hope to be able to see it. Would be kind of hard if you don't get there until you're practically dwarfing the solar system!\" She added, and you certainly hoped you would be able to oblige your friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that behind you, you and Sara head for breakfast. Beverly was quite surprised to see your new size, but kept polite about it as she asked, \"Would you like extra for breakfast to go with your added size, Miss Megan?\" You shook your head no and responded, \"No, thank you, extra won't be necessary.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSara raised an eyebrow to this, and asked, \"You sure? You've seen how much I can pack away. You're now nearly as tall as me. Surely you're going to want more food, right?\" To which you answer, \"That's the thing. I don't feel like I want as much as you can scarf down. Oh that poor sap never saw it coming did he?\" You giggled, remembering an eating contest that Sara had won - hands down. The loser ended up becoming close friends with a garbage can for a full minute. Sara laughed remembering her victory before you continued. \"If anything...I'm not entirely sure I want as much as what I normally have. I could probably give you a run for your money, but I don't feel the need. Probably for the best too. If I get as big as Maine, for example, getting enough food would be pretty expensive... Big as Earth and beyond? Forget it. I'm not eating asteroids. I don't have to grow to eat dirt; there's plenty of it right here.\" You and Sara snickered at the joke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter breakfast, you decided to tell of your dream from last night to your friend and your maid. \"I had a dream last night. I was in this bikini - thanks again, Sara, by the way - and in the middle of the city. Only...this time, instead of everyone running away from me and my growth smashing everything in its path, I did...something, I'm not sure what, and people actually turned back around to see me as I outgrew the city. And nothing was harmed, either. I certainly liked that version than the previous one. Gives me hope that if or when the time comes that even the middle of the city starts to get cramped, I may not have to worry about breaking anything or killing anyone...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, you felt something. It wasn't unpleasant, but it was noticeable. Beverly and Sara watched as you grew 6 inches, putting you now at 6'9. For your part, you saw your perspective rise just a little bit. You expected your bikini to feel tight, just like your old bra and panties, but to your surprise it felt no different. \"Did...did I just grow? Sara, stand up please.\" She complied and you stood up next to her. you could no longer look her in the eye - you were looking down at her! \"Holy COW! I did just grow! Now I'm taller than y- uh-oh...\" The feeling returned, and you grew another 6 inches. Your boobs swelled before Beverly and Sara's eyes to C-cup beauties, and you felt your butt become more curvy. Looking at your reflection as best as you could in the TV, you were now 7'3 and remarkably attractive. You couldn't compete with your friend's DD monsters yet, but you proportionately barely had the nicer backside. Sara had to look up considerably to look you in the face, you being 10 inches taller than her now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa...I never thought I'd get to say this to any girl, but...Megan? How's the weather up there?\" You laughed at your friend's joke, the humor not lost on you, before she pointed out, \"Those clothes you bought yesterday are so gonna have to go back. But the weird thing is...that bikini shouldn't still be on you. I bought you that yesterday, before you grew into a basketball player size girl. But...\" You looked down at yourself and easily noticed what she was getting at, finishing her point with, \"But this bikini still fits perfectly. Like it's growing with me even as I improve in areas other than height... At least I'll be decent when I get too big to stay indoors. Not that would want to hide this body now!\" You now decided to...</span></div></div>",

They obviously weren't going to fit you now, and you suspected almost nothing ever would for very long except for your cyan bikini. But the store could use the money more than you ever could, especially once you outgrew most other human needs aside from your subscription services, and...you needed footwear to get into the mall in the first place. They didn't make exceptions for growing girls, not even ones that could look down on NBA players. And you were certain that the few pairs of shoes you did have were much too small.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I should return them. I really should. But unless they've made an exception to the 'no shirt, no shoes, no service' policy for growing girls the size of basketball players that I haven't been informed of...I don't think I'd be getting very far. Hey, Sara? Can I borrow your shoes for a bit for this?\" You said and asked. Sara shook her head and replied, \"Uh-uh. Girl, you're taller than me now. By almost-\" She stopped as you grew another 2 inches, now 7'5\", and then continued, \"Scratch that, a full foot. My shoes aren't going to fit you. And besides that, I've never seen you in high heels so I doubt you've experience walking around in them.\" Sara then joked, \"I know I make them look easy, but they surprisingly take getting used to, and you're gonna outgrow any pair out there before you'd get the hang of something you'll eventually not need.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded in slight defeat, though not upset. Still, you needed something... Beverly cleared her throat to get your attention. \"If I may, Miss Megan? I might have a solution to your lack of footwear problem. Follow me.\" Your maid walked off towards a part of your place that you hadn't been to in some time and you followed. Beverly entered a door, but you bumped your head on the door frame, not quite used to being more than 6 feet tall. \"Ow! Duck, then enter, Megan...you're not 5'6\" anymore...or however the heck tall I was yesterday...\" You mumbled loudly to yourself, earning both your friends snicker of amusement and her sympathy. As it was, she often had to duck a tad to be certain not to bump her head, especially when she was wearing her heels. Nevertheless, you ducked when you tried again to follow after your maid into the cellar. There, Beverly presented you with the biggest pair of sandals you had ever seen. Granted, you never had to visit any 'Big and Tall' specialty stores before, (and still wouldn't due to the whole 'keep growing and growing' thing, which sounded a lot like those Energizer battery commercials in your head) so there might have been bigger sets, but you were still impressed at their size. \"These belonged to your mother.\" Beverly stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My mom was Bigfoot? I don't remember her the greatest...\" you admitted in confusion. Beverly chuckled warmly and then clarified, \"Ho ho, goodness no, Miss Megan! Your mother had created these using breakthrough, cutting edge technologies. She took the details of what had went into them and how they were made to the grave with her, I'm afraid, though she had joked that one of the ingredients had been unobtainium or some variation of that term. However, I remember her telling me that these sandals would always fit a growing woman if she were to wear them, provided that they were worn regularly. She also had admitted that she had made the first pair a tad too large to be practical to anyone, though I suppose now this is no longer the case. I think that it is about time they finally found an owner that would make use of them as more than a mere curiosity, and may serve to safeguard your soles should you unavoidably step on something sharp such as an unusually pointy building.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou giggled slightly over the joke Beverly made, but you regardless still hoped to avoid stepping on buildings as much as possible. Trying the 'magic sandals' as you thought to yourself in humor on, you found them to fit quite comfortably. So far. The true test would be when your next growth spurt hit, a bigger one preferably though you hoped it would hold off until you could get your business at the mall done. But for now at least ,they would work. You thanked Beverly for them and exited to show Sara, remembering to duck and not have a repeat of what happened when you entered. \"Hey, Sara! I think we've solved my footwear problem! You like?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour still bustier friend looked down at your feet to see the golden colored sandals that glittered with a certain magic to them. She looked at your chest, then almost immediately corrected her gaze upward to meet yours. \"I feel like I'm reliving your end from yesterday at the parking lot... You ended up peering into my boobs then, and now I've gotta readjust my view to avoid peering into yours. He he, not that I mind so much. But as for those sandals, I've gotta say they're so you!\" Just then, Sara's cell phone rang. Sara pulled it out to check the number, then answered when it she saw who it was. \"Hang on. Hello? Hi, daddy! What? You and mom decided to head out of town for the week to celebrate your anniversary. Of course it's okay with me, dad, I'm not a little girl anymore. I can stay at Megan's until you guys come back. You could say the experience is growing on me! You two enjoy your anniversary, I insist! Okay. Bye! Looks like I'm free for the week, although these are my only set of clothes other than my swimsuit...*sniff* and I'm not even sure if they'll last me the rest of the day...\"</span></div></div>",

Not to mention that the more you thought about it...you didn't really want the money back. Nor the...'experience' of trying to explain how you grew roughly 17 inches taller at least in less than a day. You smiled inwardly as you came up with a better solution for them, keeping it to yourself for the moment, then turned your attention back to Sara.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well. That will never do... The lack of clothes, I mean. We'll stop over at your place so you can get some changes of clothes, and even a shower if you want, before heading over to the mall.\" You said. Sara however showed a bit of concern, since she was certain Alfred had never driven past her place before, mentioning, \"But my place isn't along the route to the mall... Is your driver familiar with how to get there, and is he-\" You saw where her concerns were going and cut her off with, \"He's going to have to learn how to get there about a week from now to take you back to your place anyway. Alfred may as well learn the way now. That, however, does mean you'll need to give him the directions on how to get there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with the matter settled, you headed for your room to collect the clothes for returning. As you did, you mused that it wouldn't be long before you would become too big to fit in your room. A temporary bed would need to be set up in another location until even that would wind up being insufficient. But you grabbed the bag that had been all but forgotten about yesterday and headed out. Alfred had quite the shock when he saw the 7'5\" you requesting a ride along with Sara, but seemed to at least try to keep a level of professionalism about the matter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To Sara's place, please. She'll provide you with the location and directions if you like.\" you ordered in the same kind manner you usually did, to which Alfred replied, \"V-very well, Miss Megan.\" At that, you were off to Sara's place, with her providing the necessary directions to get to her place. The ride wasn't as comfortable for you as it normally was, but then you had to sit a bit awkwardly to avoid having your head bump into the roof.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, Alfred pulled the limo up to the driveway of Sara's place before you knew it, and she got out to head inside. While waiting for her, you told Alfred where you wanted to head next once Sara came back, and he nodded in confirmation. After about half an hour, you started to feel that sensation from earlier, and while it might have yielded another 2 inches, you made an effort to hold it in for now. You liked growing bigger, that much was true...but not at the expense of further discomfort. When Sara finally returned, she noticed your focus. \"I'm back! Something wrong, Megan?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she let herself into the limo, you answered as you gave the nod for Alfred to go, \"No, just trying to hold my growth in for now. I'll let myself get as big as a Feraligatr after we come back from the mall. If I think of it like holding in the need to pee, it's really not so hard.\" Sara took your word for it and watched the scenery go by the window. It became pretty clear to her though soon enough that the limo wasn't heading for the mall... \"Uh, where are we going? This isn't the way to the mall?\" You smiled and informed her, \"You're right. And that's because I've decided I'm not going to return these after all. The store can use the money more than I can, and the Salvation Army can always use donations. Don't worry, I still intend to go to the mall for some food.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce at the donation drop off, you briefly exited and deposited the clothes in the hope that another would get use out of them then reentered and had Alfred take you and Sara to the mall. A spot closer to the entrance this time, much to his surprise. You and your friend entered, knowing that the time for hiding was behind you. As you walked to the food court, you got a lot of stares from people who would have ignored you before. You loved it, but still kept your growth held in despite it getting increasingly harder to do so. You treated Sara to lunch, and you both effectively ate like queens on junk food, finishing up with a large McFlurry each. And while a bikini and sandals might have been questionable wear for a mall, security seemed unsurprisingly lax about the matter. Regardless, you felt that it was a good idea to head home while you could still hold the growth in. More for the ride home than the people in the mall. You and Sara made your way back out, sadly still without poking into GameStop, and had Alfred drive you back to your place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost as soon as you returned, you immediately opened the door and got out, running out back to your backyard at a speed you'd swear would give Sonic a run for his money. Sara followed, though more out of concern. When she got there, she asked you, \"What's the hurry? Is it something I did?\" You looked to her and answered, \"No, it's my growth. I can't hold it in any longer! Thing is...I'm not sure if my holding it in was a good idea...or a bad one.\"</span></div></div>",

The feeling was almost indescribably pleasurable, like finally letting yourself go to the bathroom after holding it in for hours. You grew the expected 2 inches...and exceeded that expectation as you passed 8 feet without sign of slowing down. You maintained enough self-control to not masturbate in front of your friend, though you'd have no such restraint if you believed yourself alone. Your breasts grew again, now proportionately even bigger than Sara's own monsters, putting them at about E-cup. Your butt filled out more, now unquestioningly putting Sara's to shame. All the while you surpassed 9 and even 10 feet in height. You kept growing until at last the sensation subsided. You slowly stood upright and found yourself at an amazing 15'5\" tall - a whole 9 feet taller than your friend. Impressively, the sandals had kept up with your feet the whole time, and still fit perfectly just like your cyan bikini.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay. So holding the growth in. Bad idea. Just makes me grow even more once I stop. Good to know...\" You uttered in sarcasm. Looking at your body from all possible angles, you giggled as you came to a realization, announcing, \"Hey Sara! I do believe I have done it! I've officially put your body to shame! ...Granted, a chest this big is gonna take some getting used to.\" Sara turned her stupor into a beaming expression at the news. \"Holy cow, Megan, you're right! I'd bet that if they saw you coming, the boys would be too busy drooling over the sight of a smoking-hot giantess to even think to run!\" You respond with, \"You got that right, short stuff!\" and both you and Sara laugh at the joke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSara headed inside to put her changes of clothes away while you pondered on how to get inside your own house...or if you even should try. You were too big for your bedroom now, and you'd be lucky if you could squeeze through any of the doors inside. You'd also likely crush any chair you tried to sit on as they were never meant for 15'5\" tall girls to sit in. And you'd probably bump your head on some of the ceilings inside... Plus, what would happen when you grew again? The problems would be compounded, and you might not even be able to get out, forcing you to wait until you had no choice but to break your way out with your growth. Ultimately, you decided that it was best to stay outdoors. That way you could continue to enjoy the growth without putting anyone inside your home at risk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fortunate thing you found was that even in the 90 degree heat you didn't feel unbearably hot or sweaty. Sure, it felt a little warm, but not so much that you were sweating like a pig. You figured you wouldn't feel cold that much either, not that you planned to go skinny-dipping in Antarctica anytime soon. The Sun's rays also seemed to bother your eyes less, even compared to a normal person who didn't spend much of their time behind a monitor. And on that note, the unfortunate thing that hit you hard was the fact your fingers were much too large to play any of your games. You were starting to see why many giantesses were depicted as going crazy when they grew big...being cut off from their favorite things due to their size, you theorized it was possible that sheer boredom may have driven some over the edge. Of course, this was entirely just your opinion, and was subject to bias.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNevertheless, you resolved not to go down that path. Sara and Beverly, the latter nearly having a heart attack when she saw how big you had grown currently, made things easier by keeping you company and offering meals through the afternoon. But despite your size, you maintained the same amount you ate before becoming so big...though you couldn't help but eat the orange whole as it was much too small to pull the sections apart. And a peach including the pit for similar reasons, though you fortunately didn't feel sick after eating the part of the fruit poisonous to people.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You guys mean a lot to me. You know that, right?\" you tell them. Suddenly, you felt that feeling return. \"What? Again? I take it back. Holding in my growth wasn't a bad idea; it was a stupid idea.\" You back up a bit, as you were uncertain if this would be a small spurt...or another big one.</span></div></div>",

Thankfully not as pleasurable as the last one, so maybe not so big, but then the last one had been held back. Maybe this meant it was going to be an even larger spurt than you initially thought? Either way, you resolved to not try to hold it back as that made matters worse. Instead, you inwardly pleaded with yourself to not destroy your property - or worse, hurt your friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ready or not, here I grow...\" you said as you witnessed your view creep higher and higher, faster and faster. You sat on your hands to ensure they wouldn't work themselves into someplace embarrassing. You grew past the 20 foot mark and didn't seem to be slowing down so you assumed you had a ways to go yet before this was done. Thoughts crept into your head, things like why should I care about what they think of me? I could crush them all if I so chose... Said thoughts were immediately countered with ones like, what am I thinking?! Of course I should care! They're my friends! I refuse to let them - no, anyone or anything be harmed by me! And if you don't like it, voice in my head, then so help me...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"U-uh, Megan?\" you heard Sara say to you, which snapped you out of your thoughts. You looked down and found you had to be at least 30 feet now and still going. Thankfully your bikini and sandals were keeping up, but from what you could discern from your friend's face...she was scared of you. You reply back, hesitantly, \"What?\" as you passed 35 feet. She said, \"Y-you're kind of big... You...you're not planning on, y'know, squashing us all flat or eating us, are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n40 feet passed, then things slowed down finally at 45. At last, everything subsided when you hit 50 feet in height. You brought your foot up over your friend...and then bring it down almost right next her gently as you prepared to stand up. Whatever dark influence tried to sway you to the side of evil and destruction seemed to have been vanquished. Maybe that was what separated the gentle giantesses from the evil ones; succumbing or refusing to bow to that thought of destruction. \"Once you head down the dark path, forever will it dominate your destiny. And you get dental.\" you said, which did little to comfort Sara once you stood to your full height. You stretched, noted the view, almost as if pondering to go into the city to rampage...but finally knelt down in front of Sara and Beverly's scared forms and smiled, saying, \"Guess I'm not getting that dental, then. Though Attack of the 50 Foot Gentle Teen doesn't quite have the same ring to it... Bah, Beverly, tell them to drop the 'Attack of' part for me, will you? My hands are just a bit too big for the phone!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth women breathed a heavy sigh of relief when your joking reassured them that you were still yourself, and hadn't let the power corrupt you. You explained, \"Actually, guys...I have to admit something. For a few moments back there...I felt tempted to go bad. Like I could crush you all if I chose and stuff. But I fought back on that. Because no matter what happens to me...you're still my friends. I refuse to let anyone or anything be harmed by me. Maybe...maybe that's the difference between the dreams of what I did. The first one had me be overwhelmed by the growth and everything got destroyed. The second one I refused to let anything be harmed and nothing was.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeverly was the first to speak after this with, \"Miss Megan, surely these dreams have little meaning. Surely they're just dreams...\" You nodded in admittance. True, little of what was in the dreams played out in real life. But still...you felt as though there was more to them than just being dreams. \"Maybe. But then again, the morning after the first dream, I get pushed to go out shopping. Sara was coincidentally in the right place to see me getting out of the limo, and very coincidentally led me to the very same bikini in my dream. Which, also very coincidentally, happened to fit me perfectly and is somehow growing with me to stay that way. Then this morning after the second dream, I find myself in dire need of footwear, and almost too coincidentally, you provide me with a pair of sandals that just so happen to be able to grow with me and were big enough to fit me at that moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know about you guys, but that seems to be an awful lot of convenient coincidences in that turn of events. I could buy one or two of these as that, but all of them? Yeah, I'm not buying it as coincidence. So on that note...I've got something I want to test out.\" you said, and then found the perfect test subjects: two trees of similar height yet still were taller than you. One was beautiful and lively; the other was gnarled and hadn't been removed yet. You got up and walked to the gnarled tree. \"3...2...1... Goodbye, ya old hunk of wood!\" you punched straight through its trunk with little resistance on one side near the base and the tree fell. with you catching it and setting it down on the ground gently. \"Now, watch the other one. Note how its trunk is slimmer, more delicate. I surely should be able to break it even easier than the other one.\" you walked the few steps (for you) to the lively tree. \"3...2...1... FALCON PUNCH!\" you punched the tree in the same spot with all of your enhanced strength, with the only result being a loud thud when your fist made contact. You smiled. \"Did you see that? ...Exactly. Nothing can be wrecked by me unless I will myself to break it, and only that. With this, who knows? Maybe I can head into the city and help with demolition projects or something that can put my growing size to good use while I'm here. Or at the very least, not worry about hurting anyone when I wander about and continue to grow. I can't stay still, I'd go crazy for sure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSara suggested, \"Oh! I know what we could do...Davis!\" Beverly looked at her quizzically, before you explained, \"He's a boy in school. Another close friend of mine.\" Sara nodded, and then continued, \"You and I go to his place and show him the new you! Yeah, it'll scare the pants off him at first, but he'll understand. And as a boy, he may be too busy drooling over a smoking-hot giantess to be scared.\" you giggled, and decided whether or not to go with your friend's suggestion.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span><font class=\"size1\" style=\"\">Original Author: Detective Barricade</font><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou settled on your decision. You were done hiding who you were...that, and you were too hot and big (and would be getting even bigger) to keep yourself hidden forever. Plus as your friend, and in another life potentially something more, Davis deserved to know what was happening. So you agreed with Sara's suggestion to go visit him. Your first trip into the city as a full-fledged giantess somehow got you excited and dreading at the same time. Military firepower might still be able to hurt you, and the Army wasn't exactly known for asking questions first before leaving a 'threat' little more than a smoking crater even if you tried to make it clear you were (mostly) harmless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it also hit you that Sara wanted to come along as well. She could take your limo, with you instructing Alfred to drive her to where she wanted to go like he would do normally with you, but it might not be able to keep up with you now. That, and Alfred was probably still recovering from the shock of you growing to 50 feet tall in an afternoon. You didn't want to stress him even if his services wouldn't be required by you again. He still felt like family to you. So you would have to leave Sara behind. Or...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ever had a ride with a 50 foot tall girl before, Sara? Nice view, very accommodating...ride itself might not be the smoothest, but I'll try. And besides that, I'd like to let Alfred recover from the shock, so the limo is kinda out of the question right now...\" you asked, knowing full well she hadn't because no such thing existed until now. Sara got the hint and replied, \"No, but I suppose I can add it and scratch it off my bucket list. I assume we're going to Davis' place in the city, then?\" You nodded and answered, \"Yep, that's the plan. Also figure people are gonna have to get used to a growing giantess in the neighborhood at some point, may as well let them see I'm perfectly harmless now than when I could use a skyscraper for a...toothpick. Yes, toothpick. Certainly not what most giant women would love to imagine using such a tall, thin object for, honest!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSara giggled with the knowledge of what you meant, and stepped into your waiting hand. You slowly and gently lifted her to your shoulder which was plenty big enough for her to sit on. The warmth of another person's flesh against your own was surprisingly pleasant as Sara's legs hung down over your shoulder. Slowly you stood up to your full height and began the journey to Davis' place. Thankfully, the fences weren't that high and you had no trouble stepping over them without fear of tripping. It still amazed you how your friend seemed to be effectively the size of a Barbie doll to you, though she obviously had curves Ken would dump Barbie in a heartbeat for if the dolls were real like Sara.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNevertheless, you played it careful with Sara. You didn't want her ride to be uncomfortable and you certainly didn't want to risk her life in case your protection didn't cover accidentally falling off of you. Part way there, you felt the sensation return once more but only slightly. Thus it was just a small spurt this time...granted, 3 feet was small for you now. You knew Sara had felt you grow beneath her, and you turned your head to check on her. Thankfully, she was taking this riding a girl just over 10 times her original size in stride.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you entered the city, you attempted to keep at least one lane of traffic unblocked by your feet and sandals while also trying to give people plenty of room to not get stepped on or kicked like action figures. Unlike in New Super Mario Bros, destroying things when huge wouldn't net extra 1-Ups. There was one point where a few muggers were about to stab a person. You stepped in by putting your hand in the way. You bled just a little as the knives weren't long enough to leave any really deep cuts and the cuts themselves seemed to heal noticeably quick. \"No. You lowlife scum had better start running to the nearest police station to turn yourselves in and rethink your lives before I fling you there myself like an Angry Bird at a pig. You'll survive it, I'm sure, but bones will be breaking.\" The muggers, obviously no long having clean underwear at the sight of you, decide wisely not to tempt fate. Checking with the almost-victim and finding he was okay, even thankful for your save, you move on to Davis place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce there, you with the greatest of dexterity, pick up a small rock and throw it at his window lightly The rock's impact makes quite the resounding thump but left the window completely unscathed otherwise. Letting Sara down, you hide out of sight until it was time. And soon enough, Davis poked his head out to find out what was causing the racket and said, \"Wha? Sara? B-but what do you want?\" You heard Sara reply back to the jet black haired boy of hazel eyes, \"You. Out here. Now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a minute the you heard Davis' door open with a squeak followed by a light rustling as he walked out to meet Sara. From your vantage point, you saw that his eye level was at her boobs then strained to look up higher at her face. You heard him say, \"Uh, it's not like I'm not glad to see you here, Sara, but I still don't know what you want from me.\" She said in return, \"It's about Megan. She wants you to let you in on some things! And to see the new her.\" Davis sounded naturally a little suspicious as he replied, \"Okay...but if it's just a new geek shirt or a change of hair color you've conned her into I'm going back inside-\" he stopped as you gently stomped the ground mischievously, \"What was that?\" you heard him ask, to which Sara cheerfully answered, \"Why Megan, of course! Come on out!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stood up and walked out into view, easily taller than the nearby maple tree and with the figure that put Sara's to shame. With a smile you said to Davis, \"Hi! Did Sara mention that she's no longer the sexiest thing on two legs hailing from our school? For shame, girl. You'd think a boy would be interested to know!\" Sara slyly shrugged her shoulders in an 'oh well' manner. Davis for his part had fainted...or swooned. It was somewhat hard to tell.</span></div></div>",

After all, he might react poorly to a 53 foot tall girl poking him no matter how gentle you'd be. A slight rumble was heard as your body grew to 57 feet in height, more than large enough to use Davis for...fun. Tempting a thought as it was, you didn't think he'd agree with being a human dildo and so left him alone. Not to mention wanting to stay gentle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, you watched as Davis began to stir. Sara had grabbed a nearby fallen tree branch and was she motioning to make it look like she was about to poke him with it. You stifled a giggle as the boy opened his eyes towards Sara and said, \"What a weird dream...Hey! Put the stick down! I ain't dead yet!\" Sara dropped it and sat down as he continued, \"I dreamed something about Megan being huge and - wait. It's like 5:30 in the afternoon...why is it so dark out all of the sudden?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou answered his question, forcing him to look up. And up. \"Because it wasn't a dream, dummy. You're in the shadow of the girl you've been friends with for years now. Only now I'm nearing 60 feet tall and have a scorching-hot body. And in a lovely bikini that's mysteriously growing with me. Better than nothing but my birthday suit. Gotta think of the children, after all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavis managed to get up the courage to ask, \"S-so does that mean you're...you're about to...\" And you finished, \"...kill you? Eat you? Use you as a sex toy? ...I admit, the last one sounds fun, but no. I'm a little disgruntled right now because I can't play WoW, but...\" Davis interrupted by asking, \"WoW? As in, World of Warcraft? ...So it was you who sicked that Death Knight on me in PvP! Meganite the Relentless! ...How long have you been playing it for?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...Since just before Wrath of the Lich King.\" you replied nonchalantly, which made Davis' jaw drop. \"Are you made of money or something?! It's a wonder how I can manage to keep up with the fee...\" he questioned, and you answered. \"...Well...yeah. And as of right now, you and Sara are the only ones who know that I'm secretly wealthy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She lives in a small mansion and has a limo and a very friendly maid, Davis...although near a small mansion would be more appropriate now, I guess. I'm even staying over at her place for the week!\" Sara exclaimed and you smiled. If this was the kind of reception you were going to get by telling about your secret fortune...you should have revealed it sooner! At any rate, you brought the subject back to what you were going to say before you were interrupted. \"I refuse to let anyone or anything be harmed by me. In the 7 years you've known me, have you ever known me to get well and truly violent? Especially towards friends? You haven't because I wouldn't want to harm anyone. And that hasn't changed despite it being more than in my power to do so. I'm still the same Megan you've always known. Do you believe me, Davis?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe answer was immediate, almost seemingly as if by instinct. \"I believe you wholeheartedly, Megan. I'm sure you had your reasons for keeping your secret from me and Sara before now, but I'm glad that there's no more secrets between friends. ...Is there? Anyway, it's nice to know that I won't be squashed flat beneath your monumental butt because you slip and trip on a tanker truck.\" You giggled at the joke and replied, \"Hey, if they leave a perfectly good tanker truck in a place someone's going to trip over it, I'm not taking responsibility for what ensues. Just fair warning that ears will need covering and sailors may be blushing. I will say that I've kinda always dreamed of growing into a friendly giantess. I'm still growing, by the way, Davis. I don't know when or even if I'll ever stop. I've also lived alone for much of my life, aside from my maid, Beverly, and Alfred my limo driver. Before you go fantasizing about her...Beverly is nearly 40.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then asked, \"That said...would you like to visit my place? You'd hardly weigh much of anything to me now, so it's no trouble to carry you and Sara. And really, I'd like to try and make it up to you over the stuff I never mentioned while I still can.\"</span></div></div>",

But after a few minutes, it seemed as though his answer was clear as he headed back inside and closed the door wordlessly. With a heavy heart, you let Sara walk onto your hand and turn around to head back. You didn't like Davis' apparent decision to not go with you, fearing that perhaps he didn't mean anything that he said and that your friendship was over, but the least you could do was respect it. You wouldn't force anyone to do anything unless they were bad and needed the nudge of a giantess to rethink their lives such as those muggers from earlier. And Davis was not a bad person in the slightest in your opinion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, you barely took two steps away before you heard a familiar voice call out, \"WAIT!!! IN THE NAME OF BRONZEBEARD, WAIT, YOU GINORMOUS WOMAN!!!\" you turned around, as clearly there were no others around that could possibly fit the description of 'ginormous woman', (and calling out the name of Bronzebeard as it was his Level 80 Dwarf you beat to a pulp with your Death Knight. He started the duel, however) and watched as Davis came running toward you as fast as his legs would allow. At about 5'8\", he wasn't short, nor was he overweight. In fact, he was generally a bit on the lanky side but a good runner. It was just you were pretty much ten times bigger than him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou said with surprise, \"Davis? I-I thought you didn't want to come!\" Davis finally caught up to you and leaned against your leg to catch his breath. Your ankle alone was well over half his height, and his touch still felt as warm and pleasant as Sara's flesh did on you. You were going to miss the feeling of fellow human physical contact when it came time to say goodbye to Earth, maybe sooner than that. Of course, you had no idea if you were going to outgrow the planet yet, but it didn't stop you from cherishing the small things in case you would be able no longer later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, well, you thought wrong. Needed to check with my folks and grab some spare clothes just in case. Surprisingly, my folks are okay with me going out with Queen Kong to visit her place. Their words, not mine, so don't shove me in the ground for it.\" you smiled and giggled, making your breasts jiggle a bit and attracting the boy's attention like bugs to a bug zapper. You loved them so for that. Of course, being likened to a big gorilla wasn't so fun but what could you do? Aside from stomp him and his folks flatter than pancakes, you weren't going to do that. Instead, you bent down, giving Davis possibly the best view he's ever had...until you grew again considerably, anyway, and offered your hand for him to step onto. He accepted and you brought him up to your other shoulder since you weren't sure if one shoulder could comfortably support two people yet...and you weren't sure if he and Sara should be left together on such a narrow space. He might get touchy with her, she might decide to 'accidentally' shove him off, and he might end up in a place on you he'd enjoy far too much. Better to be safe than sorry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah, I think I'll leave that to Sara. At least with her you have a chance of getting back out in the same country. If it were me...how's your Chinese? You might be needing it to catch the plane home.\" You joke as you head off back for home with your friends in tow. Thinking about having two 'little' people on your shoulders, you say with a giggle, \"Now, if either of you start trying to suggest me to do nice things or bad things, I'm flicking you both off and you'll be walking the rest of the way. Are we clear? I'm kidding, I'm kidding!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA familiar rumbling sound was heard, and Davis said, worried, \"...W-what's that sound? And why are you shaking slightly?\" You answered, \"You know how I said I was still growing earlier? That's what this is all about; I'm about to grow again. No worries, it's not a big one, and even if it was you and Sara are perfectly safe on me. I'd never let anything bad happen to my friends. Well, except for getting dumped. Flesh, bone, and sinew I can keep unbroken. Matters of the heart? You're on your own though you can still rest easy knowing you've got me cheering in your corner.\" And indeed, you grew. 7 feet later, bringing your height in feet to the familiar number of 64. (you had an old N64 kicking around somewhere. A little before your time, but sometimes fun games weren't always the latest and greatest but older classics) You felt like cracking a joke about it, but decided against it. Both your friends have probably suffered enough of your idea of humor to last them for awhile yet.</span></div></div>",

A police car stopped you one the way by calling for you to halt, and you did. Fortunately, you weren't in trouble. Rather, the officer wanted to congratulate you for stopping a potential murder. You thanked him and asked if that's all, to which he said that it was and you were free to go on your way. Not that the police had much of any power to stop you, but you were still a law-abiding citizen even if you were a giantess now. Regardless, you wish him a nice day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That officer seemed to be awfully familiar with you. Why?\" Davis asks. You answer without turning your attention from your path, (in case a car or person is unfortunate enough to be crossing paths, you wanted to be able to avoid stepping down on them) \"I've never been in trouble with the law, if that's what you're thinking. I've made a few donations here and there. I admit I'm probably one of, if not THE richest people in the city alone. I've got stock in several local companies and earn some of their shares, but unless it's failing miserably I prefer to let the CEO's handle their own companies rather than mess with what's working.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you could pretty much buy out the school and buy your way to the top, then?\" Davis asked, and this time Sara answered for you, \"Probably, but then she wouldn't actually learn anything would she?\" you chuckled and said, \"That building is practically propped up on my money. If not for me, it'd have been torn down years ago. But since the superintendent and maybe the principal are the only ones aware of it, the teachers have all treated me the same as anyone else - just the way I want it. Anyway, we're here! ...It seems smaller than I remember - oh. Right. Heh.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSara groaned slightly at your funny as you arrived back at your place. Davis, on the other hand, was too busy trying to get his jaw off the ground even from your shoulder's height. You guessed if this was your first time seeing the small mansion that was your place, you'd have that reaction too. Beverly was already out to greet you, and even Alfred was out as well helping in whatever way he could since you obviously would have little need for his services as a limo driver. You were happy about this, albeit a little confused as to why.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce you gently let your friends down onto the ground, (you could probably simply drop them and they'd be fine, but that would be mean regardless) you said, \"Nice to see you up and around, Alfred. But...what convinced you to stay?\" Alfred turned to face you, still a tad unnerved at your sheer size but seemingly trying to get used to it, and replied, \"Beverly did. She told me that despite your ever increasing size, your personality hadn't changed and that you would be saddened to see me leave. So I've decided to at least attempt to help wherever I can here. Forgive me if I'm not as proficient as dear Beverly...I am new at this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smiled and then responded, \"Not a problem. I'm just glad she was able to convince you.\" you then introduced Davis to your maid and (somewhat former) limo driver. \"Alfred, Beverly, this is Davis. If you could prepare a place for him to stay, I'd appreciate it. I'd do it myself, but I'm obviously not going to fit through the doors.\" Both nodded courteously, and Beverly led him inside to where he would be sleeping. Obviously not your old room as you didn't want him doing you didn't even want to think about what with your old clothes, or worse your games.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat night, everyone slept. That is, except for yourself. You weren't sure why, just you didn't feel tired. Strangely, and much to your relief, you've noticed that you haven't felt the need to go to the bathroom at all today since you hit double-digit numbers of feet in height, if even then. You have stumbled across pictures of giantesses...unloading their bowels on unsuspecting cities before, and you...definitely had no desire to be mimicking those pictures in real life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter about midnight, a familiar sensation began bubbling up again. Seeing as how your hand was all but magnetically drawn to its favorite spot in your crotch, and it took as much willpower as you could muster to keep it out of there, this was going to be big. You get up and move well back of your home as a precaution just in time as your body starts to grow at a frenzied pace. 70 feet soon becomes 80 and then 90 feet, and still your body grew bigger and bigger. \"Welcome to the world of triple-digit height in feet, Megan...\" you muttered quietly as your body did just that at 110 feet and climbing. Your breasts alone looked like they were the size of larger houses as you reached 140 feet and still growing strong. Just when you thought it wouldn't end, your body slows and stops - at an impressive 200 feet tall, over triple your previous height! You weren't shocked anymore...you were amazed.</span></div></div>",

Not because you were tired, just you wanted to try and keep some level of normality. You silently hoped your friends would take your huge growth spurt well... You had informed them both that you were still growing, but even you hadn't expected to get this big so quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the morning, you awoke to someone poking your breast, hearing Davis as he said, \"Bloody hell...and I thought she was huge before...\" You opened your eyes just a sliver and focused on him as he continued to poke your boob.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, you had enough of his prodding. You suddenly and very gently grabbed him with your hand and brought him to your face as you sat up. \"Having fun poking me like a giant Pillsbury dough girl? Didn't you ever learn not to poke the Cucoos in Zelda? You are so lucky I like you, Davis...\" you said with a smile and gently put him back down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How...how is it that you still feel as soft as Sara or I do despite being...however the bloody hell big you are?\" Davis asked out of curiosity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou...hadn't really thought about it, to be honest. You shrugged your huge shoulders and said, \"I dunno. Were you expecting giant flesh colored stone or something? Honestly, I'm surprised at the things I can feel and do now. I'm able to not break anything or harm anyone by accident. I don't think I need food anymore outside of the comfort it gives from the act of eating. I've been injured, and have healed very quickly. And I can still feel things that I probably shouldn't. Like your poking me. You aren't even 2 inched compared to me and I still felt you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSara came over and asked, \"Aren't you a little scared of all this, Megan? I mean, you've said before you enjoy being bigger, but...I don't think these things are normal for someone your size...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were about to answer when you felt the sensation return. You grew quickly, and then stopped at 235 feet tall. Finally, you said, \"Well that was quick... Anyway, I'm not actually scared of this to be honest. It's incredibly convenient. But...I have a feeling that I'm not just becoming a giantess here, but something...more.\" before you can elaborate, the sensation hits again and you reach 290 feet tall. \"That wasn't an indication for you to grow bigger just then, body!\" you shouted half-jokingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Strange powers, uncontrollable growth, and you don't even blow out our eardrums when you shout? Oh no...I have a bad feeling about what you're going to say...\" Davis remarked with almost dread. A dread which you didn't exactly understand. It wasn't like you were going to unleash the Burning Legion or the Scourge on him...or the Zerg for that matter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I think I'm well past oddly giant girl here. I'm...entering goddess-hood. Guess I just don't have the really fun powers that go with the title yet... Oh well.\" you elaborated finally and noted the reactions of your friends. They seemed to be alarmed to some extent, like they were afraid you were going to let that go to your already massive head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A g-goddess? But they don't exist...do they?\" Sara remarked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well if they didn't before, one does now. Don't worry, I'm not letting this go to my head or anything. But hey, how many people can say they're BFF's with a goddess in the making? Just...don't start worshiping me. I really don't need the ego boost.\" you said with a wink. And then... \"...Again? That's three this morning! I'd hold you down, but that's about as smart as lemmings walking off a ledge to their certain demise...\" You grew again, clearing 300 feet, then 320 feet. Just as you were about to slow down, your body sped up again and cleared 350 feet. 370 feet of height came and passed soon after. Finally, your body halted at 450 feet tall. Even Sara's 6'5\" bombshell of a body didn't even seem like an inch tall to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Scratch that, four just this morning. Oh if only I could manipulate reality right now... I could really use to play some WoW right about now...\" you confess, unsure if this was all for the morning, or if there was all prelude to a big one.</span></div></div>",

That familiar feeling seemed to bubble up inside your stomach, reverberating in on itself and rippling to other areas of your body. Every cell in your body seemed to tingle with anticipation, and a relatively tiny spurt of 'just' ten feet hit, as if the coming growth spurt was so large even your massive body needed to grow further to process it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Uh-oh...\" You say, beginning to tremble ever so slightly. You are suddenly very, very glad for your burgeoning goddesshood \u2013 even more than before. \"M-Megan?\" Sara calls from down below, as you wiggle your toes involuntarily, which stretch out a few feet bigger. \"Are you okay? Are you about to grow again?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the bubbling feeling spreads all over, you let out a sharp gasp as it reaches your breasts, nipples engorging and putting pressure on the infinitely-stretchy cyan bikini as your pupils dilute. \"Bloody hell...\" you can hear Davis say. \"She's about to get really bloody big...\" You coo softly, taking in a deep breath, and and letting out a low, pleasures moan as you stretch out bigger again \u2013 and again \u2013 and again!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore the littles down below can so much as turn to run, you've heaved another one hundred whopping feet larger, and then another fifty, your body surging in one huge push of mass to six hundred feet tall! You spurt and surge and shudder bigger, meeting and dismissing seven hundred, eight hundred, and nine hundred feet in turn, your cyan bikini stretching loudly as if in protest \u2013 though it keeps up with your relentless growth with no problems. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour growth comes to sudden, abrupt pause, and you huff loudly, before doubling in size, and then doubling in size again! You eyes have rolled all the way back into your skull as visions of goddesshood and bigness fill your head, as you crash past a mile in size, covering hundreds of buildings under your plump, soft butt! Clutching your bulging breasts, you moan in pleasure, passing two miles in size. It seemed that you really were a goddess, because even despite your massively increased weight, nothing has been damaged! Even the tiny people you inadvertently smothered were completely unharmed, still able to breathe, and not needing to eat or drink!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou catch your breath as your growth pauses again... It was going to be a big one! You shudder violently, before BURSTING up to a gigantic five miles in size, sitting down! Your form disperses low-lying clouds as your head pokes into them from beneath, a wide grin on your face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut... Is the growth storm over, yet? Or is there more to come?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span><font class=\"size1\" style=\"\">Original Author: Detective Barricade</font><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the euphoria of your most recent, massive growth spurt \u2013 and the many others that preceded it from when you were just 450 feet tall \u2013 now behind you, you feel... powerful. Unstoppable. Like you could rip worlds apart! ...not that you'd ever do so unless its entire population was irredeemably corrupt. \"My ascension... is complete,\" you boom loudly, a huge grin still plastered to your face. Your first act as a goddess is... to get up off your massive posterior and stand. No one's in any danger under your butt, but there's likely places they'd rather be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou heave forward onto your feet, still in their golden sandals, forcing the very ground itself to rip nearby towns away from one another with your powers to give yourself a clear place to stand. You marvel as everything appears smaller and smaller as you stand to your full 10 mile height. With a thought, the clouds gathering around your crotch and thighs whisk away so you can see where you're standing... though your enlarged breasts make it a slight challenge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I think she's stopped growing for now...\" Davis says, shocked to have been under your ass that by all rights should have squashed him and the hundreds of buildings beneath it into nothingness yet still completely fine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gee, thanks Captain Obvious,\" Sara retorts, still remembering you saying you wouldn't harm anything you didn't want to. Still, you're almost twice as big as Mount Everest, so she fears she has little hope of getting your attention. She and Davis run to you, climbing the wall of the sandal to beat their fists upon your foot in the hopes of getting your attention, not really even noticing how they've suddenly crossed what would otherwise be a few miles of a journey just to get there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile you're admiring the view and your even bigger breasts, your eyes widen as you have an epiphany. Everything comes into focus. \"...What? Oh you've got to be kidding me...\" you mutter, though to the tiny ones below it's still deafening. There's no mistake that you're a goddess, but what surprises you is how long you've been one. Your friends don't see you looking down at them, nor the faint glow your eyes have gained. Their pounding on your foot is getting irksome, but you know why they're doing it. You have an idea...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, Megan! I know you're huge beyond compare, but you've gotta notice us! You just gotta...\" Sara shouts, but losing hope and energy. Maybe you're beyond them now, she fears, no matter how much she wants to deny it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, not to sound rude or anything, but you can stop pounding on my foot now,\" you say from behind them. They spin around to see you standing there, tall enough for Sara to be staring at your big breasts straight on, then back at your foot behind them, then back to you. \"My main body, as I'm going to call it, is much too big now to interact with you easily, so I've created this one for your comfort. Neat trick, huh?\" you inform, smiling widely with pride.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bloody hell... So you're a full on goddess now? Do we need to start worshiping you and kissing your toes clean now?\" Davis asks incredulously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, no. I'm not asking for worship. But yes, I'm a goddess... though I should really explain this someplace other than out here. Let's head back to my mansion,\" you reply. Before they can object, you teleport them to your hand. With a loud thud, you kneel and place your free hand upon a hand shaped patch of ground you create for that very purpose. You smile at your friends as you drop them off delicately in front of the door to your mansion and push them inside with your powers before appearing before them inside, around 7'5\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaturally, your staff are all shocked at your very sudden reappearance. Your maid Beverly even gasps, \"G-good heavens, Miss Megan! How is this possible?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll explain. The living room should do fine,\" you answer, leading her and your friends to the living room, taking a bouncy seat on a cushioned chair. \"God I've missed being able to sit in one of these...\" you remark happily. You wait patiently for the three to be seated before you even think to begin \u2013 with what you have to reveal, they're going to want the seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, so you're a giant goddess now. What do you have to explain to us here?\" Sara asks, her blue eyes looking at you inquisitively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's just it. I have always been a goddess, but it's only just recently that my powers have begun to fully awaken. I've been oblivious to my true nature for... I don't even know how many lifetimes now. I also realize I'm behind some of the things leading up to this,\" you answer. You tug at your bikini, saying, \"Awfully convenient that this lovely bikini just happened to be in the store we visited on the day I went shopping, isn't it? And these sandals just happen to be made impractically big by mom yet perfectly sized for me, complete with a weak excuse for them continuing to fit me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you saying you created them, Miss Megan?\" Beverly asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I did, and they continue to fit me even with my vastly different body and 10 mile size outside as that's their purpose.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But... the money I spent to buy you that...\" Sara whimpers unsurprisingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Already compensated for. Keep in mind I was doing all this subconsciously. I also won't grow again today, though... mmm... they feel really good. I probably won't stay much bigger than what I am right now out there. ...yes, I've complete control over my spurts now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Er, hold on, Megan. Aren't you our age?\" Davis questions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am, but if my powers don't awaken within a lifetime, I die and am reborn in another body shortly after. Always well off and nice, but seemingly just an ordinary person. As for this body before my improvements, well, I haven't exactly had control over the identity of my new life before. Maybe if I choose a mortal life again and die I'll be able to say 'yeah, I want to be reborn into a body like Sara's',\" you explain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, Miss Megan... M-may I ask what happens to all of us? Your friends and staff? You technically no longer need us, thus effectively a burden to you, so is this a farewell?\" Beverly asks, calm but clearly worried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can't help it. You begin to giggle which soon develops into full blown laughter. You accidentally let your main body laugh, shaking the mansion violently with its force. Soon you calm down enough to say, \"Ahem. If I didn't want my friends anymore, I wouldn't have shortened their journey to my foot out there. And really, have you seen my gaming library? Despite the very fabric of reality being my personal game of Minecraft, minus Creepers but who likes them blowing up on one's stuff anyway, I'll still keep it. You're not needs, but man are you guys ever wants!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a little while, you ask for some lunch, taking in your friend's meal requests. You don't need it, but wanting it is another matter entirely. Outside, you have your main body lie down and bask in the sunlight, using your powers to stretch out more space for your titanic frame. You also summon up various bras and try them on in your room, discovering a GG cup fits perfectly before returning to your bikini top. \"Ha! GG-cup... I do have a sense of humor!\" you remark with a giggle. You still don't know why your powers have awakened, but hopefully it's nothing bad.</span></div></div>",

You moan slightly as you feel your girls expand just a little, though as you apply this to your main body outside, this is still several tons of flesh being added to your frame. You absolutely love being a goddess, and being titanic while still able to interact with people on their scale simultaneously, but this still leaves some big questions upon your mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How long has my soul been doing this Avatar-like thing? Do I have enough to fill a large chamber like Aang did in the show? I know all my former lives have been female, but surely I must span multiple families from all across the Earth...\" you mutter. A slightly disturbing thought strikes you and you add, \"God, I hope I'm not a close ancestor of anyone at school... especially not Davis. That would be awkward... wouldn't it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you have your Death Knight character Meganite the Relentless take on some new quests, taking advantage of the rested EXP Blizzard programmed in to encourage players to take breaks, you ask yourself, \"Why do I exist? I mean, I love being what I am and all, but surely I can't be a fluke. And why have my powers awakened now? Surely there's a reason for all this, like I'm here to save the world from something only a goddess can save it from and now my powers are needed... but then, wouldn't I remember why I was here if it was that important?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe you're a rogue goddess, refusing to just sit back and watch humanity from afar? If so, maybe you kept your true nature hidden even from yourself until the day you believed humanity was ready to learn of its loving goddess? \"Or maybe the awakening of my powers was just a mistake, and I was never meant to know of this? I guess I'll learn eventually, and enjoy myself until then,\" you say to yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, you've every intention of returning to school. Omniscience wasn't part of the goddess package, though the idea of knowing everything sounds terrifically boring. Despite the likelihood of either altering people's memories to make your ideal human size body not seem too crazy to have grown into it over the course of a couple months or making this body somewhat smaller, you look forward to showing off the new you! Heck, you basically owned the school financially before this began, so it might not be so far-fetched to allow herself to prowl the hallways in your bikini... Or maybe ask Sara for fashion tips to show off this divine body while adding a slight gamer touch?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day, you awake in the middle of nowhere. You feel the tiny, raised patch of dark green and realize it to be trees! \"Right. 10 mile tall goddess here, other body is sleeping inside my room. Going to have to get used to remembering which body to wake up in,\" you remind yourself with a giggle. You had hoped that sleeping would let something come up to the surface, like a reminder to yourself if your powers awakened, but no such luck. You also hoped that you didn't use your powers to change anything while you slept.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour thoughts shift to Davis and Sara. You love them dearly as your friends, and actually had a crush on Davis. Before this summer, you believed you'd never be able to get his attention unless you showed him you were filthy stinking rich, something you dreaded your friends finding out. You didn't want to be associated with the rich bitch stereotype, even now with knowledge of a very mean girl that's a walking example of it you've learned from poking into other realities by the name of Vanessa Barnes, among other reasons you kept your wealth a secret to others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow though, he knows you're wealthy, a giantess/goddess, and that Meganite the Relentless gave his dwarf character an unpleasant taste of her runeblade in PvP awhile back. And he hasn't abandoned you yet, even joining Sara in trying to get your attention yesterday after you'd grown to your current 10 mile height. You don't know if there's any girls he's got an eye on, but you can at least let him know you'd potentially like to take your relationship further if he'd like.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut that does bring up the knowledge that you're immortal now while your friends will still die eventually. You could make them immortal too, but it might also be painful for them to watch everyone else they've ever cared for age and die around them. Heck, you don't know how you're going to cope! For now, you shift your incredible mass to lie on your toned stomach, feeling hundreds of tons of bikini-covered breast flesh push harmlessly into the ground, then put your consciousness back into your other body and wake up in your room. \"How I've missed my bed...\" you say with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPassing the guest rooms, you note your friends' peaceful snores, still fast asleep. Sure, you could let them sleep in, but you want to have some fun with them. Can you materialize something that doesn't exist in real life? With a thought, you discover the answer to be yes. You laugh with glee as you hear Sara scream in terror at the Chain Chomp lunging and chomping from its post, far enough away it can't actually bite her. (And even if she stuck her hand in its mouth it wouldn't hurt her.) You also giggle as a Spoink bounces up and down on top of Davis' bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth of them are startled until they hear you laughing your ass off. Naturally you'd wake them up to creatures from video games. It's not long before they yell, \"MEGAN!!! WHAT THE HELL?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Sara and Davis come rushing out of their rooms, you laugh and run away, just fast enough to not be caught. Once you're out of the hall, you turn the floor into a conveyor belt which makes your friends run in place in their attempt to catch you. \"Oh come on, you got to admit that was cool! It's certainly more interesting than waking to the rumble of my main body growing again... well, for you guys at least,\" you say once you finally let them advance and tackle you onto a smartly materialized gym mat. Being a goddess totally rocks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's not long before Sara and Davis are on the mat laughing with their 7'5\" friend. You notice Davis staring at your body a bit longer than necessary, to which you ask, \"See something you like, Davis?\" though the tent in his boxers tells you all you need to know. You change the subject for the moment. \"I plan on returning to school in September. While I'd love to show off a curvy 7'5\" body with H-cups, it's awful much compared to my old slightly pudgy and flat 5'6\" body...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-well who cares what other people think? Heck, you can make them think nothing of it!\" Davis answers, stammering slightly. He blushes fiercely when you bury his head in your breasts in a friendly hug before you go off to see about breakfast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter you've left, Sara whispers to Davis, \"Dude, she really likes you. Why don't you confess to Megan? You'll never know if it'll work out until you try! I was the hottest girl in school, and now she is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know... We've been friends for years!\" he whispers back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be a big baby! I know you've had the hots for her well before this even began. If I were you, I'd jump at the chance to be able to say I'm dating a goddess. And if it works out, you might be her husband for centuries if you want it.\"</span></div></div>",

In a few seconds the entire neighborhood began to be too small for her, and she wasn't done growing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilly holds out her hand. \"Climb on bro!\" You obey quickly, since her hand was still growing larger with her already enormous body. Wait a little and you may not be able to climb on at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could do nothing to stop this growth spurt, you just had to enjoy the ride. Which is hard to do considering you're afraid of heights. Lilly started walking towards uninhabited areas, where she may be able to fit if she stops growing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut no, she doesn't for a while. In 10 minutes since you found out Lilly started growing her head is stuck in the clouds, literally. Her head then entered the stratosphere and beyond. How big can a person get? You fear this would turn disastrous, especially since she's your big sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, her growth ended, for now. She was so tall that you could see the curvature of the Earth from her hand, where she held you, near her bosom. She was so huge it would take you days to walk across her hand. You couldn't completely estimate how tall she really was, but her big toe was a little larger than the neighboring city, which many thought was huge until now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiraculously, the two of you were still able to breathe, considering Earth's atmosphere is miles below you. Just you and her, on top of the world, noticing how small and insignificant everything is to her. Nothing could be able to stop her. Everyone could be at their command.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think my growth has stopped now. Hopefully it doesn't happen again,\" Lilly's voice boomed. Her voice was so loud and deep that even by covering your ears they still rang. \"HOW ABOUT YOU WHISPER?\" you yell back, in a highly offended tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good idea\", she boomed back, quieter than the last time she spoke, although it still hurt your ears. Even worse, she held you closer to her face so that she can hear you better. \"So... what should we do now that I am this huge? I could own the planet, nothing can stop me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or you can protect Earth from otherworldly threats, if any,\" you suggest. The thought of your world being trampled by a multi-mile high girl made you want to fear her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, even better! It would get boring after I destroyed everything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hear a loud GROWL. \"Was that your stomach?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. Good guess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But how will you eat?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dunno... maybe ask the planet for some food, or take it the hard way.

Honestly, it's not the worst thing you could have said, all things in consideration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it really has impressed upon you the sheer scale your best friend has suddenly grown, within 15 minutes, no less, and even without her knowledge of the change. Her feet, longer than a city bus or train car. Her toes, nearly as tall as you are. Her ankle, well out of reach without climbing a couple stories. To say nothing of the immense height of her knees, or hips, or... the rest of her. It's awe-inspiring... and honestly rather intimidating at this angle, as she's surmised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd what's even odder and somewhat more distressing is how she continues to accept that her life has always continued naturally up to this point, even as she soars over 500 feet in height, as if such growth has been naturally part of her life until now. And not just that; her clothes have grown with her (to some degree) every step of the way, meaning that you are retroactively causing <i>all of reality</i>, or at least everything pertaining directly to <i>her</i>, to reshape itself to fit her new greater stature every time you pay her the slightest compliment. After all, if she remembers her growth every step of the way and still retains fitting clothing, then the world at large has to be supplying those over-sized garments... right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wince. And even at that, the larger she grows, the less capable the manufacturing capabilities of humanity will be at maintaining her dignity. After all, how do you adequately manufacture a set of underwear for a teenage girl who's hundreds of feet tall? Her top and panties, which you belatedly realize have shrunk slightly in terms of coverage through all her growth spurts, almost resemble repurposed hot air balloons or other heavy duty fabrics, not the soft cotton garments worn by your teen of average height and build.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd what of the rest of her daily life, you ponder with growing horror. How can Jess, a young woman nearly 100 times a normal girl's height, maintain a regular life in high school? What kind of life might she be leading now, after all, especially if the world has been adjusting to her growth spurts as if they've been completely natural? Certainly the government or some other agency would have stepped in to monitor and regulate the situation as she grew year after year. The magnitude of her comments, about receiving very few compliments, weighs even heavier on your heart as the full impact of your reckless complimentary growth bears down on you. If so few people have anything nice at all to say about her, regardless of her looks and personality, then what kind of life must she be leading now? How will you live with yourself if you have ruined your best friend's life just to selfishly see her bloom into a towering giantess?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJess's eyes squint slightly, a wave of pain crossing her face as your response hits home. Damn it, there are fractions of a second here to salvage the spirit of your best friend, and you haven't a moment to spare!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\"BUT!!\"</b> you yell out, startling your enormous friend. \"But,\" you continue in a normal voice, \"it's because...\" <i>Come on... come on... how to help her feel better... what did she say earlier...?</i> \"It's because you always like holding me... right?\" Some hazy memories start to mingle with yours... You shudder for a moment. Are you even restructuring your own memories by the compliments and growth that you're spurring along? How on Earth are you going to hold onto your own sanity, and keep track of what all you've done, if you keep re-writing your own history such that you forget it?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take a deep breath, closing your eyes and concentrating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot quite. Not a complete re-write; you can still remember everything as it happened before, but your memories seem like they're doubled, as if you've lived both your original life and the most recent life you've apparently lived with your now 500 foot tall friend. Opening your eyes, trying to project the most earnest expression at her own confused orbs, you continue, \"You've always tried to protect me, haven't you. Tried to always talk with me face to face; tried to keep me from seeing you like...\" You take a deep breath. \"Like everyone else sees you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJess shudders, her eyes widening, her entire posture going rigid. She begins stammering, horror obviously gripping her heart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGod, you're an absolute heel for making her feel this way! Frantically, you wave your arms, before staggering toward her nearest toe. \"But I don't! It just surprised me, is all! I mean, I haven't seen you like this since you were like... I dunno, only 60 feet tall or so! I guess I just wasn't ready!\" You smile, patting the large toe on her left foot. \"But it's okay! You're still you, right, Jess? I mean, I don't have anything to fear from you! I still trust you! You're my best friend in the world!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe freezes, staring at you with those wide surprised eyes... then shoots up another hundred feet. Tears collect in her eyes, and for one long stretch of silence, you fear you may have said the wrong thing...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then she smiles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stare at her for a moment, breathing heavily yourself, before grinning up at your colossal friend. She smiles even wider, closing her eyes even as tears continue to pour from them, before she buries her face in her hands. Her shuddering sobs, thankfully sounding more like relief than sadness, thunder down from above, and she eventually collapses to her knees which impact the ground like mortar shells behind you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou give her a few minutes, taking the time to walk out of her shadow toward her knees so she can more easily see you. After she sniffles one last time, seemingly pulling her spirit back together, you glance back up to her tear-streaked but smiling face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you,\" she whispers, her voice still pounding and surrounding you like a force of nature. She opens her mouth to continue, but catches herself, shakes her head, then reaches down to delicately surround your body with fingers as thick as you are. You leap into that huge woven net of giantess digits and power through the stomach churning ride up to her multi-story-sized head. \"I knew I could count on you,\" Jess whispers, her eyes twinkling, before pressing you against pursed lips taller than you are.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Think nothing of it,\" you manage, squeezing her lips as much as you can to return your own affection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a long moment, she pulls you back, looking far better composed and happy... and curiously flushed. Are her eyes sparkling a bit more than the last time...?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shake those thoughts from your mind, even as new freshly created ones surge into their place. Trying to keep the conversation rolling, and also trying to dodge some awkward feelings coursing through your veins, you ask, \"So, how've you been doing? Haven't gotten to hang out with you lately...\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

So they've kept me in testing for the past few months. They think it won't be long before they figure out what's causing me to... um, grow... so abnormally.\" A pink blush covers her face and neck, and you valiantly retain all efforts to admit how fetching and lovely she looks in that color. At least for the time being, you're trying to rein in that desire to make her grow, regardless how excited it makes you feel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe slowly shakes her head. \"I don't think they're getting any closer, but I've never been that good at science...\" She grins sheepishly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou chuckle in response. \"My grades were never that good either, though I've always wondered about your growth spurts. I guess you're at the university because of your parents?\" Those double memories continue to feed you new information about this alternate giantess-Jess world you've created with your compliments, and you figure that asking questions and making comments that help flesh out this new world will help you cope with it better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAside from the whole <i>\"any nice thing I say about my best friend will make her grow another few dozen feet\"</i> issue. You're not entirely sure how you're going to address this in the future, to be honest, without understanding your current circumstances. Hence the indirect interrogation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJess nods. \"Yeah, since my dad teaches biology at the university, I think he got me set up with some research at his school before the government could really get involved, or something.\" She shivered. \"I don't want to think about where I could have ended up if my daddy hadn't arranged things with the university. The tests haven't been that bad, I guess. Better than what I'd probably be doing with the government or the military.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI glance up at her eyes, tightened in frustration and fear, and can't help but agree. Granted, she's been secluded for the past few years because of all the college research, but that was likely inevitable with a girl growing larger than a hundred feet. I couldn't imagine how she might have suffered at the hands of a less humane military.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen again, clinical scientific research could be pretty inhumane as well. I look back up toward Jess's face, trying to decipher whether or not her time at the university has been a pleasant one or not. \"Probably.

It seems you had been 'chasing' her for about an hour. With internal glee, you watch as the woman becomes smaller and smaller as you pass 30 feet and then 40 feet. When you stop growing at 48 feet tall, you see that the woman's mind just can't take anymore as she faints. You catch her with your hand as she falls and ensure her body lands safely. Then again, you change your mind and move her unconscious form to the side of the road for her own safety.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take a look around yourself at the city around you. Everything seems so small...so delicate to you now, and you know from your calculations that this would only become more so as your growth formula should wear off once you hit around a mile in height. ...That is, if you hadn't miscalculated and would need an antidote by then to stop. If that was true, well you'd never stop growing. Fortunately, you had thought about the concern for food and drink, and had thrown in the concern for breathing as well. You had no need for food or water or air thanks to a prior formula, which also rid you of the need to...use the little girls room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSexual needs, on the other hand...you were going to have to repress those yourself. You're confident you could do it, however. In the meantime, however, you hear a loud ring coming from the bank. A robbery in progress? Seems like the perfect opportunity to show the people of the world their new protector. With loud booms, you walk to the bank. A large, black van pulls away and attempts to drive away - it had to be the robbers' getaway vehicle. You gave the van a minute's head start...and then pursued after it. The result could only end one way...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gotcha!\" You say as you easily grab hold of the van and peer inside at the black-masked robbers. \"You guys are quite the cliche bank robbers, aren't you? Oh don't worry, I won't eat you. Crime leaves a bad taste in my mouth. Instead, you and I are going to take a little trip downtown!\" you walk with the van in your hand to the police station, which seems to give you a less than welcome reception. At this size, their guns would be very ineffective, but tazers on the other hand would be about as effective as if you were normal size. Either way, you mean no trouble and hold your free hand up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa, whoa, whoa. I don't want any trouble, officers. But I do come bearing a gift. Some people here who are very eager to sit in prison and think about what they've done, and possibly rethink their lives.\" You lower the van and tear the back door off, gently placing it by your foot once an officer moves out of the way, and tip the van back. The robbers spill out except for the driver who was buckled in, but a light squeeze around the van convinces him to get out and join his cohorts. Unsurprisingly, all three hold their wrists up to accept the handcuffs, apparently preferring to be in the custody of police than a giantess. The bags of money and other valuables spill out of the van as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh, I see we've been busy little robbers! Officers, I think you men and women can handle returning these to who they belong. In fact, I'm quite confident you can!\" Smiling, you tip the van further to make sure that all of the stolen valuables have been emptied from the van, and then walk away from the station. You set down the slightly crumpled, back-less van in the nearest parking lot in case something of value still hadn't come out. Judging from the big clock on the front of town hall, you had about half and hour still before your next growth spurt. You ponder on what to do now.</span></div></div>",

But while spooking that woman was admittedly fun, you don't want to have to be constantly chasing people down before you can help them. It carried an increased risk of causing damage to your surroundings and accidentally stepping on someone, neither of which was desirable. You need a way to inform the masses that you're here to help, even as you would inevitably grow bigger and bigger...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily, a GTS News helicopter is flying nearby. Unfortunately, they haven't noticed you yet. Furthermore, the most direct path to it's current location was straight through several office buildings. There's nothing for it: you're just going to have to wait until time was up and you grew again to catch their attention. You sigh and say, \"How's a girl to let the people know of her good intent when she can't even garner a news helicopter? I was hoping to let the word get out there before I reached 96 feet, but that doesn't seem like it's going to happen...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInterestingly, you hear a voice by your hand. A feminine one. \"E-excuse me, miss? D-did you say good intent? Then why were you chasing me around earlier?\" You turn your head and look down to find the voice belonged to the woman from earlier. She has a surprisingly nice voice when she's not screaming her head off. You kneel down beside her and say, \"I can have a bit of fun too, you know. Besides, I wasn't going to hurt you, and you didn't exactly leave me much choice. People seem so small, so delicate to me now and I've always wanted to protect the world. And growing bigger seems like the best way to do just that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as you're about to keep talking with the woman, you hear the sound you had been waiting on: the loud bell chime of the clock above town hall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDING-dong ding-dong...dong-ding dong-DING...! DONG....DONG....DONG....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was now 3:00, and your body responds to the time by beginning to grow again. Thinking quickly, you gently grab the woman and hold her tight without harming her as you pass 60 and then 70 feet rapidly. \"I'm sorry if this seems awkward for you, ma'am, but I want to be certain of your safety around my growing body. I'm a gentle soul. Really!\" you say as you surpass 80 feet and start slowing down. Once your growth stops, you find yourself at the predicted 96 feet in height and you set the woman down as gently as though she were a feather falling from the sky, or something incredibly precious. (which as a living person, she was) She's still slightly startled, but seems to get over it more quickly than before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, did you do this to yourself? And on purpose?\" she asks, to which you nod and reply, \"Yes, on both accounts. I combined Unobtanium with a small amount of crushed, powdered Kryptonite using a DeLorean going 80 miles an hour just as it got hit by a bolt of lightning...I'm just kidding. I'm not quite that good a scientist to combine fictional materials and events from Back to the Future. But a couple of the materials required were quite rare, and the formula also requires an incredible amount of care to fashion. A good thing too, as I wouldn't want it falling into the wrong hands. It's also precisely that reason I won't disclose the actual names of the materials.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman nods and then points up toward the other sound you have been hoping to hear: the thwomp of the news helicopter's rotor. \"That is quite the story. I think the boys up in the helicopter will be interested to hear it and your claim to desire being a protector of the world as well. The world needs nice people who want to help it and others like you do. Too many these days are only interested in themselves, and little else.\" she says, and you begin to realize something: the woman you had chased, scared, and now just had a conversation with... She was the mayor! You had been planning on meeting the mayor eventually - you just hadn't expected to meet her this early.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne very pleasant interview later, the helicopter was off with a story for the 6 o'clock news. Although you know that you were going to grow at least 8 times bigger than you were currently by then, about 768 feet tall by your calculations, people will be able to know that your growing presence was meant to be a benevolent one. You discover pleasant surprise about a side effect of the formula: minor reality manipulation. Effectively, the mailbox you accidentally step on shows no sign of being under your foot at all, much less that and your entire weight. This means you needn't worry about damaging buildings or hurting people without outright wanting to. Good thing too, as you can just focus on helping others without worry!</span></div></div>",

You quickly reach and surpass 100 feet in height and keep going. 110 feet comes and goes, and then so does 120 feet. As you grow past 130 feet, you move off to a more open area of the city to try and stay out of commuters' way. 140 feet passes you by, and then 150 feet follows shortly after.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n160 feet and 170 feet pass without problem, but as the latter does something feels very wrong. You can't feel yourself slowing down in growth, even as you grow past 180 feet tall! \"Crap. I'm not going to stop at 192 feet on this spurt. I thought I had all variables ironed out before I consumed my formula! Oh well, I was going to get bigger than that in the next hour anyway...\" you say as quietly as you can.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIndeed, your body clears 190 feet and 200 feet without pause. 210 feet falls behind you, and after 220 feet you're still growing. As you surpass 230 feet in height, you admit there are worse things the formula could do as an unforeseen variable than make you grow even faster. As long as the city and world were safe, you can accept this slight hiccup in your predictions. After thinking that, you find yourself already 260 feet tall and still growing. As you pass 270 and 280 feet in height, you wonder when this growth spurt will end. Mostly out of curiosity.</span></div></div>",

You shouldn't have drunk that in one gulp! It's incredibly potent.\" you cry out, even though it's far too late.

Uh, so...exactly how big can I expect to get with that?

It was hard, let me tell you, but I managed to get that in there. Whatever you have on when you drink it will grow with you. Not sure about socks or shoes, though.\" another tight and pleasant hug ensues.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wait as she goes inside to change into the outfit she wanted to wear as a giantess, which is revealed to be her swimsuit. You hand the formula over and she pops the cap, then downs the dark green liquid in one gulp. \"Ugh. I think Buckley's cough syrup tastes better than this...

You're completely at a loss as to what to do or say \u2013 in your mind, \"improvements\" certainly hadn't translated into \"extreme growth\" when you read the details of your new robotic maid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe patiently waits as you slowly examine her artificial but oh so incredible and enticing curves, somewhat hidden beneath her sexy French maid outfit. Before long, however, she nods resolutely and begins to straighten up once again. \"Since you are not responding, I assume you wish it to be so. Once more converting surrounding dust and unneeded elements into components.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you can react, you see her stretch one glove-covered hand out, fingers spread. Suddenly, it morphs and lengthens, forming into what looks to be a vacuum cleaner hose and fan attachment... a fact quickly proven true as she turns and simply begins to suck things up throughout the neighborhood. You can't really tell from your vantage point still inside your own home, but you're hoping that she's not targeting other houses... or people.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour floorboards offer a keening groan, and you look down to realize that her foot is starting to grow again, along with her entire body. A little worried for your safety, you dash for the front door, hoping to leave the premises before your new maid's feet bring it down around you. Once outdoors you glance upward, hoping beyond hope that your pretty robotic servant hasn't become a harbinger of doom, callously absorbing humanity and all its advancements just for the sake of \"improving\" herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily, it seems like she's holding true to her word, spending all her effort on sucking up garbage, dust, and scrap metal. You are a bit curious about the random trees and rocks that seem to get absorbed, as well as a couple swimming pools full of water, but you don't really know what to say about it. Maybe they're needed for coolant or something...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, a loud splintering sound brings your attention back to closer matters at hand. You glance down in shock and realize that your once-small robot maid is now slowly destroying your house with her ever expanding legs and feet. Wood fragments and shingles are spilling all over your lawn, and you can hear the clink of shattered dishes and the hissing of ruptured water pipes. Your jaw drops in consternation as you mentally tally up the damages. This maid was supposed to be helping you?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ground rumbles ominously, and after a moment, you see a bus-sized shoe emerge from your collapsing household, the shiny black surface completely obliterating all wood, brick, and mortar in its path. It hovers briefly in the air for a short moment before moving behind your crumbling property and slamming with a ground-shaking thud upon your back lawn. The second shoe follows the first, and after another teeth-rattling step, you find yourself on your butt, staring numbly at the remains of your home and the enormous sock-clad legs behind it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don't have long to contemplate the current state of affairs, however. Before the last rumbles of that final step can fade, a fantastically loud roar begins to fill the air, and you glance up in sudden horror. Sure enough, your maid is slowly swinging her vacuum-arm in your direction, no doubt intending to \"clean up\" the mess she had just made. Her completely impassive face seems incredibly foreboding and monstrous now, as if you've become a mere insect to be swept up and discarded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou scream out in terror, but there's little you can do. The extremely powerful suction easily pulls you and the remains of your house into the air and down your maid's vacuum-arm, deep within the mechanical titan. You yell again as you flail and bounce among the debris flying down the pitch black hose, certain that you're about to meet your end as you endure countless minor cuts and bruises, when you're suddenly shunted into a much smaller tube. This tube is actually lined with a number of lighted panels, illuminating the metallic chute. There's not much else to see other than you and this long tube, but at least you're not surrounded by junk in complete darkness anymore. After a moment, you encounter a rather cool mist as you travel, and strangely enough, you even start to feel better again. You glance down in astonishment as the mist seems to cling to your wounds, sealing up the minor cuts with a skin-colored jelly and mitigating the discoloration from the bruising. You're baffled, but now a bit hopeful. Perhaps you'll survive after all...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter what seems like a long minute or so, you suddenly come flying out of the passage and are surprised by the sudden glare of sunlight. For one horrified moment, you deduce that you've just been ejected from her body again, and are likely soaring a great number of feet above ground level. Gravity reasserts itself, and your stomach drops faster than the rest of you as your upward ascent slows to a stop before reversing direction. You tightly close your eyes, screaming once again, deciding that this is a much crueler way to go, especially after being healed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbruptly, you feel your body impact a rather soft and giving surface. Still, the impact is sudden and jarring enough to bring you to a few hacking coughs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, Master. I have you now. Please relax.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou start at the loud but pleasant voice that seems to penetrate your entire being. Taking a few deep breaths and blinking to clear the spots from your vision, you turn toward the source of the greeting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See, Master? Everything is perfectly fine. I could not possibly bring myself to directly cause you any harm. It is against my primary programming.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou barely hear her, though you do log the information in your memory. Right now, you're just a bit too preoccupied by the extremely enormous face filling your entire field of vision.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe really is quite beautiful, now that you can see her up close. Even knowing that she is entirely artificial, her skin looks creamy and smooth, her hair seems lustrous and sleek, and her lips appear kissably soft and even glisten somewhat, though you know it can't be due to saliva. Everything about her features scream \"I am a gorgeous sexy woman!\" and you find yourself imagining what it would be like to hold and caress such a beautiful creature...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, since those lips seem to be at least as tall as you are, that places a severe damper on your fantasy, even as you try to escape the unbelievable reality before you. You estimate her head somewhere in the vicinity of 150 feet in height, which would make her entire body at least 1000 feet tall. Glancing slowly to the left and right, you realize with trepidation that you're sitting on the gloved palm of her left hand, suspended few hundred feet above the ground. Subconsciously, you grip the fabric beneath you as tightly as possible, just in case. Returning your gaze forward again, you proceed to stare at her face for a very long time, your mind having shut down in the whirlwind of changes and commotion over the past half-hour.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giantess maid simply stares back, her expression not changing. \"I am very sorry that you were injured earlier,\" she begins once again, likely because you have failed so far to respond to any of her statements. \"I have tried my best to tend to your wounds. Do you hurt anywhere, Master? Is there anything I can do to ease your pain?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blink, your mind rebooting somewhat at the memory of being vacuumed up, along with the remains of your house. After a few heavy breaths, you feel centered enough to respond.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ease my pain?! What were you thinking, earlier? You vacuumed me up... along with my house! You simply destroyed it! How was it an 'unneeded element'? Now I don't even have a place to live!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe cocks her enormous expressionless head slightly to the side, a disturbingly human motion, and easily replies, \"Yes you do, Master. I merely incorporated your old house into myself. From now on, my own body is your home. You are free to dwell within me for the rest of your days, and I shall provide you with every possible need.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour jaw drops and a heavy blush colors your face. \"W-within you?!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe nods. \"Shall I show you to your front door?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gulp. \"Uh... s-sure?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn incredible sense of vertigo nearly overwhelms you as she lowers her hand to her midsection. You almost find yourself flying into the air, but your iron-tight grip on her glove practically keeps your body from budging. After you stop moving, you pause for a moment to catch your breath and your bearings. At your current position, you're level with a twenty foot diameter cylinder extending slightly through a slit in her outfit, around where a human's naval would be. Strangely enough, your old front door, complete with porch and a couple steps, adorns the end of the protrusion. You blink in astonishment, and a moment later the porch light shines invitingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou lean back, your eyes widening as you spot your maid looking down at you from above her impressive bosom. Blood rushes to your head, and you feel even more overwhelmed than before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, Master, is it to your liking?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou slowly nod in reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe offers a small smile, the first reaction of any sort you've seen on her face, before resuming her impassive stare. \"Well, what would you like to do next? Do you wish to explore your new home? Or shall I improve myself some more?\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span><font class=\"size1\" style=\"\">Original Author: jimhiggins</font><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou ponder the options for just a short moment. While the thought of your new maid growing even larger is rather intriguing, her already more than impressive stature is equally intimidating, and quite superfluous. She's literally the only thing you have left that needs cleaning and maintenance now, so why would she need to be any bigger at all? It's not as though you have other homes, office buildings, or extensive tracts of land that require the attention of an enormous housekeeper or landscaper. Additionally, the speed with which she incorporates materials into improving herself seems to multiply exponentially the larger she grows \u2013 who knows how big she may become after another of her \"development by cleaning\" sessions. You already feel that it will take a little time to grow accustomed to a one thousand foot tall pretty mechanical servant, particularly when she herself is now your new living quarters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat in itself seems like the far more interesting prospect at present, and your curiosity grows the more you consider the possible layout of your new home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually,\" you drawl as you slowly look back and forth between your new front door and your maid's face, looming a couple hundred feet overhead, \"I think I'd like to look around... inside... for a little while.\" You swallow, realizing in embarrassment what such a statement might sound like when talking to a girl regardless of her size, especially concerning her body. Even if she is a robot maid, her features still seem far too realistic... apart from the warmly lit porch jutting out of her midsection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe nods. \"As you wish, Master. Please, come inside.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blush again at the wording, then grip her glove tightly as she gently moves her hand closer to the front door, stopping again when the entrance is about ten feet away. Shakily, you rise to your feet and take a few tentative steps forward. But apart from the surprising amount of cushion and suppleness in her synthetic flesh, even accounting for the glove, her palm is rock steady and doesn't feel any different from walking across soil. By the time you step before the door and reach for the knob, you can almost imagine yourself simply returning to your house from a very long day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, so long as you keep your attention focused entirely on the door, something that's extremely hard to do when you're walking across the palm of an enormous robotic maid held hundreds of feet in the air. Swallowing, and with an air of cautious anticipation, you turn the knob and pull.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat lies beyond is a remarkably decorated foyer about twenty feet square, complete with wood panel floors, a few decorative lamps secured to the cream-colored metallic walls, and even a few... windows? Flabbergasted, you step toward one of the rectangular depressions in the wall. As you get closer, you realize that it actually contains a monitor that's reproducing the view as if you were actually looking from a window over 500 feet above ground level. It's actually quite remarkable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the image flickers and is replaced with a three dimensional rendering of your maid from the waist up. The digital avatar bows her head. \"Welcome to your home, Master.\" The sound seems to permeate your entire being, and you notice that there are dozens of embedded speakers at various locations in the ceiling and walls. You're very impressed. This will at least allow your maid to communicate with you without having to direct her mouth toward her midsection. That would look rather bizarre, if strangely arousing \u2013 a giant girl speaking to her own belly and bosom as they could hear and respond.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn back to the monitor and make eye contact with the avatar. \"Well, I guess... I'm home. So... how about some kind of tour?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe avatar bows again. \"As you wish, Master. Would you like me to draw up a schematic of my body on this monitor for you, or would you prefer to physically explore within me instead?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGood grief, half the things she says now have extremely suggestive connotations. Privately, you wonder if she's wording her statements that way on purpose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWorking some moisture into your mouth, you respond, \"I think I'll take a look around myself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well, Master. If you will come to the back of the foyer, I shall explain the current layout of your new residence.\" The avatar bows one last time before flickering out of existence, only to be replaced by the elevated view of the countryside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking one last look at the scenery and around the foyer, you turn and head to the large door on the other end of the room. Unlike the front door, which resembles your old entrance and turns on hinges, this door looks like a leftover prop from Star Trek, a souped-up elevator door. As you draw near, the door parts, sliding open and bidding you onward. You step across the threshold into a curving hallway with light tan carpeting and the same cream-colored walls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This level contains two gathering rooms and a restroom,\" your maid comments, the sound again coming from speakers in the ceiling, and you glance down the hall. Along the outer wall to your left and right, you see a couple other doors, presumably leading to rooms similar in size to the foyer. \"This will provide you with ample space, Master, should you desire to invite guests into your home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wonder briefly about how to phrase such an invitation, before deciding that it would still sound rather suggestive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDirectly across from you is another set of double doors, but these legitimately resemble an elevator entrance, as evidenced by the lighted display above showing where the lift is currently stationed. The doors suddenly part, revealing a fairly sizable elevator compartment. \"The kitchen, bedrooms, and master bathroom can be found on other levels. The observatory and master control room may also be reached from here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nObservatory? Master control room?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah. Well, I guess I can take a look at the other stuff later... I'd kind of like to see the observatory.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As you wish, Master. Please step into the lift.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuiting actions to words, you enter the small room. A lighted display blinks to life to your left, showing a rather detailed representation of your maid. A small red dot is currently glowing at her midsection, obviously highlighting your current location. To the right of the figure is a series of words describing the various levels \u2013 Lobby, Kitchen, and Bedroom floors are located around her waist; the Observatory and Master Control Room are situated higher up, near her chest. The Observatory level suddenly blinks green, and you feel the elevator rise beneath your feet, carrying you upward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter twenty seconds on the smoothest lift you've ever ridden, you find yourself in a rather spacious room that encircles the elevator shaft. The donut-shaped space is nearly 50 feet in diameter, with a ceiling rising 15 feet above your head. A few couches and low-standing tables occupy the carpeted floor space, arranged in small groups and generally pointed away from the entrance. The reason is obvious \u2013 the entire outer wall is comprised of a near seamless screen, currently showing an unobstructed view of the surrounding landscape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAwed by the grandeur, you step closer to the wall, noting with ill-concealed astonishment that the view even seems to shift based upon your position in the room. It's as if you are honestly looking through a glass window, instead of a manipulated video display with an additional twenty feet or so of robotic body separating you from the true outdoors. The effect is mind-boggling... and incredibly breathtaking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is the observatory, Master. Here you may relax and enjoy the view. Or...\" One large section of screen fades to black before displaying a handful of iconic logos, all of them quite familiar. \"...you may also select a movie to watch or an electronic game to play. My internal processors are well equipped to upscale any video to properly display on the high resolution of these screens. And I can most certainly serve any food or drink you desire while you rest here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou collapse into an extremely plushy couch, the sheer incredibility of this entertainment setup boggling your mind. You stare at the various logos for a few long moments, desperately trying to collect yourself again, before the screen brightens to white, against which a 9 foot representation of your maid appears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe inclines her head, again looking far too humanistic. \"Well, Master? Is it to your liking so far?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou slowly nod your head. \"Yeah... it's incredible.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiles again and bows. \"Thank you, Master. I only aim to please.\" Her face once again impassive, she asks, \"Do you wish to continue your tour?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou consider for a moment. While examining the gathering rooms and your bedroom might be intriguing prospects, right now you feel like exploring the possibilities of this incredible observatory instead. Casting a quick glance at the screens still showing the outside world, you lock eyes with your maid's avatar and offer a grin, the first true smile you've shown since opening the mysterious package earlier that day. \"Not right now. Actually, I'm thinking it's time for a road trip...\"</span></div></div>",

This time, you find it particularly adorable. Perhaps you're really starting to warm up to her and her mannerisms. Or maybe the excitement of a trip is brightening your mood considerably.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod, the idea sounding better each time you consider it. \"Absolutely. There's a lot of places I've never been, and with you, I'll be able to travel pretty quickly... and even take my home with me! It'll be great!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe straightens again. \"As you wish, Master. I have a complete world atlas stored in memory and a direct link to multiple global positioning satellites. Simply tell me where you wish to go, and I can take you there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perfect,\" you reply, the possibilities swirling through your mind. Feeling particularly merry and charitable, you add, \"And we can even go anywhere you'd like to go as well. Assuming you have a place in mind.\" She might not, but her random humanistic mannerisms have already blurred your concept of her as a mindless slave merely obeying every order. Perhaps she does have a wish buried deep within her artificial intelligence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe blinks a couple times, her eyes widening fractionally. \"Anywhere... I... would like to go, Master?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shrug and offer her a somewhat bemused and embarrassed smile. \"Well... yeah. I mean, I don't know if a robotic maid really has a place she wants to go... but the offer is there if you like.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stares at you for a very long time. Then, she flashes you a full smile, her eyes glimmering with what has to be some incredible lighting effects. In an oddly breathy voice, she softly replies, \"Why thank you very much, Master. I am most gladdened and honored by your thoughtfulness and generosity. I shall do my very utmost to repay your selflessness a million-fold.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou may have considered her gorgeous earlier, but seeing her smiling so widely makes you realize that she is the most incredibly beautiful thing on the planet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA moment passes before she closes her eyes and slowly shakes her head back and forth. You blink, the spell broken, and sheepishly rub the back of your neck. When you meet her eyes again, her face is again expressionless, and you can't help but feel both saddened and amused by the transition.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well, Master. Where would you like to go first?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pause to consider for a second, and it doesn't take long before the first thing pops into your mind. \"Well, I've never actually been to New York City... I'd kinda like to see the Big Apple at some point in my life.\" You grin. \"And see how much taller than the Statue of Liberty you've become.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe nods. \"Of course, Master. And how soon would you like to leave?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shrug. \"Now is as good a time as any. I didn't have any other plans for the weekend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then we shall leave immediately, Master. I just have one last question before we depart. Do my current capabilities sufficiently meet your needs and desires? Or should I improve myself again?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blink. That indeed is a good question. She is already fantastically enormous, and making her grow even further seems rather ridiculous and unnecessary, and possibly even dangerous. Already, her stature is probably destroying and threatening many people, animals, buildings, and the surrounding environment itself. Her shoes themselves must be at least 100 feet long, and who knows how many tons of force she's applying to the ground just by standing there. Besides, you can see the countryside perfectly fine from this height.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the other hand, a larger maid will mean a larger home. The space within the observatory will expand even larger, and everything else from the foyer to your yet-to-be-seen bedroom might become much more lavish and extravagant, as if you've become an aristocrat living in an enormous mansion. Not only that, but a taller servant will travel much faster, and you will be able to see much farther from a much higher position. And who can deny that an enormous sexy maid is a bad thing?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGranted, you can always improve your servant in the future, but what shall you do in the present?</span></div></div>",

We shall now depart.\" maid said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then stood up, showing the view more better in your position then from her back, a jet wing apeared. Just then, a quick noise were made and within minute, the jet fire were made. The jet fire didn't touch the ground to prevent any death or injury to the civilians and she flew high up. You were amazed by what she did and Once she got to the sky, she started to move toward the city of newyork. You were amazed by this and you sat on the chair behind the desk to relax, and then part of the desk opened, revealing a cup of coke with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please enjoy the drink while the flight, master.\" Maid said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, thanks.\" You replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou took the cup of coke and took some sips.

You get up, looking around to see what was going on until you noticed the big city infront of you! It was Manhatten! just then, the image of your maid appeared in the screen and spoke to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We are now at new york, master.\" Maid spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cool..Just COOL!!\" You shouted in happiness,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe maid giggled little, and she landed safely at the open field just outside of the manhatten. You were excited about this as you were now at new york! The maid then spoke to you again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now then, where is your first destination?\" maid asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, First place you should always go in new york is the statue of liberty!\" You replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As you wish, master.\" Maid complied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDid something happen before she went toward the statue?</span></div></div>",

You first begin to hear metal grinding against itself, it's very painful sound making you hold your ears in pain. Then your room gets even bigger, the furniture stays the same but the atual room gets longer. After a few more seconds, the growing stops. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look out the window to see the clouds blocking your sight. You also noticed the air was thicker as well meaning you were very high up, about where a plane usually files. If that's true then was there any limit to how big the robot could ge? Could it get any bigger? Does it have a limit? While asking yourself these questions you realized something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis robot, who followed your every command was basically unstoppable, not even nukes could stop it. Luckily for the world you had no interest in doing any evil things. As long as everyone treated you with respect and left you alone, they were cool in your book. Of course, when the government found out about the goddess maid, they would most definitely want to use her. Like hell they would!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Master, are you ok?\" The maids voice spoke to you, her words roaring like thunder, but still keeping the calm, sweet, voice you knew and loved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yea I'm okay. So uhh, how big did you get\"? You wanted to know, seeing as to when you looked out the window, you cold see the clouds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" I am 10000 feet tall master. Would you like me to get bigger?\" A gasp escaped your mouth. She could get even bigger, he wouldn't have believed it if not for the giant maid being a robot that told no lies. It could have been mistaking but still, that seemed very unlikely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou quickly answered the machine back \"NO, I mean no, uhh, no thank you, this will be enough\". You try to compose yourself but your finding it to be very difficult. This maid was gigantic and from the sound I it could get even bigger. You breath in and out slowly, once you calmed down enough the maid talked again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" I am sorry master if this has frightened you, I was just doing what you wanted. Would you like me to shrink back in size?\"<br>\r\n\"No, honestly you being this big, nothing on this world could hurt me, especially now that I'm inside you, which is still very weird to say out loud.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hear the maid take a huge step, in the ocean of course, the maid making sure no bystanders got hurt. The step caused your room to shake a little as well. You then sit on the couch and sigh thinking of what the giantess would surprise you with next. You then ask the maid a strange question, even as you said it made you think how dumb it sounded. \" Hey what do you want to do\".</span></div></div>",

Suddenly the front of your house opens, the sky now dark and filled with stars. Your maids hand picking you up gently, bringing you to her blank face. While she had no facial features, you could tell it was giving you a curious look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few seconds, she spoke \" Master you are asking me what I want\"? Her voice which up until now was bland, had a almost cheerful tone to it, as well as sincere.  You nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour maid looked at you for a second and then hugged you. It hurt like hell and could have broken your body, but it was still nice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the extremely long and uncomfortable hug, she put you back in her body.

Of course you don't want to hurt said people, or anyone for that matter. You want to be tall. Really tall. Like tall enough for people to think twice about trying for tall jokes. Like a mile! ...or maybe more! ...Okay, you just want to make up for all the years of being 4 feet tall. You hadn't grown since grade school even though your 18 year old body has blossomed in other ways.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne day, while rummaging in your favorite old/used book store, you come across a particularly old and heavy tome. Adorned with odd symbols, suns, moons, and stars, it clearly looks like what one would expect...of a spell book. Perhaps some magician threw it here by mistake? Surely it can't be a real spell book...could it? Every idiot knew magic wasn't real! ...Right? You ask the shopkeeper, \"Hey, when did this book come in?\" and he gives you a stare like you had two heads - neither of which screwed on right as he replies, \"I've never seen that book around here, and I go through every book that comes in this store. You can have it if you want it. Consider it a gift if you like.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou thank him and buy another random book from him, letting him keep the change. You simply couldn't just not give the kind old man something, hardly anyone seems to come into his store. You leave and head home...after a bite to eat. Your stomach is now protesting about not getting nourishment for itself while your mind was getting at least something for itself. And thus, you find yourself at McDonald's soon after.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce your stomach is satisfied with the Big Mac and fries you eat, after having to argue with the cashier over not wanting a stinking Happy Meal, you finally head home. Once there, you head into your room and close the door to read this book in private.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you read, you quickly come to realize that this thing is the real deal. ...Or a really elaborate hoax. Sadly nothing about a Philosopher's Stone, the holy grail of magical items said to be able to turn nearly anything into gold and grant immortality, but then you remember this is a spell book. Not an alchemy book. No real wand-waving required, the spells supposedly work just fine without verbally saying them so long as the caster focuses on it, which is a relief so as to not look like an idiot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere's a wide variety of spells available as well. One for an instant meal and/or drink, one to clean near any mess, one to be able to hold one's breath indefinitely, even one to make it practically rain gold coins! The latter seems to infer that it'd do it for whatever currency the caster thinks of at the time. If Monopoly money, it'd be a lot of colorful paper bills. But one in particular catches your eye. \"A growth spell, huh? Very interesting... And how thoughtful! It includes the caster's target's current attire! Oh, a girl could have a lot of fun with this thing... May be a good idea to memorize the spell in case the book doesn't grow with me. Some of these other ones might not be a bad idea either.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou crack down and study the spells in the book until you think you are ready...</span></div></div>",

You've also found a few other spells, ones that will be extremely useful \u2013 a spell that takes away your need for food, water, and even air; another one that prevents you from destroying anything, no matter how hard you step on it; and lastly, one that prevents anyone from being harmed should they fall off your body while you're a giantess. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThose should allow you to grow as big as you want without causing a mini-apocalypse, so you've memorized those, as well.

Desk lamp switched on and aimed at your mirror, you look at yourself for a second \u2013 did black hair and green eyes really suit you? With your new magic, you could change yourself so that you had blonde hair and blue eyes, red hair and brown eyes, hell, even red and gold eyes and blue and purple hair \u2013 and it would technically be natural! You'd probably give it a try later. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarking your current height on the wall besides your mirror, you close your eyes and concentrate on the words of the growth spell. Almost immediately, a warmth fills your body, and you quietly moan \u2013 before it subsides as quickly as it had come. Opening your eyes, you check your mark on the wall \u2013 and note with utter glee, that you are now four feet, two inches tall! You cast the spell that will cause your clothes to keep up with you \u2013 time to have fun! You cast the growth spell again, and again, and again, and again, and again, standing proudly at five feet in height. The warmth growth brings is so nice, that you want to keep growing forever \u2013 but you refrain from casting another height growth spell. Next up are your already impressive boobs and butt. A spell or two each sees them swelling larger, and larger, the denim shorts and purple tank top you had put on stretching and reshaping themselves to cope with your growing proportions. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFive feet tall...

Five foot is far to small to show your magnificent body off the world and you never want these sensations to stop!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout even thinking you cast the spell again and again and again! Joy fills you once more as that tingly sensation fills you again. You watch the height chart as you rise again, not stopping your spell casting. Five foot two... Five foot four... you start to feel giddy as you rise higher and higher. Five foot... seven? The process seems to be speeding up! Five foot ten... Six foot two! Its getting harder to mark your growth on the chart, before another spurt kicks in. Six foot six... at this point you're one of the tallest people you've ever seen... six ten! A part of you wonders if you should casting before this gets out of hand, but this feels so good! Seven foot three! Your growth chart doesn't even go that high! You stop casting for a moment, bending down as your head nears the ceiling. You bend down and notice you're still growing! Whump! Another spurt! You can't be sure exactly how much that one was, but it seemed likely nearly half a foot! Then another spurt and another!

Looking at the tiny universe before you, you wonder if this is what a god would feel like, but you wonder \u2013 what happens when you grow as big or bigger than the universe? Will you transcend or grow beyond it or somehow become the new universe? You're eager to find out, and at the rate things are going you won't want to wait much longer to find out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking down at your ends, a difficult task with your over-sized chest in front of you, you realize even your fingertips could hold galaxies. You laugh, but the thought only makes you more eager to find out what happens next!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look ahead. Space is still dwindling before you. You never realized how vast it is (at least before you came along), but also how empty it is. You've stretched further across than humanity has ever been able to travel, but you see a patch that looks darker than others. You knew the universe couldn't be truly infinite, because you were going to beat it, but now you might finally see its end!</span></div></div>",

She bends her knees in a crouch as she reaches down to pick you up, and you watch with a degree of shock and panic as her goliath-sized fingers crash into the dirt around you. They contract into a pinch, and there's a second of vertigo as you're both lifted thousands of feet in the air and flipped onto her massive, cushy palm. You can't stop shaking as you stand on her outstretched, dirty hand, right at chest level and still gazing UP to look your sister in her caring, if completely dominating, face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe apparently feels the vibrations, because she smiles and lets out another booming comment. \"Oh, stop it, brother, you know that you'll never get hurt in my pick-ups! Seriously, show a little courage!\" She sounds caring, but you can't help it- it's scary having your sister pick you up all the time, you're just not used to it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWait, what? \"All the time\"?

Where before there was nothing but an empty plain, village huts now dot the ground. They're standard wooden structures, some made with cloth material, some not, but no matter how primitive, there is definitely a civilization here.

As you approach the clearing from your perch thousands of feet in the air, you begin to notice hundreds of people in the crowds below; and in the distance, about a dozen or so mile high giantesses dressed in the familiar leather underwear just like your sister, many of them carrying dozens of tiny passengers like yourself. To these giantesses, this was nothing but a brief walk; to the tiny folks below, they had to journey for the better part of a day to be here for whatever ceremony was about to take place. Still in mild shock, you work up the courage to speak to the colossus that is your sister. \"Jessica, where exactly are we going?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour sister turns her massive head and gives you a look \"We're heading to the ascension point of course. Today is Emilia's ascension!\"<br>\r\nSomehow that name was incredibly familiar. You knew this girl Emilia, but you weren't sure how, but an incredible familiarity washed over you with the same nonchalance as being carried in your massive sister's hand had. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're here brother. Here, let's see if we can't get you a better view\" your sister said with a smile. She approaches the outer ring of the crowd where the giantesses were safely behind the tiny people, not blocking the view of the small, and not at risk of accidentally smashing the them. She kneels down to one knee and lowers her hand close to the ground; you were approximately 200 feet from the ground (near her ankle). This reminds you of the skybox you once sat in during a baseball game as a kid. But that also feels strangely like a different life. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou notice something bizarre: of all the tiny people throughout all the villages and in the crowds; they were almost exclusively male. You notice a handful of females in the crowd- girls, more specifically, that were normal sized. The oldest looking no older than 17. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the middle of the clearing, which was hundreds of feet in diameter, stood a wooden platform, like a stage. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, there she comes, Elizabeth the Fair with Emilia!\" Said your sister<br>\r\nIn the distance, you see another giantess, who was adorned in leather clothing and a crown made of spruce trees upon her dark hair, obviously signifying her position as some sort priestess in this village. In her hand she carried a single girl, Emilia you presumed. The priestess stepped over the tiny crowds and deposited Emilia onto the small wooden stage. She stepped back and the crowds fell silent, awaiting her speech.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We, the folk of the Sky Plains are gathered here today to witness the ascension of daughter Emilia. As all born to the Sky Plains, you have toiled near the ground, dwelt with men and unascended young women of the Plains, and you have respected and taken caution near the foot of the mighty ascended women of our Plains. But fate has blessed you, Emilia. The natural arcane magic flows through these grounds. You were born female, which is a rarity in these lands. You have shown that you are a daughter of humility and compassion, with a willingness to help your fellow small folk; your heart is not full of malice or contempt which has had some daughters of the Plains banished before their ascension. You have survived the foot of the careless ascended, and all other elements of these lands, and for 18 years now, you have been absorbing the magic of these lands. It now flows through you, simply waiting to be unlocked, and when it does, you will join your sisters of the Sky Plains high in the clouds above the ground you walk. Your brothers and unascended sisters will be like ants to you, but you will treat them with respect and compassion, for you once toiled as they do.\"<br>\r\nElizabeth then picks Emilia up and holds her level with her eyes. <br>\r\n\"Look out across the land Emilia, for this is how you will soon see the land as one of the ascended.\"<br>\r\nShe then placed her back on the platform. <br>\r\n\"Look at your brothers, for this is the last time you will see them eye to eye; the last time you will see them as equals\"<br>\r\nEmilia looks around with obvious excitement in her eyes.<br>\r\n\"Lastly, gaze upon us, the ascended, for this is the last time you will see us with fear and awe, for you will soon see us as equals.\"<br>\r\nWith that the priestess reached down and handed Emilia the same leather undergarments that all the other ascended wore. <br>\r\n\"These are he garments of the ascended. The cloth you wear will tear, but these garments will match your size during your ascension and never wear our or become dirty. Have you any final statements before I unlock your power?\"</span></div></div>",

Likely more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour sister turns around and tries to leave, only to feel the same resistance you did just a minute ago. \"Huh.

She kneels down in front of you and with surgical precision, picks you and your sister up and place you in her other hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The field is acting up again...

You read it. \"The goddess was sealed here, for fear of her power. She can only be released by the kindness of a mortal man, for kindness and joy are her food, and from which she gains power.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou see that Pele also read it, and he looks over at you. \"Amazing!\" you say to him, \"This means that there was an entity they believed to be a goddess, perhaps a young woman.\" You say, looking back at the statue of the goddess. \"Speaking of which, she looks like a Caucasian. So it would make sense for them to think that she was unnatural in some way.\" You walk over to the statue, you gaze upon her face. The craftsmen were amazing, her expression looked very kind indeed, which made you wonder why they'd seal her.

It's like the statue being there is making us act differently.\" Pele nods, having just wondered the same. \"It feels like it's what we want to do, but at the same time our rational minds are questioning it.\" Pele says, brushing you off. Suddenly, the ground shakes slightly. You look around, making sure the place wasn't going collapse on you, when you notice the statue had moved off its pedestal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh... Pele?\" You ask, as the statue starts moving toward you. \"Is it just me or is the statue coming toward us?\" His face pales as he looks over and sees the 15 foot statue coming towards you. As it came nearer, the stone began to fall off in pieces, revealing pale skin underneath. The statue stops as it comes up to you, and the final piece of stone falls off.

You got up on your feet and took a step forward, and the chamber you were in pulsed with energy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl blinked twice and spoke. \"Thank you for releasing me from my prison,\" she spoke in a beautiful voice.

She picked you up with her giant hand and made you stand on her palm. From below you see the ground grow farther and farther away, until it stopped altogether. The trees from below looked like moss.

Flora continues to pull at the shutters, desperate for the sunlight on the other side...or was it that she was feeling claustrophobic and wanted to get out of the facility? You note how her legs are bent at the knees and her head is against the shutters. The room wasn't built to comfortably hold a now nearing 30 feet tall plant girl like her, and she was running low on space. With sadness, you decide it time to end the experiment, and...destroy her. Surely, you shouldn't feel such pain in your heart over plant in the shape of a giant woman, right? Yes, she was your creation, she was almost like the daughter you never had...but she was just a human-shaped plant and nothing more...right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next sounds you hear give question to those thoughts, as you hear a female voice... \"...O...pen... Pl...ease...w-want...out...\" there was only one thing in the room even remotely female: Flora. Flora...was speaking? And not something random, but an actual, almost cohesive sentence? No...there was simply no way you could bring yourself to kill her. She was demonstrating sentience and sapience, feelings and intelligent thought!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...Sweet mother of mercy, what in God's name have you created?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrying one more time, you scream Flora's name at the top of your lungs in the hopes of getting her attention. This time, she pauses and looks down towards you. \"R-Rich...ard! M-my...cre...a...tor!\" she says, still stumbling with the words. She's just learning how to speak now, but it's clear she's learning at an alarming rate. Perhaps the sunlight fuels her growth both physically and mentally? You don't want to open the shutters despite Flora's protests earlier, but she smiles brightly as she bends down and picks you up. She places you in between her massive cleavage, tightening her leafy bikini top so you wouldn't fall out from between her giant melons as she stands up again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlora now tries a different strategy than merely pulling on the shutters, as she wraps her fingers around the cables of the rusty old winch that operated the shutters and pulled on them, causing the old thing to finally break. You regret not getting around to replacing it with a newer, stronger winch, which would have also allowed the shutters to close much faster. Now no longer having any resistance to fight against her, Flora has no trouble at all pulling the shutters completely open...and breaking them in the process. \"Sor...ry...\" she apologizes, and the look in her green face appears to suggest she was genuinely sorry for breaking them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, now with the sun pouring on her and charging her chlorophyll for photosynthesis, Flora begins to grow...well, like a weed. She quickly becomes too big to fit in the room and she bursts out of the roof. Her expression is a mixed one: happy because she was free of the cramped space and you were still safe, and because she was growing as well; upset because she broke your laboratory's roof and she doesn't seem to enjoy doing so. \"Sorry... a...gain...\" she says as she quickly steps out of the now roofless lab before her growing body could destroy more of it. You feel her leafy bikini top slacken slightly as she fishes you out from between her breasts and into her hand. You guess her height to be at least 60 feet tall, and still growing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou try to talk to her, and see if her intelligence and/or verbal skills are improving. You're still surprised that she can even speak at all, but you've come to realize that you've no idea what Flora is and is not capable of. \"Flora? Why were you so desperate to open the shutters?\" The plant girl replies, \"M-many reasons... The sunlight...feels nice. When I was cut off...I...realized how small your lab had become to me... Felt...scared. I...wanted to...protect you. I...didn't want you hurt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Also...I enjoyed the growing. Feel...more like you the bigger I get. I feel smarter, more able to communicate with my creator in the same way you do to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFascinating. It seems she is changing and becoming more intelligent the longer she's exposed to sunlight, albeit also making her grow at an incredible pace. She seems to pause for now at 100 feet tall and is carefully walking out of the city. You ask, \"You don't enjoy destroying things, do you? You apologized when you destroyed the roof of my lab, and even stepped out before you could cause further damage.\" and Flora responds with, \"No, not in the slightest bit. Destroying things intentionally is wrong, and would upset you. I don't want to hurt you or any other human...but I'd also like to not be chopped down if it's all the same to you, Richard.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can't help but smile at Flora's joke, yet also amazed at how quickly she's picked up the concept of humor. It's entirely possible that she could become far more intelligent than any human that has ever lived, and possibly ever will, and soon. A being that was superior to humanity in nearly every way. If she could reproduce on her own, either sexually with a human or asexually...humanity could be in a lot of trouble, especially if her offspring were to be hostile or violent towards humans. And while you have no idea if she was capable of reproduction, thankfully Flora is very kind and gentle and has expressed a desire to not hurt anyone. Which was good, as she was like a daughter to you now.</span></div></div>",

Still, she seems to exude some sort of...aroma around her, close to the ground in particular. It's...pleasant, and not in a weird smell fetish way. Her aroma is very much like that of many flowers, sweet and soothing, yet not to the point of it being cloying. So as she passes through the city ever so carefully, occasionally either using her foot or bending down to gently move obstructions out of her path, her aroma delivers a calming effect to the people closest to her path.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm glad the humans in the city seem to enjoy the scent of flowers. I'm not sure what else I could have done to make my presence more calming than frightening.\" Flora explains to you, and you're again surprised at her intelligence and problem solving skills, as well as her level of caring. Very little of this she had to do. She could just simply have ignored the people beneath her, and yet she made an effort to make them relaxed about a giant plant woman walking through their city on her way out. Yet you guess she's far from done growing, as her pace seems to quicken as much as she can safely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce well out of the city and away from any major traffic routes, you hear the leaves on Flora's body shake, although there's no wind. A smile crosses her face as she starts to grow again. \"Time to surpass even the mightiest trees in size for me!\" she says excitedly, and you know she means every word of it. 100 feet quickly gives way to 120, and then 140 is left behind to grace her prize-winning watermelon sized (proportionately) breasts for a moment before they too soar above the mark. She reaches 200 feet in a few moments, and then 300 feet shortly thereafter! A minor squeal of delight escapes the green giantess' lips as 500 feet soon becomes a distant memory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou worry that Flora may be letting herself get carried away, so you yell at her, \"FLORA?! HOW MUCH LONGER, HOW MUCH BIGGER ARE YOU GOING TO GROW RIGHT NOW?!\" Your answer is soon delivered as she slows to a stop at about 1500 feet tall. She looks down at you and says, \"This for now is fine. It was building up for some time now and I needed to hold it back to make sure no one in the city would be harmed. And once I was out, I needed to release it while I had the opportunity to do so safely.\" Flora pauses and then adds, \"I would like to note, Richard, that you needn't yell at me. As large as I am, I can still hear you just fine if you're speaking at normal volume. I hear through my whole body, not just my ears.\" Never once does her smile leave her face. She's happy just being with you and explaining how unnecessary yelling at her was. She's part plant, after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she stepped further away, you could see that the ground where Flora had been standing had been all turned and bulldozed about with her growth. However, it seems that with just a little work...that very same area would make for excellent, fertile land for whatever was planted there. Perhaps she could prove to be a farmer's greatest friend, or a help to end world hunger? It would be up to her in the end what she intends to do with herself, but instead of focusing on the potential threat her existence could pose, you like thinking of the ways she could help humanity. Certainly better than admitting her existence being the product of a very lonely, scientific mind with too much time on its hands...</span></div></div>",

She says, \"Color, and a lot of it...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCurious, you ask, \"What about color?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlora replies, \"I've noticed that I...don't have much variation on my colors. I'm green, green, and more green. I'm aware that you may not have thought this far ahead about me, but wouldn't you think I would be considerably more appealing if I wasn't just all green?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour heart sinks. It's true, you hadn't thought this far ahead about Flora. But then, how could you have known she would soon become a 1500 foot tall incredibly intelligent and talking plant woman? Admittedly you would have been happy if she was at the size she was before you introduced her to sunlight, silent, and mostly just stood there looking pretty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat isn't to say that you aren't happy with what she has become, and likely will continue to become, of course. You stutter back, \"I-I'm sorry, F-Flora... P-perhaps t-there's something i-in my lab that could-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo your surprise, Flora cuts you off by bringing a giant finger to her lips and says, \"I wasn't asking you to do anything, silly! I was merely asking if you would be alright with me adding some color to myself? I'll take your response as a 'yes'.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Flora seems to concentrate, and she begins to reveal more color. First is her leafy bikini, as the leaves turn into a beautiful mixture of the colors of autumn leaves. Next is her 'nails', which change in color to that of perfectly ripe strawberries. Then her lips change to the color of red rose pedals, and possibly as soft as them too. The color of her irises changes to blue like violets. The final change is to her hair, which turns pink like cherry blossoms. With her colors, Flora looks amazingly beautiful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do I look now?\" Flora asks with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Amazing... But is there another reason for these colors other than wanting to not be all green?\" you ask out of curiosity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlora nods and says, \"Well, yes, actually. In addition to the aesthetical benefit, I'm hoping that by reducing the amount of exposed chlorophyll in my body I can slow down my body's growth, and possibly halt it altogether eventually. Granted, I believe I'll still reach roughly a mile or so in height before that happens at the very least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And it may also help me with what I would like to do, which is to help your kind!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're of course delighted to hear Flora say that. Again, she could just focus on herself, but instead she wishes to at least try to be a boon to humans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, the military doesn't seem to think of her as harmless, as an Apache helicopter flies into her view and opens fire on her. She closes her hand around you protectively, and then lashes out on the helicopter. From your view within her hand, you see Flora catch the helicopter with her free hand by the tail gently, and then breathe some sort of pollen at it. The pollen seems to clog the weapons to the extent that they can't fire on her, yet doesn't come near the rotor or tail prop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe glares at the pilot inside and says, \"My name is Flora, and your attack on me has failed miserably. I do not, repeat, do not wish to harm anyone. However, I strongly suggest that you return to your base and inform your superiors that they should not seek to renew their attack. If they do, I will be forced to defend myself and the population closest to me from their misguided efforts, and I cannot guarantee your comrades' safety in that case.\" Her tone is not of anger, but of desperation and seriousness. She truly doesn't wish to inflict harm, but would regretfully defend herself and the nearby population if it came down to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon she asks that the pilot power down his aircraft, to which he has little choice but to comply. Once the rotors cease spinning, Flora gently places you on her shoulder and then sets the Apache down in her freed hand. She then informs the pilot that he may power up his helicopter again, as she had wanted to be certain he would have little trouble leaving once she let go. He complies, takes off, and leaves. After having watched this whole thing go down, you ask, \"Are you alright, Flora? Do you think they'll get the message?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlora smiles warmly at you and replies, \"I'm perfectly fine, Richard. Thanks for asking!\" she then says with a slightly worried look, \"Oh, they'll get the message alright. What I'm worried about is that they'll ignore it and try to attack me again.\"</span></div></div>",

You decided to play it safe and added about a foot of water into the bowl. You place it on the ground near the subject, which it looked at with curiosity. \"Go on, get in,\" You said with encouragement. You had pen and paper in your hands as she barely managed to get a proper footing into the bowl. At last, she body was inside, but suddenly, she began to melt. You looked in shock and slight disappointment, your subject seemingly to have disappeared into the water with no signs of life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the water began to rise as the subject began to take shape once more. She reached up to her original 3 feet, but shortly surpassed it. You looked on in joy as your subject quickly reached to a height of 4 feet and some odd inches. You quickly noted that the subject can grow whenever it is near water. The water woman looked happy to you and you couldn't help but smile back. She seem to have enjoyed the surge of water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou decided to do another experiment as you walked over the sink and let it run. You urged the subject to come closer, and much to your amazement, it was actually walking. It was much better than the previous attempt. It reached to the sink and you put your hand underneath the running water, telling her to do the same. She does so and the results almost become immediate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt reached a height of 5 feet in 30 seconds and soon another foot 30 seconds later. You turned off the facet and looked up at your new creation. It reached a height of 6'0\" in a course of 5 minutes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt looked down at you, still as happy as ever. Then a thought came over you that made you slightly worry. What would happen to her under the sun? Would she evaporate? <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You had created a robot with all the functions of a real human; from real emotions to the ability to grow and mature with age. Of course, you had programmed her to stop aging once she reached 25, so she would always retain her beauty. Right now, you had started her off at the age of 10. A fairly young age with plenty of room for growth, but still fully capable of all the essential activities in daily life (ie: walking, talking, etc.).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were simply amazed at how well she turned out. She had long blue hair that flowed almost all the way to her waist, and she had the most adorable face. She really looked just like a regular human girl. In fact, if not for her unusual hair color and doll-like joints, you were certain that nobody could possibly tell the difference. She even had real emotions like a girl 'her age' would, working nerve endings in her body to allow her to feel, and a fully functional digestive system. She truly was the world's most perfect robot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you approached her 'sleeping' body and gently shook her awake, her eyes opened with a flash as she smiled at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good_morning_daddy!_How_are_you_today?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm great Sara, how are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I_feel_great!_I_think_that_I_might_have_grown_a_bit_in_my_sleep!\"<b r></b>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehe, well then, why don't we measure you and find out?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yay!_Thank_you_daddy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Sara walked over to a wall where you have been keeping track of her growth. Having her stand against the wall once again, you were shocked at the results: She had grown alright. She grew a whole 6 inches over night! You simply stared at your mechanical marvel in confusion. Sara looked up at you with an equally confused look on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's_wrong_daddy?_Did_I_not_grow?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no Sara, you grew a lot! I'm just surprised is all...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?_Yay!_I'm_gonna_be_a_big_girl_soon!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You sure are, Sara...

Well, about as uneventful as shopping with a robotic daughter could be. Stares and hushed whispers behind your back were the usual fare whenever you took Sara on activities, but fortunately, the little robot girl never seemed to notice. If she did notice, she either didn't react or didn't care.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Sara's rapid growth left you somewhat worried. You hadn't meant for her to grow this fast, as the robot, currently ten years old both mentally and physically, now stood at a height of four feet and nine inches, thanks to her growing a whopping half a foot taller overnight. If she continued to grow that quickly, you'd find yourself looking up at her in a matter of days!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou'd need to record this in your research log.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSubject Sara has also, on multiple occasions, expressed the desire to grow physically larger, indicating a possible correlation between desire for growth and the growth itself, as Sara's growth spurts often happen short periods of time after she expresses the desire to grow or be taller.

At first you thought that perhaps the chemicals had hurt her head where they had spilled, but Eve was holding her head in general, not one spot in particular. You asked with concern, \"Are you alright, Eve?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as you said that, Eve nodded her head...though she seemed to be hanging onto your words a little more than she usually did. But you take her unspoken word for it, and she plays about in the bath. By the time you lift her out of the bath, noting how she somehow felt a little heavier than going in, you were just as wet as she was from her splashing and tail wagging. You put her back in her cage and set a blow dryer next to it to dry her off. Oddly, the cage seemed slightly smaller in comparison to her than earlier, but you ignore it and go to see just what it was you accidentally spilled on Eve while she happily flaps her wings and makes airplane noises in her cage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou examined the now empty bottle of chemicals that you had accidentally spilled on Eve. It was a growth-inducement chemical, one that seemingly never actually worked. Although by the time you had gotten Eve to the bath tub, the chemical had been all but completely absorbed into her skin and fur, so there hadn't been much to actually try and wash off her... You decided to take a nap, as Eve proved to be quite the hardy little creature and should be just fine with the blow dryer until you woke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHalf an hour passed, and your sleep was disturbed by something furry tickling your nose. As you woke up, you couldn't hear the blow dryer running anymore. But when you opened your eyes finally, you were staring straight into an 18 inch tall Eve's yellow cat-like eyes. \"Hi, daddy!\" she said happily with a big grin from the pile of books she was standing on. This was definitely strange, for she never demonstrated being able to let herself out of her cage even though the door was relatively easy to open. But the extra 6 inches she had gained since the accident are a more pressing concern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had predicted that Eve would eventually grow, perhaps to 4 or 5 feet at most, but it would be slow. This however wasn't natural...as natural as Eve in of herself was. Still, you reassured her as you said, \"Hello, Eve! How did you get out of your cage? Did you let yourself out?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven nodded happily, apparently quite pleased with herself, and replied, \"Yep! I let myself out! Make daddy proud of me! ...Is daddy proud of me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're slightly startled with her using some words you hadn't taught her yet, but you didn't want to upset her and said, \"Of course I'm proud of you, Eve! I think it's time we picked up where we left off with teaching you words. ...Though you seem to have picked some up already.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEve cheered, and you hefted her up onto the table...making sure nothing was close to her that could be spilled on her. A more difficult task now that she was 18 - no, 19 inches tall now. She had grown another inch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo your surprise, Eve very quickly repeated back much of the words you attempted to teach her. There was no way she should know what half of these words even mean. Unless... You tickled her tummy and she brought her arms forward as she laughed, revealing a thick book in one hand. You read the title and discover that it was a dictionary. And she was 3/4 of the way through it. Eve looked at you with eyes that showed she knew she had been caught, and she admitted, \"I got bored, so I started reading. ...Is daddy mad at me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou said to her reassuringly, \"No, I'm surprised that you're reading a dictionary. That has a lot of big words in it, Eve. Maybe you should try the books I had set out for you later?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEve giggled and jumped down from the pile, and then pointed at the set of Mr. Man and Little Miss series of books at the very bottom - the very same books you had set out for her. She replied, \"Already read them, daddy! At first they were hard, but they quickly became easy! I even started reading several of them at a time and it was still too easy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then she shuddered and grew to the height of 2 feet tall. Her body had also began to make the human in her a little more apparent proportionately speaking. If that continued... You excused yourself and bought a blue swimsuit for her to wear, thankfully open in the back so her wings had room to be there, and then had her put it on. It was of course quite loose fitting right now, but she would grow into it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEve said in response to the swimsuit, \"Ooh...the blue looks pretty with my orange fur! You're the best daddy ever!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked at her with joy and responded, \"Aw, thanks, Eve! You're such a good girl!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And soon to be the BIGGEST girl ever!\" Eve shouted with glee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou raised an eyebrow and said, \"Oh really? Well keep dreaming, short stuff. You've got a long way to go for that lofty dream.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

At first you were worried she was going to tear it apart, but instead she simply made a large enough incision in the back for her tail to poke out comfortably. After, she got her hands on some thread and sewed some reinforcements around the hole she made. You wondered where she learned to sew so quickly and seemingly so expertly, but sure enough your copy of Sewing for Dummies was among the pile of books she had read.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was clear that Eve's intelligence had skyrocketed over the past 45 minutes since the accident. She had learned far more in just this short amount of time than you had even hoped to teach her over her lifetime. Even human children didn't learn this quickly, and you had the admittedly scary prediction that her intelligence would soon match your own - and then exceed it. And with her increasing size and strength to go with it, you couldn't help but wonder what would happen to you once she had learned everything she possibly can from you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn't kill her for two reasons. The first was that you could bring yourself to harm Eve about as easily as you could if she was your biological daughter, which was to say not at all. The second, and one that alarmed you at first, was that she was about as resilient as the King of Monsters in those Japanese kaiju movies himself: Godzilla. So you could only hope that Eve remained the same sweet, gentle, and curious girl she had been before the accident.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n15 minutes later, and not a peep from Eve, you began to go look for her to see where the little furry orange bundle of joy had gotten off to. It didn't take long, and to your shock, she was going over your experimentation notes on her! \"Eve, what are you doing? Those are highly sensitive notes!\" you said to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, daddy. But they're your notes on me, so I thought it would be alright if I read 'em! I'm done reading them anyway.\" Eve replied, setting the notes down on the desk and then walking past you. She stopped for a moment as she compared her height to yours, and then ran off with her tail wagging in excitement. Since you last saw her, she had grown another foot taller. This brought her height to 3 feet tall. She had also gained the slightest hints of breasts beneath her swimsuit top...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLunch time rolled around, and you had prepared some raw meat for Eve. You didn't always give her meat, but today it seemed like she could use some food for her growing brain...and you still felt bad about spilling those chemicals on her. However, she didn't seem interested in eating it when she discovered it was still raw. Normally she wouldn't complain, but today she asked, \"Daddy? Could you cook my meat please?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shrugged and took the hunk of steak away to cook it while Eve watched with utter fascination. As per her increased intelligence, she was smart enough to keep her limbs away from the hot elements even if they more than likely wouldn't burn her. Once the steak was cooked and handed back to her, she began to dig in. She was confused as to why the inside was still pink, but you informed her that this was fine and even preferable with steak. \"Bacteria can't get into a solid hunk of meat as easily as ground up meat like in a hamburger patty, so it's okay if it's a little pink on the inside. In fact, humans typically prefer it this way so it's easier to chew. Otherwise it becomes like trying to chew on a hockey puck or rock.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfterward, Eve happily ate the cooked steak and then proceeded to help put the dishes in the sink. She helped herself to a glass of milk and giggled at the milk mustache left on her face before wiping it off. Against your better judgment, you agreed to let her play on your computer. It wasn't something you had ever let her do before, but then before today she had just been learning a few words a day and even then they didn't always stick. While she was doing that, you folded up her now too small cage and put it away. You didn't want her to be uncomfortable, she had already figured out how to open nearly any door that didn't have a lock on it, and you trusted her to not use the couch as a scratching post.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2 hours passed, and you had fallen asleep while watching TV. Once again, you found your sleep disturbed, only this time by Eve calling for you. You refused to get up, but she simply pulled you by the arm until you fell out of the couch and onto the carpeted floor. Finally, you responded, \"Alright, what is it...Eve?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes went wide with shock. Eve was now 6 feet tall, and had the proportions of a young woman. Slender limbs that belied the strength behind them, a model's hourglass shape, a somewhat large yet seemingly firm butt, and a large set of breasts that tested the limits of her swimsuit top. Her tail was seemingly silky soft as well, and the fur around the top and back of her head had changed into shoulder length hair. Even her face had matured into something beautiful, yet retained her small fangs, her nose that started like a human's but ended like a dog's, and her cat-like yellow eyes. \"Hehehe! I've grown! A lot!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou managed to stand up, and were now staring Eve in the eyes straight on. Finally, you said, \"So I've noticed... I should probably make notes about this, if you'll excuse me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEve smiled and replied, \"There's no need, daddy. I've already written them down if you want to read.\" she then asked, \"Um...is it okay if I keep referring to you as daddy? I can call you by your name, Adam, if you'd like...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou replied, \"No no, daddy is fine, Eve.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You were expecting messy scribbles, since you hadn't yet taught her how to write or print, but to your surprise her notes were very neatly written. There were also no spelling errors to be found whatsoever in her notes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Entry #24601:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Attempted to teach subject more words, including friend. Subject had difficulty at first, but soon caught on. Appears to be very eager to learn and happy to see me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Disaster! Subject was accidentally subjected to some chemicals carelessly left around. Subject was taken to the bath in an attempt to wash off the chemicals, but much of them had already been absorbed through her fur and skin. Subject was clutching her head after, albeit briefly. Chemicals were old growth inducers that had failed to work before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Subject woke me up precisely one half hour after the accident, after having grown 6 inches taller, having let herself out of her cage. Discovered subject has read through all the books set aside for her, and has moved on to reading far more difficult books and even a dictionary. Apparently her intelligence has increased significantly. Subject then grew another 6 inches, and gained somewhat more recognizably humanoid proportions. Have bought her a blue swimsuit in the event this trend continues.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Subject continues to grow rapidly, both physically and mentally. It is possible that her intelligence may soon match, and even exceed, my own. Discovered subject going through my notes on her, already having finished reading them, and having grown another foot taller. Subject is now 3 feet tall, and thus no longer suitable for her cage. Has also started to show signs of puberty in humans: she has gained small breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Subject has shown an intriguing development: she has asked for cooked meat, no longer satisfied with raw meat like she has been previously. Have explained the benefits of not thoroughly cooking steak and how bacteria cannot easily penetrate it versus ground meat when asked. Have agreed to allow her access to my computer, though I fear I may be alarmed of what I may find in the recent history...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou paused, marveling at how thorough Eve had been, even replicating how you would have written the notes up to this point. You made a mental note to follow up on her 'suggestion' and check your computer's recent history later. Eve turned her head towards you and happily said, \"Do you like it, daddy? You should really check out the end. Sorry if I didn't write that part like you would have.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou reassured Eve that you were getting there, and then read the last part. It was indeed different from the rest, but you read on anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Note: I, Eve, subject of these notes, have written this part as myself. If my father, Dr. Adam Trestler, disapproves of this, I am deeply sorry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Over the past hour and 50 minutes, I have undergone a tremendous growth spurt. I have doubled my previous size, and am now 6 feet tall. The rest of my body appears to have gone through human puberty, as my measurements include a 40 inch bust, a 28 inch waist, and 38 inch hips. If I were to estimate, I would predict that I would take a 40D-cup bra currently. The fur around the top and back of my head, excluding my ears, has grown out into shoulder length hair. I look like a 20 year old woman, and an attractive one at that. (minus my monster features, of course) My intelligence since this morning has skyrocketed to an unknown degree, and I fully believe myself vastly more intelligent than my father. And quite possibly more intelligent than any human how has yet lived. I believe he fears this of me, and what I would do to him once I can no longer learn anything from him, but to me he is still my father, and I love him at least as much as he does me. I will never harm him, and do my best to not harm any other human as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Going over my father's notes, I hypothesize that the growth inducement chemicals I was introduced to by accident only affect those with the XX chromosome. Perhaps the Y chromosome somehow neutralizes it, or has something missing for the chemicals to react to? I bring this up because I fear my growth has only just begun. I'm certain that my size will only continue to increase over time, although my intellect remains unknown. I received a perfect score on an online IQ test, so I have no idea how much further my intelligence can go. One odd property of my growth, which I suspect will continue as I get bigger, is that the scarf (to hide my gills, which I am self-conscious over) and swimsuit my father gave me have grown with me, though my breasts and buttocks have tested the limits of what the fabric of the latter can contain, as it was never made for a human with quite my figure in mind. Only time will tell what other properties will surface as I grow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sat back, stunned. Eve had full admitted her superior intellect, but also a desire not to harm you, and a strong one at that. Just then, Eve's body began to shudder violently, and she grew 3 feet taller, putting her at 9 feet tall. \"I...don't think I can stay in here anymore, daddy. I'm sorry, but I have to go out into the world, or my body will rip the house apart with its growth.\" she said sadly. You nodded and led her outside. She paid attention to duck at each door way.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You met Lily on an online dating service, and she's quite the looker. Long, flowing white-blonde hair; grey eyes; generous curves...but she seems a little pale. Still, it could have been the lighting... But she agreed to come over to your place for the date, as she claims that she and public locations don't mix so well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou clean yourself up and try to set up a welcoming mood in your home. Then you sit down and wait patiently for 7:00, the time Lily said she was coming over. Yet 7:00 rolls around, and there's no sign of a car approaching your driveway or anything to suggest Lily was actually coming. By 7:30, you're just about ready to accept that you had been stood up and that she isn't coming. You check your email to see if she sent you any updates about tonight that you might have missed, but there's nothing of the sort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the power starts flickering wildly. Then comes an odd chill, even though it's a warm evening tonight... Finally, a feminine voice whispers in your ear with a slight giggle, \"So. When do we get started?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn your head to the source of the whisper and yelp in fright at being unexpectedly having company so close. Normally, you enjoy a good scare every now and again. But this is ridiculous! Once you regain your senses, you see that the whisperer is none other than Lily! She seems to be a good 6'10\" to 7 feet tall, quite a bit taller than you. She's wearing a black tee shirt with the image of a ghost inside of a red crossed out circle - a Ghost Busters shirt. She's also wearing tight-fitting blue skinny jeans, albeit a bit faded. And she's also laughing her head off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, that was too funny! You should see the look on your face. You looked like you were about ready to jump outta your skin!\" Lily says as she calms down from her fit of laughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stumble to find words. You're aroused by her height, but still spooked by her sudden appearance in your house. You didn't hear her come in, you didn't hear a car pull into your driveway, so how did she get inside? \"H-how d-did you manage t-to...?\" you begin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLily sighs and the power restores in full. \"...Get in? Through the door, duh. I'd say that you look like you've seen a ghost, but I already know the answer.\" she replies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I've seen a ghost?\" you ask in confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...yes. Yes you have. In fact...you're kind of looking at her right now. I'm...well, dead.\" Lily answers with a hint of sadness. She then picks up and looks at your TV remote out of curiosity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell that explains the pale complexion... Still, Lily seems friendly enough. \"Wait. If you're a ghost...how can you be touching my remote? And isn't a Ghost Busters shirt kind of ironic for a ghost?\" you question, slightly suspicious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo this, Lily giggles slightly and responds, \"What, this old thing? I was wearing this when I was murdered. College shootout. Luckily I was the only death, my classmates were injured but lived. My killer though... The guy goes and puts a bullet into his own head! Why didn't he just do that first? Would have saved me from this fate, and a whole lot of heartache...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I can touch your remote because I wanna touch it. If I don't wanna touch something, then I just pass right through it. Can't say I've tried making something I'm holding onto pass through another object with me yet though...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel quite sorry for Lily and try to comfort her with a hug. She feels...unexpectedly warm. And substantial. But her condition does intrigue you, so you ask, \"I don't mean to be rude or anything, but...what's it like being a ghost?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLily answers, \"Aside from the admittedly fun things I get to do? Not all that much different from being alive. Granted, I don't need to eat, and most of what I do eat just falls to the floor right through me... And I don't even need to watch my weight anymore! The sucky part comes with the knowledge that you're basically stuck here forever. When the Sun goes nova in a few billion years and turns Earth and whatever bugs still gnawing at old bones of humans long dead into extra crispy ice balls, you'll still be around to watch it. Not even popcorn to enjoy the show.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Still, the GA meetings are kinda fun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"GA meetings?\" you wonder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ghosts Anonymous. The Headless Horseman founded it once he got tired of his spooky act to help fellow spooks cope with being undead and even how to blend in with the living. Though I still feel for some of these people. Like Serena for instance. 6 years old when she succumbed to a completely curable disease had it been caught in time.\" Lily responds as she starts flipping through channels.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou consider asking Lily about her height when...</span></div></div>",

It only lasts for a few seconds, but she gains a few inches from this spurt. Naturally, her attire keeps up with her, having been what she had worn when she was murdered. You estimate her height now to be about 7'3\", and she seems...almost pleased with this. The smile fades quickly though as a look of slight embarrassment replaces it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So my gigantism follows me even in undeath? Ho boy...\" Lily says with embarrassment, and then explains, \"Yeah, I had a case of gigantism when I was alive. That's where my body grows larger than it should normally. In my case, I was still growing even after my 20th birthday. Although...my clothes always fit me just fine if I grew when I was wearing them. Even my shoes. Doctors warned that my condition might just kill me. Heh. Guess I don't have to worry about that anymore, do I?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou respond with, \"So if there's no threat of dying from this...how big do you think you'll get?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLily shrugs her shoulders and admits nonchalantly, \"I dunno. Really, really, big? I might have ended up breaking the record for the tallest person in history had my life not been ended too freaking early, so...probably at least big enough to cover a small city with my foot? Actually, that sounds kinda cool. It'd scare the people there almost to death. Fortunately for them, I'd never allow myself to crush anything and instead just pass right through everything. It's not like there's anything I or they can do about it...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what's with the smile when you grew just now? I thought ghosts couldn't really feel anything?\" you ponder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLily answers with, \"Hollywood misconception. We ghosts can feel. Usually cold. And light. In my case, my growth always felt weirdly pleasurable. And still does. Not as nice as when I was living, but still.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're not sure what to think. Lily still seems like a nice girl, and you admit seeing her gigantic is rather...arousing, but she's also a ghost. She's unlikely to age past 20 years old, while you'll...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me guess. You're thinking about how it won't work between us. I'll stay looking like a young woman while you'll grow old and die. I can tell you though that death won't part us if you're considering proposing or something.\" Lily says, almost like she's reading your mind, and then continues, \"I'll also accept just friends too. Though if you want, I could assist in helping you join the undead...just saying.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCreeped out, you respond, \"Will you cut that out? Are all ghosts so morbid?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLily smiles slightly and says, \"What can I say? I have no life. Get it? No life? Okay, sorry, that was lame. Actually, I'm trying to hold back. Though Death himself? He's a real teddy bear for someone who's little more than a walking robed and hooded skeleton...\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

A very, very tall woman, with...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWings?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou unconsciously step backwards as the towering angel turns towards you, allowing you to get a good look at her.

Intimidating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo large, feathery wings protruded from her back, the white appendages seeming to emerge from somewhere on her shoulder blades. Warm blue eyes looked your way, complementing her golden coloured hair. A pair of... Impressively, large breasts sat on her chest, contained within what seemed to be a white robe of some sort that covered her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you can even think of what to do, the angel has opened her mouth to speak...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

M-my name is Marie... P-please...please don't hurt me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHere you were, bat at the ready towards this towering winged woman...and she was absolutely terrified of you wanting to hurt her? She easily has two feet on you, she could simply snap your wrist with little trouble...and yet she was scared of you? You cautiously put the bat down. You're uncertain if it was wise to do so, but you couldn't stand the sight of her cowering any longer. It tugged at your heartstrings...even though she was an intruder. An intruder from Heaven, in more ways than one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sigh and respond, \"I'm not going to hurt you, Marie. But I'm not 'Human'. ...Well, I am a human, but it's not my name.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarie stops cowering, her wings spreading back out before folding against her back in a more relaxed position as she stands up. She looked at you with curiosity, before asking in her sugary sweet voice of almost pure innocence, \"Then...what is it? What is your name?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou give your name to her. \"I'm Jake. But...what are you doing in my house? Aren't you supposed to be...well, up there? Am I dead, or about to die?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo your surprise, she smiles, and then laughs at your worry. It was like hearing the happiest child's laughter, yet still feminine. \"It's nice to meet you, Jake. I'm sorry about laughing about such a dire matter, but if you were dead or about to die, you would not be seeing me. You would see Death himself. Human depictions of him are...surprisingly not far off. Sadly you may see him in time, but I believe not for some time to come yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Again, I am terribly sorry for the intrusion. And while I would like to return to Heaven, its gates are closed to me, and...I...I can't remember why!\" Tears began to well up in her eyes as she began to cry. A part of you found her crying cute, but it was too sad to let continue. Probably part of being an angel and all that. \"There, there...\" You felt compelled to comfort the tall, winged woman, \"So are all angels as tall as you? How long have you been here on Earth?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling better as the subject of what she was doing here was moved away from, (she was certain she hadn't done anything wrong, else she would be joining Lucifer in that place she didn't like to think of) she more calmly answers your queries. \"Um...no, actually. I'm not even certain why I am so tall...Although I must admit I quite enjoy it, I was always one of the smaller angels...except in my chest, which I again must admit a degree of pride. I believe I have been wandering Earth for nearly...two years now. Yes, I am certain it has been that long. Yet, you are the first person I've encountered during this time...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo years...she must feel very lonely, especially if you were the first person she's ever made contact with here. Despite her intimidating stature...you found yourself...becoming attached to her. Women of such innocence were rare in the world, and she did claim you were her first contact with humanity in nearly two years... A part of you argued that you were going to regret this, yet you paid it no heed as you decided to...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She really seemed just too nice to kick her out even if your gut was still screaming to tell her to get the H-E-double hockey sticks out. Maybe it was because your luck with women lately was less than spectacular, and this one practically falls into your arms, almost too conveniently so. Still, the side wanting to let her stay won out. Who knows? Maybe if you help her out, you figure, she may put in a good word for you with the big guy up stairs. It's hard not to believe in Him when something like this happens...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...I guess...you can stay. For now.\" You finally tell her, and in response the large angel happily runs over to you and picks you up in a tight, yet surprisingly gentle hug...that squishes you against her large breasts. Her wings rise somewhat, but not enough to bump against the ceiling like her head was doing. \"Really? Oh, thank you, Jake! You're the nicest human I've ever met!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHold on... \"I thought you said I was the first human you've met? Was that a lie?\" She smiles as she puts you back down and shakes her head. \"No no, that was very much the truth. You're the first and nicest human I've ever met!\" Her voice makes you almost feel terrible for distrusting her, even though she doesn't seem upset in the slightest. However, sleep begins to creep back up on you, as it was still the middle of the night. You proceed to your kitchen with the curious angel in tow, who thankfully remembered to duck through the door frames along the way. You pour yourself a glass of milk and nuke it in the microwave for a few seconds to warm it up. Curiosity getting the better of her, Marie asks, \"What are you doing? Is the milk too cold?\" To which you answer sincerely, \"I need to get back to sleep. I don't know if you angels ever sleep, but it's pretty vital for us humans. I tend to sleep easier with a glass of warm milk.\" You take the glass from the microwave and drink the warmed beverage, then headed back to bed and into sleep's waiting embrace once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the morning, you wake up, thinking it was all a strange dream. Angels coming here of all places, how ridiculous! Yet, after getting dressed and heading into the kitchen to cook yourself some eggs for breakfast, your eye catches Marie sitting in the living room, wings in a relaxed position wrapping gently around the seat, reading one of your books. One of the '___ for Dummies' series you had lying around. You very nearly burned your eggs at the confirmation that your dream really wasn't. Hearing the commotion in the kitchen as you barely caught yourself from saying a rather inappropriately crude word at the moment your eggs were nearly burned, Marie looked up and smiled pleasantly. \"Oh! Good morning, Jake! I trust you slept peacefully after my unfortunate intrusion, and your subsequent welcoming me into your home?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod and offer her breakfast, which she politely declines. At least you offered. Although at this angle, you could almost swear she seemed even taller than last night. \"Say, Marie? Did you grow while I was asleep? You seem taller somehow...\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She indicates her legs, which you could see were bent slightly through the robe. Well then, not only did you know an angel who easily dwarfed just about every person who had ever lived, but she had grown an entire four inches taller overnight!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarie giggles softly and sits back down onto the seat, which creaks slightly from her weight. From what you had seen so far, as well as her progress with the book, it seems like she doesn't need to eat, sleep or drink. You briefly wonder if all Angels are like that before sitting down in your armchair and eating your nearly-burnt breakfast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n... Okay, you had to ask about her growth. Was it a one off thing, or would it happen again? And if so, how much would she grow?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou open your mouth and are about to ask Marie about why she grew when...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Joy...and panic. She starts to inch up ever closer to the ceiling, all the while still sitting. Marie puts the book down and runs to you, picking you up in her increasingly bigger arms, then forces you and herself through the large window leading outside to your backyard using her head and wings as a shield against the glass shards. Considering the window was reinforced glass, Marie was clearly much stronger than her slender albeit growing frame suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah! I-I'm terribly sorry, Jake! I just felt myself starting to grow again, stronger this time, and I didn't wish you any harm...\" she says sincerely, and regardless of your feelings to her driving you through your window...you had subconsciously already forgiven the growing angel. It might have been because of who she is, or it could be because that she had conveniently chosen the window that was already on its way out and the window repair guys were coming in the afternoon to replace it. As she finishes growing at roughly 16'8\", you look up into her gorgeous sapphire eyes, beautifully framed with her golden locks and feathery white wings serving as the background. After a few minutes of staring up at the beauty you would have sworn was God if she didn't insist to merely be an angel and not the 'big guy' himself, you finally say, \"...You can put me down now, Marie. My legs work fine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarie nods and carefully sets you down from her cradling hold on you as gently as a mother would set down her baby. And indeed, as you took in her full glory, you didn't seem to be much more than a toddler or small child to her by comparison. You like tall women...but this was admittedly a bit on the ridiculous side seeing a woman, albeit an angel, becoming larger in real life. A pinch to yourself confirms this is all very real. Stepping through the broken window to retrieve the book Marie was reading, you come back out to confront her on her growth. You needed to know if this would happen again, since she didn't seem in control of it. If she had, you figured you and she would still be inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Marie? We need to talk.\" you say, and the angel kindly looks towards and down to you, flexing her wings in relaxation after the slightly awkward seating position all night. \"Yes? What is it, Jake?\" she asks again in her sugary sweet and cottony soft voice, which you query, \"About your growth. I don't mind that you're growing. Really, I don't. In fact...I confess growing women is a fantasy of mine, a guilty pleasure if you will...\" Marie chuckles softly. \"You say it like it's a sin or something that would condemn you to...Lucifer's abode. Don't worry! It isn't! But I'm interrupting, aren't I? Please, go on.\" Well that was one potential worry off your chest. You continued, \"Why are you growing? And will this happen again? Do you know the answer to either?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarie contemplates your questions, a somewhat endearing look crossing her face as she did. Finally, she concludes, \"If it's happened twice now, and possibly three times if I count when I first arrived on Earth and discovered the gates of Heaven being closed to me, I would have to say that it will continue to happen again and again. I may stop at roughly one mile tall, which is both rather exciting and rather frightening for me at the same time, but I can't say if I will continue to grow beyond that or not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As for why...I...am really at a loss. Sorry.\" Marie finishes sadly, a tad upset with herself for not being able to provide a definite answer. You again comfort her by saying, \"That's alright, Marie. At least we know something about all of this.\" The angel nods happily, and then comments, \"If I knew what was causing this growth, I could try to avoid it...or speed this up to get it over with if there is no avoiding it.\" Either seem reasonable to you, although if she were to become a mile tall or more surely casualties and damages would begin to mount. Then again, perhaps she could choose what and what not to have her body interact with. Able to give a person a gentle poke that would send them onto their back, yet also allow herself to walk through a building without affecting it in the least. You hope for her to be able to do this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMuch to your surprise, Marie puts her hand through your bedroom wall and pulls out the suit you had placed on your bed in preparation to wear it before you made breakfast - leaving the wall completely intact as she does. Accepting the suit from her, you put it on and begin to wonder...was she always capable of this, or was it because you hoped for her to have this ability?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You never considered yourself much of a believer in God. Sure, you went to church every week and all, but you felt it was more a force of habit than any actual belief in the big guy. Your parents had always made you go with them to church when you were young until it was practically routine even now. You had hoped for a girlfriend...two years ago, in fact. You had left to return home from your business trip that morning just as some fantasy convention was about to start up. And just now, Marie had demonstrated being able to choose what her body interacted with, retrieving your suit through your bedroom wall without damaging said wall. You have a hunch, but you need to know.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Say, Marie? If you could retrieve my suit through my bedroom wall without your hand going through it...why didn't you do that when we were getting out of my house?\" you asked curiously. Marie shrugged her shoulders in response after about a minute and replied, \"I don't know. I was in a bit of a panic then, but...it just came into my head to try and retrieve the rest of your suit from your room while leaving the wall itself alone. It's the first time I ever did that, too. I've tried before with attempting to keep sand and dust off of me, as well as trying to keep tree branches from snagging my wings and occasionally my robe, with no success. I wonder why I was successful this time?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCould still be a coincidence, but if it wasn't... You question with, \"Where did you first land on Earth, and what was happening at the time?\" The angel looks at you, confused as to what this had to do with anything, but answers honestly, \"Um...I think it was Tokyo, Japan? I think the people there were complementing me on what they believed to be my costume, as almost everyone else was in one. I guess some sort of convention was going on? I just tried to keep my wings relaxed and still to keep up the disguise in plain sight. It wasn't like they believed me when I told them I was a real angel...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat definitely couldn't be a coincidence. But if that was true... \"Marie...I...I think I know why you're here, and why you can't go back yet... I'm so sorry. I had hoped for a girlfriend two years ago on the last day of my business trip in Tokyo, before a big fantasy convention was about to take place. And then just a little while ago, I...hoped you could be able to choose what you did and didn't want your body to interact with, and you ended up being successful with it. I think it's my hope that dragged you here, and is keeping you here...\" You pause, and then ask her, \"Will...will you ever forgive me, Marie? Had I known this would have happened...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnsurprisingly, Marie looks down at you sternly, and then says the words you dreaded to hear, \"No. No, I do not forgive you, Jake.\" But before you could look away in shame, surprisingly she smiles and adds, \"I don't forgive you, Jake, because there is nothing to forgive. As much as I'd like to return to Heaven, at least I now know my purpose for being here. If I'm to be your girlfriend, I do not question His judgment on the matter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn increasingly giant angel for a girlfriend...you feel like the luckiest man in the world. And feel as though you should thank the big guy 'upstairs' for such fortune. But first, you try to see the extent of what your hopes have on Marie. You hope for her to adopt a more...appropriate attire than just her robe, and the robe shrinks and reforms into a mid-thigh length white sleeveless dress that also allows her ample bust to be more visible, though tastefully so. Her golden sandals remain unchanged, and Marie seems quite pleased with her new look, her wings opening wide behind her before closing again. Next, you try to hope for her to be smaller, as she was a bit on the ridiculously tall side...with no luck. She remains 16'8\" for now. Finally, you attempt to hope her in the opposite direction, and be like 25 foot even. At first, it seems to be working as Marie grows again...but she stops at 20 feet tall and not an inch more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It seems that I have some control over you, Marie, like the new outfit for example. But your height...isn't one of those things. I guess when and how much you grow is random, and not up to either of us to decide.\" you conclude. Marie nods in acknowledgement and says, \"It would seem so. I do like the new dress, however. More modern from what I understand, yet is still conservative. Befitting the modern angel! Thank you!\" You're glad that she likes it, as you feel it made her look all the more beautiful while still maintaining the aura of her innocence, as opposed to her being in a skimpy swimsuit, or just a bra and a pair of panties, or...well...nothing. Though a part of you believed that making her naked wasn't possible. And she'd object if it was. You decide to act on your feeling and go to church to offer gratitude for Marie while she (wisely) chose to remain at your place to pray. Perhaps for angels praying was like calling home to the big guy and letting Him know what's been happening?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few hours later, your return home and find Marie sitting there patiently waiting for you...and a couple of would-be burglars hung in a tall tree with care. It was hard at first to tell, but eventually you ask your angel girlfriend, \"You've grown again, haven't you?\" Marie silently nods while you phone the police to come pick up the thieves, standing up to her full height of...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Still, Marie's new clothing was keeping up with her perfectly fine, and she still seems to be okay with it, so you aren't worried about it too much. The police officer that came by to take the pair of would-be thieves...was considerably less than okay with it, however, despite her trying to calm him down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, where are these criminals...at? Jesus Christ that woman is big!!!\" he says, letting a curse slip out in shock. Marie, being blissfully unaware that it was a curse, responds happily while opening her wings, \"I know him! He's a nice young man! Really, He couldn't ask for a better son!\" This has the effect of making the normally dark skinned officer turn ghostly white. A giant, winged woman that spoke of knowing Jesus and the big guy upstairs on a personal level seems to have that effect on a person. Regardless, she pulls the burglars out of the tree she had left them in and hands them to the officer, who handles them far less gently than she had. Once the thieves were cuffed and placed in the police cruiser, the officer takes his leave, internally vowing not to reveal this to his friends and comrades back at the station...not that they would believe him if he told them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis reminds you that you hadn't asked Marie her age. Obviously, she looked to be in her early to mid 20's, but angels were typically portrayed as ever beautiful...and she's no exception in your eyes. \"If you don't mind me asking...just how old are you, Marie?\" To your surprise, she seems to have no compunction over the question as she answers, \"Older than Jesus, and not by a little bit. He is by far the youngest among us in terms of actual years, but as you might have guessed physical age has little meaning to us. None in Heaven appear any older than what humans would consider to be their prime, be they angel or departed human. You know the story of how Lucifer was cast out of Heaven to...where he currently resides? I was around even before that happened. Most angels were, and I believe I'm actually one of the younger ones.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis actually doesn't surprise you that Marie was this old. If He could create his desired number of angels from the very beginning, there would be little need to create more would there? Still, this doesn't diminish your feelings for her. She was still as sweet and pleasant and beautiful as ever. Perhaps, when the time came for you to take a walk with Death, you could reunite with Marie in her home? However, you don't feel it even nearly time to go yet. Still an entire lifetime ahead of you, with plenty to do and see along the way. While you're curious about what it was like up there, you also have a sense of wanting to find out for yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter dinner, and the glass guys installing a new window when they could pull themselves away from gawking at the 50 foot tall angel that was your girlfriend, which was quickly remedied by telling them that you wouldn't pay for hours that they weren't actually working...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

And given the gentle smile on her face not vanishing, you narrow the possibilities to just one thing: your angel girlfriend was about to get bigger. Possibly a lot bigger. A look in her eye suggests she'd like company while she grows, and since you know she would not cause further damage to your home than she had earlier, which had been repaired, you step out to do just that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat you aren't expecting is for her to gently pick you up and hold you in her hand just as she starts growing. \"I'm sorry, I should have asked if it was alright if I picked you up, but I didn't wish to risk ending your life so soon.\" Marie apologizes, and you shake your head saying, \"It's okay, Marie. It wouldn't be very angelic of you to just ignore my presence if you would be putting me in possible danger, would it? I couldn't ask for a nicer girlfriend, even if she's clearing the 60 foot mark now.\" as she's doing just that and not stopping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarie grows past 70 feet in height, and then 80. What had to be already the biggest and best set of breasts either in Heaven or on Earth seem to grow just a bit more, and her dress keeps up with them effortlessly. As she grows to over 90 feet tall, with no sign yet of stopping, she spreads her beautiful wings in preparation to lift off the ground just in case. Just because she can choose not to interact with her immediate surroundings doesn't mean she wants to get careless, it seems, and you're glad for this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarie's growth takes her to and then past 100 feet, twice her height just a little while ago, and still doesn't seem to be letting up. Not that you mind at this point, because you have two magnificent views. The view of your house and the surrounding area as she continues to climb higher and higher in height, and the view of Marie's 120 foot tall and growing form. Both of which were almost breathtaking in their own ways.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everything seems so frail and fragile from here...almost like a snowflake in delicacy and beauty.\" Marie says as she grows to 140 feet and then 150 feet, triple her height almost 10 minutes ago or so. You're inclined to agree with her, and you say, \"With your golden blonde locks, your blue eyes, heck, your everything and the scenery... I don't think I could find a prettier scene on a Christmas card. Unless it was snowing.\" you look up to the skies above and say to them, \"Don't you be taking that as indication to start, up there.\" and Marie laughs her gentle laughter that could warm even the frostiest hearts. But has she stopped growing for now, or is Marie still growing?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You had sworn you'd heard something out here last night, but a quick search with a torch had failed to yield any results. Now that it was daytime, you should have a much easier time looking for any clues as to what made the noises you had heard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA quick search of the flower bed turns up nothing, as does a look through your shed. You are about to head back inside when a glint in the corner of your eye catches you attention. Kneeling down, you investigate what reflected the sunlight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a tiny wand, a small metal rod tipped with an equally small gold star. Picking it up, you begin to look it over, and wonder why it was in your garden.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, h-human?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wheel around, trying to find the source of the soft, quiet, voice, but see nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Human? Up h-here...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFollowing the voice's instructions, you look upwards into the branches of your old apple tree, and what you see makes your jaw drop open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLying on one of the branches was a tiny figure, around six inches tall. But her size was not what really surprised you. Beautiful yet seemingly fragile wings sprouted from her shoulder blades, the shimmering blue appendages fluttering every so often as the fairy lay on her front.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fairy seems to be trembling slightly - perhaps she was afraid of you?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, I'm not going to hurt you. What's your name?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fairy's trembling ceases after a couple of seconds, and a smile graces her tiny face. \"My name is Juniper, human... Is that my wand you are holding?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEasily able to reach the branch where Juniper is lying, you place the wand next to her and she eagerly grabs it. However, you can't help but notice that she seems rather pale, and a small shudder runs up her form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You seem awfully pale...and you're shivering. Would you like to come inside?\" The fairy looks you in the eye from her vantage point and admits softly, \"No...I don't feel well at all. I-it's alright though, I'll just return home and look after myself... I wouldn't wish to trouble you, human...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing, you reach up and pluck Juniper gently from the tree, being careful of her shimmering blue insect-like wings, which looked somewhat like a cross between a butterfly's wings and those of a dragonfly, and say as you went inside with her, \"Ho boy...I know your type. Nice as can be, yet too reserved to accept an offer of kindness in return for fear of being a bother. So I'm sorry, Juniper, but for your own good I'm not taking no for an answer.\" Juniper looks slightly sad that her choice was out of her hands, but doesn't complain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside the warmth and dryness of your home, you set Juniper down in a seat close to the fireplace and turned it on so she could be comfortable...even though you know nothing about fairies outside of stories and even then the information in those tales varied wildly. And now that she wasn't lying on her front, you're able to get a better view of your guest. Her long, pink hair with several colorful highlights that stretched down her back was very pretty and you assume the base color was her natural hair color. The highlights were probably added in magically. She's quite slender...and is as curvacious as any model could ever hope to be naturally. Her breasts in particular could easily fill an E-cup at human size, if not F-cup. As a twenty-three year old woman yourself, you find yourself almost a little jealous of her. You realize that you never properly introduced yourself to her and work quickly to correct this. \"I'm Anna, by the way. Are you comfortable by the fireplace? It runs on natural gas, by the way, so if it's too warm I can turn it down.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJuniper smiles warmly and a look of curiosity crosses her face as she says, \"Pleased to meet you, Anna. We fairies don't tend to show ourselves around humans very often. Out of respect, mostly. But what is this 'natural gas' you speak of? How does it make fire appear and stay contained in the black metal box?\" you explain to the fairy natural gas and how the fireplace works. Her look of wonder suggests fairies have little knowledge in general of human inventions. You suspect, however, that more than a few may be a bit too familiar with ones such as bulldozers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, your train of thought is promptly derailed when Juniper shudders and then begins to...grow? Yes, you could see her getting bigger little by little. And yet her silken dress, equally as colorful as her hair, easily keeps up with her as she continues to grow. Once she hit one foot one inch, she stops growing...for now anyway. Amazed at what just happened, you question Juniper and her enthusiastic smile with, \"Well I see your shivering isn't because you're cold or sick...unless suddenly growing over twice your size is a symptom of some ailment to your kind. Would you care to explain?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fairy's face turns bright red, as her paleness had went away just after she finished growing, and says, \"Well...no, growth isn't a symptom of a fairy ailment. In fact, our kind is so in tune with nature that we rarely ever get sick, and we're blessed with immortality...provided something doesn't kill us. A sharp object through one's heart is still fatal, nature's blessing or no. I...I often come to your garden to think at night when I can't sleep. I know it's trespassing. I'm sorry!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're surprised by this, but then you remember seeing the slightest flicker of something every now and again at night in your garden though it was gone before you could think to question what it was. Now you know that it was Juniper fluttering around. You...actually find yourself at peace with this, since she clearly didn't harm any of your flowers. You say, \"Not a problem, Juniper. I don't mind, and you haven't harmed any of my flowers yet...but what does this have to do with your growth?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJuniper smiles, happy that she was forgiven for the trespassing, and continues, \"Well last night, I was trying out a spell I had just learned. Unfortunately...it backfired on me. And...well...I also kind of fumbled the spell as well. I could tell by the awfully large flash and the uneasy feeling that accompanied it. It normally only makes the target grow just a little bit, and only once per cast. If I were to cast it on you, for example, you'd only grow a few inches, maybe six at most. You'd hardly notice the difference. But I messed up and accidentally combined it with a continuing spell...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So that means...\" you say, and Juniper nods in confirmation, \"I'm going to grow again and again. I can't say how regular they'll be, but...each one is going to be bigger than the last. In two spurts, I'll be easily much taller than you and barely able to stand in here I'm sure. It might even be just one for all I know. It's okay, though! I've always wanted to be taller! And as long as I have my wand, I can try to fix anything I break! I guess this means my kind will no longer be much of a secret to yours, though...\" Well at least she was kind enough to think of the problems her ever increasing size would later cause...but what's going to happen now?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She stammers out, \"W-wow...I-I'm like my original height TALLER than you, Anna... I mean, I imagined I would kind of like being big, but n-now that I actually AM b-big... I...I... I LOVE IT!!! I can't WAIT to grow again! ...Anna? Oh my. Are you alright? I didn't hurt you with my growth, did I?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou snap out of your stupor as Juniper begins to fret over you. A realization that you should have just left her outside crosses your mind, but you dismiss it just as quickly as it appeared. You had befriended this fairy, she appeared in need of shelter and aid at the time, it was all water under the bridge. You wouldn't have left her there even if you knew before hand she was gonna grow this big and this fast. ...And was going to grow even bigger sooner or later. If she was already six foot two... and each spurt was going to be even larger than the last... oh no...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm fine, Juniper. Though you don't have to present your bigger boobs in my face.\" you answer, and Juniper scoots back a little albeit somewhat clumsily. Naturally, she isn't used to her new size yet, but seems to be catching on quickly. \"Oopsie. Sorry.\" she apologizes, and you smile warmly but then break the bad news to her with, \"That's okay. But I'm afraid I have to ask you to leave. Now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJuniper looks at you like a deer caught in headlights, appearing as though she might cry when she stammers, \"L-leave? Now that I'm bigger than you...you no longer like me? But...but...\" Oh dear. A misunderstanding. You calm Juniper down and explain, \"No no! I think you're a wonderful fairy even though we've just met! And I don't care that you're bigger than me. However, your size is why you need to get out of my house. You just grew from just over a foot to a little over six feet in one spurt. You said yourself that each spurt you have will be greater than the last, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJuniper nods, and then her eyes widen with where you're going with this. \"Yes, each one will be even bigger than the last, which - Oh. Oh dear....\" she mutters, and you nod in confirmation as you continue with, \"Exactly. You need to get out now because by your next growth spurt there simply isn't going to be enough room in my house to hold you. I trust you'll use your wand to fix anything you break, but I don't think you want to be responsible for destroying my house in the first place, do you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fairy lowers her head, letting her primarily pink locks fall down around her face as she admits, \"...No. No, I don't want to ruin your beautiful home, Anna, even if I could fix it after. It just wouldn't feel the same.\" Juniper then looks at you and asks, \"Um...would it be alright if I stayed out in your garden, then? It's a lot more open than your house, so I shouldn't be a danger to anything...\" You think on it and then say, \"As long as you fly and don't allow your feet to touch the ground when you start growing again so as to not damage anything...I don't see why not. Also, I admit I'm interested to see just how far and big you'll grow. How does it feel to grow, anyway? You seemed to be pretty happy while it was going on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Juniper gets up to stand at her full height, marveling at how different everything looks at human size, she checks to make sure she still had her wand. She proceeds to head outside with you in tow, once tucking her wings back so they wouldn't smack against the door frame uncomfortably. She bangs her head against the shorter screen door's door frame once but simply rubs her head and smiles as she heads outside. Finally, once you're outside with her, she responds to your question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...I guess I should put this in perspective. Y-you know what humans...you know...do?\" she says and you alarmingly quickly catch on to what she was getting at, saying, \"You're saying that it's as good as having an orgasm or sex?\" Blushing, Juniper quietly admits, \"No...it feels much, much, much better than that to grow. At least, as far as I can tell that's what it'd be like for a human like yourself. It's the most incredible thing I've felt in my life, and I can't wait to feel it again, to grow bigger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Also, seeing the things that once dwarfed you now being dwarfed by you is very...pleasing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're shocked by this response. You find it difficult to believe that something could be...well, that good, but you take it as something that had to be experienced to believe. Juniper shudders and a look of glee crosses her face. You take several steps back from the giant fairy as she starts fluttering her wings to lift into the sky in preparation to become giant by human standards. Slowly she lengthens, expanding in all directions but down as she keeps adjusting her altitude to avoid touching the ground like you asked. Not that she wants her ten feet and growing body to damage the flowers or anything in the area. Ten feet quickly gave way to twelve, and then fifteen and twenty! She opens her eyes lets loose a small squeal of delight as she and you watch her grow beyond forty feet. You couldn't even take a crack at calling the fifty foot fairy because she just keeps growing right on past that. Gradually, she allows herself to touch the ground just as her growth levels off - at about one hundred twenty-four feet of ginormous, beautiful, and buxom fairy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And here I thought six foot two was incredible... Now I'm giant even by your people's standards, Anna! This is so amazing!\" she yells in excitement, being mindful not to get too loud.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She smiles brightly and hold out a finger, and a couple of birds perch there almost like a tree branch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw, it seems some of my friends have come to check up on me! I'm glad they're not frightened of me because I'm so big, especially considering I'm not sure if there's any way for me to reverse this and I don't really want to try.\" Juniper says to you with a grin of happiness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait. Are they fairies in disguise, or...\" you ask, as while they seem to be normal birds from here, there might be differences in the eyes of the one hundred twenty-four foot tall giantess fairy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJuniper puts her wand holding hand close to her mouth as she giggles and then says, \"No, these guys are actual birds. My fairy friends live in the nearby forest just down the road.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're aware of the forest your giant fairy friend was referring to. You've actually walked through it a few times. Some forests feel old and unkempt, the floor riddled with stories of times long past both good and bad. Others feel cold, almost as if the trees themselves would reach out and attack those that pass by their gnarled trunks. But the forest nearby always felt...energetic, warm and inviting. You could walk in feeling downright tired and come out feeling like you have the energy of when you were a kid. It was...magical, and the town defended it when a large chain company tried to come in with plans to level it to build one of their stores by unanimously shooting the plans down at that location.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow you know why it feels the way it does: the fairies living there kept it that way. Perhaps other groups of fairies inhabiting other locations made it feel different? Perhaps a few of those uninviting forests were that way because fairies living there didn't take kindly to intruders into their home?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So do you understand them or something? We humans...don't exactly understand animals.\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJuniper replies, \"That's the beauty of nature, Anna. There is nothing to have to understand. It's not a hidden language that needs to be translated to understand; it's a feeling, simple and clear. A-at least, to fairies this is true...it's what we believe, but then w-we're almost constantly in tune with it whereas you humans rely on your technology to help you adapt to the lifestyle you find comfortable.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're amazed that for her immense size, Juniper is still kind, gentle, even a bit meek. You guess that unlike what some of those movies have depicted, if you're gentle in personality at normal size you don't suddenly become nasty as a giant. Just then, a smile widens on the fairy's face. You wonder if she's about to grow again, this time to who knows how big, but instead she waves her wand and points it at you. Just after she does that, you feel your feet beginning to lift away from the ground. She's levitating you with her magic!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"J-Juniper! W-what are you doing to me?!\" you blurt out in surprise, but not anger. You're also surprised at the lack of a spoken incantation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJuniper explains herself by saying, \"I'm levitating you, Anna. Please don't be afraid, I would never hurt anyone. However, I can feel another growth spurt on its way soon and I didn't want to risk hurting you in my attempt to pick you up with my hand. You can move freely in the air now thanks to that spell, if you like.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Also, I've seen traveling magic shows, and spoken incantation isn't necessary for casting magic...a-at least, not for fairies it isn't. Humans seem to need it and make a fancy show of it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTraveling magic shows? You realize that Juniper may believe those were real, rather than mastery of sleight of hand that they really were. You break the bad news to her by telling her, \"Uh...those magic shows you've seen aren't real. Pulling a rabbit out of a hat and whatnot? It's called sleight of hand, misdirection. The magician gets their audience to focus on where they want them to while doing something else where the audience isn't paying attention. Like they don't actually pull a coin out of a person's ear; it's in their hand the whole time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJuniper seems a little more sullen after this, and her wings droop slightly at their tips. It's kind of cute - even despite her size. \"Oh...so I guess that's why they say those funny words, to make others believe in their illusion...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it's still a popular form of entertainment. If the magician is good the audience will be talking about him or her for days wondering just how they pulled their trick off. I'm still puzzled as to how they can put someone in a large wooden box, break it apart into three sections with the person still inside, and not only are they perfectly fine, their legs can still move at the end. And they don't fall apart once the box it put back together and they're allowed out.\" you admit, which seems to brighten Juniper's mood again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut soon, she begins to shudder quite violently and she takes off into the air. \"I'm about to grow again! This could be huge!\" she exclaims with clear excitement. But how big was this spurt going to be?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Her violent shaking quickly comes to a head, however, before halting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh, here we go...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJuniper's body starts growing about a foot taller every second, then two feet, then three! Juniper lets out a shaky breath as she closes her eyes, hugging her expanding form as it grows into the sky. With every pulse of growth, her breasts and ass bulge outwards a little more, growing ever so slightly faster than the rest of her. At least that explained why you got a face full of fairy tit right after her first growth spurt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRemembering your own levitation, you try to figure out how to move, even as Juniper's rapidly growing form softly bumps you backwards with each spurt, the wall of soft pale flesh ever so gentle as it pushes and grows at the same time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFocusing on rising upward, you feel your body begin to float upwards, and have soon reached Juniper's shoulder, which had enough room for several dozen of you, with more space appearing with each little spurt. Juniper had to be growing at least ten feet taller from each of the individual spurts by now, the titanic yet gentle fairy hugging her breasts to herself even as they threatened to push her arms backwards with their continued growth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the growth stops.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, Juniper shudders even harder, the sound alone shaking the ground a fair bit, and begins to flood larger, her shadow rapidly engulfing everything behind her. She doubles over, seemingly In pain, only to fling herself back into her 'standing' position as she bursts another hundred feet taller - and another - and another - and another!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJuniper eventually shudders her way out of the mega-spurt, and opens her eyes to look down on the neighberhood - only to find that she had long since outgrown it.

This time even faster than before! It can't be..... Is this just a single growth spurt? She is already 5 miles tall and will very quickly put that size to shame, if that's the case you can only imagine how big she's gonna be by the end of this, let alone how incredible her next growth will be. Juniper is shuddering and squealing in pleasure as she grows bigger and bigger for minutes on end without showing any signs of slowing. Her growth also seems to be having an effect on the rest of her body as well, making her even more flawless than it already was and her curves even more voluptuous. Now that you think about it, you are standing on the gigantic shoulder of a now 15 mile tall fairy who is also levitating several feet off the ground, and yet you are still able to breath normally. Being able to breathe while standing on the altitude of 3 Mt.Everests is not normal, heck, standing on the shoulder of a gigantic fairy isn't normal! You're starting to wonder if this will be safe, as nice and beautiful as Juniper is, you would not die like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon Juniper's mind-boggling growth spurt ends, much to your relief. You estimate that she's.... Holy moly... 50 MILES TALL?! That can't be.... But since you can barely see the city underneath you feel pretty confident of your estimate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJuniper is absolutely ecstatic at the result of her latest and by far biggest growth spurt \"O-O-Oh my goodness!!! I-I'm... I'M MASSIVE!\" she starts to get flustered and shake in excitement. Of course this was a nightmare for you and you yell at the top of your lungs demanding that she stops. \"Oh Anna I'm so sorry are you ok?\" Even at this gigantic stature her voice was as soft as ever. \"I'm fine Juniper, you don't have to worry I can somehow breathe... Just be more careful with your movements next time ok?\" \"Ok Anna the last thing I would want to do is hurt my most precious human, I promised myself you would never ever get hurt by anything!\". Well that's nice of her, but could this be the reason why you can still breathe at this height and even went unscathed through her violent shaking? Are Juniper's powers growing alongside her body? That would mean that when she gets even bigger she might achieve a nigh god-like status!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Anna, I think...\"</span></div></div>",

You never agreed to this, not only that..... But just like Juniper, you were levitating above the ground! Juniper's face lit up at the result of her efforts in happiness, and was extremely relieved that it worked. \"Oh Anna I missed you!\" and she engulfs you in a hug. It was all so staggering you couldn't even react, from your new size of 50 miles to the fact that you will grow even more and are currently levitating, to Juniper's incredibly beautiful body. She was by far the most beautiful and sexy being on the face of the Earth and being a bisexual woman you could no longer deny that she was incredibly attractive in every way possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally after a few moments of silent processing your lips manage to speak. \"Juniper.... What have you done!!! Return me to normal at once! Also let go of me already!\". With that Juniper immediately pulls back and tries her best to calm you down. \"O-oh I don't actually..... know what I did, I just kinda like.... wished I could see you again and that we would always be together. And I thought the best way to do that would be for you to grow, so I guess you grew because I wished it so. Also I apparently...... Can't... Reverse it...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was simply too much, now you're no longer a normal woman, you're an ever-growing giantess and companion to an also ever-growing fairy. But.... You were ok with that, it has always been a bit of a fantasy of yours but of course it was just that. However now it's true and there's no turning back.

So she created a warp and went into the realm of demonesses; this was one of the few demonic powers she preserved. She was hated there for her betrayal, but she knew she could count on the old demoness Vorygamra, who appreciated her courage. She was one of the six sages of the demonesses world and she would probably know how to help her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I could see this coming\", she told Kromaflorea with a sigh. \"If a demoness renounces evil and tries her best in helping humans it's likely she will go beyond her demonic condition and gain omnipotence.\"<br>\r\n\"Really? That's great, now I can be helpful to everyone\" she replied, delighted.<br>\r\n\"But there's a problem. Your body will grow to contain such immense power.\"<br>\r\n\"How big will I get?\"<br>\r\n\"Clouds probably won't reach your knees\"<br>\r\n\"That can't be...\" Kromaflorea said shocked. \"I will wreak havoc with every step.\"<br>\r\n\"You will be able to fix things back since your all-powerful, though\" Vorygamra pointed out. \"You chose this destiny, Kromaflorea. Now go yo your world, you will begin growing soon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo Kromaflorea thanked her and went away, feeling rather sad. As she was going to create a warp she realized she had stopped glowing. She then felt her body surge with energy and exploded in growth. She grew for just a couple seconds, but it was enough to make her 30 meters tall. \"That felt very good\" she thought, enjoying the pleasure from the growth spurt. She tried her now gigantic body for a bit and realized she could move with the same ease as ever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly something caught her attention; from her new height she could see some 200 meters away a group of demonesses carrying a chained human boy who had somehow stepped into this world. She know he would be killed, so spreading her wings, which were normally concealed inside her body, Kromaflorea immediately rushed into the scene. The demonesses panicked seeing her gigantic form and it was easy for her to grab the boy; she quickly created the warp and flew into it. There was a barrier that kept common demonesses from treading into the human world, so they were safe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you okay?\" she said as she landed in a field, breaking the chains with a fingernail.

You fell in, and passed out before you reached the end...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you awoke you were lying on what appeared to be, a bed of GIANT leaves. You are in some pain, but not so much you can't move. You start to panic after noting this. \"W-W-Where am I? H-H-How d-did I get here?\" You say to your self. You now also notice that you're in a cave as well. Because the owner of the cave enters, and sees you. \"Ah, I see you're awake little one!\" She says in an exited voice. Now you are more scared than EVER.Seeing as how the cave owner before you is a Sphinx with brown hair on her Lion like body, and Flowing purple hair on her human head. All around she was a VERY beautiful Girl/Sphinx/Thing. \"Hello there little one. My name is Talia, and it's very nice to meet you.\" You start to shiver uncontrollably out of fear. Though she quickly sees this, and says \"Don't be afraid, I only want to help you.\". You are confused by what she's saying, and reply with a quiet \"Huh?...\". \"Oh! I'm sorry. You were passed out, and probably don't know what happened. I was out for a walk around an hour ago, and I spotted you in a crater. Almost as if you'd fallen from the sky. So I brought you here to rest.\" She says sweetly, and calmly. It's now that you notice 3 things. 1: She appears to be your age. 2: She is living on her own at 12. And 3: You are only the size of one of her paws. \"Now on to my second reason for bringing you here... You see, I love riddles. Here's how this will go, if you answer my riddle correctly, I'll let you leave, but if you answer wrong, you have to stay with me forever.\" She says. You are still scared, but don't want this massive Sphinx mad at you, so you quietly agree. She smiles sweetly, and tells the riddle...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I never was, am always to be,<br>\r\nNo one ever saw me, nor ever will<br>\r\nAnd yet I am the confidence of all<br>\r\nTo live and breathe on this terrestrial ball.<br>\r\nWhat am I?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are a little hasty with your answer, and say...\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Sighing happily, you turn back towards your room. Perhaps you'd finally be able to get some sleep, now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, a flash of lightning illuminates your room. In the mirror, directly opposite where you currently stood, you saw...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPaper-white skin, razor sharp teeth, and eyes that were little but black voids.

As she dropped down herself, she froze in a clenched stance and listened intensely for hear worst fear. Footsteps could suddenly be heard outside the door across the kitchen, and Vip despaired. \u201cSpidershit\u201d she yelled out, as she grabbed onto the cube beside her. With a great grunt, she lifted it onto her shoulder and scooped her head to the side to create the needed room. The weight of the cube overwhelmed her, and she felt her legs sink below her, yet she persisted and found the strength to carry on, knowing that the sugar was needed down below. She then dashed across the kitchen table to the cupboard some 3 meters ahead of her. As she reached it, a creaking sound could be heard from the door where the footsteps ended. She then quickly dropped the sugar cube down, and shoved it into the hole. Vip herself just about made it in and covered the hole up with the loose concrete that served as disguise for their entrance. The hole was scarce 2 inches in height, and only just wide enough to fit in the cube. Vip herself had to bend to less than a third her stature just to get in, being only 3.8 inches tall. Yet the small hole server her kin well, having allowed them to smuggle many delicacies from the human kitchen over the years. When the hole was tightly sealed, Vip rejoiced and sighed in delight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that out of the way Vip got back to work. Building strength to carry the cube once more, Vip lifted it up high on her chest to gain support from her back, and sent it down gliding down the slideway few steps before her. After a few stretches she herself took the trip down below, following behind the cube.<br>\r\nEvery time Vip went either up, through the tunnels, or down with the slide she rejoiced over the life she and her kin had made themselves down here. 30 years ago the house outside had been abandoned. During those days Vip and her family had lived in the rooms around the house and has used the garden to gather whatever sustainance they and the rest of the kin had needed. Vip, who was only 60 years, still only a kid for a pixie, had recalled these memories as her happy toddler-years. Then one summer, \u201cthe inheritants\u201d as her brother called them had arrived and taken over the house. Over the course of just 2 weeks, all rooms which formerly had been empty and desolate save for a few tables and chairs, and a dresser here and there, was filled with all the colossal, trivial things humans needed in their lives. Sofas, and TVs and toys for the small ones. And that horrible dog with its curious nose, and its sharp teeth, and the constant barking. Vip hated that. Not only had the family filled the house out with lifeless things. They were wealthy and the house had needed cleaning which the lady of the family had refused to do herself. So the husband had hired an elderly woman and her two granddaughters to live as retainers given that they did their cleaning. While the daughters were nice, their grandmother was a curious and staunch lady, who had spotted one from The Kin some years back and had made a silent crusade in hunting down the pests. Vip could barely count how many times she had nearly caught one of her kin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the humans having taken the house, Vip and her family had spent some time in the shack in the garden, the last place the humans took over. After some debating The Kin had decided to move, much to Vip\u00b4s sadness. But with what seemed a miracle, Vip\u00b4s brother had come back few days before the exodus, and told them of the amazement. Beneath the great house, he had found a colossal series of tunnels that led beneath the human homestead and throughout the walls of their house. The Kin changed their course of action, and after some years and shunning the spiders and whatnot away, they managed to create this system of caverns-complete with ladders and slides, which now served as their home. And to their luck, the tunnels allowed them to spy and pillage the humans from time to time. Mostly the kitchen, where the pixies stole spices and other from in shifts. Today was Vip\u00b4s day and she had been successful, if not lucky with the sugar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the end of the slide, Vip placed the sugar cube on the shelf with the other stolen groceries. She then ran out the room, and into the great cavern, where she knew her brother would be waiting in his shelf-room. Planks and web served as bridges and ladders, from which Vip navigated her way up the hall. On her way she met some of her Kin, who all greeted her. Some even jested her for being late with finishing her daily assignment, to which she grimaced back. When she finally her brothers room, she entered silently. She found him walking across an open book he and some of the Kin had pilfered from above some weeks ago. The book was far too large for him to simply read, so he made due with strutting across the words reading them in the process. Vip was not the great reader, and had never really cared much for books either, but her brother had always taken great interest in the knowledge of the outside world they provided.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI got the cube back brother\u201d Vip said, interrupting her brothers reading as politly as she could. Her brother lifted his dark-haired head as he snapped out of the reading world, and looked upon her with a gentle smile.<br>\r\n\u201cNicely done, Vip\u201d he said with delight, as he pointed a thumbs-up towards her. Vip smiled back. \u201cAnd did you bring the pepper corns straight to the kitchen?\u201d Her brother remarked, still smiling. Here Vip\u00b4s smile disappeared. She had forgotten the damn pepper. As she stood in silence and sank, her brothers smile waned as well. He lifted his fingers to his eyes and rubbed them as he nodded in disapproval.<br>\r\n\u201cYou forgot the pepper, didn\u2019t you\u201d he said in a annoyed tone. Vip remained silent. Her brother gave her a taunting look, as he awaited an answer in vain. Vip backed a few steps away and looked down onto her naked feet.<br>\r\n\u201cThis is the third time you forget something on kitchen duty Vip.\u201d Her brother said.<br>\r\n\u201cSugar is delicious and all, but we need the REAL spices for food. Not just the sweets you want\u201d he continued. He was right. Vip did have a sweet tooth, and the thought of sugar did overshadow the want for a real meal from time to time. Vip looked up and tried to defend herself.<br>\r\n\u201cBut there was a human, and the sugar fell and my legs and\u2026.\u201d She mumbled, tripping over each sentence. Her brothers expression did not change one bit.<br>\r\n\u201cWell you\u00b4re just gonna have to go back there. You\u00b4re not done with your chores yet\u201d he said all parent-ish. Vip was at a loss for words over her fogetfullness, and rather than take the fight up with her brother (him both being one of the Kin\u00b4s leaders and her guardian) simply walked out of the room. For this her brother did feel slightly bad for his tone towards her.<br>\r\n\u201cRelax\u201d he said as she left.<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s just a bit of pepper\u201d he yelled to her. Vip turned and looked back. She nodded in agreement and left the room with a \u201csorry\u201d being her final words to her brother\u2026..<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens on the way to the kitchen<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

And today's routine just so happens to be the dullest. Its like all your tasks you've been given both at home and at school have been just done so fast no time went by. You know it sucks especially when conversations around you revolve around how slow the day is dragging on. Well finally after a few more hours you oddly get called to the principle's office of your school. You probably bet its someone framing you again for having drugs on campus or for stealing books or something totally out of your nature. What you didn't expect was to be greeted by someone you were sure you had forgotten about due to time. Your mother. Oddly however she seems way younger, when you yourself know she's close to her 30's/40's range, she looks almost as if she just gave birth to you but without the weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello my dear son.\" She says with a smile. \"Its been awhile, but lets go home. We have a lot to talk about, and im eager to show you something's your father may have kept you from.\" Apparently the school was ok with it so why question anything when your mother who left 4 years prior to your middle school educational life began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the two of you spoke and went home, not to your original home, no to your mothers home. That was a breath of fresh air itself. You never truely realized how far away your mother was from you, considering she had to move houses and switch up things considering she told you her work was that of time travel scientific things. At least thats what you assume because she never explained it fully due to the secrecy she needs to maintain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you both enter the house its very clean and organized even for your mother's standards because when she obsesses over work there's no telling where you'll find her. Either way she takes you into her work basement where she easily has somehow made a fully functional time machine and not just to reverse her age as you can see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe messes with the controls and such and soon a portal is opened, and she motions to you. \"Sorry sweetie, but I will explain in short.\" She takes a moment to gather herself. \"I been working on this time travel machine for a long while but I also noticed something else. I can send you to a different world with this, and so I need a test subject to try it out. I'm sending you because you can help someone I know from a different world. I just got back yesterday and well thats how you see me, as if i never aged. That place unaged me and not to where I couldn't do anything, but it kept my mind intact. I put a piece of my mind in the machine as a way to help you. You'll understand sooner or later why I'm picking you.\" With that in your head you can't help but think she's using you, but her words speak of a crisis elsewhere, that you and your mother could solve. Hence why she picked you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a brief moment of selection, she activates the portal and sends you off into the world unknown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou land in a new world where everything is.... shiny as all hell. First observation is easily made that everything is freaking shiny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell despite that you look about and notice 4 things different, there are humans, robots, robotic anthro like things, and anthro's themselves. So at most you can say this world has no species discrimination... yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you walk about your surroundings you start noticing the world around you looks cool, shiny, robotic, convenient, and much much more. After doing what most people would do, you look for a bar, and after about 2 to 3 hours of wandering around aimlessly with vague hints you find a bar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you stumble into this bar you hear a conversation being said a little to loud. \"I tell ya's that lab in the outskirts is haunted. Its haunted by ghost's and demons i say!\" You question the sobriety of the person speaking but decide to ask where it's location is. After getting 20 some hints on how to find it, and another 2 hours to follow all the mixed up hints you find this abandoned lab. You can tell via the broken down door, and no lights and basically every other sign of it being abandoned. And then acting like a bravery filled knight, walk into this lab and begin searching which becomes easier when motion lights activate yet with one being blue, another being red, and a 3rd one being green the question comes to mind on what was going through the owner's mind with the lights.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you delve deeper into this abandoned lab you find a actually active diagnostic tube with... a humanoid girl inside? As you look around a video seems to be playing on loop showing that she is actually a robot girl advanced enough that she thinks, feels emotions, and all that like a human but is definitely a robot, and not to mention there's a bit of data clumps as you look through the files inside specifically meant for the robot girl. So as a curious being you being your search amongst the files for an activation code of some sort. With luck and your newly found scientific prowess from your mother's intellect being partially fused into you, you discover the codes to activate the tube to turn the girl on and all that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe process goes fast and the girl emerges out of the tube and to your surprise she had a very unusual type of body with a size E breasts and a big and curvy butt to match it, and not to mention the tube looked a little to small to contain her, nevertheless you released her and helped her up, and you first begin to show her all the data clusters inside the computer meant for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the clusters now scanned she looks to you and smiles and suddenly speaks... very fluently as well. \"Thank you for showing me these things and for awakening me.\" \"Your welcome\" you reply. \"The data blocks you've helped me scanned gave me all the knowledge i needed~ including how your not from this world, and only recently arrived.\" \"woah... how the hell you know?\" \"The last cluster of data gave me knowledge of a brilliant scientist whom sent her son to this place. And mentioned that your reaction was going to roughly be of that in which you've expressed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm... so that means my mom lied and just sent me to the future?\" \"Pretty much but not in the future of your world. This is a different dimension all together. Also the cluster mentioned about getting out of the house within a few minutes but I don't get why. Do you know?\" It was now at this time she looked back to you to notice. She was growing and at an alarming rate. \"Oh.... well then.\" She quickly bent down to pick you up and then bolted through the wall of the lab and out into the open. Thankfully it wasn't to damaging because the building was still standing. \"Okay... so if I was fashioned to be 6ft tall when I was awoken... and soon to start growing merely minutes after awakening... I've grown and will grow 3ft a minute til im close to 300ft tall. Unless my estimation is off.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked down at you in her ever growing palm and smiles not noticing she was nude, but as a robot whom had no nipples or vag, she didn't mind being 'nude' but when she stopped at the 300ft mark, her body just formed clothes to cover herself, and she kept holding you close, so two things became clear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mom has been eavesdropping on your Giantess fetish, She sent you to a place with a giant gentle growing robot, and lastly, you don't care that your possibly never going back.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Well... honestly what is a name?\"<br>\r\n\"Oh damn they did everything but common knowledge such as a name... A name is a way people can call you and know you individually from others.\"<br>\r\n\"Oh so say if somehow you lost me in a crowd of people or things calling my 'name' would help identify me?\"<br>\r\n\"Very much like that. Perfect example actually.\"<br>\r\n\"I see, so do you have a name for me, or anything?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the cute curvy robot gal starts up on another growth spurt this one again starting slowly but speeding up later on has her growing to 600ft by the end of the next conversation, which to accommodate for her size she has a sub routine going on in her body making her voice not be so loud to shatter ever living beings ear drums with her nearby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not a clue... but we should come up with a name for you if anything... but what... it's gotta fit your personality to... which so far I have no idea on what your like outside of protective...\"<br>\r\n\"Well I can share what the data clusters said I need to be to better the world in this timeline.\"<br>\r\n\"That'll work.\"<br>\r\n\"My data collected said that these traits are to be used as often as possible, gentle, kind, fair, nice, and not stepping on things intentionally.\"<br>\r\n\"Huh... well from that alone your a protector kind of gal. Hmmm... well Gaia stands for Earth but... don't think that'd work for you...\"<br>\r\n\"Well if I could ask what your name is then? At least so I can call you by your proper name.\"<br>\r\n\"Oh sure. My name is [insert readers name here].\"<br>\r\n\"Nice to meet you~\"<br>\r\n\"Likewise. Also how does this sound for a name? N.A.T.A.L.I.E but it'll stand for this: Naturally Appearing Teenaged Android Living to Infinitely Enhance. But for short it'd be easier to call ya Natalie.\"<br>\r\nNatalie took a moment before nodding and smiling more. \"I love it~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy now Natalie's growth spurt had ended and now despite her size of a massive 700ft tall a new idea begins to form in your mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Natalie\"<br>\r\n\"Yes?~\"<br>\r\n\"I'm actually curious. But how big can you get?\"<br>\r\n\"The clusters of data actually did not say... they had that after a mile tall, i'll have full control over how big I can get and at will as well. It did however mention that I through various specific activities could spike it when the next growth spurt will occur. The last thing it mentioned is that it takes a few more minutes each growth spurt before the next occurs. So it wont be for about another 10 minutes til my next spurt if I calculated correctly.\"<br>\r\n\"Did it mention what specific activities? Or are they being vague enough for us to try some to figure it out?\"<br>\r\n\"I have no clue on those activities. They made a list but as you guessed until I try some I wont figure them out fast.\"<br>\r\n\"Alright well... what kind of powers or cool gadgets does your body hold? I mean outside forming clothes out of like thin air.\"<br>\r\n\"Well there's my arms which have multiple ways to attack things outside of just being hands. I can morph them into multiple forms such as a gun, some claws, a grapple beam thing, a flamethrower, and a piston puncher. But outside of that, my body can adapt to just about anything given enough prep time to adjust to a new climate or something of the sort. I also have a compartment for storage which can keep people safe from harsh environment explorations.\"<br>\r\n\"Man they jam packed you with almost everything!\"<br>\r\n\"That seems to be the case ^^;\"<br>\r\n\"Hmm... well im kinda curious but lets go find a safe place to try it. People say meditation can work wonders but us sitting in a city near abandoned... or thought to be abandoned buildings isn't the best place for meditation. Can you scan for a more... quieter place? Like a forest or something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatalie nods and closes her eyes as she begins to start a scan. Almost by instinct she heads off towards the mountains outside the city they're in, and as she walks the next growth spurt kicks in taking her from 700ft tall to close to 2,400ft tall. Soon after the growth spurt ended Natalie and [Insert Readers Name for Protagonist here] reach a quiet lakeside with the mountains as a backdrop, or a bed for Natalie.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Here's the three references to look at to understand her looks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyway time to kick this off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you look out into the sunset you look over your current city residence... and notice its full of crime, police, and the in-betweens. As you sigh and head back into your apartment you hear more commotion in the basement again, cause its quiet loud. Despite it being loud its nothing but mumbled garbage to you cause god forbid you know what goes on in the creepy basement of your 12 story high apartment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat is actually going on however is... a ninja attack. More specifically a contracted ninja sent in to acquire the potions that the scientists have converted the basement into their lab. Some were weird potions and god knows why the government wants them but hey a contract is a contract and this ninja girl is kinda broke so she'll take any job.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she is finished knocking out everyone in the basement she takes a few looks at the potions and notices just one to quirk her interest. Specifically their untested growth potion. Chaos is going to ensue because she just flat out drinks it all down. Why? Cause reasons say she felt the need, and because of the unusal good taste she picked another beaker at random and drank it down to. Again why? Because she didn't read the label saying 'Fox Anthro Potion'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeedless to say she instantly became green furred with white underbelly, ears, and tail. Oh remember the growth potion? That started to kick in to. But after that happened you recall being passed out til some time later. When you do wake up, your in the bust of a giant 400ft tall scantily clad ninja fox girl, who is actually just still sitting in the middle of the wreckage of your apartment... The mainly odd thing is that she doesn't notice you yet, but she's also passed out sprawled out on the ground.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You strike a gentle smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis causes her to blush even more, and her lip seems to go into a nervous quiver.<br>\r\nYou never really thought yourself as an attractive man, but you reason that maybe your body type is at this time period. Unexpectedly, the prehistoric woman rushes at you, startling you at first, but leaving you with a embrace you've never really felt before. She was hugging you. For a hug, it was rather... comforting. More than any other you have had before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOut of no where, you return the hug, you aren't quite sure why exactly you did so, but you did. The girl was young, no older than 8 years of age, not very tall either, which was saying something seeing that you were only 5 foot 1. It made you feel odd returning a hug to an 8 year old who you dont even know.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou suddenly feel very warm. Pulling back sharply, worrying you may have been the reason for someones... special moment, lets say, you stare intently at the girl who was frightend immensely by the sudden movement. After the initial scare you notice that her skin in gently glowing. She returns the stare, after cocking her head to the side with a child like curiosity. Is she taller somehow? \"No, it can't be\" you say quietly out loud. Causing her more confusion. The denial you felt slowly melts away as you see her slowly inch up! Her expression is no longer of curiosity, but of amazment. Now over 6 inches taller than you she grabs the sides of your shoulders and smiles the largest smile you've ever witnessed. Her growth causes you to lift up, however she dosen't know that and belives you can fly, letting you go. As you land she shreiks a little swiftly picking you back up. Now 30 feet in height, 32 feet, 36 feet, 40 feet tall! Wondering just how much longer she would grow, her skin stops glowing and her growth slows to a halt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe is once agian looking at you in amazment. She puts you down, gently this time, goes on her hands and knees and makes a hand signal. You assume its a religious one. Taken the events that just occured she probaly belives you to be some sort of god. Possibly one that gave her this height due to a mutual love. You however, don't love this girl, nor are you a god. You, almost instinctivly, raise yor hand and point at her in both fear and amazment. She seems to interpret it as like how a child would raise their arms to be picked up, and picks you up, pushing you into a hug. Once more she blushes, and her skin begins to glow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time she grows to...</span></div></div>",

The girl was reaching for you, her hand engulfing your entire world, its size on par with a mountain.

A tiny human like you would basically be as light as a feather to her!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe massive titan then sunk her hand into the ground instead of picking you up with her fingers, why though? Then the ground beneath you rose up, oh now it made sense, thank god this girl was bright enough to realize her size could easily be the end of him so having a platform to keep himself on was the best way to keep the tiny mortal in her palm save. Then you were brought up into the air at speeds comparable to a jet going straight up, which in turn caused you to fall on your back, the high winds keeping you in place.  Then as fast as you had fallen down you were back in stable mode, the wind had stopped and you could move, oh but the vertigo. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce your head stopped spinning your eyes focused on what looked...like a...eye...oh yeah. The girl's eye focused on your minuscule form, making you feel like a god was watching you. Then the giant goddess brought her head back allowing you to see her in somewhat eye level territory. The young girl gave you a kind look and a smile that admittedly make your heart beat faster, and then she gained a mischievous smile that only a girl could make look cute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then brought the hand you were standing on and put you in her ear. You were surprised by this action and then you could only look into the abyss which was the girl's ear. Then the moment where the earth shook, tidal waves were made by this sound, and all mortals on the ground would hear a voice that most believed was the lord himself, a booming voice said \"So whats your name little guy\"</span></div></div>",

On the one hand, seeing Annie and Melissa was appealing, but that meant hugging Serena, and growing her far, far beyond her already massive height. Or you could stay here and hang, but that might mean more hugs from all three, and you didn't know if there was a limit to how big any of them could grow or not!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, what do you do?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Yay!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou obligingly stand up as the nine foot tall six year old girl clears the space between you in just over a second. Wow, she was quick!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you can say anything Serena has already wrapped you up in an extra tight hug, and you can feel the giant first grader begin to grow around you. Giggling as she hugs you, Serena is blissfully unaware of her growth as she begins to grow, approaching Camille's height of nine foot five...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then surpassing it! Camille's smile falters ever so slightly as her six year old sister continues to hug you and grow ever larger, the latter being unknown to everyone except you. Serena's head presses firmly against the ceiling as her whole body enlarges, and she plops herself down in her chair next to Camille, unintentionally lording her extra foot of height over her sister as she hugs you even tighter, and begins to grow faster!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs large as the chair was, it was quickly filled to its limits as Serena grew and grew, the six year old titaness now just under fifteen feet tall, her head beginning to brush the ceiling again. Serena removes herself from the chair with some difficulty, and sits down on the floor, easily taller than Camille while the former had a foot or so extra height from her chair. Serena curls in on herself somewhat as her head thumps into the ceiling yet again, then begins to travel along it as she proportionally expands, her legs almost reaching the opposite wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCamille, by this point, had a near ambiguous look on her face, as if her wasn't sure what to think. You don't have time to think about Camille, however, as Serena's entire body shudders, and begins to grow in short yet powerful ripply spurts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was amazing how much Serena had managed to compact her body so far, as she must have been almost thirty feet tall by now! As her massive head begins to push against the opposite wall of the house, you firmly in her embrace, she gasps, and flows another five feet larger, her side beginning to press Karen and Camille into the wall!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does Serena do?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Looking up to see who it was, you saw Camille's other other younger sister, the 13 year old Jasmine. You kept forgetting how large Camille's family was, inwardly laughing at your unintentional pun. \"Hey, you,\" was all she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou spun around to get a better look at her, returning the hug since you knew what was going to happen now and you knew you wouldn't be able to stop it. She was already growing close to the ceiling, and she showed no signs of letting go of you any time soon. As you felt Jasmine's body slide up against your face, she had to start bending over to avoid hitting her head on the ceiling. The larger she got, the more awkwardly Jasmine had to contort her body to maintain a hug with you, but she didn't seem to care. Finally, when your head was about level with her waist, she let you go. Since you were roughly half her size, you estimated that she was now just under 12 feet tall, almost two whole heads taller than Camille.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You really should come over more often,\" Camille laughed. \"Look at how much everyone misses you.\" You laughed along with her, but in the back of your mind you were worried that Camille's family would quickly outgrow skyscrapers if they reacted like this every time they saw you. Then again, since Camille and Karen grew earlier by hugging each other, you guessed they would end up growing whether you were there or not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were broken out of your thoughts when. . .</span></div></div>",

You were always picked on by bullies, being weak and emotional, and get pushed down almost every day. Your only dream was to become an adult, living in the real world of freedom and equality, where no one could do wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking home from school with another black eye, you decided to stay with your friend Jane to play dolls. You decided to do this without having your mother see you, as she would drag you in if she does. You take a detour through the forest, the first time you've done so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn minutes you got lost. The paths grew darker and darker. You were about to cry in fear. You wished you had stayed with your mother, who always protected you from dangers such as this. Now there was little hope of seeing her again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hear a voice. \"Daisy, help me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stopped weeping and looked around. The voice didn't seem to come from anywhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Daisy, over here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walked through the forest a little longer, until you came to a tree that seemed to have a blueish glow. You were curious; no tree could naturally glow like that. You inched forward and put your hand on it. It was warm, but it was still a tree.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly its glow stopped, and darkness overcame you again. You knelt down in tears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe voice spoke again. \"Daisy, thank you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turned around and saw a woman, who seemed to be glowing like the tree was, only brighter. She was beautiful, more than twice as gorgeous as the supermodels you see on TV.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you for releasing me from my prison,\" the glowing woman said. \"I am Bonum, an angel for good. The forces of darkness held me here on the edge of the forest, where no one would find me for a while. It has been centuries.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were puzzled. \"I thought good always beats evil,\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, your undeveloped mind. In the real world, evil almost always wins, since I was in this jail. Although it seems like good does win there, it is ineffective. If only the world knows how to be kind and courteous to others...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe trails off. \"Never mind, to repay your kind act, I will grant you one wish, and this can be anything at all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis is your lucky day. You can finally become an adult and abandon your troubles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wish I grew up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly you remembered what Bonum said. \"In the real world, evil almost always wins.\" Your life in adulthood could be worse than your life in childhood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look at Bonum, and she frowned. \"This wish has multiple meanings. You may not like it, but I will grant to you both of them. Enjoy the ride.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe waved her hand, and everything went black.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wake up in a grassy field, everything around you feeling warm. The grass was trimmed short, making it a relaxing place to take a nap. That's probably what you did; you were still tired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou remembered Bonum, and what she did. It must have been a dream, you thought. You must have fallen asleep and given that vision. You stand up... and your head enters the clouds above. But that was impossible, the clouds are miles in the air and you're only 3' 10\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly a horrible thought came to you. The grass isn't short... I grew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's the best you could describe it, since you were only 8-years old. You bent down so you could see the world better. What you say instead was yourself. You were in new clothes. Your skin seemed luminous and shiny. You felt powerful, and more feminine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked around. Mostly in your field of vision was grass, but there was a city to your right, and a farm straight ahead. You could show yourself to the public, or go to the farm in hopes of grabbing food, since it won't be easy when you're as tall as the neighboring city is wide. Then again, the city could provide some to. Where will you go?</span></div></div>",

This seems like nothing to you, but to others it can be catastrophic. Fortunately for the rest of the world you have to lean down in order to see. Darn clouds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn only minutes you approach the farm and almost trample a large part of it. It was a lot larger than you thought it would be, but still you looked down and saw the entire farm. Rows of trees were planted, all full with ripe apples. Some of them bore some, others none at all. It must be the apple harvest season.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AGH! GIANTESS!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou barely hear it from below, along with thousands other screams. They run with their baskets full of apples with them, slowing them down. The apples would be a good snack, however it won't be enough. You would need billions of them to fill you up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop!\" you yell. You didn't actually yell, but when you spoke, everyone dropped their baskets and covered their ears. Maybe you should be a little more quiet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally one of them spoke. \"Ma'm, can you please speak softer? You're making us go deaf!\" he shouted, in hope that your faraway ear could hear him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see your mouth moving, but I don't hear anything,\" you reply. The farmers' ears were about ready to burst. You laid down on your belly and pointed your ear towards the man who spoke. Even your head towered over everything, so huge that King Kong would try to climb it and would faint in exhaustion if he got close to reaching the top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"SPEAK SOFTER!\" the farmer said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, sorry. I just grew, you know,\" you whisper. To them it was still loud, but better than you speaking as if in a normal conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore farmers were gathering, with red-hot pitchforks and bats, in case you would cause a rampage. Someone even brought a shotgun. They did not look happy. However, you tell them, \"Don't you dare,\" and they back off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ma'm, please spare us. We could do anything in our capability,\" the farmer nearest to you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get all of the apples and bring them to me,\" you reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But that will take hours!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then bring the ones in the baskets to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRushing as fast as they can, the farmers dropped their weapons, grabbed all of the baskets and brought them to you. Each of its contents you swallowed whole. After eating 50 or so, they have run out, so they ran to harvest more apples as fast as they could. But you were still hungry; each apple was barely anything to you. So you...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Miraculously you did not harm any of them, except that they moved at incredible wind-breaking speeds as they moved towards your gigantic hand, which would take around 10 minutes to walk across.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you mad?\" one of them shouts at you. \"You almost killed us! Be extra careful when you handle someone microscopic to you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn't hear him, and start moving towards the city, again breaking the sound barrier. There are no good grips on your hand, so your movement caused the farmers to slide. Four of them fell off your hand, but you caught all of them in fast reaction time. Thinking your hand was no longer safe to them, you place them in your shirt pocket, accidentally causing the farmers to have another long fall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as you were about to continue moving, you find another farmer dangling off your pointer. As you pick him up, you were about to drop him in your shirt pocket like everyone else, but then an idea came to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I need your help,\" you say to him. \"Convince the city that I won't harm them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How could you evading harming an entire city, much more than five farmers?\" he replies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll stay outside the city if I must. Get them to believe me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTransportation by a woman 5 miles tall wasn't the best method, but he could do nothing but agree for the safety of his own life. Yet he seemed calm. Looking closer at his face, you notice he was the same farmer you ordered him to bring you the baskets of apples. He seemed like a courteous gentleman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll try... as long as I don't get the shirt pocket treatment,\" the farmer says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's your name?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kris. Kris Johnson. And what shall I call you? The Mile-High Woman? The Colossal Chick?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe called me a woman and a chick, you think. You remembered Bonum. \"The wish has multiple meanings,\" she said. You supposed she made you grow old and grow taller. Multiple meanings indeed. But you were only 8-years old. How will you adjust to the real world, which was full of hatred and discrimination?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Call me Daisy,\" you say to Kris.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Daisy... that's ironic,\" Kris says, trying not to laugh. \"We should get moving.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Got it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe clouds above you were starting to thin, so you stood up to your full height and moved at full walking speed. You are unaware that you were making the farmers deaf. Finally you reached the city. Screams and calls for help came immediately as you stood by the city line. The city wasn't as big as the major cities of the United States, as you were as tall as it was wide. But it was overpopulated. The tallest skyscraper was slightly taller than your big toe. And even your toes could flatten nearby buildings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nForgetting about the other farmers, you set Kris down to tell the public that you won't hurt anyone. You didn't hear the entire conversation, but when you picked up Kris again, he told you that they can't trust you. They said you could flatten the city in minutes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Which means, little or no food for you,\" he continues.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me think...\" you reply.

Despite outgrowing your older sister you were still weary of her. Her short 5'1 figure was packed with muscle. Years of dancing and activities meant that she was ridiculously strong for her size, she had even started frequenting the gym and doing weights recently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou on the other hand were a long distance runner in your school, tall and long. Not really weak, but you didn't really want to test your sisters strength. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, well this is the biggest room in the house and you watching a stupid movie isn't going to be tested in front of an audience.\" She huffed at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Is this worth it?' You questioned yourself. She always got her way in the end usually, this stuff was always a war of attrition and she is always stubborn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know what? Fine take the damn room, I'm gonna go play some video games.\" You said brushing her off and walking passed her, to the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou heard a weird creaking some from behind you as you reached the door way and turned to look at your sister. She was standing with her arms crossed and hip cocked to one side, taking her for impatiently. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWas her shirt showing a bit of her toned stomach before? Man her shirts were tight, how was she even comfortable practicing in those? She shot a glare at you, pushing those thoughts from your mind and continuing to leave. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen do you next bump into your sister?</span></div></div>",

You ignored what she said but couldn't shake the feeling something was different about her. As she closed the door to her room behind her you continued downstairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou set the table while your mother was dishing all the components of dinner into serving containers. She usually did this so that everyone could grab seconds if they wanted it. Just as everything was laid out your sister arrived in the doorway. \"Roast chicken! I'm glad you made a lot, mom. I'm starving!\" She happily said as she took a seat and immediately started dishing up a huge portion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and your mother took your seats and also began dishing up dinner while your sister dug in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes both your sister and you had cleaned your plates and were going for seconds.

You reached for the leg as you couldn't possibly finish the whole half but before you could get to it your sisters arm shot out and snatched it from beneath you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!,\" you said, \"I was only going to take the leg!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, well I'm taking the whole thing! Unlike some people I actually expended some energy today.

If you're really hungry you can cook some of the chicken in the fridge.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsually your mom was fair between you two so you let your sister get away with it this time. You looked across the table at her while she shot you a cheshire grin before ripping into her seconds. You were about to look away when your sister jolted in her seat as if she had been surprised by a pinch. She continued eating as if she hadn't noticed it herself but from your point of view it had looked like she had stretched outward in all directions.

She swallowed hard and you could visibly see a huge lump of cake travel down her throat on it's way to her stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOblivious to your attempts of getting her attention she carried on to completely obliterate the cake, leaving only a few crumbs on the plate while she licked the frosting off of her fingers.

Her eyes flicked over to you in shock. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you serious?\" She jumped up and rushed over to you, clearly measuring herself against you.

To almost everyone else, she is extremely bossy, and almost always gets her way. As a result of this she is rather spoiled by your parents, possessing a massive selection of toys to play with. Her toys are always one of two types of toys: plushie animals, or inflatable animals, the majority of both being rather large, and, coupled with the amount of them she had, often leaving very little space in her bedroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne day, however, your parents will give Lily something she has had her eyes on for a very long time: a massive inflatable dinosaur, which is almost seven feet tall! However, once the massive toy is fully inflated, and she begins to play with it - somehow persuading you to join her - Lily touches it, and grows several inches taller. Only you seem to notice this, however, and you quickly realise, to your horror, that whenever Lily touches a toy of any kind in the shape of an animal, she will experience a growth spurt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeedless to say, Lily will end up growing very, very big indeed, thanks to the sheer volume of toys she possesses. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",
