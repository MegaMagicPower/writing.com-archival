As this continued Cana began to feel wet and the pain switched to pleasure when she felt a tentacle move inside her and then shot out her mouth, it was the same tentacle that went up her ass she didn't think it was possible and only thought it was a thing in the books she read  she felt the other tentacle that was rubbing her pussy finally enter which Cana helplessly let happened and she soon felt about 3 enter her pussy as 2 more enter her ass as two more enter her mouth and small ones entered her ears. The monster fucked her like this for hours as Cana's stomach started to stretch out as she started to be felled with eggs from the monster. Cana was soon released from the monster left on the ground as the monster shot more cum on her she soon started giving breath to tons of babies which lasted for hours....<br>\r\n- the next day - <br>\r\nCana was able to leave her prison trying to walk to the town where she saw Lucy. <br>\r\n\"Cana!! Oh no....Cana\" Lucy said seeing her friend naked and covered in cum. <br>\r\n\"Please...Lucy help get me washed\" Cana said as Lucy brought her friend to a nearby bathhouse where she helped wash Cana. <br>\r\n\"Cana what happened?<br>\r\n\"....\" <br>\r\n\"Cana you can tell me anything.\" Lucy said<br>\r\n\"...I was raped Lucy and I give birth to...to that things babies...\" Cana said as tears rolled down her cheeks.<br>\r\nLucy was speechless \"please Lucy don't tell the others...and don't leave me alone.\" Cana said Lucy was again speechless but she hugged Cana. <br>\r\n\"Cana I never saw you like this, but I promise it'll just be between us.\" Lucy said<br>\r\nLucy finished up washing Cana and got her dressed in some of her spare clothes.

She seen felt something shoot into her mouth as the creature left her mouth as Wendy soon was turned on her back and pinned down by the creature as this happened she soon felt the creatures cock enter her ass causing Wendy to scream as tears started to form in her eyes Wendy just sat there moaning gripping on the creatures fur as it pounds her ass more. This went on and on into she felt the creature cum into her ass. To drained of energy Wendy laid they teary eyed and out of breath.

They got to Lucy house and Nami was undressed.<br>\r\n\"I hope you don't mind being naked for a little bit it'll just be me and you into my daughters come home from there walk.\" Lucy said normally Nami would be against being naked like this but she strangely fells fine around Lucy. <br>\r\n\"Lucy if I might ask is your daughter still in diapers?\" Nami said seeing a stack of diapers in the corner of the room they're in.<br>\r\n\"Well of course she is only 3 she's still learning how to potty train.\" Lucy said giggling. \"If you want to you can try one on.\" Lucy said making Nami blush Lucy watched the girls reaction to the statement and desided to have Nami lie down as she grabbed one of the diapers. She was fast to diaper Nami who was shooked that the diaper fit her and so found it very comfy and relaxing to. <br>\r\nLucy hold Nami in her arms as she stocked Nami's hair \"you know I always wanted someone as cute as you to be my baby I know you have your friends looking for you but for now why don't you just relax and enjoy this time with mommy dear.\" Lucy said as Nami listened it put her mind completely at ease no longer did she have to worry about being a grown up, no longer did she have to deal with the idiots of the crew, she can just simply enjoy her time here. Lucy soon noticed that Nami was asleep carrying the girl into a nursery she soon placed Nami into a crib and went out of the room.<br>\r\nThat's it for part 1 I'll work on part 2 soon.</span></div></div>",

But this new jutus is the most control Hinata seemed to have over.<br>\r\n\"Naruto, are you sure this is completely safe?\" Said Hinata \"Hinata the other haven't done any harm to you, and plus you agreed to this when no one else did.\" Naruto Hinata just remind quite. \"Alright Hinata let's do this, padded no jutsu!\" Naruto shouted <br>\r\nAs a puff of smoke cleared it was clear what the jutus did Hinata was just standing there in nothing but a diaper. <br>\r\n\"Hinata!?!\" Naruto said blushing<br>\r\n\"Naruto! I said that jutus would do something like this, please just in do it.\" Hinata said as Naruto did the release only to see nothing has happened.<br>\r\n\"Hold on Hinata, there gotta be a way to get you out of this.\" Naruto said Naruto saying this looking though the scroll to find some sort of solution to the problem. <br>\r\n\"Naruto, I thought you knew how to undo these types of jutus!\" Hinata said blushing madly as she said this she went to move but ended up tripping and grabbing Naruto's arm which activated the other part of the jutus replacing Naruto's clothes with only a diaper. Both just looked at each other blushing, at that moment Hinata got a strong need to use the bathroom as did Naruto both grunting and trying to hold it in. Naruto was the first to fail and unless an in holy amount of crap into his diaper as did Hinata a moment later. <br>\r\n\"Guess we should get changed now.\" Naruto said as he led Hinata into a near by bathroom. \"Wait Naruto we don't even have anything to change into.\" Hinata stated \"well we can at least get cleaned up and out of these dirty diapers.\" Naruto said<br>\r\nHinata lad down only to have Naruto unable to open said diaper. Both confused they desided that its best that only one goes get clothes and bring it back which Naruto gladly goes and does.<br>\r\nHinata sat down on a near by toilet causing her diaper to mush against her butt which cause a small moan to escape her. With that her diaper grow warmer and she started to feel aroused founding it hard to resist she began to masterbate doing this filled the room up with both moans and crinkles from the diaper after a few mins she climated. As Hinata climated a proof of smoke formed around the diaper and disappeared leaving a fresh one in it's place. <br>\r\nNaruto was quick to return after which he was shooked that Hinata figured it out but did he really have to do that in his diaper as well it was still messy. <br>\r\n\"Naruto if you want to maybe I could help you.\" Hinata said as she grabbed Naruto and kissed him as there started to make out Naruto was turned on and Hinata reached in and started to give Naruto a hand job which at first felt weird to Naruto but soon started to like the feeling and climated which changed his diaper into a fresh one as well. <br>\r\n\"Naruto then give a spear sit of his clothes to Hinata and the both get dressed and just desided to head home for the day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto now very confused didn't know what to do if he told anyone he would be a laughing stock but if he can't find a way to fix it him and Hinata could be both stick in diapers forever with Hinata \"changing\" both of them.<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

Also main characters are aged 18+ for this story) <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh and Misty just left Viridian City and were on their to Pewter city, when a wild Caterpie appeared in front of them, \"Wow a Caterpie\" Ash said excitedly, Misty on the other hand was not that excited, \"AHHHHH GET THAT MONSTER AWAY FROM ME!!!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh quickly got out his pokeball and caught it. Ash was really happy and proud of himself for catching his first pokemon, Misty though wasn't very trilled. \"Eh why would you catch a bug pokemon\" Misty said in disgust. \"What, you\u2019er afraid of a cute little Caterpie\" Ash said. \"CUTE! It\u2019s a BUG POKEMON, they\u2019re disgusting creates that just deserve to be under a shoe.\u201d Misty snapped. They continued fighting until Ash decided to walk away leave Misty Behind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWanting her bike replaced (and not wanting to be alone in the bug-infested woods) she followed him, hiding behind trees as she went. Eventually he spotted her again and got irritated, \u201cWhy are you still following us?!\u201d \u201cBecause you still need to replace my bike!\u201d Misty yelled annoyed. \u201cI said I\u2019d replace it someday, plus you have to apologies to my Caterpie for what you said!\u201d Ash yelled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cApologies to that ugly thing, NEVER!\u201d \u201cThen I won\u2019t replace your bike.\u201d Ash replied. The argument went on and Misty only kept insulting Ash\u2019s Caterpie, which only made Ash really mad and less eager to replace the bike. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh then turned his and began walking away. Fuming, Misty grabbed a rock and threw at Ash\u2019s head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWAH-?!\u201d Ash stumbled at the hit and then was knocked to the ground. Misty stomped over to him while he was stunned. Pikachu, who was walking beside Ash, stood aside and watched the both of them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe almost yelled at him while he was lying down groaning when suddenly a Weedle fell from the trees and landed right on top of Misty\u2019s head! \u201cAAAAHHH HELP GET IT OFF, GET IT OFF!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMisty was screaming and jumping on the spot. Ash got up from the ground, saw Misty in her situation and was about to break into laughter- but a flash of white caught his eye. He smirked, before reaching down for the waistband poking out of the girl\u2019s shorts. As he grasped it, he noticed Misty didn\u2019t really notice with Weedle hanging on to her head. Well he\u2019d change that! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the- AAAAAAAGH!\u201d Misty suddenly was being pulled up by her waistband, the cotton being shoved viciously into her butt by Ash\u2019s anger-fueled wedgie, \u201cSt-stoppit!\u201d Ash laughed as he pulled the girl\u2019s butt up higher. He began bouncing her as she yelped, her panties\u2019 legholes now visible as they flew deeper and deeper into her ass. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh knew his strength wouldn\u2019t last much longer and that Misty probably would try to get the upper hand and take revenge. He quickly noticed a low hanging branch and began carrying a squealing Misty over to it, her panties up to her upper back by this point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was going to leave her up there for a bit until she agreed to his demands- or maybe something else would be better...</span></div></div>",

She hadn\u2019t received many wedgies over the years- a few small ones from her sister when they were younger was really the limit. but even then, she was mainly used to giving them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had never been this bad and she had certainly never been hung up like this. It stung painfully and she was willing to listen to her new travel \u201ccompanion\u201d\u2019s demands. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can come along on my journey quietly. If your not, your underwear is going to make a nice little home in your butt, like it is right know, throughout my journey. I'll pay your expenses and you can help cover stuff when you feel like it. And this is what our relationship will be until you get your bike back and leave me alone. You, submissive and accepting of what I want. Makes sense?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMisty was clearly hesitant about such a deal. She wanted her bike replaced but not with those conditions. She would have just said she would leave the boy alone and never see him again but she also didn't want to be seen as a weak push over, especially after he did this to her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing Misty hesitant just made Ash smirk. He could do this all day. He got around her again, picking up a nearby branch that was flattish, \u201cHere let me persuade you, Misty.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAAAAAAAAAAGH!\u201d Misty squealed loudly as the tree branch slammed into her denim-covered butt with all the strength Ash had left (which was still a lot to the girl who had only been spanked by hand, never by a branch). <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt sent her swinging, grinding her already awful wedgie deeper into her ass, the pain beginning fresh as the momentum put pressure onto her crotch before swinging her back to shove it back up her butt. \u201cI haven\u2019t heard a \u2018Yes Sir\u2019 yet Misty!\u201d Ash laughed before spanking her again with the branch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter five strikes from the branch Misty was on the verge of tears but held strong. She wouldn\u2019t let him win! At least, that was what she thought as Ash circled around front. He looked her over before reaching up and undoing her Shorts. She tried to hold them up but he smacked her red behind, causing Misty to yelp and let them drop to her ankles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh laughed at the site, the pitiful and foolhardy girl swinging from a branch, undies shoved deep up her ass and exposing her now red butt to the world. Misty\u2019s cheeks burned in humiliation, desperately hoping she could escape. Her spirit was at its breaking point. Maybe she could get her Pokemon to save her sore butt!</span></div></div>",

He was almost little to no help when battling them but in the end it was he and his Pikachu that blasted them off. Even though he was clearly temperamental, something about him told her that he could become a great trainer with the right guidance. And maybe they got off the wrong foot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait!

You clearly just started your journey as a trainer, and-\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait... are you offering to be my mentor?\" Ash asked while placing his hands on his hips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl nodded, swallowing her pride. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh looked at Misty skeptical. He was still angry at her for insulting Caterpie and throwing a rock at his head, that much was certain. But, now that he had some time to calm down, he was able to think clearly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon he came to a decision, he got back onto the stump, and unhooked her panties from the branch of the tree, causing her to fall back to the forest floor on her face. \"Ow! eh, did you have to drop m-EEEK!\" Before Misty could even unpick her wedgie or put her shorts back on Ash got behind on grabbed her waistband again and hoisted the girl off ground until she stood on her toes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright Misty, what's the catch?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AH! eh, N-no ca-catch. Pro-Ah! promise. Cross my hea-AAH!\" Misty clutched her butt as she felt Ash lift her off her toes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But why? Why would offer your help?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Be-EeK! because w-we.. eh, got off the wrong f-foot! eh, You destroyed my bike but i-it w-AHs to save your Pikachu. You even managed to blast off team rocket with no battle experience! eh, ow! eh, look am sorry I insulted your Caterpie and throw a rock at you, eh, That was uncalled for, but I want to make it up by training the potential in you!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing Misty's words Ash slowly let her back down to her feet and let go off her undies, which made her sigh in relief. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You really think I have potential Misty?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you have the passion for Pokemon. The pain in my butt proves that. Don't get me wrong, but you still owe me a bike.\" Misty said while she undid her wedgie and put her shorts back on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah I'll get you your bike but my conditions on you submitting will still stand... But, maybe the one on you staying quiet can be dropped. Though you can't all that bad. I mean you were wedgied and spanked with a branch by me and your reaction was to help me. And your pretty strong, you didn't drop a tear in all that.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks Ash.\" Misty said as she held the urge to grin while she finished redoing her shorts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen that was done Ash then grasped Misty by the waistband once again, leading her by the underwear rather than wedgieing her (for now at least). <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mon Misty, we need to get to Pewter before nightfall.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She did help him catch a pidgeotto that day as well, much to his joy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had messed up a bit- sending his poor caterpie out to fight it when it was a flying type. Misty had let him know very quickly what she thought about that, by smacking him at the back of his head. Ash quickly had Pikachu defeat it so he could capture it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBirds eat worms like yours Ash! Pokemon isn\u2019t just about throwing one creature at another- they are only effective if their trainer is thinking!\u201d She said, lecturing him, Ash sitting sheepishly on the ground cross legged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry Misty, I wasn\u2019t thinking clearly. I just thought that Caterpie needed his time to shine!\u201d He said enthusiastically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMisty sighed, smiling a little, \u201cI know that\u2019s what you want, but something like pidgeotto isn\u2019t something you throw a Caterpie at. And you did all this after forgetting you needed to weaken pokemon to catch them first, one of the basic rules of catching pokemon!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shook her head in fond exasperation, \u201cYou\u2019re so hard headed sometimes. But you need to drill it into your head- many of a pokemon\u2019s weaknesses are self explanatory. Grass gets burned up by Fire which is weakened by Water which is soaked up by Grass again. But advantages like this can make the world of a difference!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh nodded furiously, \u201cI understand! I\u2019ll do my best to memorize my pokemons\u2019 weaknesses!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMisty nodded happily, \u201cI\u2019m sure you will!\u201d They both squealed when web-like string suddenly shot up next to them. They both stopped when they saw it was only Caterpie forming a cocoon around itself, \u201cOh its evolving!\u201d It turned into a Metapod, the cocoon stage of the bug\u2019s life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other kid jumped up celebrating and hugging his Metapod, Misty laughed before noticing the sun was almost set, \u201cLooks like we\u2019re not making it our today. Tomorrow then; best set up camp in that case.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey did so, getting a fire going and eating before Ash turned to Misty, \"Alright Misty, while I know you helped me a lot today with catching a new Pokemon. You still insulted Metapod when he was a Caterpie and need to make it up for it, so for tonight your going to also be in a cocoon like him.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMisty looked at him blankly as he got her sleeping bag out, \u201cWha-Whadda ya mean?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe pulled her gently by the panties, \u201cOh simple!\u201d he grabbed some rope and threaded one rope through one leghole, then another through the other leghole. He then pulled them up, wedgieing Misty\u2019s panties up her butt and her undies climbed up her sides.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he was done, the legholes were halfway up her body, held there on the sides by two ropes that looped over a shoulder and through the legholes. Misty squirmed in the permanent wedgie, which honestly only seemed to make it worse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh explained, \u201cYou\u2019ll be staying like that for the night in your sleeping bag like Metapod. Hopefully after tonight I\u2019ll never have to do this again\u2026?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMisty nodded, \u201cYes Ash, the lesson is being- ugh -learned!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood! Then I\u2019ll be taking these as collateral,\u201d He said removing her shorts, \u201cYou can get them back in the morning. Take off the wedgie and you\u2019ll be walking around shortsless tomorrow.\u201d Misty blushed as he did take them off but nodded and got in her sleeping bag.

Lily and Violet DID say she got an atomic wedgie from her boyfriend when she first met him... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stifled a chuckle at the thought.. Her own eldest sister, the strong and commanding woman who helped take care of her and her other sisters, receiving a WEDGIE of all things. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she let sleep overtake her, she drifted off into slumberland so she could dream of making as a water Pokemon trainer.<br>\r\n---- <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning, Misty's eyes fluttered open, yawning as she stretched up, and then immediately wincing at the feeling of her still in place wedgie. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned her head, as she watched Ash wake up as well, stretching out his body as he felt his bones pop a bit and greeted Pikachu with a scratch behind the ears. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh crawled out of his sleeping bag and zipped Misty's own sleeping bag open a bit to check. He smiled as he saw that Misty had kept the wedgie in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, you kept your promise!\" Ash handed his companion back her shorts, \"You can undo the ropes now..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMisty gladly did so, getting out of her sleeping bag and untying the ropes until her undergarments were free.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter digging her panties out of her crack and putting her shorts back on, the two of them (along with their Pokemon) had a quick breakfast. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Before we get going, I think you deserve a heads up.

And considering that some of the leader's Pokemon might be ground types as well, I think Pikachu needs to sit it out..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh wanted to protest, but he knew she was more than likely right.. From what he'd heard in one of the trainer booklets, electric Pokemon like Pikachu don't work too well against those type of Pokemon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess... I could get a water type..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You got it!\" Misty smiled at Ash's words, gently knocking him on the head \"You see? There's a benefit to using your brain..\" </span></div></div>",

This lead to her loosing sight of him. <i>How.. is... Ash... doing.. this?</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith Pikachu next to her, she decided to sit on a stump to rest. As she did so however... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA net sprung out from behind some shrubbery, and promptly caught Misty by surprise and pinned her upper body to the ground. Thanks to Pikachu's quick reflexes, he luckily dodged the net. Misty gapped in shock at what just happened, with her fears being unfortunately confirmed as she looked behind her to see the domineering hand of the Team Rocket member, Jessie. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Quite da catch of da day, eh?\" Meowth quipped as the feline popped out of the shrubbery.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll say!\" James said as he too popped out, \"It-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames stopped in mid-sentence, as all of three Team Rocket members looked at Pikachu who was not in the net.     <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" You missed, Meowth!!\" Jessie growled angrily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! You try aimin and firin with paws! Besides, I got da twoip that helped loose us our haul of Pokemon.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMisty sweated a bit nervously as she tried to reach for Pokemon, but the net kept her from doing so. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Dammit I can't reach my or Ash's Pokemon! Pikachu can't fight them alone! Eh, think!!</i>\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing Jeesie getting ready to go for Pikachu, Misty gave swift kick to Jessie's chin. \"YEEOOWW!! Jessie yelled as she hopped on one leg holding her chin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Run Pikachu! Get outta here, go!\" Misty called out. Pikachu hesitantly made a run for it, stopping to look up, before running for it faster and then out of sight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile the three Pokemon thieves were angry, they stopped as Meowth looked closer at Misty as a realization popped into his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey fellas! Check it out.. we still got da twoip's pokemon!\" Meowth said, a smug grin adorned on his feline face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, yeah we did\" Jessie said, as a smiliar grin formed on her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMisty tried to kick them away from her but James held her legs down as Meowth took her Pokemon away from her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh, GIVE THEM BACK!!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd don't think we will, but don't were we'er not done with you.\" Jessie said cracking her knuckles with anticipation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMisty gulped as a pit formed in her stomach.<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLittle did Misty realize, however, that Pikachu was scurrying off in search of Ash.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Ow!! OW!!!\" She winced as he proceeded his tugging, pulling his arm up while griping a fist full of her panties, causing her to hoisted into air much like how Jessie did. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you didn't, did you? You got hurt and captured. You ended up like THIS because you let your emotions get the better of you. If I hadn't showed up in time, they would have done worse.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMisty tried to think of something to argue back but she couldn't. Ash was right. Pikachu could have certainly saved her but she didn't have enough trust in his abilities. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n*sigh* \"eh, you'er... right, I didn't have enough trust... I promise I'll that.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh slowly put her down. \"I know you will, which is why I'm taking you'er shorts. Cause then you'll have to trust me to make sure no one sees.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo she was put back on her feet and Ash let out, she sighed in relief, proceeding to pick her underwear out of her crack. \"Ow... You know I could've handled Jessie's wedgie considering how much worse yours are.

But first, we'll need to get you into position.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First, let's fix this.\" Stepping up to her, he pulled the waistband of her panties off her head, letting them snap back down to her waist...mostly, they were a bit too stretched to go all the way back into position. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMisty sighed in relief as the pain in her backside lessened. Panting out a quick \"Thanks,\" the girl said from began to think that things were turning around. \"Great I didn't even have to ask him.\" She thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't thank me yet.\" or maybe not. or rather, they literally were, as he spun her around, grabbed her panties, and pulled hard enough to lift her off the ground by her panties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OW! Ah, what are you doing?!\" Her sudden flailing caused her to turn and left her dangling sideways as he carried her over to the grass before dropping her unceremoniously. \"Ow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here's what we're gonna do,\" he stated enthusiastically, \"You are going to educate me on type weaknesses. Every wrong answer I give earns you another wedgie.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT?! Why?\" This was definitely not what she had expected. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because I think I'll learn better if you can really FEEL the consequences for not teaching me right.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMisty gulped as she began to think of questions. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n----------------- <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSurprisingly, Ash had limited Misty down to just three wedgies after 9 questions. The first time he answered wrong, was on the third question regarding the weaknesses of a poison type, Misty had earned herself a lifting wedgie, which lasted for about a minute thankfully. The second time, on the sixth question about which Pokemon type would be effective against a Normal type, he hoisted her off the ground swung her by the panties for about two minutes. And unfortunately, the last question, relating to which type was best against a fairy type, had earned Misty a hanging wedgie from a rock formation by a tree. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You didn't tell me you didn't know anything about steel and fairy types! -AAH!\" AH!\" She wriggled about, trying in vain to get free from her wedgie. She was definitely going to need to change into another pair of panties when she was free from this. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that's what you get from not teaching me right.. It's not my fault I just had slightly outdated books. Now, for the final question, with a special penalty this time.\" Misty gulped nervously. \"If I get this one wrong, you won't be aloud to wear any shorts whenever we're not in a town.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wedgied and shortless girl's eyes widened in shock. \"Are you kidding me?!\" No more shorts when they're outside of town, just her undies clad butt on display for this wicked boy to see. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope. Who knows, it could make for quite the reputation if we run into enough people: The Shortless Pokemon Mentor.\" Misty's face reddened, dread filling her at the thought of being known as the Pokemon trainer who was always wondering around in her underwear because he couldn't be bothered to study. Of course, she couldn't have known that Ash wasn't cruel enough to let that happen, he'd make sure she didn't get seen by many people. Somehow. But a little fear should help jump start her brain. And he could give herself chances to earn her shorts back outside of towns later. Misty thought of a question that was easy but not obviously easy. \"Okay, name one of the weakness that psychic types have.\"</span></div></div>",

( The side- tracked chapter off screen) <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAccording to the book, the types of Pokemon that psychic Pokemon had a disadvantage against were not only not easily influenced by the powers of a psychic Pokemon, but they (ironically) were, in a sense, phobias that some people had. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd the most notable weakness was..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ghost types..\" Ash answered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMisty sighed in relief; \"Correct..\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh then promptly got her down by climbing on the Rock and using both hands to pry the panties from the part that the waistband was hooked onto leaving her dangling from his hands about a foot off the ground. \"See you can be a great teacher! I was able to remember what you said the other day!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Th-thanks..\" Misty said with a bit of bashfulness from her praise. \"Um, does that mean I'll get my shorts back?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh don't worry, you will..\" Ash said, proceeding to slowly climb down the rock, pulling Misty along with him until they were back on the ground. \"But first, I need to get a water type for the Pewter City gym..\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess that's.. Fair..?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Though how the heck are we gonna find one?\" Ash asked <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMisty replied \"I'm sure we'll find one if we look around the forest\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great in the meantime, how's about you took a break from walking as a reward?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait.. Dont' you m-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh suddenly got behind her, and took two handfuls of the panties's fabric, proceeding to HOIST the girl off her feet once again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know what I said.. Since I want to be a Pokemon master, I should be the one to lead the search, if I make a mistake you can just tell me, In the mean time.. I suggest you just ''hang tight' \"..</span></div></div>",

We should be able to find at least one water type around there.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMisty groaned. \"<i>At least I'll be getting my shorts back before town.</i>\" After a few minutes of walking, and Misty's groans of discomfort, they did manage to find the pond Ash had mentioned.

He didn't REALLY plan on spanking Misty, he just said that to get her butt moving, and to have a laugh. Still, he had to admire her will to never let up in her search. It was a sign of her potential as a trainer, Just the right kind of mentor he required for guidance and practice for him to be on the right path. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the meantime, Misty was still searching underwater and holding breath all the while, now at the deeper part of the pond, now at a deeper part of the lake.. Naturally she came up for air for a bit since her lung capacity wasn't exactly superhuman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the surface, she was flooking around at the floor of the pond, when she spotted a round wriggling object.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she swam closer, she saw it was a Poliwag, wriggling about and trying to get free from something..<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApparently the poor little thing's tail was caught in something while trying to get some Salveyo weed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so she dived down, and swam towards the tadpole Pokemon, and began getting the little guy loose. Of course as it turns out, he was actually a she.. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyway, after working together with her, Ash helped the tadpole Pokemon get her tail free.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey both went up for air, where the Poliwag jumped on her shoulder and gave a peck on her cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're welcome..\" Misty chuckled.<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh grinned to himself, impressed that Misty found a water Pokemon in under a minute.. But just as he was about to go congratulate her, however, he noticed something moving in the water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon a closer look, Ash realized that, judging from the horn, it was a wild Goldeen.. And a BIG one at that. The Pokemon also seemed to be swimming rather aggressively towards the trainer and the Poliwag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"MISTY, BEHIND YOU!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"PIKA PI!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMisty heard Ash and Pikachu's cries, and turned around to see the territorial fish swimming right at her, intending on stabbing her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully Misty managed to avoid this, only for her underwear to get caught and tangled up on the fish's horn. As a result, the big goldeen hoisted Misty over its head in the air, thrashing and swimming about in an attempt to.get the squealing trainer off.</span></div></div>",

Really, how many times does that happen? \"Guuuyyys, help!\" Please!\" Her struggling just seemed to be further irritating the fish Pokemon that she found herself at the mercy of. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Poliwaaaaaag!\" Fortunately, salvation was at ha-er fin. With a loud cry, the newly befriended Poliwag was returning the favor Misty had done her and blasting the Goldeen with a well aimed water gun. While not very effective at damaging the angry Pokemon, the blast of water did manage to push it back while tearing it's horn free from Misty's undies... aaaannnnd slightly tear the girl's panties as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEh, could have been worse. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the Goldeen now swimming away a muttering a series of irritated golf, gold, goldeen\"'s while diving underwater, Misty swam back over toward where her companion's were on dry land. All while unaware that her damaged undies were starting to fall off of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whew, that was close. Thanks for the save little guy.\" Misty said as she gave the Poliwag an affectionate pat on the head. \"You see that trainer over there\" Misty said pointing at Ash. \"He needs a water Pokemon and I think you would be a great partner to him. What do you say?\" The Poliwag gave a cheerful tone. \"I'll take that as a yes.\"   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh, meanwhile, was looking at Misty with a bit of pride. \"<i>Wow Misty... You'er amazing.</i>\" His admiration stop however, he then noticed a bit of cloth next to Misty in the water. \"Uh, Misty, is that what I think it is?\" He could feel the laughter bubbling up inside him at the thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe trainer turned to her side and saw what he was referring to. It looked to be a pair of torn panties. \"<i>Wait a minute...</i>\" Realization dawned on her. \"AHHHHH!\" Even faster than she had rushed into the water, the embarrassed girl grabbed her ruined panties and shoved both of her hands below the water and in front of her crotch while the raven-head on land burst out laughing. \"Uhhhhh, Ash, could you grab me some more underwear from my bag. And give me a little privacy.\" Her face was officially the reddest it had been since meeting her new student.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hahahahehe. Yeah, yeah, Keep you shorts on.

Earlier you said I'd be getting my shorts back, but now I'm down to just underwear and bra!

She knew she'd probably still be getting wedgies, but at least there was a chance it might have to her getting to keep her panties and butt covered more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh decided to cut off her protests quickly however. \"First of all...\" He said while griping her waistband at the front before giving a quick yank just strong enough to hurt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, wait, don- OW!\" he pulled harder to silence her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No interrupting. Okay?\" she nodded and he stopped pulling as hard, causing her to sigh in relief. \"Now then, I never said when you'd be getting them back. Second, I'm not giving you the rest of your clothes back yet because of the next exercise I have for you.\" At this point, he let go of her panties entirely, caused her to sag to her knees. \"You're going to need to help me find out Poliwag's what attacks she can do and has learned. With me so far?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill on her knees, Misty gave a frantic nod. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, now here's how this will work: no matter what, you aren't getting your shorts back until just, and I mean JUST, before we reach Pewter City. However, I'm going to rate you on how well you help me train with Poliwag. Do good enough, and you can have everything except you shorts back for the rest of the trip to the city. mess up, and you'll be making the rest of the trip over there with just your bra and undies.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMisty's face was blushing at the thought. This boy seemed determined to keep her in as much of an embarrassing state as possible. Which was the point really. As Ash was learning, Misty seemed to do her best with high stakes. \"Alright, so uh, where should I start?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh smiled as he stepped around behind her. Grabbing her panties from the back now, he hauled her back to her feet as she groaned in discomfort. \"Find out the basic attacks first and make sure to have her aim out over the water, where the attacks would cause the least amount of harm since the water can't get hurt and any random water types that pop up wouldn't likely to get very hurt by another water attack.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so the practice began.

What?!\" Her panties were just slightly above the middle of her back now. \"ow! Ow! OW!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing, he answered, \"I told you you'd be keeping that atomic in for the trip over to the city.\" Her waistband was just reaching her shoulders. \"I let you have a small break while I got a Poliwag, but now it's back to your wedgie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AH! Come on! Is that AH really ne-OW-cessary?!\" Misty said wincing<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few more seconds, he just managed to get her panties over her forehead again and snapped them in place. \"Yep!\" he cheered, satisfied with his work. \"Now we can get moving.\" Then much like he had this morning, he gave her backside a quick slap to rush her forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so began the hour and half trek to Pewter City. Every step slicing Misty's panties further into her butt. The girl would have made for quite the sight if anyone had spotted them on the way over: shortsless with her undies wedgied over her head, wincing with every step she took. Thinking over her situation, Misty felt both worry and (strangely enough) pride. Oh sure, most of her dignity was now gone, but she was happy in helping Ash improve as a trainer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, a part of her worried about how things were going. Ash definitely had a \"unique\" method of learning, and something told her he wasn't going to let up anytime soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like we're just about there Misty.\" Her thoughts were interrupted by his words as she looked ahead to see the city in the distance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Does this mean I can... uh...\" A part of her was nervous to ask, afraid of punishment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily for her, he just giggled and tossed her, her shorts. \"Better get those on before someone else sees you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat certainly got a reaction from her as she realized the odds of being seen had increased now that the city was so close. before even removing her atomic wedgie, the girl had already gotten her shorts on. As she unhooked the underwear from her head and it started to snap back down, she was started as Ash grabbed it midway and pulled. \"Hey, what's the deal?!\" She frantically tried to think of anything she might have done wrong. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just something I want to try.\" he said as he continued hiking her legholes up her back until they reached her upper back. Then, after stuffing her stretched panties under her shirt to hide, he then undid her bra and pulled the straps through legholes before redoing the bra putting her in a permanent wedgie. A bra-connection wedgie. \"There, that should keep your wedgie in without exposing you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMisty groaned in despair as she realized that her butt was still in trouble. \"Why meeeeee...?\"</span></div></div>",

Not enough to give a NUCLEAR wedgie of course, though just enough to get the point across that she was losing.. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPoliwag honestly didn't know why her new trainer was so interested in tugging on his companion\u2019s underpants.. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPikachu natrually filled her in on everything that had before they met up with each other.. Though of course, he added that he had next to no idea why Ash would even choose <b>WEDGIES</b> of all things, but he supposed it was just his nature.. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPoliwag naturally gave Ash a look of confusion, but naturally shrugged her... Body.....?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<i>Eh, perhaps she'd try to learn the appeal of wedgie giving when she evolved into a Poliwhirl.</i>\u201d</span></div></div>",

As Pikachu's stomach growling indicated..<br>\r\n~~~~~~~~~~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh stood at the door, breathing in and out to calm his nerves.. He knew if he wanted to do well in his first gym battle, he'd need to keep his cool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't stop him from having butterfrees form in his belly, but he was willing to press forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe worked hard, and had Misty as a great coach. He could do this.. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter opening the doors, the two humans and two Pokemon walked into the gym, where across from them, stood a teen boy, a couple years older than them and taller. With rather squinty eyes, tan skin (almost brown really), a green vest, an orange shirt, and brown pants. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Name's Brock.. Have you come to challenge the Pewter City Gym?\" The teen asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, my name's Ash Ketchum from Pallet Town, and I'm here for my first gym battle!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Straight to the point I see..\" Brock said with a small smile; \"Well, Ash, let's see how well you do.. Hope you're ready.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh nodded, as he grabbed Pidgeotto's pokeball, and brought him out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrock raised an eyebrow at the odd choice.. Something told him the rookie had something up his sleeve, so he knew he'd best not get overconfident despite the type advantage Brock's Pokemon had, especially since ground type moves wouldn't work on Pidgeotto.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Geodude, your'e up!\" Brock threw the pokeball containing the small pebble like Pokemon with muscular arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Geo!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMisty looked on at the two.. Win or lose, she knew that despite being a rookie, Ash will proven himself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Ash's plan for victory had been relatively simple. Figuring that the gym leaders wouldn't use his strongest Pokemon first, The idea was to at least soften said Pokemon up with Pidgeotto if his flying type wasn't strong enough to beat it. Then Poliwag would be able to clear a win easily enough and have a better chance against whatever Brock's second Pokemon would be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis 'lessons' with Misty had definitely gotten him to start thinking more. <i>To think, I might have actually tried to win with Pikachu before.</i>  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment, everything was quiet, until Brock made the first move: \"Geodude, use tackle!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"geo!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe battle was on as Ash quickly had Pidgeotto dodge before returning fire with a gust attack to try and knock Geodude back. However t<b>he rock was undeterred!</b> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaturally, Geodude retaliated by throwing a stone at the bird, which he avoided, only to receive a Mega Punch to the face, sending the bird reeling until he regained his senses and up righted himself. Geodude naturally grabbed him with his burly hands and got ready for a Seismic Toss, only to be countered with a Peck Attack to the face. While the bird did manage to get away, the peck to Geodude's face only annoyed the rock type Pokemon rather than do much damage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPidgeotto avoided another tackle attack, and transitioned to using Double Team. As he flew at Geodude, his entire body had a white outline around it. And as a result, the bird created multiple copies of himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeodude attempted a tackle, but phased through one of them, leading to him receiving a blow from above, courtesy of Pidgeotto using Quick attack, which allowed him to move at a speed that allowed him to be almost invisible, made more effective when Pidgeotto used the momentum while he focused the full force at his beak while lunging, with the smaller surface area allowing the impact to be more condensed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rock type recovered after landing on the field, and went underground using dig. Geodude came out of the ground, finding that Pidgeotto had flown almost all the way to the ceiling, leaving him unable to get any higher. Thus he was ready to use a Mega Punch once again.. And if Pidgeotto tried going down, he'd only find himself getting intercepted by Geodude.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut what he did next made Ash grin with impressment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter hovering back down a bit, Pidgeotto deftly moved to the side while using both talons to grab Geodude by each one of his muscular forearms, using both his side-flap AND Geodude's momentum to start dive bombing to gain even greater speed. Emphasis on speed, as this tactic required a great deal of it, otherwise Geodude would be able to recover and retaliate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike a rocket of feathers and stone, the two sped downwards until Pidgeotto gained sufficient velocity. After pulling up back into a sort of loop, Pidgeotto didn't let the momentum and speed go to waste as he promptly chucked the rock Pokemon into the side of one of the largest rock formations on the field, leaving a Geodude's sized hole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe battle grew intense with both Pokemon starting to look tired, the unexpected happened. Pidgeotto had just dodged again and Ash had called out for a whirlwind attack to push Geodude further while using Geodude's momentum to get a better result, but got something unexpected instead...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pidgeoooo!\" As the bird flapped his wings, the gusts of wind suddenly gathered around until it formed a sort of cyclone of sorts.. A <b>literal</b> whirlwind if you will, proceeding to let it engulf Geodude. The centrifugal forces being too much, as the tornado promptly slammed him into the field, hard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDexter obviously voiced his commentary. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><b>Twister. A dragon type move. This move allows the user to send a tornado at an opponent</b></u>. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah, I didn't know you had that attack!\" Said Ash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrock also looked surprised as he returned Geodude to his pokeball for a well earned rest. \"That's the thing about being a trainer I suppose. Pokemon are just full of surprises.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I guess you're right.\" Turning to his Pidegotto, who had collapsed to the ground in exhaustion, though he was still awake and covered in bruises underneath his feathers..<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh opted to let him rest rather than send him into the next fight. \"Get some rest pal, you've earned it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPidgeotto chirped back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow it was time for round two. Poliwag vs Onyx. As Brock watched Poliwag stepped up to fight, he suddenly felt himself start to chuckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, what's so funny?!\" Ash demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know why, but for just a second there, I had this weird feeling you were going to try and use Pikachu.\" That thought suddenly had both Ash and Misty laughing as well. After all, using a small electric mouse to fight a giant snake made out of stone? What sort of idiotic, completely insane fool would do that?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyway, before it began, Ash breathed in and out in order to calm himself. As he did, Poliwag looked at him. She nodded in reassurance that she'd give it all she had, giving the trainer her faith in his skills as a battler.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right..\" Ash grinned; \"Let's get this thing started!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPoliwag started off with a Water Gun, only for Onix to evade with surprising quickness for a Pokemon his size. Likely, this was because of his experiences in gym battles, allowing him to compensate for whatever disadvantage he'd find himself in, especially opponents that were water type Pokemon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn retaliation, Onix attempted to slap Poliwag with his tail, only for the water type to hit the dirt. While the blow didn't connect in the slightest after she ducked, the strong breeze from how fast it was certainly blew the smaller Pokemon away about a couple meters back. Thankfully, she managed to land on her stubby little feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter an attempt to swipe at her with his tail again, she hopped back to get some distance while also launching another water gun. Onix naturally avoided this yet again, and promptly began charging, or would that be slithering?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPoliwag got out of there, knowing that meeting the attack head on was stupid. She could try to run away until he got tired and make himself easer for her to finish him off with a Water Gun or two. But she and her trainer knew that Onix probably wouldn't even tire out that easily.. So instead, this battle would have to be done similarly with Pidgeotto and Geodude's battle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully, Poliwag had plenty of places to hide, due to her size, how big the field was, and the plentiful amount of rocks there were on the field!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Onix went past one of the biggest, he groaned a bit in pain as the side of his head felt a forceful shot of water pelt it. Turning his head to where it came from, he slowly moved towards what looked to be the same rock formation Geodude smashed into, only for the other side of his head to feel the same shot of water that hit him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a grimace, Onix turned his head and looked around. Brock knew that Onix's size was a bit of a double edged sword, since it made him a larger target, which is why he had Onix use Dig.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Poliwag looked around for Onix, she felt a rumbling, about 4 meters to her right. She immediately started running again, only to feel the shockwave resulting from Onix suddenly popping out of the ground in front of her, knocking her back and hitting one of the boulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe got to her stubby feet the best that a Pokemon with no arms could, and used her tail to help shake off the dizziness. Only for Onix to come back up again, this time from behind. Poliwag was thrown like a ragdoll, though she landed on her feet this time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis didn't look good at all, since Onix was now playing the game of guerrilla warefare with Poliwag. Since Onix himself now had a place to hide, there was no telling when he'd pop up again, and he'd more than likely intercept Poliwag again if she tried to run. He wasn't sure if Poliwag could even TAKE much more from this..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Wait a minute</i>.. Ash thought to himself as the gears in his head turned... Until he hit upon an idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Poliwag was gathering her senses, she heard her trainer call out to her. Telling her to run and wait until he said otherwise. Knowing that her trainer had a trick up his sleeve, she began running as fast her little feet could carry her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she felt the rumbling in front of her, Ash told her to jump into the air as hard as she could and use Hypnosis. She did so, jumping into the air surprisingly high (likely due to her frog like physiology). As Onix's large head popped up again as if he were playing \"Whack-A-Mole\" , Poliwag's eyes were glowing blue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the rock Pokemon made eye contact with Poliwag, his eyes became dull.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith Onix now in a trance, Poliwag took the initiative and began pelting him with Water Gun after Water Gun, until he was looking like he could collapse. With him just standing there, Poliwag knew this was her chance, hopping onto her opponent's tail and running up his body until she got to the head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe used it as a platform to hop away, opening her mouth while in mid-air and using Mud Shot, hurling multiple round globs of mud at high speed towards Onix...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the mud made contact with Onix, Poliwag landed on a pillar of stone, panting a bit as she watched the toppled giant crash to the floor. She was surprised, but glad all the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe little thing was so exhausted she was actually happy to get some rest inside her Pokeball..<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd just like that?... Ash had effectively won his very first gym battle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Tomorrow because Ash definitely wanted Pidgeotto and Poliwag to join in on the fun, and Misty had recommended that he drop those two off at a Pokemon Center so that they could rest up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack in their, Ash was happily staring at his first gym badge while Misty looked at him with both amusement and a hint of pride. Pride that he had taken her lessons to heart, and amusement because of just how transfixed he seemed by it. \"Glad to see you're enjoying your victory Ashy boy.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You bet I am!\" he said excitedly. \"My skills really improved thanks to you, but I still have a long way to go.\" .<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMisty just smirked. \"You'er worrying too much, with my skills as a mentor I'll make you unstoppable.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Still do need more training if I'm to get stronger and smarter as a trainer.\" He cautioned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah yeah, I know.\" she said waving off his concern. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Well, that's bad sign</i>. She didn't seem to be taking his concern very seriously. <i>Better do something about that.</i> Creeping up behind her, he reached his hand down the pack of her shorts, grabbing her panties and pulling hard. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gahhhhh! Oh come o-AH-on!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You only have yourself to blame for waving off my concern.\" he said while tugging harder and pulling her up off of the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Owww!, I'm so-ow-rry!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Little for that I'm afraid. Now: shorts off.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlushing, she complied and struggled to remove her shorts while he proceeded to destroy her butt with her underwear. First stretching the panties up over her head and then grabbing the legholes to wedgie her further, completely exposing her butt-cheeks in the process. By the time he was finished, Misty just groaned in agony while squirming after he tossed her back onto the bed. \"owhowowowowhowow! Okay, lesson learned.\" She gasped as a quick slap was delivered to her backside, letting out a quieter \"ow.\" That one actually hadn't been every hard. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, that means I'm sure you do your job right.\" his eyes traveled over her stretched out panties as a thought occurred to him. \"You know, you're definitely going to be needing some more undies soon. What do you say we go out and get you some.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?!\" Having to go underwear shopping was something she realized that she would probably need to do if she was going to handle Ash's... 'unorthodox' learning methods. But going underwear shopping WITH him. Correction, going underwear shopping with A BOY! Not something that any girl really, looked forward to.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I could just get you some myself, but then you'd have no say at all in what you get.

Yo-you're joking? R-right? Right!\" Misty hadn't worn underoos since she was seven. The switch over to plain panties was made after an incident when a kid had decided to pants her at the playground. An action that earned plenty of laughter from everyone around. When Misty had later gotten home, she had begged her family to buy her more mature undies in the hopes that it could reduce future humiliations. The slight improvement that was plain white panties was the best they would agree to.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Afraid not Misty. This is for your own good.\" Well, her own good and <i><u>his own</u></i> entertainment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrantic, the poor girl demanded to know, \"How can this possibly be for my own good?!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing, Ash explained, \"because Misty, you need more discipline. You couldn't even sleep in your wedgie when the point was to learn what Caterpie felt like after you insulted him.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe reminder of that mistake caused Misty to suddenly find an interest in looking down at her feet, an action that made her wince slightly as her head pulled her panties just a bit tighter. \"I-I, know but, why-\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimple: since the threat of losing your shorts wasn't enough, I'm just going to have to up the consequences for bad behavior.\" Suppressing his delighted smirk, he added, \"In this case, upping your embarrassment. Now get your panties off your head and start packing, we've got places to go and underoos to buy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoing as he said, and changing into a pair of less stretched panties once he looked away, Misty began to think over her current options while packing. On one hand, she could suck it up, go back to wearing underoos, and pray that no one other than Ash ever saw her in them. Even limiting it just him though was mortifying. It would be embarrassing enough with another girl seeing her like that, but a BOY! Maybe I could talk him into a lighter punishment. she thought. Of course, he may just see that as a sign that she's trying to run away from the consequences of her action. Even if she was starting to think he was a little crazy, she didn't want to risk making him too disappointed in her and think she wasn't a worthy mentor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat to do, what to do?</span></div></div>",

As they fled, Misty was the first to speak. \"Great, now what do we do!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlightly dumbfounded, Ash replied, \"Your asking me?\" The two hung a sharp right around a tree,; too sharp for the Rhydon, causing it to briefly tumble over and let the two trainers put a bit more distance between them and it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're the one who wants to be a Pokemon master, might as well give you a chance!\" In truth, she was just too panicked to think straight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately, Ash did have an idea. \"They can't climb, right?\" he asked while looking at the trees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMisty beamed at him. \"Now there's an idea.\" The two quickly climbed up one of the thicker looking trees, Misty having only a little trouble as her bare legs got lightly scraped by the bark. Not that she minded much given the bigger problem present. With them both now out of its reach, the Rhydon began circling down below. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhy it wasn't trying a ranged attack yet, they didn't know, but didn't waste much time thinking about it. Perhaps it was just surprised at their course of action. Whatever the case, Misty quickly released her Staryu onto one of the tree branches and had it attack with a water gun. Deciding that its intended targets might be more trouble than they were worth, the Rhydon opted to leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs our two trainers were calming down, Ash asked, \"So what do you think that was about? I mean I don't know much about them, but shouldn't it have been harder to drive it off.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEqually confused, Misty answered back, \"Beats me. Maybe we got to close to wherever it was living and it figured we were far enough away now not to bother attacking more.\" in all honesty, she didn't want to think about it too much. \"Best not to look a gift Rapidash in the mouth. \"Let's just get down from here and get moving.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a short laugh, Ash agreed and the two started climbing down when Misty...</span></div></div>",

She closed them for a while only to slowly reopen them to find the Rhydon close to her face looking into her eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMisty was shocked by this but as she looked into the Pokemon's eyes she began to clam down. \"Ahmm... hey... there...\" Misty was very confused, she then proceeded to reach her hand out and placed on the Rhydon's head which made the pokemon pur. Misty turned her head to Ash and Pikachu who were also confused. Ash even had a pokeball in his hand ready for a battle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he could say or do anything the Rhydon then reached out, griped Misty's waistband and unhooked her from her wedgie. The Rhydon even placed Misty on her feet as gently as possible which made Misty grateful. \"Wow! Thanks! You'er actually pretty nice for a big scary looking Rhydon.\" The Rhydon gave a cheerful smile and it waged it's tail. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, it then looked in the sky and gave a worried look, all most as though it realized it was about to be late for something. \"Hey what's wrong?\" Misty asked as she turned to look to the sky. The Rhydon looked at the sky and then Misty. It turned to Ash and Pikachu. Who saw the Rhydon making an 'I'm really sorry\" expression. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't see anythin-AAAAAAHHH!!!\" Misty shrieked in pain as the Rhydon yanked her into the air by her underwear. It hooked the waist band to its horn and began to run into the forest with the squealing girl. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Ash and Pikachu looked at each other dumbfound by what they so, before realizing they should probably chase after the Rhydon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n----------------------------------- <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRhydon ran as fast as it could, ducking under trees, jumping over logs and bushes, a ride that turned Misty's already painful wedgie into agonizing butt torture. \"OW!OW!

The Rhydon looked at Misty with sorrowful look and tried to unhook her waistband from her horn. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly for the waistband to *RIP* and cause Misty to fall face first to the forestfloor. \"Oof.. of courses it would rip now.\" Misty said to herself as she got on her feet and unpicked the aftermath wedgie.

The babies however, responded by coughing which caused the Rhydon to actually tear up. Misty slowly walked to the litter and placed her hand on their head. \"Holy- Their really warm. Do they have a fever?\" Misty asked the Rhydon to which it nodded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is why you chased us. You wanted our help. Don't worry I promise Ash and I will help your babies get better.\" Misty said. The Rhydon's face beamed with a smile and proceed to give Misty a hug. \"Can't.... Breath...\" Misty said as she squeezed. The Rhydon let go of her realizing what it was doing to her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Misty! Where are you!?\" Misty heard and then she walked out of the cave to find Ash and Pikachu. \"Misty! Are you alright? Where's the Rhydon?\" Ash asked concerned. \"I'm fine Ash, I just need a new pair of underwear. But you need to see this.\" Misty said as she took Ash's arm and guild him into the cave. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------------- <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMisty showed Ash the baby Rhyhorns and explained to him that the Rhydon didn't mean harm and wanted their help. Ash looked at the baby rhydons and from the looks of them they really needed help. While Ash looked at the Rhyhorns, Misty changed into a new pair of underwear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We have to help them Misty!\" Ash said clutching his fists. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry Ash we will. But first take out your pokedex and scan the Rhyhorns\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh wasn't sure how that would help but did so. The Pokedex scanned the Rhyhorns and found out what was wrong.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no! They've been poisoned!\" Ash said worried. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They must have been attacked by beedrill or something.\" Misty though. \"What do we do?\" Ash asked. \"They need antidotes. Antidotes are items that can be used to cure poisoned Pokemon. Luckily I have some with me.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that Misty took out her antidotes and used them on the Rhyhorns. \"There that should help them\" Misty said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd she was right. Almost instantly the antidotes took affect and cured the Rhyhorns. They were however, still a bit weak and needed some rest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Rhydon jumped with joy, hugging and squeezing the two trainers. \"Your... Welcome...\" said Ash, \"Too.. Tight...\" Misty said. After the tight hug Misty, seeing as their work here was done, said it was time to leave. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright Ash lets get moving\" Misty said as she walked forward. Ash on the other hand was a bit hesitate to leave. \"Hey Misty, Can we set camp here till tomorrow?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMisty looked at Ash surprised \"Why Ash?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want to make sure the Rhyhorns are strong and healthy. So could we please set up camp here?\" Ash asked. Misty gave a smile and responded \"Sure Ash, lets camp here till tomorrow.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n------------                        <br>\r\nNightfall was about dawn on the group as Ash, Misty, Pikachu and the Rhydon had berries and fruits for dinner. \"Alright Ash, we better get some firewood if we want to stay warm for the night.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right.\" Ash responded and both went into the woods to get firewood. As they looked and collected firewood they both began to chat to past the time. \"You really helped those Rhyrons Misty.\" Ash said. \"Oh, it was nothing, your pokedex did help us find what was wrong.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah but if it wasn't for your knowledge, they could've suffered worse. what I mean is your a great mentor and all..\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMisty blushed a bit at his comment \"Thanks Ash and, aside from the wedgies, your great student.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not my fault you look better in an atomic wedgie.\" Ash replied jokingly. Misty rolled her eyes at the statement. \"It would honestly look better on you.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh stopped and raised his eyebrow. \"Oh really Misty?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMisty stopped and got nervous. \"a-I-a-I-I was-a- just joking!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh smirked and looked at Pikachu who was walking beside them. \"Pikachu you be the judge.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n------------------ <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Rhydon waited for its friends to come back. It began to wage its tail as it saw them make their way back. Though it was then confused when it saw Misty. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMisty held the firewood and walked wincing with every step she took as walked in an atomic wedgie. With every step she took she could feel her panties slicing  deeper into her butt. \"See even Pikachu thinks you look better in it.\" Ash said he gave slap to Misty's buttcheek causing her to yelp.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey made it to the camp site where Ash showed Misty to Rhydon. \"Hey Rhydon, doesn't Misty look better like this.\" He said presenting Misty.\" Rhydon looked at Ash confused and used one of its fingers to undo Misty's wedgie. Which she sighed is relief. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh rolled his eyes and shrugged his shoulders. \"Guess you don't get the joke. Oh well.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh and Misty then proceed to set the fire and hit the sleeping bags. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh put his sleeping bag so he could have a clear view of the rhyhorns. Misty watched Ash and smiled. \"<i>I things considered, I'm glad to be your mentor Ash. I will make a great trainer.</i>\" Misty though to herself as she dozed off.          </span></div></div>",

Kinda of like how she would in 3... 2... 1... \"What was that?\" she asked as she turned toward the bush and Ash stopped climbing halfway down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ursa.\" came a voice with a high pitch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh please no.\" said Misty shaking in her hanging wedgie. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs luck would have it, it was not a dreaded Ursaring that came out, but rather an adorable little Teddiursa. One that didn't seem to be very bothered by Misty sawing over it as hung by her panties. \"Whew.\" said Ash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, for a second or two I thought we were in danger. Now get me down and let's get moving before this little cutie's mother shows up.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so they did just that, freeing Misty fro her wedgie and quickly getting themselves back on their path in the hops of avoiding any more fearsome Pokemon. By now, Misty had completely forgotten about trying to avoid getting underoos. Ash, however, had not forgotten about getting them when they reach town and began making plans for when they arrive. \"So, first things first when we get to town, get Misty some underoos.\" Thinking some more, he tacked on, \"make sure the fit is at least a little tight on her.\" After that, they could ask around for safe areas to look for a water type that Ash would be needing. Because there was no way he planned on accidentally wandering into more danger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><u><b>1 Hour later</b></u></div> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIts amazing how fast you can move when you're worried about danger. The two of them turned an hour and a half trip into just an hour. They had been in such a rush that Misty almost went towards the city without her shorts. Thankfully, Ash was kind enough to stop that from happening. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlushing as she remembered her state of undress, she thanked him and hurriedly put her shorts on while hoping no one would see. Before she could buttom them up, however, Ash grabbed the waistband of her panties and started pulling on them. \"AH! Hey, what are you doing?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just give me a minute.\" he said as he continued hiking her legholes up her back until they reached her upper back. Then, after stuffing her stretched panties under her shirt to hide, he then undid her bra and pulled the straps through legholes before redoing the bra putting her in a permanent wedgie. A bra-connection wedgie. \"There. Just because you're getting your shorts back, doesn't mean you're getting out of your punishments. Now come on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"R-right.\" said the young trainer as she struggled to walk with her wedgie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We've still gotta get you those underoos.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMisty froze up as she finally remembered that and debated if she should risk making him mad by trying to talk him out of it.</span></div></div>",

She so glad to have her shorts put it on first, in a gentle fashion as to not irritate her sore red buttocks, before undoing her wedgie. She sighed with relief, finally having something to cover her. She was about to undo her wedgie, however Ash walked over and suddenly hefted her up and laid her face down over his shoulder with the upper body to the rear (not giving her enough time to even take off the atomic wedgie as a result). <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-hey wait a minute, what gives?!\" Misty asked, her face turning pink from how he was carrying her, with her head down, and buttocks pointing up and to the front. As much as she wanted to squirm out, Ash wouldn't allow this, considering he was using his right arm to securely hold her legs at the hollow of her knees. \"I thought I would be given a break before the-?!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You thought wrong there Misty-girl...\" Ash interrupted as he casually walked while he carried her; \"You putting on the shorts was just me allowing you to prep for what I have in mind...\"<br>\r\n--------- <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Minutes of searching, later....<br>\r\n</b><br>\r\n-- <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMisty's upper body dangled forward from gravity pulling down on her with her arms by her sides, thanks to her having been hung by the seat of her shorts from a branch five feet above Ash as he finished climbing all the way back down from the tree and looked up at her with a satisfied grin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe winced quite a bit, as not only was the material of her shorts digging so deep into her crack that her sore red buttcheeks were exposed, but her panties were still pulled over her head. As a result, she was truly experiencing two different wedgies at the same time. Didn't help that from the way her back was pulled into a bit of a curve, due to the atomic wedgie, it only made things more uncomfortable. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There... I think you'll have enough time on your hands to finally learn to open your ear holes.\" Ash said; \"In the meantime... I'm just gonna go and train my Pokemon for a while. Pikachu'll be coming with me so he doesn't try and get you down again... Hope you have fun~\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd like that, Ash walked off with Pikachu, leaving Misty to think about the poor choices that lead to this.</span></div></div>",

The lake's water smelled amazing, it was clean as can be, the color was almost like a sapphire that melted into a liquid form, and the best part of all? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey had the area to themselves, considering that there were no other humans but Misty and Ash in the area. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right Misty, now that we're here, let me show you what I got ya!\" Ash said as he held the paper bag up and opened it for Misty to see inside. And what Misty saw inside of there was something that made her jaw drop rather comically as she took the article of clothing out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nActually, 'swimwear' would be more appropriate, considering that what she held in her hand was in fact a bikini colored blue like the sea with bubble patterns. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I honestly thought of you and your water Pokemon when I saw this, believe it or not!\" Ash chuckled as he closed the bag; \"Anyway, I'll just let'a change into those bad boys in private...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Th-thanks...\" Misty stammered as she looked around until she found the perfect spot to change in private. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh whistled to himself as he twirled his mallet around, obviously trying to pass the time while he waited for his companion/mentor. Pikachu looked at the weapon in question, rather curious as to how Ash could carry that thing around in his backpack without being affected by its weight (or fit it in there, but that's beside the point). <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, considering that this was the same raven-head boy that heaved Misty off the ground by her underwear really easily, than it should come to no surprise that he'd be able to easily twirl his mallet around like a baton. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of Misty... she walked out from behind some shrubbery, clad in only her new bikini while carrying her clothes back to the spot where they were and placed them near her backpack.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, they actually look sharp on you!\" Ash said as he put his mallet away and walked over to Misty to look over her. \"Definitely made the right call...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Th-thanks...\" Misty said with a blushing smile as she rubbed the back of her neck. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyway, you go on ahead and begin your search. In the meantime, I'll change into a swimsuit of my own and meet up with you, sound good?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, uh, yeah, sure!\" Misty said, surprising the urge to turn pink from the thought of seeing Ash in a swimsuit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right... Better get your butt moving Misty...\" Ash said as he walked off to find some privacy, though not before giving her a friendly swat on the aforementioned butt to help Misty get started. It worked of course, with Misty hopping a bit while holding her blue clad cheeks from the unexpected smack. Misty then proceeded with moving towards the bank, being careful as to not potentially scare some of the lake's residents.</span></div></div>",

Fortunately, it did not take her long to remember that she had a search to begin. <i>Hmmm, where to start?</i> Unsure of where to begin looking, She swam a bit farther into the water and began looking around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><b>2 minutes later...</b></u> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMisty swam far enough back toward the back so that she could stand in the more shallow water, wondering how to continue. Looking out over the the water, she began thinking out loud. \"Maybe I should try...\" *SLAP*. \"Gah!\" Misty jumped as she felt a hand strike her backside hard and would have fallen over if not for the hand that grabbed her shoulder and steadied her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hahaha, ah, too funny.\" Ash giggled behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRubbing her bottom, she said, \"No it wasn't. And did you really have to do tha-ehhh...\" The girls's throughts were shutdown as she saw the boy in his yellow speedo swimsuit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just take it as a lesson on being more aware of your surrounding.

Although the best place to see one in the wild would be a lake as perfect looking as this one.\" Misty answered, still sounding confused and uncertain as to why this one was following Ash. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh thought for a moment before saying, \"Well, if they're usually urban, then do you think that means she wants to go into town or something?\" Thinking again, he looked at the Vaporeon and asked, \"Are you bored here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gave a nod and a quick \"vay\" in answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh's smile widened, \"So do you wanna come with us?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gave another \"vay\" and what seemed to be a shrug in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMisty just stared in bewilderment. A bored, wild Vapereon. I mean, I guess it could happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh, however, was thrilled. \"Alright! Looks like I've got a new friend!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Once they get out of the lake, what happens next?</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

First of all, seeing as we're still at the lake, we won't be changing out of our swimsuits. Think about it, we can study Vaporeon's moves in the water where it will be at it's best. Right?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fair enough Ash. Plus it sounds pretty fun!\" Misty said with excitment while unpicking her wedgie; \"What's the second thing?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll also be testing how well you focus.\" Ash said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, how'll you be doing that?\" Misty asked, with a raised eyebrow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a surprise you'll just have to wait and see...\" Ash said with a wink and a grin as the boy tussled the girl's red hair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving being to excited to study a water Pokemon, Misty chuckled as she tried to fight off the boy's playful hands. \"All right, so don't tell me! But I promise I'll give my teaching a 110%\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know...\" Ash said with his hands on his hips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd like that, Misty took off with Vaporeon back to the lake.

Rather than resisting or arguing, she tried to think of an attack to call out for Vaporeon, not noticing how the small Pokemon was staring at her and Ash with interest. Ash did though. <i>Come on, think of a move, any move.</i> \"Ugh, watergun!\" she called out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn response, Vaporeon looked up and blasted a strong stream of water into the air, making it briefly rain as Ash stopped pulling, but still held on. \"Okay, that's one down. Let's see what else she's got.\" A mischievous idea came to his mind. \"And I think I'll help you just for the next one.\" He yanked hard on Misty's bikini, lifting the now squeaking girl off the ground and turning her so that her butt now faced Vaporeon. \"Let's try for a tail whip!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVaporeon shouted her name as she charged forward struck her tail against Misty's backside just as Ash let go of her bikini, knocking her back onto to land. \"ahhhh owhowowow...\" she whimpered as she rubbed her wedgied and tail whipped butt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on Misty, we've got plenty more work to do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd work they did. Fortunately, the worst of the training session was over for Misty. Ash had continued pulling on her bimini, but only enough to make her squirm while they practiced with Vaporeon. And she did have a fairly nice arsenal.They soon discovered, with some aid from Ash's Pokedex, that Vaporeon could also use Helping hand, tackle, and quick attack. At one point, she had tried to demonstrate sand attack, at least it looked like she was trying sand attack, but didn't seem to have it down yet. No matter though, that could be the first thing they work on next time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well Misty, I'd say this was a productive use of our time. Wouldn't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep.\" she answered back. \"I'm just gonna go change back into my clothes.\" Just as she started to do so...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

However, Ash had mandated that she not put her shorts back on afterwards. \"You just look way better without them.\" he had said, making her embarrassment all the greater. She had the sinking feeling that, if he had things <b>completely</b> his way, she'd be wedgied and in nothing but a pair of underoos 24/7. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, there was nothing like a good night's sleep to refresh her after a such a crazy couple of days. And with the sun shining brightly into the room, it looked like this would be a good day. If she could be bothered to get out of bed. In the back of her mind, she could hear someone telling her to though. And what was that shaking feeling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I tried to be nice about it. Now we do it my way.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore her sleepy brain could think of a response, she suddenly felt herself being lifted up and experienced the, unfortunately, increasingly familiar feeling of her underwear being yanked upward. \"HuuaHHH! WhaHHHts going ahhhhhhn!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn her barely awake state, she panicked and started trying to scramble away, only to be pulled back by her undies and suddenly felt an arm go around her waist. \"No point in resisting Misty. You'll just make things worse.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A-aaaaaaaaash!\" she shrieked a bit as she felt her underwear being yanked up further while he held her close. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, I guess that's enough for now.\" having mercy, he let both her and her underwear go. \"But that's what you get for being a heavy sleeper. Anyways, I've already got breakfast set, so you should definitely eat up. And no shorts until you do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmbarrassed and helpless to fight back, she just gave a quiet \"yes sir.\" in response.</span></div></div>",

What was important at the moment was her pupil/companion, who she noticed stood still, with legs shaking, and no attempt at walking to the door being made. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMisty tugged on the shorter boy's sleeve to get his attention, which worked, as Ash turned around to face Misty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ash, listen... I can't say I know EXACTLY what's going on in your head, but if it's a voice telling you 'you're gonna screw up', than ignore it...\" Misty put a hand on his right shoulder; \"Right now, you just focus on what's in front of you, and remember all that training you've been through.

Their brief introduction had been quite pleasant, and Brock was looking forward to seeing what his opponent had in store for him. He wasn't sure what, but something told him that there was something special about this kid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first round saw Ash's Pidgeotto go up against Brock's Geodude. Pidgeotto, following Ash's commands, staid up high and moved quickly to avoid any attacks that Geodude sent up. Although sending out attacks that could do enough damage proved to be a bit more difficult, as Geodude seemed able to weather every Gust of wind sent at him, and moving in close for Peck quickly became too risky after the first two attempts. In a surprising turn of events though, Ash managed to wrap up the fight when Pidgeotto, rather than Gust, ended up sending out a Twister attack, knocking the rock type over and out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second round proved to be a bit surprising against Onix's endurance when faced against Vaporeon. The stone snake held up against the first water gun sent at it and immediately put Vaporeon on the defensive as it was forced to dodge. Ash had Vaporeon dodging left and right, and even using quick attack to rush away from an Iron Tail. It took several more well timed water gun attacks amidst frantic dodges to finally bring the mighty beast down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd just like that, Ash had earned his first gym badge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Misty and Ash were preparing to leave the gym, Brock stopped to congratulate the younger trainer again. \"...and I've gotta say, your Vaporeon, moves surprisingly fast. How did you get her to be that quick?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh rubbed the back of his neck and laughed awkwardly. \"Honestly, I think that's all her. I haven't really had the chance to train her for speed yet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrock nodded. \"Well, Pokemon can get a lot stronger on their own than we sometimes give them credit for.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, sometimes it's less about training Pokemon to be stronger and more about figuring out what they can already do and what the best way to do it is.\" Misty added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh took in this information, knowing that it would be useful later on.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><b>What happens next?</b></u></span></div></div>",

Until the three gasped when the man removed his beard and hat, to reveal that he looked almost EXACTLY like Brock, save for being much older, and bigger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I<b> KNEW</b> there was something familiar about him! </i>Misty thought to herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dad?!\" Brock said; \"What?

If I couldn't be good enough to use something other rock type Pokemon... Then what good could I be as the man you and your siblings look up to?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrock's fists clenched; \"So you left because you thought we'd all be better off without you?! Well, guess what?... That's the biggest load of <u><b>bullshit</b></u> I've ever heard! If we really were better off, than we wouldn't be asking ourselves when you'd come home! It doesn't matter whether or not you'd be good enough as a trainer! What mattered to us has always been you being there for us! As a father should! This gym and everyone living in it need you! I don't care how little you think of yourself, I won't let you walk away from your own family again! Not when they need you the most!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMisty, Pikachu, and Ash stood there, their mouths agape as they listened to Brock chewing out Flint. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Son...\" Flint struggled to find something to say until tears rolled down his cheeks as he looked at his eldest son; \"I don't see how you could still need me, even after my failure. Even after I <b>hurt</b> you and the other kids... I'm not just a failure as a trainer... I've failed you as a father.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think you haven't looked hard enough...\" Brock said, now with a more visibly relaxed posture. \"Maybe you failed as a trainer, but you still have a chance as a father. If you really want to make up for everything we went through. Just... Please come home...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...All right...\"<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe reunion between Brock's siblings and their father was, suffice to say, emotional.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlint apologized to everyone for leaving, promising to never leave the way he did again, with conviction in every syllable of his words. And everything settled down, he talked to Brock again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Son, I want to thank you and those kids for helping me snap out of my foolishness... You're growing to be a good, strong man. Which is why I want you to do what I never did...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dad, are you saying--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Brock...\" Flint said sternly; \"I still recall that you have a dream as a Pokemon breeder... And if you want to achieve it, then get out there and show what you're worth. You can't do that by staying here, because to deny you of your passion would be wrong. Besides... I think those kids could use your level-headedness.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrock looked at him with disbelief, but gave a small smile; \"I'll do it....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlint gave a smile of his own as he put a hand on his boy's shoulder; \"Good... I have a feeling, you're going be something great.\"<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrock met up with Ash and Misty, who were playing with Brock's younger siblings until they saw him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Brock told them about his talk with Flint, the two looked at each other with a surprised look on their face, then at the young gym leader.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, now that we've thought about it, I think we have room for our little group,\" Misty said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pika!\" Pikachu said as he leaped onto Ash's shoulders<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You said it, buddy!\" Ash said to his Pokemon, scratching him behind the ears.<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so, the duo had become a trio, as Brock, Misty, and Ash made their way from Pewter city to the next one.</span></div></div>",

You feeling okay?\" Ash asked as he walked in, closing the door behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm fine Ash... Just go and prepare for your gym battle!\" Misty said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You didn't sound fine then, and you don't now!\" Ash said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething was definitely wrong, considering Misty didn't tell him to take his pants off; \"If anything, you looked like you didn't want to go to the gym...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Misty, please talk to me! I wanna help with what's bugging you! You've been helping me so much, and now I want to return even a quarter of all you've done for me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMisty looked at the boy as he pleaded with her. After some thought, Misty got off the bed; \"Do you really wanna know?...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I won't stop asking until you do...\" Ash said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right I'll talk,\" Misty said  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But first things first, your undies...\" Ash said <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMisty sighed and nodded turning around and lifting up her yellow shirt so he could see the waistband of her panties. It didn't take long for her to feel Ash's fingers grip them, nor for her to squeal in discomfort as the boy hoisted her off the floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh sat across from Misty on a separate bed, while the girl in question was sitting with the back of her underpants pulled over her eyes and hooked under her nose. She winced a bit from the way her cotton dug into her crack but it didn't stop her from telling her story<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right... The reason I was against going to the gym is related to the reason I specialize in water Pokemon...\" Misty's voice trembled with hesitation; \"Um... Ever heard of the Sensational Sisters?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't they put on those shows with water Pokemon?' Ash said <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but they're also in charge of the Cerulean gym...\" Misty said; \"Which is why I have water pokemon... They're my older sisters...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh's jaw dropped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See... My relationship with them is strained... For a lack of a better word. Doesn't exactly help that a couple of people have compared me to them. They're oh so graceful and beautiful, whereas I'm the tomboy that wields a mallet and is only really good barely beating them at wedgie wars. Which is why I decided to run away and strike out on my own...\" Misty sighed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mist... I... Never realized that you've gone through that...\" Ash said, his demeanor softening. \".... You know what? The people that compare you with your sisters... They clearly haven't stopped to get to know you as I've been... First, you're an awesome water Pokemon trainer, probably even way better than your sisters! Second... You've been helping me grow as a trainer for the last few days. I don't know how I could've gone so far without your guidance! Heck, I'm surprised you saw anything worthwhile in me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd not that Ash would say it, but he actually was growing fond of Misty's tomboyish attitude. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite being in an atomic wedgie Misty smiled as she walked over and pulled him up into a hug; \"You have no idea how much I needed to hear that...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she did Ash then undid Misty's wedgie</span></div></div>",

The actual problem was, eh, well...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're seriously just handing over the badge?!\" Ash and Brock had cautiously backed away as the words exploded from Misty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer sisters, however, seemed to be completely unperturbed. <i>Although I have no idea how? And how have I been able to give her wedgies without facing this?</i> Ash thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sister dear,\" began Violet, \"it's not like that would be much different from trying to battle right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" chimed in Daisy, \"even if we did have a couple more Pokemon to go with Goldeen, that Pikachu of his alone would practically guarantee him the win.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We don't expect you to understand, of course,\" Lily added. \"Running a gym is exhausting. Why do you think we're backstroking away from it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMisty was practically grinding her teeth. \"Grrrr!\"<i> I know my sisters aren't exactly ideal, but there's that, and there's nonsense like this! Seriously, just giving away a badge!</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Should we do something?\" Ash whispered to Brock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Remember earlier when I told you it's okay to sometimes?\" he whispered back. Ash nodded. \"This isn't one of those times.\" Ash wasn't going to argue with that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLily, meanwhile, was smugly wrapping up her point. \"Now unless you know of some other way to settle this, I suggest you just let your little boyfriend take the badge already.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Speaking of little...\" Violet as she looked at Ash; \"He's a bit of a runt, Mist... Don't you like, want someone taller?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh looked a bit miffed at the jabs to his height.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's not- grdiruh...\" her words quickly turned into completely unintelligible grumbling. She took a deep breath, an idea for what to do forming in her head. \",,,Dah, Ash!\" The boy jumped as his redheaded companion shouted his name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, yeah,\" he replied swiftly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You agree that you should have to battle for the badge, right?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, well, yeah. I mean it would be kinda disappointing. I'd rather actually earn it. But, well...\" he sheepishly gestured to her sisters. \"I'm all for it if you've got another idea though.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs a matter of fact, she did. She was just taking a moment to wonder if she should actually do it. On one hand, having him battle her for it would give him the perfect chance to actually earn the badge and let her prove her skills to her sister. I'd definitely do a lot better than they would. But at the same time, she was tempted to just not. After all, she'd hardly be making her point if she lost, and she wouldn't want Ash to lose the battle either. <i>Besides, my sisters aren't really setting a very high bar for me to live up to right now. And as for earning the badge, well, I'll have to think of something.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>What does Misty decide?</b></span></div></div>",

Heck, the only reason he did so well at Pewter gym was because Brock, despite being more experienced than he was, didn't expect Ash to be as skilled as he was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSecond, she was still his coach/mentor. Considering they'd been traveling for a while, she'd know how he thinks in a Pokemon battle, especially since she was the one helping him with his battling skills. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn other words, there was a possibility that she'd crush him in an all-out Pokemon battle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"However...\" Misty said with reassurance in her voice; \"For this battle, it'll be different from a regular gym battle.. The point of our battle won't be for you to beat me. It'll be to test your skill, and how well you apply it. If I think you've proven your skill well enough, the match ends with you winning the badge!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh relaxed a bit more but was still nervous regardless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMisty's sisters and Brock looked at her with astonishment but ultimately didn't object.<br>\r\n------- <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone went to the pool, where everything was getting set up for the battle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Ash went to his side of the pool, Violet walked up to him a bit sneakily. Proceeding to try and give him a wedgie. As she reached out Ash suddenly turned and pulled her forward by her arm which caused Violet to fall on her stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oof! Wh- AAH!! ow! Ow! OW!!\" Before Violet could do anything, Ash yanked her panties over her back, over her head and snapped her waistband to her forehead.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you know what's good for you, you'll avoid doing that again,\" Ash said as he talked off and made his to the poolside. Leaving Violet to lay weakly on the ground in her atomic wedgie. \"owowow... eh, my poor butt.... well, eh this is new... ow...\"   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough, Misty stood across on the other side of the pool from Ash, who appeared to be doing his best to ignore the voice in his head as she instructed him back in Pewter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This match will allow only two Pokemon each! If the challenger shows enough skill that Misty deems satisfactory, then he will earn the Cerulean gym badge! Let the battle... BEGIN!\"</span></div></div>",

While he wasn't exactly the practically guaranteed win that Misty's sisters had called him, Pikachu's electric power would give him a good leg up and head start in the fight. \"Alright, Pikachu, I choose you!\" he called out with his arm outstretched as Pikachu... wasn't there. \"Huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pika.\" the electric mouse popped up from behind his left shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh smiled as he saw his small friend. \"Oh, there you are.\" Well, now let's-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pika Pi.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, is something wrong?\" Ash was rather confused and hoping that nothing bad had suddenly happened to Pikachu. Said Pokemon began explaining, by which I mean saying its name in different tones and gesturing about randomly, the issue. \"Soooo, you're saying you don't wanna fight Misty because she's our friend?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pika.\" A nod.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMisty stared in bewilderment, wondering how this kid seemed to attract so many odd Pokemon. It was only a bit strange when Pikachu seemed to absolutely HATE the idea of going into a Pokeball, but now there's this. Not to mention that whole thing with Vaporeon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe redhead was about to say something, only to be cut off by Ash, \"So can you tell me why?\" he asked his Pikachu calmly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe got a few more gestures and bit of Pokemon speech in response. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, you're worried about hurting her Pokemon?\" He got a nod in response and, much to Misty's surprise, smiled. \"You are really are nice little guy, aren't ya?\" Pikachu smiled a bit and nodded while awkwardly scratching its head with its tail. \"Still, you don't have to worry about that.\" he said while petting Pikachu a bit.\" Just think of this as a spar, not a fight. Friends do that all the time.\" Pikachu seemed to be mulling that over for a moment before Ash said one more thing that he knew would spur Pikachu on to fight. \"Besides, I'd be a little more worried about them hurting you, buddy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShock briefly took over Pikachu's face as he let out a confused \"Pika?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well yeah, I know you're an electric type and all, but Misty's water Pokemon are WAY more experienced.\" Misty smiled from where she was standing as she heard Ash say this. \"I'm just not so sure you'd be up to the challenge.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pika! Pikachu! Pika Pi. Pikachu!\" the small mouse said fiercely and with confidence while gesturing towards Misty, himself, and then Ash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You sure?\" ash asked. Receiving a particularly loud \"PIKA\" in response. \"Alright then, let's see what you've got!\" Ash said as Pikachu moved forward, ready to battle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMisty smiled, proud of how Ash handled the situation with his Pikachu.</span></div></div>",

NOW, we can begin!\" Daisy said, with annoyance from the interruption.<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as the announcement was made, Misty brought out a Pokeball, pressing the button to enlarge it. She gave Ash a stern look that told him that he better be ready, making sure that he understood the importance of this gym battle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Misty calls.... Seel!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd just like that, a white light flashed out of the opened Pokeball and onto a platform until it stopped, revealing the seal-like Pokemon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWasting no time, Ash immediately started off by attempting the first attack, ordering Pikachu to launch a thunderbolt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as Pikachu launched it, however, Seel already dived into the pool, avoiding the electric attack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth the trainer and his electric mouse gaped at the pinniped Pokemon's reflexes. But both snapped out of it, just in time for Pikachu to quickly duck under a headbutt from Seel, which had such speed and power that Pikachu's fur could feel a breeze blow against it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as Seel splashed back into the water, Pikachu scampered to the next platform on his right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly for Seel to stealthily climb onto the platform Pikachu was on and toss him into the air with his head (thankfully not using his horn), and immediately slapped him away with his tail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPikachu naturally launched a thunderbolt in mid-air as retaliation, which hit right on point. Pikachu then landed on a platform in a quadrupedal stance, as nimbly as a cat would.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMisty had Seel use aqua ring to recover from the electric attack to a degree. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Retaliating immediately, after getting hit. Even used Seel's slap to gain some distance... Not bad!</i> Misty thought to herself; <i>But now, it's time to stop prodding...</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, Seel dove into the water again and launched a water pulse at Pikachu, who leapt over it. Not wanting to give Pikachu time to retaliate again, Seel chased after him while lobbing water pulse after water pulse.Thankfully, Pikachu was ordered to use agility to better avoid the watery spheres. But even still, Seel was keeping Pikachu from using his electric attacks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh was sweating bullets, as he could only watch as Pikachu was being chased around the pool, unable to send out a single thunderbolt as he scampered onto platform after platform.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen of course, Misty grew tired of this impromptu game of \"ring-around-the-rosie\" and had Seel use blizzard on one of the platforms Pikachu was about to leap on. The sea lion Pokemon obeyed and leapt out of the water, blowing a gust of chilled air from his mouth onto the surface of the platform and creating a sheet of ice. Pikachu couldn't stop himself from landing on it in time, unfortunately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecause Pikachu was struggling to get his footing back, Seel was given ample time to slam his larger body against Pikachu, sending him flying across the pool. Seel dove into the water and swam quickly, managing to leap into the air and intercepted Pikachu by spiking him into the water with his tail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was now or never! if Ash didn't think of something now, Pikachu wouldn't be able to get even a single attack in before getting knocked out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat is, until a lightbulb flashed into his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pikachu, wait for my signal!\" Ash said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pi-i chuuu Pikapi, Pi pikaa Kaa...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n[Translation: All right Ash, I trust you...]<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so Pikachu waited as Seel swam at him like a torpedo, getting closer and closer... Until...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, use thunderbolt while still in the pool!\" Ash said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMisty couldn't order Seel to get out of the pool in time, as he was still charging. Even though his headbutt connected solidly and sent Pikachu flying, Pikachu was still able to send out currents of electricity throughout the water at the moment of impact, giving Seel a good shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPikachu landed on a platform, almost like a ragdoll in contrast to his agile movements from before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeel, on the other hand (flipper?), just barely had enough strength to stay conscious and stay afloat, though the blubber coated on his his body did manage to slightly insulate him from the electricity, So regardless of his severely weakened state, he was still declared the winner, as Pikachu fainted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man, who knew our little sister could kick so much butt in a Pokemon battle?\" Lily said, her eyes widening with astonishment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She even got around the type advantage the squirt's Pikachu had!\" Violet exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrock, of course, wasn't surprised in the slightest. Considering that Ash did the same thing during Pidgeotto's bout with Geodude, it was only natural that Misty could also do it; though to a greater degree, anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh, leapt onto the platforms until he got to Pikachu, lifting the little guy into his arms. Pikachu regained consciousness, giving him a little thumbs up to show that he wasn't discouraged from getting beaten by a water Pokemon. Ash smiled while he carried him off of the pool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You were awesome out there, bud. Way I see it, you deserve a good long rest...\"<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Pikachu was handed to Brock, Ash went back to the pool, and got out his pokeball. Thankfully, due getting severely shocked by pikachu's thunderbolt in the pool, Misty wasn't going to use Seel for the next round.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo now, it all came down to one Pokemon each...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPidgeotto was somewhat out of the question, considering that despite having no weakness against water type moves, he still likely wouldn't fare well if his wings got too wet. Metapod's mobility was somewhat restricted, so he was a no go. This of course, left Ash with only one viable option.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right Vaporeon, let's show Misty what ya got!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Vaporeon came out of her Pokeball and was on a platform, she looked around until she saw Ash and gave him a questioning look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Ash explained what was going on, Vaporeon nodded in understanding and turned around, ready for her first gym bout.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMisty opened a Pokeball, calling out the occupant inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh swallowed a lump in his throat as he looked at Vaporeon's opponent, whom he had every right to be nervous of. Who was it you ask?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhy, a seaking, of course!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite not having the gyrados' fearsome reputation; any wildlife expert, Pokemon researcher, fisherman , and those that survive an attack would tell you that these horned fish are not to be taken lightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1.) Seakings are powerful swimmers. They can not only swim against a river's current, but they're even able to swim up a waterfall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2.) That single horn on a seaking's head isn't for show; it's a deadly weapon that trainers must hope to never be on the receiving end of, due to it being powerful enough to bore holes through boulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh did his best to calm his nerves as he got himself ready.</span></div></div>",

As such, he decided to be cautious, waiting for Misty to make the first. And move she did! \"Seaking, Horn attack!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dangerous fish rushed forward straight toward Vaporeon, who, at Ash's command, dodged and fired a water gun the was easily avoided by Seaking. \"Darn it,\" Ash muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll have to do better than that Ash. Now, Poison Jab!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately for Ash, Vaporeon was just as quick to dodge this time as last. Even better, an idea was forming in the boy's mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Water Gun,\" Misty called out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dodge, and then circle around under Seaking.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" Misty watched as Vaporeon dodged and swam under Seaking, coming out on the opposite of the fish. Deciding not to give Ash a moment to think, she called out, \"Horn attack!\" Playing defense won't work for long Ash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain Ash had Vapoeon dodge oddly, this time having her dive down and actually jump over Seaking's attack before calling out \"Water Gun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain Seaking avoided the move, and Misty, getting a bit irritated by this battle turning into a game of Meowth and Ratata, yelled, \"Seaking keep chasing Vaporeon and don't use Megahorn attack until you get close.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing the opportunity he was waiting for yelled, \"Dive, get him following you, then swim straight up as fast as you can!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really, still running Ash?\" she asked, honestly surprised. <i>What is he up to?</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe got her answer soon enough as the inevitable result of their commands happened. Vaporeon leaped up from the water, actually managing to go up a good four feet with how fast it was moving, with Seaking following behind with his horn glowing and, thanks to his superior speed, closing the distance fast. \"Tailwhip him straight upward!\" Ash yelled out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Misty watched as Vaporeon did an odd turn in the air before striking Seaking with her tail and, combined with the momentum it already had, knocked him straight up to the ceiling for a hard collision as Vaporeon landed back in the water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Keep him up there with water gun!\" Vaporeon obeyed, knocking the fish back into the ceiling with the blast of water. Once Seaking started falling again, Ash called out for a tackle which Vaporeon managed to land on the now seriously dazed fish. It probably didn't help that Misty seemed just as dazed with surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as Vaporeon was about to retreat away, Misty gave a few claps, causing her to pause and Ash and the others to stare at her. \"Okay, I am officially impressed.\" Granted her Seaking definitely still looked battle-ready, if a little beaten up. In fact, he looked like he wanted nothing more than to be given an attack command so that he could get some much-deserved revenge for the embarrassment he just suffered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, you are?\" Ash asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"After a maneuver like that?\" she asked rhetorically. \"Yes, definitely yes,\" she said with pride. \"Although I have no idea what would inspire you to weaponize the gym's ceiling like that.\" She laughed a bit as she said that last part.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh let out an elated cheer in response. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><b>What happens next?</b></u></span></div></div>",

And what's more? There was a twinkle in his eye that practically glowed with exuberance from having not just earned his badge, but from actually impressing his coach/mentor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe still had a long way to go, but she had a feeling that the boy would be going places in the future. All he had to was to keep at it is all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, uh, sis? Could we talk to you in private?\" Violet asked as she tapped Misty's shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm?\" Misty turned around and saw all three of her big sisters standing in front of her. \"Sure, what about?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Something important...\" Daisy said.<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the four sisters walked out of the room with the pool, the talk began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Soooo, after we watched your match with your boyfriend, we just gotta say something...\" Lily,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNormally, Misty would've reminded her (or protest, whichever) that Ash wasn't her boyfriend, but she let it slide since this talk was so important.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You showed some incredible skill at Pokemon battling out there Misty...\" Daisy said; \"I've never seen anyone take control of a battle the way you did. In the first round alone, you showed quick thinking, coordination with your Pokemon, and even got around an opponent's type advantage to a degree I hadn't seen before!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's more? You showed a great judge in skill from seeing the way Ash battled. Heck, the kid's not too shabby of a battler himself, especially since he's learning under you. He's still a dork outside of that, but still!\" Lily said with a giggle at the last part.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How come you never told us you were this good?\" Violet asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I... Um...\" Misty hadn't predicted this at all. But thankfully, she regained her composure; \"See, there've been people that compared me with you, to the point where I just had enough of it! I wasn't going to stop being a mallet wielding tomboy just to please them, so I decided to hone my battling skills in private so I could become a water pokemon master... That way, I could become more than what THEY wanted... Yeah, sounds sappy and stupid, but that's how I feel...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer sisters looked at her, their faces softening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaisy suddenly gently pulled her youngest sister into a hug; \"I'm beyond sorry Misty... We never knew what you were going through!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We don't care if you're not into 'girly' stuff like us. Nor your mallet, strength or how you're better at wedging us in our wedgie wars. We don't want anyone to try and dictate who you should be!\" Violet joined in. \"If anyone's got a problem, they can just get in line for a royal butt-kicking from us!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're our sister Mist...\" Lily said as she joined. \"We'll always love you for who YOU are, tomboy or otherwise! What matters most is that you stay true to your heart! And from the way I see it, Ash and Brock feel the way about you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMisty's eyes widened as if time had stopped while her older sisters hugged her tenderly. Eventually, she gave a big smile and let tears of joy fall down as she hugged her sisters.<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater, at the inn in the evening, Ash and Misty were in their room, where the girl was just finished getting changed into a new pair of red panties with blue zigzag patterns on them. She then came out, now clad in only the undies and nothing else towards Ash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Definitely made the right call with these...\" Ash smirked as he gently tugged on the waistband, letting them snap back after releasing them. \"What do you think, Misty-girl?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They actually feel kinda nice, in all honesty...\" Misty said, smiling as her cheeks turned pink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good! Now, time to see if how long they last in my hands...\" Ash said, giving a cat-like grin as he cracked his knuckles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout even needing to be ordered, Misty turned around and showed her butt to Ash. The boy then proceeded with ever so slowly grabbing the waistband with an underhand grip in preparation. Soon enough, Ash had hefted the young trainer off the floor in one clean jerk upwards towards the ceiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMisty squeaked as Ash suspended her by her panties, the material painfully digging into her. Strangely enough, she wasn't resistant to it as usual... Could it be that she was growing accustomed to them? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Mist?\" Ash said as he held her up; \"I still haven't thanked you... For making me a better trainer...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Give yourself, eh, some credit Ash...\" Misty winced; \"You still put in 120% percent, eh... that's bound to make help you in the long run!... Besides ... By training you, I think I'm getting better myself...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh smiled; \"So... We're basically helping each other?\" Ash gave the girl a little bounce, as a means of sinking the panties deeper. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eep! Yeah... eh, I guess you could say that...\" Misty bit her lower lip from the material digging into her.</span></div></div>",

It was nice knowing that their arrangement was helping her out so much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, He couldn't let a moment like this continue for long. \"Alright, enough of the sappy stuff,\" he said while giving her panties another sharp pull and making her squeak. \"Let's see how much it will take to get you squirming.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah! Oh god!\" she gasped out as Ash spun her around a couple of times by her undies. \"Probably less tha-EHHHNn you think!\" Suddenly Ash stopped mid-spin and stepped back while giving a strong pull, letting the momentum further pull on the girl's underwear. \"YEOWWW!\" With his strength, he then tossed her face-first onto her bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that's good,\" he said walking up behind her and grabbing her waistband again. \"It wouldn't be quite as much fun otherwise.\" Pulling up, he briefly lifted the girl off the bed before dropping her back down as she whimpered, shaking just a little bit. \"Ooh, shaking. Nice, it makes that little butt of yours look even cuter.\" As if to emphasize his point, he then gave her a strong swat on the aforementioned butt.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah!. Th-thanks...\" she said, uncertain and blushing like crazy.<i> Oh man, how is this still so embarrassing?</i> Her embarrassment and worry grew when she felt him slide his left arm through the leg-holes of her panties. \"A-ash, what are you doing?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Isn't it obvious?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMIsty quickly found herself lifted completely off the bed, squealing as Ash curled and uncurled his arm<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm doing some weight-lifting.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><b>The next day...</b></u><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Brock was getting a new map, as Misty had thrown the previous one into the campfire on the journey to the city during one of her attempts to stall, Ash and Misty were outside the Cerulien gym saying goodbye to Lily, Daisy, and Violet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It really was great seeing you again sis.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, and we hope you have a great journey.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And feel free to tell us about it the next time you're here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMisty smiled. \"Thanks, you guys. And I will.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Violet turned towards Ash. \"Hey, Ash...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? What is it?\" he asked. Violet then whispered into his ear which made him smirk. \"I don't have time but I can show you one where we all do it.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh then turned to Misty, \"Hey Misty, close your eyes\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm... ok...\"Misty was confused but did so. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a while, she heard whispering, and then nothing, that was until... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the girl felt four, yes four, sets of hands all grab her panties and yank upward. \"OWWWWWWHOWowow!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCombined, and grabbing from all sides, Ash and her sisters managed to yank her panties up to just below her chest in one go. And after some pulling, while she futilely struggled to get free, they managed to get her panties up to the top of her head. They then let go causing the back of her waistband to snap on her forehead and the front of her waistband to snap at the back of her head. Giving a brutal double atomic wedgie. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMisty fall to the ground and held are crotch in pain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yikes!\" Violet began. \"That is definitely worse than the wedgie I received\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>I wanna be given that</i>\" Dasiy muttered<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm definitely using this in our next wedgie war,\"  added Lily. \"Seriously Misty you have a boyfriend who could really teach you. I wish I had a boyfriend who could...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHehe, well...\" Ash smiled and rubbed the back of his head awkwardly. Then his mind finally processed the word \"boyfriend\" again and he seethed a bit internally. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMisty, meanwhile, held her crotch with only one thought in her mind. <i>Really?! They think Ash would be good boyfriend material. And it has to be because of this!</i> Well, that and her currently immense discomfort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><b>What will happen next?</b></u><br>\r\n    <br>\r\n<b><u>Option 1: On their journey to the next town, while Brock puts some kind of meal together, Misty and Ash move away from the campsite to practice more with his Pokemon.</u></b></span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It's been at least a day or two since the trio started their trek from Cerulean, with Misty still feeling a bit of phantom pain from the super wedgie that Ash and her sisters had given her before they left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVermillion was still a town over or so, but despite the long journey, Ash wasn't discouraged in the slightest. It kept his companions in good spirits, who gladly welcomed his infectious optimism. Misty especially, considering that outside of the wedgies she received from the young trainer, she had also grown rather fond of him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrock was especially important for the two, considering his talents as a cook and his perchance for being the \"big brother\" of the group. Save for his occasional \"girl-crazy mode\", he was usually the one acting as the voice of reason in moments where It was needed. It helped that he seems to have more experience with surviving out in the wilderness, likely a result of his father's teachings as well as having to take his siblings camping on occasion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of which... Brock was already at work cooking dinner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen asked how long it'd take, he wagered it to be around at least three hours or so, given the preparation required for the recipe he was using.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMisty opted to go out training with Ash to pass the time training, with Pikachu staying behind to help guard the camp.<br>\r\n----<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right Ash, I think for today, you should bring out Metapod,\" Misty said. \"He could use the exercise... Though I don't know how he'd even be able to move around... Anyway, back on topic! Why don't you try and see if you can improve on the things he knows?...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh nodded meekly. He then proceeded with calling Metapod out of the Pokeball.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bug type jumped into the air a bit with joy, though how he could do this without legs is a mystery.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyway, training began with Ash having Metapod improve the accuracy of his string shot by firing globs of the sticky stuff at some leaves on a branch. <br>\r\n------- <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis continued for a little while now, with Misty having not made a move on him yet. What's more?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSometime, after Ash and Metapod took a bit of a break. She seemed to have disappeared who knew how many minutes ago while Ash was doing target practice with his little green pal. Ash had no clue what was up, though he figured she went out to see if she could find a water Pokemon to catch...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe instant that Ash and Metapod got back into training, this time with tackle attack, they didn't even notice that someone was watching them from the trees. Someone wearing a camouflaged jumpsuit, along with a full face mask that completely concealed the face and hair; as well as gloves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilently but stealthily, the figure slowly crept up closer and closer, until they suddenly grabbed Ash from behind and yanked him backward by his jacket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-hey, what the heck?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMetapod immediately rushed to his trainer's defense and tackled the person away, only to get pushed away as retaliation and landed on his side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh immediately returned Metapod' to his Pokeball. While Metapod didn't look like he was hurt, he didn't want to risk his Pokemon getting injured for his sake needlessly. This turned out to be a big mistake, as the mysterious newcomer looked at him, and slowly walked towards him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGulping with fright, Ash slowly walked backward. Further and further he kept his distance from the figure until he turned tail and ran, with his pursuer doing their best to make sure he didn't getaway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe chase lasted about two minutes, with Ash sweating nervously as he tried unsuccessfully to shake them off while running through various shrubbery. All this came to a close when he tried to dart to the side, only for him to be tackled to the ground by the figure. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a brief struggle, Ash actually managed to gain the upper hand. He grabbed the figure the best on his/her camouflaged bottom and brought him/her to his/her feet as they stood up. This caused the jumpsuit to rip revealing the figure to be wearing blue panties with green swirl design patterns. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout missing a beat Ash went into action, giving a strong enough pull to yank the figure and cause her to squeal. Before anything could be said Ash then dragged the squealing figure to a rock formation with a particularly curved shape stone on the side. Ash hooked the figure's panties to the stone, hefting her off and letting her dangle from the stone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe figure yelped as gravity went to work on her but then admits her struggling, Ash heard the figure give familiar \"ow...\". Ash then proceeded to pull her mask off to reveal... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Misty?!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMisty winced. \"Yeah... eh, it's me, ow... ta-da... ow\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh watched as she squirmed around as she hung by her undies; \"W-what the heck is-\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's part of the training... eh, Basically, I pretend to be someone who wants to kidnap you... eh, and you attempt to escape. But you returned Metapod to his Pokeball...eh when he was still very well capable of defending you. Plus, you know very well he can use harden... So, mind telling me why you made such a boneheaded move?!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I...... I didn't want to risk Metapod getting seriously hurt because of me... I... I don't think I can deal with something like that, not like when Pikachu risked himself to stop the spearrow from nearly killing me! I...... I don't want that to ever happen again!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMisty looked up at him with sympathy, while still hanging she put both hands gently on Ash's shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ash... I..... Look, I know how much you care about every single one of your Pokemon. But you gotta realize that they care just as much about you as you do them; because you've shown them nothing but love, affection, and encouragement. That to them is what makes YOU so valuable in the first place!\" Misty said; \"If they want to protect you, then they'll do it, regardless of the risks. It's not something that you can stop Ash... Any more than you can catch lightning in a bottle..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the time that Ash was given to mull over these words, and proceeding to get Misty down from the rock formation. The two heard a rustling that came closer, louder until a wild and rather grouchy Pinsir came into view. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nApparently, the bug type Pokemon wasn't a big fan of the idea of humans being in his territory. Just as Misty was about to send out a water Pokemon, however, Metapod popped out of his Pokeball and attempted to the tackle, only to get smacked away for his troubles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMetapod thankfully used harden to avoid the impact from slamming into a tree. But the Pinsir seemed intent on using his horns to do him in, so naturally, Ash attempted to distract him by throwing a stone. Just as the Pinsir turned to face him, Metapod suddenly glowed, with his shell opening up to reveal-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Butterfree, the Butterfly Pok\u00e9mon. Butterfree is the evolved form of Metapod. Its wings, covered with poisonous powders, repel water. This allows it to fly in the rain\" Dexter's electronic voice resounded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh and Misty couldn't believe what they saw before them, as Butterfree flew in front of Ash and Misty protectively. Just as the Pinsir charged, however, Butterfree suddenly used string shot to immobilize him.<br>\r\nJust as the stag beetle Pokemon had gotten loose, Butterfree than flapped his wings and used sleep powder to naturally put him to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nButterfree floated over to Ash, nuzzling him affectionately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh smiled big time as he pat his Pokemon on the head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Brock is not gonna believe this...\" Misty murmured to herself as she fixed her wedgie... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

In fact, this bridge was probably weirder than that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's odd, I don't see this anywhere on the map.\" Brock said, studying and turning around the map in his hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, and why is it a rope bridge?\" Ash asked. That got him a couple of confused stares.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhhh, what?\" Asked Brock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a bridge over rushing rapids and big rocks.\" The boy explained, stating the obvious. \"You'd think whoever built it would make something sturdier and less likely to get taken down by a strong wind.\" Brock and Misty thought for a moment before nodding in agreement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, that also prompted worry from Misty. \"Brock, do you see any other paths over this thing on the map?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't even see this one on here.\" he answered. \"Huh, the bridge must be new or something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking over the bridge, Ash briefly weighed their chances of getting across. <i>What's the worst that could happen?</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><b>42 and a half seconds later...</b></u><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooookay, irrr, and...

How 'bout giving me a hand?\" Misty asked, still hanging to the wrecked bridge and trying to pull herself the rest of the way. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right.\" Ash said, crouching down and reaching his right hand towards her left... and then past it towards her butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh come o-owhowhowhowoW!\" Misty shouted as Ash grabbed the exposed waistband of her panties and hoisted her the rest of the way up by those. \"Ow! is this really the-Yeowch! Sorry, sorry!\" she backpedaled her complaining as he started bouncing her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's always a good time for a wedgie Misty.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that settled, the two soon moved on to figuring out where the water had likely carried Brock to. unfortunately, they would be setting off a few traps along the way.

So far, they had been walking for at least half an hour, with next to no clues found at the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo make matters worse, things had gotten just a tad too quiet around here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Misty.... Do you think whoever put up that bridge wanted to...? You know..\" Ash drew his index finger across his throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Probably... Though not out of malice...\" Misty' foot unknowingly stepped on something hidden underneath a couple of leaves; \"Probably wanted to-OH CRAP!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMisty immediately grabbed Ash and pulled him down with her to the grass, ducking just in time to avoid getting slammed into by a log on a rope.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir eyes bugged out of surprise and fear, thanking their lucky stars and reflexes for avoiding such a collision.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ash, I think we better keep moving\" Misty asked herself as she and Ash got to their feet and made a run for it.<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe trio dodged rocks thrown at them, narrowly avoided a pit, and other such obstacles... The next one was a tad more embarrassing, however...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as Misty had stepped on another hidden trigger, she narrowly avoided getting slammed by another log, though the seat of her shorts, unfortunately, got caught on a branch as it flew by. The log naturally dragged the screaming girl along, who was now, unfortunately, hanging by her shorts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as Ash and Pikachu were about to run over and help the girl out, they fell to the ground, courtesy of bolas that were thrown and wrapped around their feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't even think about moving...\" Said a girl with dark blue hair in a braid and hair ribbon, wearing red overalls over a pink shirt. She stood over Ash, with a double barreled shotgun pointed at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, Ash may have been stronger than the girl... But with the shotgun pointed so up close to his face, he probably wouldn't be able to retaliate effectively without getting a face full of pellets. So of course, Ash complied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where do you people get off... Thinking you can just come in here and steal innocent Pokemon from their homes whenever you want. The nerve!\" The girl said with a growl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who do you think we are, Team Rocket?! I would never do what those poachers do!\" Ash said angrily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl with the gun paused in thought as she studied Ash's reaction.

Fortunately, he didn't have any trouble getting over to her. \"Hanging in there alright Misty?\" he asked, having even less trouble making a joke. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha ha.\" she said sarcastically. \"Just get me off of this thing.\" Complying, he reached down and proceeded to grab her panties. \"W-wait! \"Not li- Ah!\" And just like that, he wedgied her up and off of the branch. As the branch was clearly strong, he had no problem standing straight up so that she was now suspended by his hands on her blue with vertical while stripes undies. More unfortunately, with her shorts still stuck on the log's branch, they were now pulled off and fell down to the ground. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh he-\" The mysterious girl cover her mouth with one hand to stifle her laughter, not quite believing what she was seeing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahhh!\" Misty''s hands moved to the front of her panties, trying in vain to hide them from this new girl. \"Ash!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah yeah, keep your shorts on.

Wouldn't traps be more of a danger to Pokemon?\" Ash asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me explain a bit more. I take care of wounded Pokemon that I find around here and prevent people from stealing them away. The traps help with that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohhhhhhhh...\" Well that certainly made more sense.

We don't know where he is, but we have to find him!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait... Hold on a minute...\" Melanie thought a bit; \"I saw a guy close to my age getting swept by the river and got him out before he drowned. He was half choked with water, but otherwise he was still breathing... He had dark tanned skin with a decent build and squinty eyes... Does your friend look anything like that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah!\" said Ash; \"Is he all right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's resting in my cabin... I'll take you both to see him.\" Melanie said with a gentle smile.<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough, Melanie took the kids and Pikachu to the hidden 'village' where she cared for the Pokemon that lived in the area. Just as they were about to go into the cabin, however...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bulba!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh and Misty turned sharply to at the sound, only to find the same bulbasaur from before. Ash showed great caution as he put his hands up defensively, since this WAS the same tough little froggy-plant-creature... Thing... from the incident with that oddish. He certainly still didn't look happy to see them, considering that his trademark vine whips come out of the sides of the critter's bulb on his back, moving aggressively like snakes giving out a warning before getting ready to strike.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pi-i, kaaa, chuuu Kachu!\" Pikachu said as he walked up to the grass type Pokemon; \"Pi pika-pika, ka'ka kaa pika Chu kachu pika-pika!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bulbasaaaaaurrr\" Bulbasaur relaxed a bit. He then gave everyone but Melanie the \"I'm watching you gesture\" with one of his vines. He then walked up to Melanie, who picked him up and pet him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry about that...

She'd aimed at them almost immediately, and then they had to go and turn on what could only be described as a giant vacuum. Suddenly, it was a struggle just to hold onto her gun, let alone aim, with the winds trying to suck everyone in and getting inside quickly took priority over attacking. \"Everyone okay?\" she asked, glancing over them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah!\" they all said quickly. Her eyes locked on Misty though. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, Misty...\" The girl looked down and saw that, without her having noticed, the wind from the vacuum had pulled her shorts down while she helping some of the Pokemon get inside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you kidding?!\" she exclaimed as she frantically pulled her shorts back up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile she did that, Brock asked, \"Any chance you have something that can deal with that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelanie shook her head. \"I never made preparations for having to fight off a giant vacuum. How do they even have that? WHY do they even have it? With however much that must cost, you could probably buy a hundred Pokeballs and do what actual trainers do!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh suddenly noticed that a certain someone was missing. \"Hey, where's Bulbasaur?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><u><b>Outside</b></u></div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I must say, James, this is going even better than I thought it would,\" Jessie said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Indeed. With this thing on, those twerps can't even step outside. Let alone attack.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, guys,\" Meowth said while pointing to the top of the cabin. \"What's that little vegetable doin'?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the top of the cabin, Bulbasaur remained attached to the roof despite the suction pulling him in as his vines shot out and swatted the vacuum away from the cabin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking advantage of the momentary reprieve, Ash quickly ran out of the cabin and deployed Butterfree while calling out for a Gust attack. As Butterfree flapped his wings, the vacuum turned back to the cabin again. As Gust collided with the vacuum's suction, the whirling winds transformed into a truly epic tornado that slammed right into Team Rocket and their insane contraption, sending them off flying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><b>Later...</b></u><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So run this by me again, you want me to take Bulbasaur because why?\" Ash asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As nice as it is to have him here, it just wouldn't be right to keep him here. The little village I've got here isn't exactly big enough for his bulb to grow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh just stared at her, clearly not sure what to make of that. \"That's a thing? That makes no- YEOW!\" He was cut off as Misty gave his ear a sharp pull. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ash, I swear, the next time we're in a proper town, I am getting you the latest book on Pokemon so that you will stop being surprised by things like this.\" With that done, she let go of his ear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Besides that,\" Melanie further explained, \"I'm worried he might be a little too good at his job. The Pokemon are getting more and more hesitant to move away from the village with him watching over them, and it's only a matter of time until I run out of room for them all. And I do think he's warming up to you. Especially with how you and Butterfree destroyed that machine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh thought that over for a moment. He knew that he would still need some more Pokemon, and Bulbasaur would be a great choice. He already has a bug, water, flying, and electric type. Adding a grass type seemed like the next most logical choice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlright,\" he smiled, \"I can't really argue with that.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><b>So what comes next?</b></u><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><b>Option 1: Ash practice with Bulbasaur. And while they're at it, he finds a good use for vine whip that he conspiratorially whispers to the grass type. Spanking Time!</b></u></span></div></div>",

He then looked down at Pikachu, a lightbulb going off in his head as he knelt down to the Pokemon's level and whispered into his ear an interesting idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPikachu tilted his head in confusion but nonetheless complied with a nod.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, Pikachu...\" Ash flashed him a smile.<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe match between Butterfree and Bulbasaur soon commenced, with Bulbasaur's experience as the village's bodyguard giving him the edge as his vine whips made it difficult for Butterfree to use Tackle on him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't help that Bulbasaur was surprisingly nimble for a squat little Pokemon, effectively dodging some string shots here and there before leaping at a tree and springboarded towards Butterfree, who narrowly avoided getting slammed by the larger Pokemon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh knew he that if he was going this bout, Bulbasaur would need to be slowed down in some way. Then it hit him...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Butterfree, blow him into the air with gust!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nButterfree immediately flapped his wings as hard as he could and sent Bulbasaur flying, though he managed to stop himself by using vine whip to stop himself from being completely blown away by wrapping around a tree branch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Saaaaaur!\" Bulbasaur gritted as he tried to formulate a plan to launch a counter-attack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, send some stun spore into the air currents!\" Ash said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nButter free did just that, letting the gust carry the spore over to Bulbasaur, effectively paralyzing him long enough for Ash to send a Pokeball out and officially catching him.<br>\r\n-- <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter saying their goodbyes (with Melanie telling Ash to be a bit more merciful on Misty's underpants), the group eventually found a place to stay for the night, where Misty was waiting for Ash to get back from practicing with Pidgeotto. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as Ash walked into the room and closed the door behind him, and looked at Misty with an innocent smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Say, Misty, I was thinking a little bit about how Bulbasaur might feel like a member of the team. So I had Pikachu talk to him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMisty raised an eyebrow at this. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"From what I was able to guess, based on Pikachu playing charades, Bulbasaur was fine with it. Though aside from the battle, he thinks he should also do a little 'initiation'...\"Ash's expression had a mischief filled glint. \"Just so you two could seal the deal..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bulbaaa\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMisty turned her head to the right and saw Bulbasaur standing next to Ash. Who gave her the same sort of expression as Ash as her vines came out of the sides of her bulb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh oh...\" Misty gulped as she slowly stepped back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that, the room was filled with the sound of swatting, and Misty's squealing.</span></div></div>",

There was just something infinitely more embarrassing about having him remove her shorts for her. Nonetheless, he still continued his actions and removed her shorts. \"And the shorts are off. Now one more touch.\" Grabbing the back of her panties, he yanked hard upwards to expose more of her butt, making her wince. \"And now we can begin.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eeeep!\" Misty squealed as Bulbasaur's free vine whipped her backside. \"OW!!\" A vine-shaped red print could already be seen forming on her backside.

Where are we?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking over the map, Brock traced over the last spot he was sure they had been over to the the direction they've been going. \"It looks like we're in the middle of nowhere.\" That got him a couple of groans. \"The good news though is that if we keep going straight, we'll reach Route 24 soon. And that'll take us straight to Vermilion City.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great.\" Ash said. \"Then let's- why is it suddenly darker out?\" The trio and Pikachu found a shadow going over them. looking to it's source, they found it was a Charmander. reading over its information on his Pokedex, Ash was excited at the chance to finally catch a fire type. \"Alright! Vapoer- Ugh!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he could even throw his Pokeball, Ash was stopped by Misty pulling on the back of his collar. \"Ash, try and be a little quiet, you don't wanna spook it.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We might have another problem.\" Brock said. \"Take a look at it's flame. It looks pretty small for a Charmander. I think it might need some help.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh considered this for a moment. if the Charmander was weak, then he could catch it easily enough and then take it to a Pokemon center. And so he tried to do just that, only for the Charmander to resist. And resist the second time when Brock tried it. After some debate, they had Pikachu go up and talk to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon returning, Pikachu explained, as best he could, that the Charmander was a \"he,\" already had a trainer, and was waiting for him to return. \"Huh, well, I guess there's not much we can do then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrock nodded. \"His trainer should be back sooner or later and we can't exactly just take him.\" With that decided, our group started to move onward.

In the first round alone, you showed quick thinking, coordination with your Pokemon, and even got around an opponent's type advantage to a degree I hadn't seen before!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's more? You showed a great judge in skill from seeing the way Ash battled. Heck, the kid's not too shabby of a battler himself, especially since he's learning under you. He's still a dork outside of that, but still!\" Lily said with a giggle at the last part.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How come you never told us you were this good?\" Violet asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I... Um...\" Misty hadn't predicted this at all. But thankfully, she regained her composure; \"See, there've been people that compared me with you, to the point where I just had enough of it! I wasn't going to stop being a mallet wielding tomboy just to please them, so I decided to hone my battling skills in private so I could become a water pokemon master... That way, I could become more than what THEY wanted... Yeah, sounds sappy and stupid, but that's how I feel...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer sisters looked at her, their faces softening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaisy suddenly gently pulled her youngest sister into a hug; \"I'm beyond sorry Misty... We never knew what you were going through!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We don't care if you're not into 'girly' stuff like us. Nor your mallet, strength or how you're better at wedging us in our wedgie wars.

What matters most is that you stay true to your heart! And from the way I see it, Ash and Brock feel the way about you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMisty's eyes widened as if time had stopped while her older sisters hugged her tenderly. Eventually, she gave a big smile and let tears of joy fall down as she hugged her sisters. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter several long moments, they ended the hug. \"This is great you guys.\" Misty said. \"Before Ash, Brock, and I leave, maybe the four of us should do something together.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nViolet's face lit up, already having an idea in mind. \"Ooh, I have an idea!\" The excitement in her voice was palpable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRemembering something that Violet had mentioned to them during the second half of Ash and Misty's battle, Lily sighed. \"You aren't suggesting what I think you are, are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMhm.\" was the bluette's reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm, I don't know.\" Daisy said. \"It could be fun.

Slowly, Misty's face turned pale in terror. \"You guys can't be serious?!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think it would a great idea, besides I'm tired of losing to you at our wedgie wars\" Violet said \"Oh there he is!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMisty watched in horror as she saw her sisters walk up to Ash and whisper to him. She got all the more scared when she saw his face slowly show a sinister grin from. *Gulp* <br>\r\n<br>\r\n------- <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater that night, Brock went back to the inn the group had stayed at the previous night. Misty and Ash, however, were getting to stay the night with the redhead's sisters. At present, the sisters and Ash were all gathered up on the sofa in their living room, waiting for Misty to finish changing in the bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on out Misty-girl.\" Ash sing-songed. \"We're waiting.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bathroom door opened slightly, and Misty stuck her head out. \"Do I have to?\" she asked nervously \"<i>It's humiliating enough when it's just Ash. Now my sisters too! I think I might actually die of embarrassment!</i>\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm, I don't know. Girls, what do you think?\" In response, Misty's sisters all gave a resounding 'Yes.' \"Welp, you heard 'em. Get your butt out here or I guarantee you won't be able to sit down for a week. And NO covering\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-okay...\" slowly, the door opened further, and out stepped Misty, wearing nothing but a pair of baby pink panties with dark blue hearts printed on them with a matching bra, her face was a dark shade of red. Her legs shaking a bit out of nervousness and embarrassment, she stepped into the center of the room while her sister and Ash surrounded her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yes.\" Ash said while sticking finger into the back of her waistband and pulling on it. \"You were right Daisy, these look perfect on her.\" He released the band, letting it snap back to her waist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Told you so.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm, those panties sure look good you Misty\" said Violet. \"She looks absolutely adorable like this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As much as I hate to admit it, that rump of hers does look pretty good combined to mine.\" admitted Lily jealously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMisty, meanwhile, was blushing and squirming a bit under their gaze. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright girls,\" exclaimed Ash, \"I say we kick this off by...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

That way I can show you all how it's done.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"An excellent idea Ash.\" agreed Lily. \"It should be a wonderful learning experience.\" The other two sisters nodded in agreement. The Sensational Sisters took a seat on the couch while Ash dragged Misty, who had only just managed to pick the cotton out of her backside, over to the chair by her undies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright girls, pay close attention.\" Ash said while lifting Misty back up to her feet with a frontal wedgie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Urgh! Come on Ash, can't you be a little gentler?\" Misty pleaded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No back talk!\" SWAT! The girl 'eeked' as her <b>student</b> gave her a spank. \"That makes for a good starting point girls. Don't be afraid mix spanking in with wedging. It works very well. Now Misty, lean on the front of the chair and raise your butt for me.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl climbed, she face a nice shade of pink. \"I-is this alright?\" she asked. She knew the that all of their eyes were on her butt and undies right now.  Her SISTERS and a BOY were staring at her undies!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perfect.\" Turning to Misty's sisters, he said, \"Now to start, you want to get a good grip on the waistband.\" He did so. \"And pull nice and quick.\" Misty squeaked as Ash did so. Immediately after that, he began twisting the panties back and forth while turning them from side to side, further driving in the girl's wedgie. \"You'll also want to very your movements. And remember, fell free to add some spanks.\" SWAT! SWAT SWAT! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YEOWWwww...!\" Misty squirmed about, unintentionally making her wedgie worse and creating a more hilarious show for Misty's sisters. With her wedgie in place, the girls could easily see her bare butt-cheeks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the show continued, Ash demonstrated more techniques to get the sisters started. The best way to do frontals, how a squeaky clean worked, the best spanking technique, etc. Bouncing her by her undies, he even explained that how to worsen a hanging wedgie and how worsening an existing wedgie can be even better than going for a new one. He made sure to limit how hard he tugged though, not wanting to risk tearing Misty's panties with his strength. He'd leave that pleasure for the sisters. Speaking of whom, they each had their own opinion on how they wanted to proceed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nViolet was grinning, so glad that she had suggested this. Personally, she was looking forward to ripping those panties off her. They did have a few more pairs for her in case something like that happened. Although she definitely wanted to see if she could stretch those over her head and down to her crotch first. Maybe tying them like that? <i>Eh, I'll figure it out when I get to it.</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaisy meanwhile, was thinking about trying for a hanging and spanking combo. She could already imagine hanging her up and then getting out the spatula to beat her behind. <i>Like a pinata</i>. she thought. The questions were, what she would do then. She could make her say embarrassing things, literally pull her down and tear the undies, bounce her to her hearts content. So many choices.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLily, meanwhile, knew exactly what she wanted to do. She planned on spanking that ass of her as much as possible with a few wedgies mixed in. <i>After I'm done, your so called 'perfect' ass is going to be as red as my hair.</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMisty meanwhile, was currently laying on Ash's lap while he gave her an, admittedly lighter than usual, spanking. Likely because he knew how much punishment her butt was in for. This thought gave her no comfort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So that's about all that I really need to cover. Now as for who should go next, I would say that...\"</span></div></div>",

To her surprise though, she did release her undies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, just like that.\" she said. Turning to her sisters on the couch, \"Daisy, I believe I left my little toy to your left. Could you toss it to me?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking to her left, the blonde found a ping-pong paddle by her side. Grinning mischievously, she answered back with a \"Sure thing sis.\" before tossing to the pinkette.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatching hit paddle, Lily turned back to Misty and said, \"Hope you're ready little Misty, because I want you to count these for me. We're going up to thirty.\" Pulling her arm back, she got ready to swing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wa-wait, whatAAAHHHHhT?!\" she shouted as she felt the first stinging blow, her butt having already been made nice and pink by Ash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Still thirty. No progress unless you count.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSWAT! \"YEOWWWww! Come on, that's not f- AH!\" Learning her lesson, the girl quickly called out, \"One!\" And so they proceeded, the wooden paddle continuing to punish Misty and turning her bottom a nice shade of red by the time she got thirty. At which point, she was trembling and fighting back tears. At the very least though, she could take solace in the fact that Lily was not as strong as Ash. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring this time, back on the couch, Ash and the other two sisters looked rather impressed. While they had been expecting more wedging, this was certainly a welcome sight. And the girl didn't seem to be done either. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awwww. Was I a little too rough with you sis?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"J-j-j-ju-just a b-bi- Ah!\" The girl was suddenly lifted off the ground by her panties as Lily carried her over to the chair Ash had been sitting on at the end of his turn and set the girl down on her lap. \"No, nonononono, not another\" SWAT. \"OW!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Remember what your boyfriend said about back talk Misty. Now relax, this won't be another spanking.\" That confused the girl until she felt her pull her panties up, sinking them into her cheeks and exposing her butt to her. Much to her surprise though, she then let go of her undies again, and started drumming her fingers on her ass. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you do-eeehhh...?\" The girl's face did a weird flip out as she started actively caressing and rubbing her bottom. \"H-hey! Wh-what are doing?\" she squirmed a bit on her lap. \" Just trying to see what makes your butt so much better than mine.\" the pinkette answered. Hmmm, soft, but with just the right amount of firmness. yes, I can see why Ash-\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay!\" Ash suddenly blurted out, catching everyone's attention and causing Lily to stop. \"I think it's something else turn now.\" He said through clenched teeth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLily smiled, enjoying seeing the green eyed monster in Ash.

As much fun as it is to keep her waiting, she looks like she might start bouncing in her seat if she doesn't get her turn soon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bluette jumped and gave a quick cheer of enthusiasm in response. \"Thanks Lily.\" she said while giving her sister a quick hug. \"The wait was starting to get to me.\" With that, Lily took her seat back on the couch while Violet looked at Misty, who was now seated on the floor. \"Now what should I do with our precious little sister?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile embarrassed at being talked down to, the girl at least had the sense to avoid trying to give anything resembling back talk. \"Please be gentle.\" she whispered, being just loud enough for them to hear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm, nope. Lay down flat on the ground, I've got an idea.\" Misty complied and Violet took a seat on her back. Grabbing the already stretched panties, she began yanking on them, causing Misty to grunt in pain. \"Now, let's see how far I can get these.\" After several seconds of pulling like that, she changed position to sit on her legs and keep her pinned while grabbing her panties and beginning the difficult process of getting them up to her head. After about a minute of her struggling, and Misty's groaning, she managed to hook them onto her forehead. \"Annnd... there... we... go!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith her panties now attached to her head, Misty let out a few more groans before asking, \"Are you done?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not just yet. Now stand up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNervously, and on shaky legs, she did so. Her underwear digging further into her backside in the process. \"N-now what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrabbing the waistband on her head, she answered with a \"This.\" Using both hands, she continued pulling on her waistband.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YEEEeeeee aahhhhhh! What are you doing?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seeing how far they'll stretch, duh.\" Continuing her efforts, the girl pulled the panties down to her chin while Misty cried out. While she had been wanting to see if it would be possible to stretch the panties all the way back down to her crotch, it was only when they were reaching her neck that they started popping and the waistband began to tear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce that happened, Misty collapsed down to her knees and let out a quiet, \"oooowwwww...\" sound.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning to Ash, Violet asked, \"So how'd I do?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking Misty over, Ash felt pleased with Violet's work. \"For a newbie, you did really well. And I think Misty would agree. \"Wouldn't you Misty?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaid girl weakly nodded her head in response. \"I'd hate to feel what she could do with more practice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNodding in agreement, Ash said, \"Welp, time to change you out of those panties Misty.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMisty's eyes widened in shock. \"Y-you mean... right here?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChuckling, Ash said, \"Don;t worry, you can turn away from us while you change.\" With that, she tossed her another pair of panties. This time a red pair that had black smiley faces on them with a matching bra. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer face a shade of red darker than her butt, Misty turned around and slowly got to her feet. Hesitantly, she undid her bra and then reached her hands down and began pulling off her destroyed panties, feeling the eyes of Ash and her sisters on her butt. Correction, on her bare butt. Yeah, they had been wedgieing her, but it was still humiliating for her to be now completely NAKED. She couldn't imagine what she'd do if Ash saw the other side. <i>Don't think about, don't think about it! Just get the new panties and bra on!</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the new pair in hand and the old pair off, she was about to start putting them on when she heard Ash say \"Stop!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstantly, Misty froze. \"W-what is it?\" Fear welled up inside her. \"What if he wants to see my... my...!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Doesn't her butt look great girls?\" he asked her sisters, winking. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo continue the embarrassment, Lily shamelessly answered, \"Oh yes, especially with that nice shade of red on it. I can't understand why you let her wear anything but her underwear Ash. Most guys would want to keep her in even less than that.\" Misty's nerves only grew at her words. That was NOT a pleasant thought. \"It's honestly no surprise that you'd have her naked little rump close by just so you could spank and grab it whenever you want.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nViolet chimed in after that. \"It does look great. Yeah, she's a bit of a runt, but she's so much fun to play with.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.\" said Daisy, \"You're a luck girl Misty, getting a man like this all to yourself.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Misty's embarrassment grew, Ash smiled. By no means was he going to admit to having any FEELINGS for Misty yet. That being said, he wouldn't deny some attraction. And talking to Misty's sisters about it was something he'd never thought he'd do. Why not start now. \"I know, I really hit the jackpot when I first yanked her undies.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, Ash, c-can I...\" Misty fumbled with her words, embarrassed to asking for permission to put her underwear on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, yeah, go ahead.\" he said, while he continued to talk to her sisters. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPutting on her new pair of panties and a new bra, Misty felt some small relief in knowing that she was once again somewhat covered. That feeling was counteracted by listening to Ash and her sisters talking about how much of a great boyfriend he was. <i>Just great, they think he's a boyfriend, and it's all because  he knows how to spank and wedgie my butt.</i></span></div></div>",

Something she didn't have to do for long, as she quickly came back with a metal spatula in hand. \"Uh, wh-what's that for?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh don't worry,\" she began, \"we're not getting to this just yet.

UGH!, stostopstopstop, pleeeeeEEE!\" In spite of her pleas and squirming, Daisy still managed to get her set in a frontal hanging wedgie. \"Ughhh, please get me down.\" she squeaked out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not just yet\" Daisy said as she gripped the back of her panties. Misty grow pale in terror. \"No! Daisy! plea-AAAAAHHH!!!\" Daisy ignored her sister's pleads and gave a very yank. She tugged harder and harder as Misty screamed louder and louder as the pain got worst and worst. She kept at it till she pulled her panties over Misty's head and *snap*. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMisty winced and whimpered as hung in a frontal hanging atomic wedgie. \"Please... no more... no more\". Unfortunately the worst had yet to come. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now now Misty, I still have to put my spatula to use.\" Misty's heart sank at her words. Quickly, the girl reclaimed the utensil and got in position to start. \"Hope you're ready for another round of swats pal, because I plan on enjoying this.\" And with that, she began raining down a barrage of spanks on her red and still sore backside. The girl trashed and squirmed in her wedgie as her butt was further blistered by the metal utensil. After about 20 swats, at which point Misty had actually tears forming in her eyes, Daisy asked, \"So, did I do a good job on you?\"     <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer voice quivering a bit, the girl answered with a quiet \"y-yes.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Might wanna give her a bit of break right now though.\" Ash said with a bit of concern while coming up to them. \"Poor girl looks like she might actually be about to cry.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlancing over at her face and then back to her glowing red backside, Daisy agreed, \"Yeah. Better give her a few minutes to rest. Think you can get her down from there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem.\" Ash answered. reaching up to the hook, he got her panties free and undid her atomic, but still kept his grip on them as he led Misty back to the couch with her sisters. \"Come on wedgie girl, we'll give you a few to get ready again.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-okay.\" Misty said, grateful for the reprieve. The girl quickly found herself laying over the laps of Ash and her three sisters on the couch. A welcome, if still degrading, position considering the last few she'd just been in. From left to right, going from the end of the couch that her legs were on to the other, Lily, Ash, Violet, and Daisy looked over her and, sharing a quick glance, they all knew what to do. Misty's rest was interrupted as Ash's and the girls' hands began to travel over her. \"H-hey, what are you YEOW!\" her attempted question was silenced as lily slapped her ass. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now now, don't go giving us any lip, we're just giving you a nice massage for tolerating us and your boyfriend.\" At this point, Ash was done thinking of correcting them on that. If they wanted to think he was dating the girl, then fine. In all honesty, it probably made his, ahem, activities with her seem less weird. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And don't worry,\" the Ash added, \"we'll be nice and gentle.\" With that said, his hands began lightly caressing her bottom. making her squirm. \"See? Nice and gentle.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLily's hands were on her thighs, squeezing them a bit. \"Hmmm, you've got some good muscle here little Misty. I guess all that traveling by foot is a good way to stay in shape if nothing else.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but she doesn't have much over here.\" Violet chimed in. One of her hands had worked under to feel her chest while the other lightly squeezed the arm closest to her. \"Not really feeling much upper strength. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but that just makes her even cuter.\" Daisy said in her defense while giving her a pat on the head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've got that right.\" Ash added, his hands still caressing her rear end. \"You enjoying yourself Misty?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, I, uh um, hnnnn...\" The girl had no idea how to describe how she felt right now. There hands definitely felt good, and she could feel a tingle going through her body, one that had her wriggling under their touches. Lily and Ash's were having the most notable, while Violet's effect on her grew as she felt her hands begin to give her back a light massage. Daisy's hand petting her head, while demeaning, left her a calming feeling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course she is.\" Lily answered for her. \"What girl wouldn't enjoy this kind of attention?\" Rubbing her thighs some more, Lily couldn't help but think of how great a day this had been. They'd all made up with Misty, they now had something new to bond over with her. <i>The next time Misty visits, I think we'll have to make it a longer stay.</i> \"You know what Misty, next to you come over you can get us back in our next wedgie war.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat next?</span></div></div>",

Actually getting some however, was where things were proving difficult for Misty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm, what do you think of these?\" Difficult in that Ash was thoroughly browsing all the options. After getting Misty to tell him what size panties she wore, and choosing to look for underoos one size smaller, he had begun his search with clear enthusiasm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCurrently, he was showing her a package that contained blue undies with pokeball prints. \"Uh, they're fine... I guess.\" the only saving grace Misty found in this was that the store currently had few people in it and their attention was not on her and Ash. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing, Ash said, \"Well, since this is the fourth time you've said that now, I'm thinking you're not going to be giving much in the way of enthusiastic replies. I guess we'll just get these, and these two.\" Presently he held three packs that each were labeled as having six pairs. The blue ones with pokeball prints and two packs that had a mix of different colors and Pokemon designs with them. <i>These should last her for a little while.</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pika Pi.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two trainers suddenly turned toward the small, electric mouse. \"Huh, what is it Pikachu?\" asked Ash. Misty's face reddened as she noticed what Ash's Pokemon was holding. \"Are those...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, these will make a great addition Pikachu.\" Ash said as he took the package of Pikachu themed underoos from the small Pokemon. \"You're certainly more helpful than Misty, that's for sure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMisty just stared in disbelief. <i>Oh come on! Now Pikachu is helping! What next?!</i> She really should have known better than to ask. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Ash tossed the underoos at her and she scrambled to catch them all. She winced and let out a few \"ows\" as her rushed actions made her still locked in wedgie worse. \"Now just go and pay for them Misty.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?!\" she whisper yelled, barely stopping herself from making too much noise and drawing attention. <i>He actually wants me to go up to the register with these things!</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, pay. As in that thing you have to do to buy things. Do I have to explain shopping to you? Now hurry up.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot wanting to make a scene, Misty did as he asked and took the underoos up to the front of the store to pay. Of course, her embarrassment increased ten-fold as she noticed the cashier was guy who looked to be in his late teens. A cute guy in his late teen. One who seemed to be struggling to hold back his giggles as he rang up her purchase and was most definitely not looking at her face as he seemed to be picturing her in the underoos she was buying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the purchase in complete, what next?</span></div></div>",

Well, I guess you can undo it now while we get you a water type.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMisty sighed in relief, glad to finally undo this awful wedgie. \"Finally.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just give me everything except your undies for safe keeping.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh come ON!\" complained the girl. \"Why do I need to do that?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmirking, Ash answered, \"When we get to the lake you'll be swimming in your panties since I'll be having you try on your new underoos once we catch a water Pokemon. Might as well get you dressed for your swim.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMisty almost did try to argue, but at the same time, she didn't want to take the chance of getting him to make her do all of this with a wedgie in place.

The underwear-clad girl turned to her companions to check on them. \"You guys okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pikachu.\" That sounded like a yes... maybe. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm fine too, just soaked. And it looks like I wasn't able to keep your clothes from getting wet either, hehe.\" Proving his point, Ash held up the girl's shorts, shirt, and the rest of the clothes that she'd handed over to him on the way over. \"On the bright side though, your underoos should still be dry in their packages.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, bright side...\" said Misty, not sounding thrilled. At that moment though, she felt the Lapras' gaze on her and turned toward her to see the young Pokemon swimming towards the edge of the water near them. her eyes not leaving Misty. \"Huh, she sure is staring a lot. Think she wants to be friends?\" Ash asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMisty just shrugged, completely unsure of what to do. \"Maybe? She might be feeling a little lonely out here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHesitantly, Misty walked toward the Lapras. Once she was right in front of her, the two locked eyes for a moment. The Lapras tilted her head, prompting Misty to do the same. Carefully, she reached out and patted her on the head, causing her to nuzzle into her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh cooed at the sight. \"Awwww, she's pretty nice.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMisty turned towards her to reply, and it was then that Lapras made her move. As soon as the girl's eyes were on the raven-head, Lapras used her teeth to grab the waistband of Misty's panties; pulling her up and tossing her into the water behind her. \"AHHHH-!\" SPLASH. The Lapras laughed as Misty's head popped back up, spitting out the water in her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You alright Misty?!\" called Ash. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, i'm Fi-ii-aaaahhhh-IIIINNNNE!\" Misty began struggling and shouting as the Lapras grabbed her panties again and began dragging her around the lake. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh couldn't help but laugh at the sight. <i>I hope she'll agree to come along with us. She could help me out whenever we're around enough water. And it would be a shame to leave her here.</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Misty's desperation to escape from being dragged around by her panties, panties that had already been stretched out throughout the day, drove her to a new tactic: Begging! \"OW! Ah! Please please sto-AHHHhhhp! Ahhhhh, UHHhh, ow, PLEASE, my panties are killing meeEEE!?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeciding she'd had enough fun, the Lapras rushed back over to the edge of the water and tossed the girl back onto dry... with the unfortunate side effect of also pulling off her panties. She did toss them back at her though, the panties landing right on her head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaying on her stomach and realizing what was on her head after a moment, Misty frantically shoved her panties down in front of her crotch, only to realize her bra slipping off! Realizing this she got into a curled up sitting position. <i>Crap, if I try putting these back on, Ash might see something.</i> True, she was only just barely keeping certain areas out of his view now. Seeing him giggling, Misty asked, \"Uhhhh, Ash... do you think you could...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore she could say anything else, the boy calmed himself and said, \"Hang on a sec nude lass.\" She blushed a deeper red than she ever had before. He didn't pay that much attention though as he turned towards the Lapras. \"Hey, how would you like to come along with us? You see, I kind of in need of a water Pokemon to help me out and I'm sure you'd like to spend more time with her.\" Hearing the offer, the Lapras nodded eagerly. \"You catch that Misty, looks like we've got a new friend.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, great...\" said the embarrassed and nude girl. <i>Just what I need, someone else to pull on my underwear and strip me.</i> \"So can look away now.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTossing her a package of her new underoos, the blue ones with pokeballs, she turned away and said, \"Sure, but since you won't need to do anymore swimming you're putting these on now.\" Groaning with more embarrassment, Misty did as he asked. In her opinion, having just these underoos on was just a small step better than complete nudity. Once she got her new underwear on, Ash gave her a once over and his opinion. \"I new I had good taste, these look juuuussst right on you.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer face still red, Misty asked, \"Can I get the rest of my clothes back now or at least also my bra?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not just yet.

Which means-\" he let go of the underoos, causing the elastic to snap back to Misty's butt, feeling like a spank.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YOWCH!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, there's that.\" Giggling, he grabbed her underoos again, yanking her off her feet and starting to spin around with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMisty yelled as her underwear tore into her backside. \"Pleeeheeease staaahhhhp!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Careful what you wish for.\" Misty grunted in pain as he pulled straight up to help stop the spinning before dropping her on her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, my butt!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And the snap back isn't the only plus.\" Sitting down on her back and using his legs to keep her arms from resisting, he took her underoos in hand once more and began pulling much harder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"UGH! Ah, owowowhowowOWOWOWOW!\" Misty squirmed beneath him, trying and failing to get free or at least make him let up. \"Please! My butt AH! feels like it's burning!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIgnoring that, that stopped pulling towards him and instead pulled her undies straight up, exposing her bare bottom. \"Oh, cute butt.\" he mumbled. Misty's blush deepened. \"Anyways, as I was saying, the other benefit of their stretchiness is that they can a lot more punishment and they'll still just...\" he released his hold of her undies, causing them to rocket down to her backside with a loud SNAP.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooowwwwwww!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...snap right back, good as new.\" he finished with a smile. \"Great right? Now we can throw away your old panties as soon as we get back to the city.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMisty, still squirming beneath him and with her butt in agony, groaned at that thought. <i>Perfect, looks like I really will be stuck with underoos now. I really can't catch a-</i> \"GAHHhhhhh!\" Her thoughts were cut off as he resumed pulling on her undies. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA thought occurred to Ash. \"And while we're at it, we'll get rid of that swim suit I saw in your bag too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ow! Wh-what?! WHY?!\" she asked, dreading the answer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because I think you'll look much better swimming in your underoos from now on, and what I say goes.\" Standing up, he pulled his mentor off of the ground by her underoos and straightened out her posture. He could just imagine what was going on in her head with his latest news delivered. \"Now, since you did so well in helping me befriending Lapras, I've decided that...\"</span></div></div>",

Of course, Ash had also decided to decided to once again lock her in a bra-connetion wedgie, pulling up the leg-holes of her underoos to the strap of her bra and hooking the legholes with the strap to keep the wedgie in and using her shirt to hide the stretched out blue material covered in pokeball prints. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere first stop after that had been to visit a Pokemon Center to make sure that Lapras was in good health. While Nurse Joy hadn't the slightest clue what a sea fairing Pokemon was doing in a lake, she was able to report that the young Lapras was in good health. After that, the pair of trainers just had one more thing to do before they could find a place to stay the night at. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do I really have to do this?\" Misty asked as she stood in front of the dumpster, holding a bag that contained all of her panties and her swim suit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh just sighed in annoyance. \"For the 3rd time, yes. Like a I told you earlier Misty, you're wearing underoos from now on.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill trying to put off the inevitable, she tried arguing, \"But isn't it a waste to just throw them out?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting annoyed, Ash's answer made the girl's choices clear. \"If you want, we can put your panties and your suit to good use tonight, and I guarantee you won't be able to wear them again afterwards.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe effect that had on Misty was obvious as she tossed the bag into the dumpster frantically. \"No!\" And with that, she was stuck wearing underoos for the foreseeable future. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinding a place to spend the night was pretty easy after that.

A task that would have been eager if she had also removed her shorts, but she was far from eager to remove her clothes again. Unfortunately, just as she started fixing them, Ash grabbed the still exposed waistband of her undies and yanked them up. \"Ah! Wh-AH-t the heck Ash?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now that we're out of sight, we can pick up where we left off earlier.\" He suddenly yanked her up off the ground by her underoos and tossed her onto her mattress. \"First things first, you're a bit over dressed for the occasion.\" In about thirty seconds he had reduced his companion to the state she was in at the lake, removing her shoes, socks, shirt, bra, and shorts. \"Perfect! Now the fun can begin. Let's start by giving you a new hat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMisty soon found herself relieving the wedgie she'd been given just that morning as Ash started hiking her underoos up to her head. \"OWWWOWOOOOWw! AHHhh, PLEASE, mercy!\" she begged as her undies began reaching her neck. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh quit whining. These are even stretchier than your old ones so I can do a lot worse.\" His eyes drifted towards one of the rungs on the bed post and a wicked idea entered his mind. \"In faaaaact...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHolding her face down on the bed, he increased the strength of his pulling. \"W-wai-OW-wait! What owwww!\" Tugging harder still, the boy yanked her underoos higher above her head until they could reach the rung and started tying the undies around it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Annnnnd therrrre weeee, GO!\" he finished, looking proudly at his work before flipping Misty over onto her back to take in her pained expression while also twisting her wedgie in tighter. \"What do you think?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AHHH! Owhowow! \" her hands reached up toward the knot, but his quickly grabbed hers and stopped her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Up up up, no ruining my hard work.\" He made sure to maintain his position on top of her to keep her from moving back and lessening the wedgie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"GAh, ugh, come on Ash.

Oh how joyous he felt that day, and how confident he was feeling that the training with his Pokemon would see them through.

Oh this was too rich for him to just ignore and pretend that he didn't see. At this point, he figured it'd be nice to shake things up a little, maybe have some fun with his dork of a friend. Plus, maybe it would teach her to pull her shorts up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaturally, Ash crept over, and reached his hands ever so slowly to where the waistband was.</span></div></div>",

Nervously, she asked, \"O-okay, so now what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, get your shorts off.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMay blushed and sputtered out a few unintelligible words at his words before getting out, \"Why? I thought you said I'd get my shorts back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, you did. And now you need to take them off for this wedgie. Or do you want me to take them off for you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat got an even brighter blush from her as she shook her head and removed her shorts, once again showing off her Teddiursa print undies. \"Wh-what now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now put those little flame undies of yours on over those.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she did that, he stepped up, grabbed the front of the red undies, and began yanking up. \"AH! Oh come on, not a frontal wedgie!\" she pleaded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not just that,\" he said as he reached around and grabbed the back of her Teddiursa print undies and yanked just as hard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"GUHAHHH! Oh please stop, stop, ah! Oh wow, that hurrrts.\" Over the next three and a half minutes, Ash pulled on and stretched May's undies until the flaming prints went over the front of her head and snapped onto the back of her head while the Teddiursa printed ones were stretched up and napped onto the front. \"uhhhh.\" she groaned weakly on the ground. \"is it over?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep, now I can get you back to your tent.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><u>What now?</u></b> <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><u>Option 2: Max sees them coming back. Does he want to help May, or is he worried he'll be next, and instead offers to help Ash with wedgieing his sister in the future?</u></b></span></div></div>",

Granted, he figured it WAS something that May had done, considering how much of a doofus he could be sometimes. He could sympathize a little bit, having been wedgied by May herself once. He remembered the one time May hung him up in that tree after making the foolish mistake that he had made, which made him clench his rear subconsciously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConsidering that incident was the only other time May had given a wedgie, he thought he'd never see her be on the receiving end... Until tonight that was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n ---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Ash had escorted May back to her tent, he walked back to the spot where he was with May. Only for him to suddenly turn his attention to a bush... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with reflexes to nearly matching Pikachu's, he suddenly reached one hand in and dragged the bookworm himself out by his shorts. Despite his best efforts to hold onto a log, Ash simply plucked him off and hefted him into the air by the seat of his shorts, just high enough to where their faces met.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMax gulped a bit as he hung in midair, his upper body dangling downwards with his arms limply by his sides... Yup, he was busted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, mind explaining to me why you were eavesdropping?\" Ash asked with a stern look, keeping him in the air by his shorts<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eavesdropping's a pretty strong word...\" said Max<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, how about I make you an offer... Unless you want end up like May?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I'm listening!\" Max nervously laughed.</span></div></div>",
