They are wrong these creatures and many other like them exist living among humans and praying on the weak, some feeding of emotions of people while others feed of humans themselves either by eating them or sucking their souls out. The angels were given the task of protecting the humans from the demons and other demonic creatures, since the dawn of time a war between the angels and demons have been going on and today this war continues. Our story begins with a young angel part of the group of angels known as defenders his name is Philip. Philip has never been the brightest of sparks but he tries his best, for fighting demons he has a sword that is nearly as long as he is but very light so he is able to hold the sword in one arm. The sword itself has a dragon head on it that covers part of the sword below the handle. To him this is just a sword that he was given by his captain but the sword is more special than he thought. As well as having that sword he also had a specially made magnum that he used  along with the sword.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the moment Philip is currently living with the lieutenant of his group who is called Lony she cares for him and the other members of the group and is sometimes a bit worried as she is not always sure if Philip can handle certain fights. She is already up where as Philip is sound asleep and yet he has to get to college to keep a low profile in half an hour. There was loud Knock on the door to Philips room that he was sleeping that made him jump and woke him up at the same time. \"Come on lazy bones it's time to get up you've got half an hour to get to that college. As Philip was half asleep he looked over at the clock on the bedside table next him and rolled his eyes as he forgot to set his alarm and quickly got up and went to go and get changed and washed and dressed. He came back into his room and was getting his bag ready when his pet dragon had woken up. \"so you finally decided to wake up then Philip?\" the dragon said. The dragon was no bigger than a rabbit and had green scales with small wings. Philip rolled his eyes \"very funny Typhon now come on your coming along as well\" Said Phil as he held his hand out so Typhon could sit on it and then Phil carefully lowered Typhon into his bag. \"Don't you think about eating my food\" Typhon Smirked as Phil ran downstairs and into the kitchen were Lony was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Phil you're not going to college with your arm like that are you?\" asked Lony as she pointed to the arm of Philips that was covered in emerald green scales like a dragon. Lony smiled and handed Phil a pair of fingerless leather gloves. Philip looked at her confused and wondering why she had given these to him. \"they have perception Filters so your arm will look like any normal human arm\" Lony said with a smile. Phil put them on and within seconds it was like his arm with the scales on it was being painted to look like a normal arm. \" thank Lony see you later\" said Phil as he Picked up a piece of toast and ran out the door.      <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Philip ran down the street as fast as he could down the street and looked at this watch realising that he only had about 15 minutes to get too the college and stopped to catch his breath. He pulled out a device that looked about a similar size to a smart phone and started using the screen. Although it looked like a smart phone it was a special GPS gadget that had been given to him by captain Angelos the captain of squad 5 and Philip's commanding officer. After a minute the device had plotted the quickest route to get to the college from where he was. Most of the time this sort of device was used by the angels to help them find the quickest route to a demon if there was one attacking a human or one that was posing a threat. As he followed the path shown on the device he ran through about 3 meadows and a few fields filled with golden yellow flowers, Philip wasn't too happy about that because it made his hay fever act up. He finally made it to the college and looked at his watch he had made it with about 7 minutes to spare so he got out a piece of paper form his pocket that told him the room his tutor would be in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked at the paper and went down the main corridor looking at the doors each having a number and a letter on. He found the room that his tutor was in he looked on the door and it said K3 and walked in. the room was quite big with computers round the edge and some desk set out in a square shape in the middle of the room, there was barely any people in the room so Philip chose one of the seats and sat down before putting his bag down and looking at his watch. The day was starting and everybody else was starting to walk into the tutor. One of the girls sat down next to Philip and smiled at him, he smiled back but didn\u2019t say anything mainly because he didn\u2019t know the girls name and he was a bit nervous as well. The tutor came in and started reading out everyone\u2019s names, this gave Philip a chance to learn the name of the girl sitting next to him and found out her name was Alex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe initial tutor period lasted about 10 minutes then after that Philip headed off to his first lesson of the day which was IT. Philip had always had an interest in IT and befriended a couple of people in his group which had made his day better and he felt less nervous. He had enjoyed the lesson even though they were just going over some of the basics to do with IT Philip was still finding it interesting and learned some new things. He mainly had IT that day but had some other lessons and it got to lunch time  and Philip wasn\u2019t sure were to go at lunch but in the end he decided that he would go the common room as it was roughly above his tutor. He was about to walk into the common room not really looking where he was going as he had his headphones on and was listening to some music and accidentally walked into someone just as they were about to walk out of the common room. \"Sorry didn\u2019t see you there\" Philip said as he pulled his headphones down from his ears. \"You should watch where you are going you could have walked into her majesty\" The other person said. The person in front of him was quite tall and had a muscular build to him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry I didn\u2019t quite get that I nearly walked into whom now?\" asked Philip who was half confused by what this person had just said to him. The person in front of him just grunted and pushed him out of the way as a girl walked passed followed by 3 other boys of a similar muscular build to the one who Philip had walked into. The girl was a bit shorter that the 4 boys that were with her with very pale skin, to Philip her walk showed that she thought she was better than everyone else and owned everything. Philips gaze was fixed on this group of people as they walked down the stairs it was as if he could feel something strange about them but he couldn\u2019t quite figure it out. He was still staring at them when Alex walked up to him and tapped him on his shoulder. Phil jumped and Alex laughed a little. \u201cAre you ok? Phil wasn\u2019t it?\" asked Alex \u201cYeah sorry just zoned out for a sec... it happens from time to time\" Phil smiled and held the door open for Alex and she nodded in appreciation before they both went to sit down and talked for a little bit while they had their lunch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIT had come to the end of the college day and Philip walked back to his house as Typhon wriggled out of the top of his bag and flew up and landed on his shoulder. Philip looked over at his shoulder and smiled, he felt that he had a good day but was still wondering about that group of people but tried to forget about it as he was a bit tired. He got back to the house and found that there was a note left on the door from Lony which read \"Phil sorry I\u2019ve got to go something important came up back at home with captain Angelos will be back in a bit there\u2019s food in the fridge also don\u2019t forget the training tonight from Lony\" Philip smiled and got went into the house put his bag down in the kitchen before getting the food from the fridge and sitting down to watch TV and relax before Lony got back. While he was finding something to watch on the TV Typhon had started eating some of the food. \"hey that\u2019s mine get your own\" Philip said Typhon smiled as Philip rolled his eyes and watched TV while waiting for Lony to return as he didn\u2019t expect her to be much longer, yet he was still thinking about the group of people earlier there was something strange about them.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was a couple of hours after Philip had got back to the house before Lony came in. She called out his name but had no reply. <br>\r\nShe went to look around the house for him and saw that he had fallen asleep in the lounge.  She rolled her eyes as she went and woke him up. <br>\r\n\"Hey! Get up lazy it's time for training,\" said Lony while she shook Philip's arm. <br>\r\nPhilip groaned and blinked a couple of times before looking over at Lony and smiling. <br>\r\n\"You all right?\" Philip asked as he sat up and stretched. <br>\r\n\"Yeah I'm good thanks, how was your first day?\" Lony asked. <br>\r\n\"It was ok thanks,\" Phil said. <br>\r\nLony smiled and walked out of the lounge and into the kitchen. She picked up a bag that was under the kitchen table. <br>\r\nThe kitchen had a modern style to it with a black marble surface top and white cupboards and draws with black tiles on the floor. She came back into the lounge and stood by the door to the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you ready to go Phil?\" she asked. <br>\r\nPhilip nodded and there was a quick flash of light. To a human who hadn't seen a transformation before the flash would be very bright. Possibly even brighter than looking directly into the sun itself. <br>\r\nPhilip had now transformed into his Angel form. He was wearing his denim trench coat along with his red sweatshirt and his white shirt underneath that. He also was wearing a pair of blue jeans along with these. He had special boots that had been designed to make it easier when running or walking over uneven terrain. <br>\r\nLony smiled as they walked out the front door, they walked a little bit away from the house before jumping to the top of a building. <br>\r\n\"So what training are we doing tonight?\" Philip asked while yawning. <br>\r\n\"We are going to do some free running,\" Lony replied. <br>\r\nThis was Philip's favourite training as he enjoyed trying to jump over the different obstacles. He usually had a bit of trouble when he was training with the rest of his squad while they were using their swords. <br>\r\nPhilip always looked up to the others in the squad as they were a higher rank than him. He struggled when fighting them sometimes, especially one of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nSo Lony and Philip started the training, jumping over the gaps between the buildings. Some gaps were nearly as wide as 10 meters. The Free running training would help Philip as it would help to improve his speed as well as increasing his jumping ability.<br>\r\nThey got to the last jump which Lony cleared perfectly. Philip looked at the gap. He guessed that the gap could have been about eleven or twelve meters wide. <br>\r\nLony cleared the jump without a moment's hesitation and Philip just stared. <br>\r\n\"Come on you it's not that far, not scared are you?\" asked Lony. <br>\r\n\"No........ it's just very far apart,\" Philip replied. He swallowed the doubt and fear that was building inside of him. <br>\r\nHe jumped with his eyes closed. He thought he had made it until he felt the edge of the roof impact with his stomach.  Lony rushed over to him to pull him up before he fell. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you ok Phil?\" she asked, quickly checking him over. <br>\r\nPhilip nodded while trying to catch his breath. His stomach ached, and every breath sent a twinge of pain through it. He knew there would almost certainly be a bruise there in the morning. <br>\r\n\"I think that's enough for this evening, you ok to get up?\" asked Lony. <br>\r\nPhilip nodded and slowly stood up while trying to catching his breath still. <br>\r\n\"Lony... What would you say if I felt a change today while I was at college\" Philip asked while looking at the floor.  <br>\r\n\"What do you mean? Energy shift, temporal shift or what?\" Lony asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"I'm not sure. I bumped into some random guy and his skin just looked really pale... he was followed by two other guys and then some girl,\" said Philip whilst shrugging, wincing slightly as his stomach gave another painful twinge. <br>\r\n\"That's strange... don't worry about it tonight. Let's just get home and get a good night's sleep,\" said Lony smiling. <br>\r\nPhilip nodded and they both headed back towards the house.  <br>\r\nLony couldn't help but think about what Philip said as they made their way back. She wondered what on earth those people could have been.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Philip got up like normal the next day. He looked in the mirror and checked his stomach from where he had hit the roof the night before. He looked at the large bruise in the mirror and thought to himself \u201cThat\u2019s going to be annoying...\u201d <br>\r\nHe shrugged and got ready for college. He went downstairs after he had got changed and said goodbye to Lony. <br>\r\nPhilip stopped just out the front door and got his headphones out of his bag and connected them to his mp3 player and made his way to college. <br>\r\nPhilip got into college earlier than he had done the day before and sat down in his tutor and waited for tutor to start.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nThe room they had their tutor in was fairly big and had tables set up in a square around the room. It also had a whiteboard on the wall, which was quite grubby from the amount of times it had been used for classes. Not long after, Alex came in to tutor and sat next to Philip and smiled. <br>\r\n\u201cYou all right Philip?\u201d asked Alex. <br>\r\n\u201cYeah I\u2019m good thanks. Yourself?\u201d Philip asked Alex back. She nodded while Philip reached down to get a bottle of water out of his bag and winced while he was bending down.<br>\r\n \u201cAre you sure you\u2019re ok?\u201d asked Alex, concerned.<br>\r\n\u201cYeah I\u2019m fine I just hurt myself last night.....I walked into a table,\u201d Philip replied hoping that Alex would believe what he had just said. Alex didn\u2019t say anything about it but just looked concerned about it.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nThe tutor came in and took the register of everyone before handing out a poster to everyone. Philip looked down at the poster and rolled his eyes, there was a school disco going on that night. He didn\u2019t despise discos he just never really liked the kind of music that they would play, he preferred to listen to rock and metal music.<br>\r\nAlex looked at him confused at the fact that he was rolling his eyes at the fact there would be a disco. <br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t you like discos?\u201d asked Alex.<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t mind discos; it\u2019s just the music that they play at discos all those stupid pop songs,\u201d Philip smiled after he said that, as it reminded him of what it used to be like back in the defenders realm.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nAlex shrugged and smiled.  The morning tutor had finished and everybody went off to their lessons.\t  <br>\r\nPhilip had his first lesson with the group of students that he saw the day before and bumped into one of them. He would occasionally look over at them and they sat in a similar way to how they walked. Two of the boys were sitting in front of the girl and one was sitting behind the girl on another desk with the girl sitting at a desk in between them.<br>\r\nPhilip couldn\u2019t shake it throughout the day he felt as if there was something off about the usual energy of the earth. As a defender Philip was taught to sense the energy of the people around him and the environment he was in. Philip had a powerful ability for detecting the energy in the environment. On the other hand he struggled with detecting changes in people\u2019s energy levels.  The energy levels of the environment occasionally spiked, he had felt a change in the environments energy when he first seen the group of people.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nPhilip had finished his lessons for the morning and made his way towards the common room but he stopped halfway up the stairs as his phone went off.<br>\r\nPhilip took his phone out of his pocket and smiled as he saw that it was Lony calling him.  He answered the call thinking she was probably just checking up on him. <br>\r\n\u201cHey Lony, you all right?\u201d asked Philip.<br>\r\n\u201cYeah I\u2019m good thanks. Look I need to talk with you as soon as I can, it\u2019s urgent. When can you get out?\u201d Lony replied.<br>\r\n\u201cI can get out now I\u2019ve finished my lessons for the morning, where are you?\u201d Philip said.<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s good. I\u2019ll be waiting outside the college by the entrance,\u201d said Lony as she ended the call.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhilip put his phone back in his pocket and quickly ran down to the reception of the college before signing out and looking for Lony by the entrance. Lony had just walked round the corner and smiled at Philip. Philip smiled back and walked over to her.<br>\r\n\u201d Good to see you Phil, anyway I think those people you told me about are possibly vampires,\u201d said Lony quietly.<br>\r\n\u201cVampires?!\u201d Philip exclaimed in a whisper.  He didn\u2019t want anyone passing by to overhear him.<br>\r\nLony nodded and handed Philip a piece of paper with some reading on it. Philip examined the piece of paper that Lony had just handed him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not one hundred percent on whether they are vampires, but that reading is close to a vampire\u2019s energy reading,\u201d said Lony.<br>\r\nAll of a sudden there was a change in the energy around them. To Philip and Lony it felt like a sonic wave had just passed by them. Philip quickly pulled his phone out of his pocket and pressed a  button on his phone that turned it into an energy tracker. Philip quickly traced the signal on his phone to the sports hall at the back of the school. Both Philip and Lony nodded towards each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait before you go Phil take this. It\u2019s a communication device that has a long range, also you know the rules don\u2019t go attacking them if you are outnumbered,\u201d said Lony, handing the device to him.<br>\r\nPhilip nodded before sprinting towards the sports hall. Philip quickly made it to the sports hall and stood outside the door and heard a girl scream. He knelt down and started saying an enchantment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWith my eyes that can see with limited vision, grant me the ability to see beyond my vision. Spell 21, Foresight,\u201d said Philip. A circle of red light formed around Philip before he closed his eyes and opened them again. His eyes had turned completely red and he looked at the door. <br>\r\nThrough the door and there was that group of people there with the girl sitting on some kind of throne and the three boys standing in front of her. He looked to the other side of the room and saw Alex, Giles and Daniel lying on the floor, unconscious but still breathing. He stood up as his eyes returned to normal. He heard a voice inside his head saying \u201cGo in and save them you fool!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhilip then heard another voice saying \u201cyou must be careful... wait for back up to arrive.\u201d<br>\r\nAll of a sudden Philip\u2019s communication device went off and it was Lony.<br>\r\n\u201cPhil, you need to wait for us to come help you, I\u2019ve contact the others. There is something strange going on, just don\u2019t try and go in alone,\u201d said Lony.<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.I\u2019m...\u201d said Philip.     <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",
