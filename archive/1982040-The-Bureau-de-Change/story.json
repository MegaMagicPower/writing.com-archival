            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span><i>*written by Tivanenk*</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah... hello, I am here for...\" You glance around towards the plastic chairs wedged into the floor of the building, your children still playfully waving their legs. You make a quick motion with your hand, beckoning them to come to your side. The two quickly jump off their seats and scamper to you \u2013 your daughter from excitement, your son from fear. \"...my daughter Jane here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's the purpose of your visit?\" The teller states, his eyes shifting downward to meet the sky blue eyes of the 16 year old blonde girl. You hesitate, also shifting your eyes downwards, begging her to change her mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mon, dad! Let's do it! A bet's a bet!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUngrateful, little brat. You think, your milky white teeth grinding from anger, your eyes narrowing in response. You work, so that you may feed her, pay for her clothes and her school, and this is how she treats you? Why, oh why did you take the bet in the first place? It was an innocent little thing, a cute quirk. You didn't really think she would be able to win the National Girl's High School Tennis Championship \u2013 she just began playing a year ago, for crying out loud! But the inner talents of your daughter betrayed your expectations as you currently stood in the massive complex of the Repository.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh... I am here to trade my genitals with my daughter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe uninterested teller simply nods in response. \"Certainly. Do the both of you have registered accounts?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. She's under mine \u2013 a child's account. Account ID should be 7778403942. Could you confirm?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's see. 7778403942... yes. She is registered under the user ID 5389342080. George Brooks, I assume?\" He confirms on the bright screen of the monitor, before turning back to you. \"May I see your ID?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don't say anything in reply, reaching into the pockets of your jeans to promptly fish out the slim tri-fold wallet. A quick glance at your driver's license and it is given back to you, before a series of clicks of the keyboard resound through the air, the fingers navigating through the various menus and icons on the screen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everything's ready. Just enter your pin and hit Enter.\" You nervously punch in the password to your account, glancing back to your daughter, the excitement still visible on her face. You sigh, wondering how you ever got into this predicament. A quick press of the button and you feel your hefty 10 inch penis slowly pull within your body, feeling it disappear and forming the birth canal, along with the uterus, ovaries, and Fallopian tubes. You groan almost immediately as you feel something gushing out of your newly found vagina, sticking to your new briefs. You know what it is: blood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes flick to the body of your daughter, noticing that it looked no different other than the very tight and noticeable bulge within her short shorts. Very noticeable. Devious brat, you think, wincing from the pain shooting through your stomach. She just had to give you her vagina on the day of her period, ruining your brand new underwear and bringing you misery.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that all for today?\" The receptionist asks, remaining as monotone and apathetic as ever. Sometimes you even wonder if the people who work for these companies have things called \"morals\" and \"ethics\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah... I think we're... oof...\" You grunt, the prickling feeling returning back to your stomach as you keel over from the pain. It was like a rapid waterfall torrent was coming from your crotch, the liquid penetrating the thin fabric of your underwear to seep into your jeans. The stain had instantly become recognizable, the dark spot clearly visible to all observers around you. Jane was snickering while your 14 year old son tilted his head, his green eyes scrunching in confusion as the matted brown hair followed his every motion, the wind cutting through it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dad, whats wrong?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou only throw a sharp glance towards the little tyke as you groan once more, your knees buckling on the spot as you unsuccessfully attempt to stop the flow of period blood by clenching your legs. Only a moment of silence goes by before the teller interrupts your little dance. \"Sir? Is there more to your visit or shall I call help in escorting out of the blood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUngrateful stooge. You think, finally seeming to stop the blood from seeping through the fabric by creating a pocket of air in your underwear where the blood pooled, collecting slowly in a crude-made vessel. All these companies were worried about one thing: profit, and nothing else. Customer satisfaction, problem resolution, nothing else mattered to them. Not that that was that bad, after all, it meant that transactions were conducted in a swift and efficient manner. But you were quite peeved about his attitude towards you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou groan as the cramps settle in, stinging your stomach like a scorpion's tail, bringing with it a never-ending pain. How did you daughter operate under these conditions? No wonder that she always gets moody whenever it's that time of the month. Speaking of conditions, how will you function in this situation, steering your refined blue Ford Focus through the chaotic traffic as the other vehicles blur past while hastily trying to avoid your swerving as you fight off the vicious cramps?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou glance back at your children, Jane excitedly grabbing at your (well, her's now) crotch - squeezing it in very rapid motions - and your son Michael, looking bored as he looks at the drab, white ceiling. You furrow your eyebrows, disgusted by the displayed attitude. Here you are, suffering in great pain, while he looks completely nonchalant, like he doesn't even care! You bring home the food, pay for his clothes and shelter underneath the roof of your house, yet this is how he treats you?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA light bulb suddenly goes off in your head, illuminating the far ends with rapidly-flowing ideas. Perhaps your son needs to be taught a lesson. Maybe it was the video games influencing his thoughts, twisting them into ones that dare rebel against his parents. Clearly, he needs to be taught a wise lesson; a lesson of utmost respect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, I would like to transfer my son Michael' masculinity and 25 years of his life into my account for safekeeping. I think it's time to teach him how to manage assets.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael's eyes widen as the clerk briefly nods his head, mouthing 'Certainly', before beginning to scribble with an electronic pen onto some touch pad. \"But dad, I don't want to!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Quiet, boy! Your mother and I have discussed it and have agreed that we should teach you something called investment. I want you to realize that this is for your greater good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, sir, a transfer is not considered an\u2013\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Be quiet while I give my son a lesson, please,\" you say, the hurried scribbling resuming pace as you give the teller a stink-eye. \"Anyway, you better follow what I say, or I will not let you play Hyper Luigi Universe!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour car races along the highway, you now-smooth hands controlling the wheel with meticulous precision. Ah, the joy of youth! How you missed it. No creaking sounds of the bones, no balding head, no wrinkly skin. Just your handsome self at the young age of 20, and a hefty 8-inch penis between your legs, rubbing against the car seat as the car sputters back and forth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, stop it!\" A high-pitched voice interrupts your concentration. A quick look in rear-view mirror shows that Jane's hand is steadily creeping at the thigh of your son. A meaty thigh, turning the heads of any man that gazes at it, connected to a well-endowed rump. You are quite surprised by how he turned out, he certainly made a better woman than man!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://i.redditmedia.com/lq3KA9TJ5MHhcfYf0Gk-eGd7B8szRvLGxN-Za70b_60.jpg?w=575&amp;s=14caf977478e14df0c81076dfac0d89a\" target=\"_blank\">https://i.redditmedia.com/lq3KA9TJ5MHhcf...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, sorry!\" Your daughter Jane apologizes, clapping her hands together. \"You just don't how aroused I am right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever! I just want to play Hyper Luigi Universe!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or we could play in my room...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour attention turns away from the children as your car torpedoes out of the highway, navigating the narrow maze of streets and roads. A left turn, and you can see your house right ahead, smoothly drifting into the parking spot. As you hop out of the car, you reckon that you should probably explain Jane's and Michael's situation to your wife before she sees them, to minimize the damage if nothing else.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>First thing's first, you will have to see about buying your daughter more appropriate clothing, you think as you peer into the rear view mirror. She is wearing the ass-hugging leggings now popular among girls her age, clothing that you hardly approved of when you set off for the Bureau, less so now that she is wearing your penis between her legs. The tight stretchy fabric adheres obscenely to all seven inches of her engorged manhood and hugs snugly around each of her sagging, forty-five year old testicles. The head of the thing gives a little quiver each time her hand creeps a little further up your son Michael's leg, her fingers tip-toeing their way higher like a spider creeping towards a fly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Ah well. Like father, like daughter,</i> you chuckle, savoring the feel of your own new cock, satisfied that you have at least an inch or two over her still. It feels fantastic. Though your entire body is brimming with the energy of youth, your cock in particular is just overflowing with spunky virility. Currently commando for comfort's sake (you had slipped your Y-fronts off in the Bureau's toilets), you sense every thrum of the engine through the car seat. You flick the button for the heated seats and feel a pleasant warmth begin to permeate your private parts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho the hell knew that Michael had so much masculinity hidden inside him? Your own son, your weedy, bookish young son, has been carrying around a small fortune in masculinity all this time, 23,460 masculine-credits. On the open market, you wouldn't be surprised if it would have sold for enough to pay off the mortgage. What a waste, he had never truly used it - neglecting sports for study, and you're not sure if he's ever even had a girlfriend. It's good parenting of you indeed to take all that wasted potential and invest it where it can be of some use.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a brief moment you wonder if they left any masculinity in him, but a quick look back is enough to reassure that he is truly cleaned out. The human body is a curious thing - possessing the potential from birth to be either male or female, there but for a tweak of hormonal chemistry. Such a fact is evident in how women given testosterone can become male and vice versa with men and estrogen. There is always some aspect of the opposite sex in the background, the anima or animus if you will, subtly influencing the biology and behavior, and which if not for the other dominant aspect would come to the fore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd come to the fore it has with Michael. With not even two credits of masculinity to rub together, all that is left is 100% woman. And quite some woman at that. The boy must have been hiding quite a stash of femininity credits in his DNA. A pity you can't bank those too, though to deprive a person of both masculine and feminine attributes leaves them as sexless individuals, listless, strange things devoid of the aspects or organs of either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wonder what other attributes he has hidden under his unassuming facade. The kid could have mountains of untapped Strength or Fertility. He could be a positive gold mine. Next time you're at the bureau, you will get them to do a full financial breakdown of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCertainly he has come into possession of a nice handful of Cup-sizes, you realize, your gaze shifting southwards to the breasts that are squeezed into his Mario and Luigi t-shirt - mature breasts, maternal breasts, breasts that could feed sextuplets if they had to. Already there are two dark, wet circles spreading across the fabric of his t-shirt above his wide, fat nipples - the boy, suddenly thrown into the age and sex of a grown woman, is lactating like a new mother. You weigh those swollen orbs in your mind's eye, estimating them to easily be DDs, each cup-size worth a month's pay. And productive too. Dairy farms will pay good money for attributes like that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDistracted by the view in the rear view mirror, the car hits the curb as you pull into your driveway, setting those bountiful breasts a'jiggle like his mother's trifle. At the same moment, as your eyes flit up to focus on parking, Jane's hand darts upwards, finding its goal between his legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're here!\" Michael squeaks suddenly, almost leaping from his seat. Jane looks up in surprise and break into a grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, we're home! I can't wait to show mum!\" she crows, leaping out of the car almost before it has come to a halt and dashing for the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had started to get dark after a long day on the high-street. Your headlamps illuminate the peeling paint of the garage door as you pull up in front of it. Twisting in your seat, you say \"Mind getting the door for me, champ?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSullenly he nods and slinks out of the car, walking with an awkward gait round to the front of the car and twisting the handle on the garage door. As he bends down to lever his fingers under the door and heft it upwards, you give a low whistle to yourself. \"Mikey Mikey Mikey, where have you been hiding <i>that</i> all these years,\" you whisper to yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://i.imgur.com/fRG84MF.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://i.imgur.com/fRG84MF.jpg</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBent over, caught smack-bang in the beam of the headlights of your car, his big, plump buttocks waggle back and forth as he strains to lift the garage door. \"We need to get you measured up,\" you mutter to yourself, unable to tear your eyes away from the resplendent wealth in each of those juicy ass-cheeks. \"For a keister like that, I could get a new bathroom or kitchen installed. Just a question of getting him to part it- part <i>with</i> it, I guess,\" you ponder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen it occurs to you - as his father, his assets are yours! If you want to sell, for his good of course, you can in a heartbeat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally he manages to get his shoulder under the garage door and strains with all his weak might to lift it up fully. Shielding his eyes against the light of the car, he steps to the side, waiting. He looks like he has a question for you. You pull the car into the garage and climb out, and he steps closer, his eyes full of concern.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As Michael leaned down to grasp the edge of the garage door, he felt his breasts swing pendulously inside his shirt, hanging and swaying from his chest. He wanted to pin them down with his arms but the door was far heavier than he remembered (no, he was just weaker, he realised in disgust), and he needed both hands just to lift it up a few inches. He could feel the harsh glare of the headlights against his rear and felt suddenly and strangely exposed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was hard work getting the door open. He strained and panted, setting his stance wider, and eventually managed to get his shoulder under it. It swung up on it's rusty runners. Sure it was rusty, but a few hours before he would have been able to do it with one hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he straightened up, he felt the cool evening air blow over him and an odd, cold wetness upon his chest. Shielding his eyes against the glare of the car, he glanced down to see the two dark circles of moisture just over his nipples. He felt sick. He was... leaking. Holding his hands over his breasts to hide his shame, he stepped aside to allow his father to pull the car into the garage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis dad stepped out of the car, pushed, pushed his hand between his legs to rearrange himself better, before pocketing the keys. He stepped closer, a certain youthful swagger to his movements. It was the first time in a year, ever since his growth spurt, that he found himself looking up at his father. There was only one question burning in his mind. \"How long do I have to be like this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How long? How long is a piece of string, Mikey? Answer: as long as I want it to be,\" he said, a cocksure grun springing to his face. \"Have you never heard of compound interest?\" Numbly Michael shook his head, already feeling as though he wouldn't like the answer.\"Alright, let me explain,\" George said, placing a paternal arm around the boy's shoulders and leading him to the house. \"Right now your youth - 25 years of your life that is- along with every last bit of your masculinity is resting in an account, earning a return of about 2% a year. You know what that means? A year from now those 25 years will have accrued a whole six months of extra life for you to use, not to mention the boost in masculinity you'll get.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But that doesn't sound much at all for a year.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't interrupt me when I'm talking, boy,\" George snapped. \"Sure, six months might not be a fortune, but the beauty of compound interest is that after a year you'll be earning it on that too. So that twenty-five-and-a-half-years become twenty-six-and-a-bit years, do you see? You earn a little bit on that extra half year too. And every year it gets more and more until-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"'Every year'?\" Michael repeated in disbelief, his hand covering his mouth in horror. \"Yu-you didn't say that I would have to be like this for <i>years</i>. I don't want this, I don't want to be old like you. I don't want to be a wo- a wom-\" he spluttered off into shamed silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeorge glowered at the ingrate with growing fury. \"Unbelievable. You do your best for your kids and this is the thanks you get. Talk about ingratitude,\" he spat, sucking air through his clenched teeth. \"Do you think I like this, Mikey? Huh? Do you think I like seeing my own son like this, having to go without? Do you think I want to see my son having to miss out on some of his best years, on the joys of being a man? Of course I don't. Damn it, Mikey, if it were up to me you'd have a million years in the bank and a thousand IQ points, but you don't, so we have to work in the system to give you the best future we can. That's just how the world works. Don't blame me, blame the Wall Street fat-cats sat up there in their ivory towers, taking everything and leaving the scraps for us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But what about school. I can't go to school like this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"On the contrary, you can't afford to not go to school as anything else,\" George said sternly. \"Sooner or later your classmates are going to get Bureau accounts of their own and, once they start banking their attributes, if they're earning interest and you're not they'll soon get ahead of you. In a few years they couldd graduate college with ten or fifteen percent more IQ points that you do, and that's a massive headstart in the world of work.\" He placed a comforting hand on Mike's shoulder. \"Look, Mikey, I don't mean to be harsh but you're already not the sharpest knife in the drawer. You don't have spare IQ to invest, so you need to work with what you've got. Your manhood and your 25 years are going to have to stay in the bank. You can't have your cake and eat it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I don't <i>have</i> my cake, and neither does the bank,\" Michael pouted. \"<i>You</i> have my cake and <i>you're</i> the one eating it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeorge bristled with indignation. \"If you're trying to suggest that I'm doing this for my own interests, you couldn't be further from the truth. Your years are resting in my account only until I can decide on the most appropriate savings plan. You'll get better returns if you agree to lock in your investment for a set period, say five or ten years.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Te-ten years?\" Michael stuttered, eyes going wide. He did some quick arithmetic on his fingers. \"But then I'd be nearly-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fifty, yes, but with compound interest you'd barely have aged a day. You will come out the other end of this still a young, more masculine man.\"</span></div></div>",

Winifred was backed up against the kitchen counter with no place to run as the cock wobbled about just inches away. The wardrobe finally had its malfunction as the excited member finally bounced free of the stretched fabric. Winifred swatted wildly with the rolling pin, and Jane gave a howl of pain, crumpling to the ground, clutching her new manhood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let that be a lesson for you,\" Winifred stated, primly straightening her ruffled cooking apron before turning her fury on her husband. \"How could you have been so irresponsible, actually going through with it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A bet is a bet. It's only for a few weeks,\" he said apologetically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"'Only'? Have you not considered how much mischief your daughter can get up to in a few weeks. \"She lowered her voice so only her husband could hear. \"She could barely keep it in her pants before, now <i>it</i> literally won't fit in her pants. All I can say is, thank goodness you got the snip.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeorge thought for a moment before saying, \"Well <i>I</i> did.My Fertility rating was 0, sure, but now it's using Jane's Fertility rating.\" He realised then that he'd said too much as a look of horror appeared on his wife's face at the thought that her wayward daughter was now a fully-functioning, fertile man, though it quickly gave way to a strange, faraway look, as though she was contemplating something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You realise if your daughter got somebody pregnant, it would be your child...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good grief, I didn't think of that. I'd best give her the same talk I gave to Michael.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, maybe I should do that, dear, mother-to-daughter\" she said quickly, and George was relieved to be free from the awkwardness of doing <i>The Talk</i> again. He gave a chuckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"While you're on it, you may need to have a chat with your \"son\" too.\" He stepped aside and Winifred looked past him to the woman her own age who was experimentally poking at her breasts while nobody was looking. Michael hurriedly forced the look of despair of his face as his mother approached him with a deep intake of breath, as though she was about to-</span></div></div>",

We're practically twins! How much did you bank? Ten, twenty Years?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Twenty five Years, actually,\" George piped up. His wife gave him a look, only not noticing the dramatic reduction in his years. She gave him a look of 'we can have fun with that later' before turning back to her son. \"That's amazing, we're practically the same age now! This is going to be so much fun having you around the house!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But mom, I don't know if I want this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nonsense, this makes so much financial sense.

I might have to make a bit of a withdrawal myself if we're to be sharing the same wardrobe. Hmm, I might need to be looking at a bit of an upgrade up there as well, you're quite a woman...\" she mused, eyeing up her sons rack with a suspicion that he might be at least a cup size larger than her. It wasn't anything the Bureau couldn't fix though - they offered an account pooling service, where two or more people's attributes could be averaged out, giving each party equal Years, Beauty, Intelligence, and so on. It was sometimes used for married couples that wanted to share everything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're sharing the same clothes?\" Michael gasped glumly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, we're going to be sharing far more than that, girlfriend!\" she tittered. \"Make-up tips, cooking tips, juicy gossip! It's going to be so refreshing having a woman my own age around the house for once. We're going to be the best of friends.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeorge smiled. He had been concerned his wife would have shut this whole learning exercise down, which she would have had the legal authority to do as his other parent or guardian. Maybe he'd get to have a little fun with the boy's misspent Youth after all.</span></div></div>",

There is a hastily written note there - 'grandmother had another fall again. Been admitted, going to see her, back in a week hopefully.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerfect. Your mother-in-law has had a series of nasty tumbles the last few years, and her stays in hospital have only gotten longer each time, with your wife forced to drive across the country and stay with her for the days or weeks she was admitted. Even after discharge, your wife tended to stay around for days to help with cooking and cleaning until she's confident her mom is able to take care of herself again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of you have talked at length about buying the old woman a few more years, perhaps reducing her to a healthy 50-year-old, maybe even just temporarily until she could recuperate physically or emotionally, but the cost of purchasing the precious lifespan-extending credits at the Bureau has always been too much.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Ever since you were little, you've been told to avoid the Bureau. '<i>It's dangerous</i>', your parents said, speaking of the Bureau in the same breath as they would drugs, knife crime and unprotected sex. As you were told, the Bureau is like a casino but even worse, as in the Bureau you don't just gamble with money, you gamble with the very gifts god gave you, which itself is a sin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe message has been reinforced at school too. In your Humanities class, you studied the effect the Bureau's unethical practices have had on less developed countries, where poor people have traded everything they have, everything they are, just in exchange for the money to put food on the table. Many gave away decades of life to the Bureau for basic medical treatment, and entire swathes of sub-saharan Africa have been rendered prematurely aged - the inhabitants trapped in an endless cycle of poverty - too poor to buy back their health and youth, too old and infirm to work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn fact, the Bureau has been so demonised that, as your father pushes open the door and you step inside, you half-expect the rows of tellers to be occupied by Ursula from the Little Mermaid, signing contracts in blood and snatching away people's voices with their tentacles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead, it just looks like a bank. There is a calm, professional air of business as the tellers attend to the customers, occasionally conversing quietly, pushing across slips of paper to be signed (in ink) or small mounds of coins. There is a queue of customers waiting to be served, to which you both join the end of. Next to the queue stands an electronic sign listed various attributes and a number next to each one illuminated in either red or green. The red numbers are minuses, the greens positive. Every now and then, the numbers refresh and change slightly. Dad takes a glance at the numbers and scratches his chin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, the markets are looking very unsettled today. Dexterity is down almost 4.5%, although Sense-of-humour is doing well,\" he mutters to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYeah, your parents <i>had</i> been totally against the Bureau, emphasis on had. That all changed a few months ago on your mother's birthday when your dad traded in a whole lot of money to buy your mom a neat stack of Beauty. Overnight your mum had become the most drop-dead gorgeous stunner on the school run, and the Bureau had transformed from a place of ill-repute to merely a place of transaction. \"When you think about it, it's the most charitable thing you can do, giving of yourself\" you father had said sagely. \"Why, there are people out there who never had the benefit of your birth, who weren't born strong or quick or clever. Who are you to say that they don't deserve the same opportunities as others? To give to the Bureau is to help others, and that's the Christian thing to do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour parents have never been consistent in their rules, though the turn-around on that one had almost given you whiplash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith nerves growing in your stomach, the queue shuffles forward. You're sure you don't want to be here. Dad gives you a pat on the shoulder. \"Don't look so concerned, boy, there's nothing to be worried about here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But what if I mess up. My friend at school says people can lose legs in here, or come out without any faces. I've even heard Jessica's uncle ended up... bankrupt,\" you utter in hushed tones. \"They say that there was so little left when they were done with him, they took him away in a flask.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Total nonsense,\" dad tuts. \"The Bureau is heavily regulated, they can't just drain somebody dry just because they fall behind on payments. Besides, as long as you are using it responsibly, there is no risk, no risk at all! Only trade in what you won't miss and only withdraw as much as you can afford. Live within your means, as I've always told you to do, and the Bureau will be good to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>You mean like you did with mom's present?</i> you think. Ever since her birthday, we've been eating beans on toast and ramen noodles, and the hole in the roof still hasn't been fixed. Neither of them would ever let on but you suspect that your parents are in pretty bad financial straights.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Till number 7 please'. The next in the queue moves to the teller that sits beneath the illuminated number 7. He is an old man, crooked and bent, and moves with agonizing creaks of his arthritic knees, yet he wears the jeans, hoodie and sneakers of a much younger man. The teller and him talk through the glass panel until the customer is instructed to place his left hand in a slot in the front of the desk and enter his pin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly the man keys in his pin number with the swollen, gouty fingers of his right hand and presses enter. There is no dramatic flash of light or fanfare as the transaction completes, only the subtle silvering and shedding of his hair, the creak as his osteopenic spine bends a little more. You suspect he has deposited about six months. He peers closer with fading eyesight at the teller counting out a dozen or so crisp, bank notes before collecting them with trembling hands and stuffing them into his pockets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad is watching him with a rather nervous look on his face. \"There are of course those who do not manage the services provided by the Bureau very well,\" he concedes. \"Not through any fault of the Bureau of course the Bureau can't <i>force</i> anybody to do anything. They're usually just people with pre-existing problems, be it gambling or drugs. People who lack the self-control or intelligence to avoid loans they have no chance of repaying, or just don't have the work-ethic to maintain a job with which to keep up repayments.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I just have a paper-round, how do I repay anything?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad grins. \"Repayments are only for loans. This is the first time you've set up an account, so you're free to trade in what you don't want and buy outright the things you do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Till number 5 please'. It is your turn. You step up to the counter. \"Good morning, welcome to the Bureau. How can we help you today?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I would like to set up a child's account for my son here linked to my own,\" dad says. \"I'm here to teach him about saving for his future.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe teller nods. \"Righto, sir, if you'd just like to enter your pin.\" Dad taps in a number. \"And then if he'd just like to place his hand into the machine...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA little slot opens in the front of the desk, revealing what looks to be a hand-scanner. Nervously, you place your hand upon it. It is warm and seems to adhere to the skin of your palm as a laser light washes back and forth over it. \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excellent, that's just taking a scan now and should have his account set up in a few minutes,\" the teller says. \"Is there anything else I can do for you today?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad nods. \"As a matter of fact there is. Would it be possible to-\"</span></div></div>",

We only facilitate transfers, not give recommendations.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTutting his disapproval, dad twists his head to the board of flickering figures and glances down them. \"Well the Japanese look is certainly not in vogue right now... Indian has seen good gains but has probably reached a platuea. Oh, what the heck, African is going cheap ever since those new branches opened in Nigeria. Yes, he'll take African, thank you, and we'll take the remainder to spend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excellent choice, sir,\" the teller intones, pressing a few buttons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA jolt passes into your palm from the pad, setting the hairs on your arm standing up. Your skin tone has always been pale. Every holiday you've ever been on, your pasty skin has always come back a bright lobster red rather than tanning at all. But as the strange sensation buzzing through your flesh strengthens, the skin on your arm starts to turn a golden brown. The hairs on the back of your arm, once a light, blondish fuzz, darken too. \"Wh-what's happening?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First things first, it's important to diversify your portfolio,\" dad explains, as the changes spread over the rest of your body. \"One of the most volatile markets is the Racial markets. Their relative value goes up-and-down depending on all sorts of factors, mostly fashion. You know, supply and demand. Now obviously you don't want to put all your eggs in one basket. If the value of Caucasian crashed tomorrow, you'd be out of pocket. By spreading out your traits, you're more protected from the vagaries of the market. Plus the Bureau's recent push into a number of African countries has pushed the price to an all-time low as they all rush to cash in, meaning you can trade in 50% and still have a profit to spend!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would you like a mirror?\" the teller asks, flipping up a hand-mirror that sits on his desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was still you of course. The face looked exactly the same, just.... a little different. Your skin was a light brown. Your hair was black and seemed to coil higher on your head as it settled into a curlier configuration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm black!\" you exclaim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Half-black,\" you dad corrects. He gives a nervous glance around as your voice carries through the room. \"And try not to sound too aggrieved, son, people might get the wrong idea. We wouldn't want people thinking you're a racist now, would we?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And here's the rest,\" the tellers says, pushing 6 silver coins over the desk. \"Sixty Change Coins - may be spent on any trait you want at the Bureau. If you'd like that in fiat currency, there is a 5% fee on top.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Change coins will do fine,\" dad nods.

Not too shabby. Would you like to make a deposit of that as well? Though we're unable to advise, I can say that it has been moving excellently on the markets recently - over a 15% gain in the last two days.

Shorter and shorter it became, until it was nothing more than a stub. But it didn't stop there. First it became nothing and then... minus. It became an empty hole, a few inches deep, then more, as he felt it growing further and further up inside him.

There was something quite addictive about it. Michael began to grow before his eyes as the deduction of Youth added years to the boy, speeding him through puberty. It was like looking at a time lapse as he grew taller and lankier, a rash of acne spots jostling across his face is super sped-up fashion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut that wasn't all that was growing. The boy's Cup balance racked up as the converted Youth flowed into it. 1 Cup. 2 Cups. 3 Cups. More! A pair of perky nubs formed on his chest beneath his t-shirt, swelling like balloons into a perky pair of A-cups, then ballooning into fine Ds. The t-shirt gave out with a rip as the fine assets burst free for all to see. Michael was pulled forwards under their weight, until the generous orbs rested on the teller's desk, a few inches from his keyboard. One of those cheap bank pens was swallowed up between them, metal chain and all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing?!\" Michael was shrieking. \"Stop it, I look like a freak!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have to diversify, Mikey. There's not many boys your age who would be able boast a set of assets like those. Cups are a rock-solid investment. Sure, their value may drop at times, but they always bounce back!\" he chuckled at his joke, the teller joining him.</span></div></div>",

If I might offer a personal suggestion, one of the most effective means in cutting down on living expenses is to cut down on the amount of you need to feed and clothe. In other words, a smaller person requires smaller portions of food. Remember, something half the heigh weighs only an eighth of the amount, and correspondingly only requires an eight of the food! Why, reduce them enough and you could feed your entire family on a grain of rice for a week, dress them in dolls clothes, and even home them in a shoebox. The savings in heating alone would be hundreds of dollars a year!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the mention of the heating bill, George's eyes glittered excitedly. He and Michael frequently fought over the thermostat, with the boy determined to heat not only the entire house but seemingly the outside as well! Not to mention the teenage boy consumed huge amounts of food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Absolutely, take 50% off the top!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael yelped as his lanky teenage body began to dwindle, soon five feet and still shrinking. His breasts shrank too, however their weight remained firmly planted on the counter, even as Michael's height became less than the height of the counter, his toes leaving the floor until he dangled from the counter. George guffawed as his tiny legs kicked the air, and his tiny fist ponder the counter, now certainly nothing more than 3 feet. George very much doubted if Mikey had been this short since his second birthday.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy's clothes however, did not shrink. His trousers slid from around his diminshed waist to crumple on the floor, with his t-shirt (which had been baggy to begin with) soon followed. Fortunately the Bureau was quiet at this time, though what few heads were there quickly turned to see the sight of the bare ass of the  doll-sized teenage dangling from the counter, hand still resolutely glued to the scanner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's 2' 8\" of height, which comes to 258 Change,\" the teller smiled. \"Would you like that to go, or as something else?\"</span></div></div>",

I come from a family of wealth and means!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael meanwhile could feel the tightness of the skin there, and the weight of his new, juicy, 258-Change derriere which hung from him.

Red-faced he turned to see the mother shushing the young toddler, who was pointing excitedly up at Mike's exposed nether regions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom the mouth of babes comes truth. Even a child could tell that Mike had negative Cock where his manhood should be, that the Brooks family was clearly in heavy Cock debt! For all his wealth of Tits and Ass, it would be obvious to anybody that they had been purchased by a serious Cock deficit. The shame of it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was really only one thing to be done... He placed his hand on the second hand-scanner, which loaded his own account details onto the monitor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please transfer all of my son's manhood into my own personal account.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe numbers of Mike's account began to tick down, slowly at first but picking up speed, as his flailing legs became more frantic. At the same time, George felt a rush of energy as the total in his began to creep up. It was like a rush of blood to his head, and he grasped the counter to stop himself falling. He felt his aged love-handles and beer belly tighten into thick bands of muscle and defined six-pack. He felt a fine, thick stubble of an early lumberjack beard pushing its way through the skin of his chin, which grew broader and more angular. His features hardened into a stony, masculine mask. All of his body he felt muscles throbbing into new life as his Male score finished doubling, but where he felt it most of all was in his manhood, which throbbed and widened and grew, until the front of his pants bulged outwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnable to control himself, he grabbed his new mighty manhood excitedly. He knew others were watching but he didn't - <i>fuck those guys</i>, he thought in a testosterone fueled haze.<i> I do whatever I want, whenever I want, and if they have a problem with it they can fight me.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichaels screams of complaint had been shrill ever since his size reduction, but now they took on a new, even higher pitch as every last shred of masculinity was forcefully sucked out of him. The tits and ass, which had previously looked out of place and bolted-on to his angular, lanky male frame now began to fit him better, as his hips and thighs broadened to match his juicy ass, and he waist narrowed. His back had been forced into a power-straight upright, military stance by the Poise injection but now it began to arch into a graceful feminine curve that served to show off the swell of his ass. It was the sort of beautiful curve that served as a runway for the eyes, drawing the gaze down to focus on the prime assets.</span></div></div>",

Your dad only grunts in affirmation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can't really see over your dad's shoulder: despite him being lanky and slim (he hates hitting the gym), he is a good head and a half above you. Of course, you know that you will reach that height (and hopefully outgrow) quite soon, but it still slightly bothers you that you can't see what he wants with you. All you want is to return home and launch up some video games on your Xbox Two, and hopefully meet up with your girlfriend soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaty. Your sister (and dad) were incredibly surprised when you brought her home that day, after a slow walk in the park (suggested by her). They had always considered you a 'dweeb' and 'nerd', and they didn't hesitate to hold their tongues, which caused great frustration from your mother as you conflicted with them. Despite wearing the traditional round glasses that all nerds do (no, they weren't broken), you yourself looked quite... atypical for one. Even though video games were the pinnacle of your life, you never skipped your legwork... nor \"armwork\", for that matter, always spurred on by your mom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou glance at your dad once more, standing there and flicking through the digital touch screen catalog that has been presented to him. You know that the power has gotten to his head, trying to steer you in a direction that he wants. A direction that you are quite sure is spurned by envy and anger. Why else would he be picking you out deposits instead of your sister? It has to be that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou glance rightward in the direction of the neighboring till and see a man walking up to it -- tall, pot-bellied, and broad-shouldered, like a dresser, -- clicks on the menu a couple of times, takes a wad of cash out of his pocket, and hands it over to the teller. A minute goes by, and he suddenly grows about two inches in height, and about the same in broadness. You roll your eyes. When will those types realize that girls nowadays weren't looking for pinnacles of masculinity, as it has become extremely easy to buy up height and weight in the modern market. Something you seem to understand better than your father, as he constantly salivates over the two properties.

Your dad wasn't one to ask hypotheticals, so you weren't quite sure what he was referring to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, of course,\" you answer the no-brainer question.

Normally, the tellers wouldn't accept that as evidence. After all, to give up your humanity and animation requires serious permission from the one it is being done to. In fact, it is the only regulated trade option by government. The queue for it is long, and it is worth its weight in gold. Literally. One could get millions if he gives up his humanity and animation. Oh how many homeless turned millionaire stories there are. But few non-poor people went for it, for obvious reasons. The regulations are tight. And you just notice the teller press a button.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDid he pay the teller off? Or was it someone he knew?

If anything it is increased, as if all your senses have been condensed into a much smaller space. With a wiggle of your length, you feel every individual fiber of the carpet rubbing against you with enough detail to be able to count the strands. Despite that are laid horizontal upon them, there are not many, only a few dozen, and you calculate your final size comes to only a few inches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last of your human heat ebbs away as the figures tick slowly to a stop - $425,526. The price of a human - or at least a strong, white, male human - stripped totally of its humanity and vital attributes, left with the smallest shred of animation. There is a look of utter joy on his face - he is set for life and all it took was the sacrifice of another one. The teller reflects his grin. \"How would you like it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Give me a moment to catch my breath,\" he chuckles, almost speachless. \"Right. Yes, I'd like $50,000 wired to my mortgage account, $100,000 to my current account.\" He paused, staring down at his scrawny, awkward body - a body that had begun to show the ravages of aging just as Michael had started to grow into his manhood.

Happy to help you today. Will there bee anything else today?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad scratches his stumble and turns around to look at the ticker of current prices, the chewing-studded underside of his loafer looming over you as he does so. You try to wriggle your body out of the way but it is no good - his foot crushes down on you with all his weight and you give a pained scream that comes out only as an odd hum of protest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad steadies himself against the desk. He had almost slipped on the tubular thing lying there on the floor, the son that he had already forgotten about. He raises his foot and stares down at the dildo. It is seven inches of purple, veiny rubber, and it is currently vibrating against the carpet. Who would leave such a <i>thing</i> here, in a place of business? He prods it with the toe of his shoe then picks it up gingerly by the non-business end, his fingers closing around the plastic door that had once been your feet, that conceals your batteries. He places you down on the cold surface of the counter and with a gentle push sends you rolling across to the teller's side. \"Something for the lost and found, I think,\" he says with disgust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs fortune would have it, your dizzying roll comes to a stop just in front of the hand mirror that the teller keeps for showing customers there new form. You stare at the few inches of phallic rubber reflecting back at you, all that remain of Michael Brooks, and a scream even louder than the one before sets your body vibrating against the counter with such intensity that the teller has to pin you down to stop you vibrating off the desk. Flipping you face down, you feel his giant fingers against the door at your feet. Releasing the catch, your feet swing aside. He turns you back over, rattles you a number of times, and you feel the two triple-A batteries that run the length of your insides slide out of your bo-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dildo goes inert in his hands as the batteries tumble onto the counter. \"Actually, George, this is yours,\" he laughs. \"Your son, I mean. Yep, I've seen this happen before. After the humanity is gone, they have to have some shape and they usually tend towards one that fits the remaining attributes. Teenage boys, their Libido predisposes them to things like this.\" He admires the dildo. \"He's pretty well made, your boy. Ever since I got my wife that Libido upgrade I can barely keep up, she'd really appreciate something like this. Or would you prefer me to toss it in the lost and found after all?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeorge Brooks...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>George Brooks chuckles as he extended his bony fingers towards the purple, plastic <i>object</i> and wraps them around it, admiring the fleshy feel of the <i>thing</i>. To imagine, his son -- his well-built, tall, structured son! -- has been reduced to <i>this</i>, just a simple object meant to be used for the pleasure of women. He shudders at that thought, and his awe of this technology soars to new heights.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I'll be taking this,\" George croaked, as he shoved the purple dildo and triple A batteries into his pocket. \"I'll find a use for him. After all, I raised my son to be an ethically hard working man and I'm proud of him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe teller flashed a sardonic grin. \"Sure you are, Georgey-boy. I know just how proud of your son you are. Now, will you be making any further transactions?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeorge slowly threw a glance at the teller, then at his dry and pruny hands, and then at his Bureau wallet, stuffed full of Change and ready to burst at any moment. It didn't take him long to decide. \"You know what, Chris, I think I will...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeorge walked to his car -- young, lean muscles rippling, virile, and 50,000 Change lighter -- and opened the door of his Prius, soon to be a relic as his mind deliberated between a BMW and a Porsche, thinking back to his overflowing bank account. He halfheartedly tossed his son onto the neighboring seat, the plastic making a blunt noise as it smacks into the side of the door. George fishes out the two batteries, carefully inserting them into the slot as he thinks whether he is technically touching his son's asshole or not...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...You wake up lying on the familiar leather seat of your dad's Prius, feeling someone's fingers prodding your asshole. Or, at least, it feels like your asshole, but more sensitive. His fingers retract, leaving a pleasant buzzing feeling, and you hear a clicking sound resound through your bottom, as if something was being snapped shut. You look upwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tall, now-chiseled form of your father and towers over you, playing with his muscles and his 20 year old face staring at you, which he probably got from Change he extracted from you. Looking down on you. Smirking. It pisses you off. You begin thrashing about in the seat, smacking into the wall and backseat as the sharp noises resound throughout the car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Easy there, kiddo,\" You father snickers, violently grabbing you with one hand. \"Unless you want to be thrown into the trash or be given to some homeless dude to be shoved up his asshole.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't that you believed his remarks: you had doubt that your father, despite your relations with him, would really do that. But fear filled your mind. After all, this was the same man who unceremoniously turned you into a simple object, a toy that women use for pleasure. And for what? Because he simply mismanaged his finances, kissing up to your mom's demands. And this was his solution. To sacrifice one of his kids. And since he loved your sister, it ended up being you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's the spirit,\" He guffaws, before revving up the engine of the car and driving out onto the road. You sit there silently, without a peep, anxiously waiting for him. Finally, he speaks up again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, sonny.\" He mulls, one hand on the steering wheel, the other gripping his now-bigger, virile cock. \"You can't always get the things you want in life. Take me, for instance. I've had to work for years, decades even, to rejuvenate your mom's health and youth. And yet, after all that, I was left penniless, essentially, without being able to afford any transformations of my own. Do you see what I mean?\" You don't. All you understand is that your dad is a selfish prick who gave away his own <i>son</i> because he was greedy for money. Greedy for his own attributes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Unfortunately, I cannot return you to your form right now,\" Your dad continues, obviously not hearing your thoughts to him. \"I need to gather funds to be able to purchase back your humanity and animation. After all, it costs a fortune, and there's a long wait for it too...\" Yeah right. You doubt that he would ever return you back to humanity unless someone forces him to. After all, the first thing you would do if you return will be to pummel his ass. He somehow senses your violent anger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, I'm not that heartless,\" he guffaws, raising up his hands in protest. \"If I leave you like this, the authorities will get to me in the end.\" The authorities. Yes, while the market was not closely regulated, animation and humanity were two of the traits that were. An investigation would inevitably be launched by the end of the year, and they would find out dastardly deed your dad has done. Which would land him a life sentence as a toilet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, now we get to decide where you go. I can't be keeping an eye on you -- I would probably lose you after all, but I do need someone trustworthy to keep you.\" He nonchalantly grabs you with one hand before continuing. \"Here's the deal. Shake if you want this option. Don't shake if you don't. First option -- I give you to your mother and she keeps you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou remain still.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter all, while you do trust your mom and have a good relationship, you have seen the sexual promiscuity she's been displaying after your dad purchased the beauty upgrade for her, sticking things such as cucumbers and carrots up her snatch while she cooked dinner (secretly, of course -- she didn't see you). As she didn't own any sex toys, you shuddered to think what she would do to you, even if she knew who you were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right, then. Next option: I give you to your sister and she keeps you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou remain still.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf there was anything you hated more in this world, it was your sis. An outgoing and sporty girl, she would always do anything to get on your nerves, turning off your Paystation while you were in the middle of a shootout to go \"practice tennis\" with her. She always hung around you, calling you her \"dear brother\", giving you no time and space to do your own activities at home. Oh how many times you had to masturbate in the school's bathrooms because of this. Who knows what kind of games she would think of with you in her possession?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have to be a pain, don't you? All right, final option: I give you to your girlfriend and she keeps you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou begin to shake and quiver in his hand. If there was anyone you trusted more, it was your girlfriend. Kind, sweet, and pretty, she was everything that you dreamed of, accepting you for who you were, even if you were just a \"video gaming freak\" at school. There was no doubt she would handle you with care and---<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This isn't fun! Fine, I will do it, but not tell her that it is you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou go still. The thought terrified you. It was one thing if she knew it was you, and another if she didn't. If she didn't know, what would she do to you? How would she handle a simple dildo? Would she just use you? Leave you in her drawer, collecting dust? What if her mother confiscates you for her own use, or worse, returns you back to the store? You would still be able to be tracked even then, but if you were sent somewhere like, say, Japan, and bought there, then there would be no method of finding you. You would be stuck as a plain, purple sex toy for the rest of your life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Silent, huh? Well, I guess I'll have to choose then. Hmm, I guess I'll give you to...\"</span></div></div>",

Truth be told, I'd rather not have you in the house, even if you're just stuffed in a a sock drawer. Things like you are unsanitary and unnatural - girls shouldn't be playing with an object when there are men around that can do the job a damn sight better,\" he says, proudly feeling his junk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe tosses you back on the passenger seat and revs the engine hard in a display of youthful machismo, the Prius racing around corners with such abandon that you soon roll down into the foot well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeorge screeches to a halt outside his son's girlfriend's house. It takes a little rummaging around before he finds his son wedged under the seat with a jelly baby and a twix wrapper adhered to its surface. He peels them off and wipes the toy on his shirt as he bounces up the garden path. The sun has come out and the world is radiant. He even stops to take a deep inhalation of the sweet scent of a rose bush that leans over the path, feeling a satisfaction that he has his whole life ahead of him. It might just be the springiness in his knees, but it is as though a weight has been lifted - the subtle sense of mortality that had crept into his subconsciousness during his thirties and reinforced in his fourties by every muscle twinge or chest pain, was no longer there. The future held promise again, beyond simply the dream of retirement. The world was his oyster and was determined to pry open the shell and suck out the sweet, juicy meat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite dropping off and collecting his son from this house many times, he had never bothered to learn the girl's name. Karen? Kirstie? He suspected there was a K involved somewhere. The relationship had never interested him - from what little he remembered of the girl, she was mousy and plain, yet another example of your son's low standards and wasted potential. Besides, it wasn't appropriate for a man his age to be taking too close an interest in a girl her age.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door opens. Before now, he had felt physically and mentally rejuvenated but, as their eyes meet, it is suddenly as if he is back in high school. His heart beats louder. The 'good evening' falters on his lips and his mouth is suddenly dry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My. You've grown,\" he croaks, his eyes roving over her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe it is the fact that he is viewing her with young eyes. Maybe she's had a growth spurt since last he saw her. Or maybe he simply never looked at her this close before, never saw beyond the spectacles, which while indeed large, only served to add character to a face that was innocent and pretty, perhaps even beautiful, accentuated by a smattering of freckles. The school blaser that she wears may certainly have fitted at the start of the year but now looks painfully tight about her mature breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatie readjusts her glasses and squints at the half-recognisable man on the doorstep, confirming her suspicion with a look at the Prius. \"Mi-Mister Brooks? Um. Can I help you?\" She glances around for Michael, only for her gaze to lands on the purple, veiny object held in his hands and she takes an alarmed step back into the house. \"What's this about?\" she asks, nervously, half-closing the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Can I help you'... George ruminated lustfully on her words, clutching the rubber dick harder in his hands as he considered all the ways she might <i>help </i>him. He considers the pros and cons of having his way with her right now. On the one hand, he is in a monogamous marriage of twenty years, this is the girlfriend of his own son, and she is much younger than him. On the other hand... well there are probably some cons to not fucking her brains out. He just cant think what they are.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSqueezed to the point of pain and unsettled by George's fixated, Michael vibrates a hum of protest, a reminder that he does in fact still exist.</span></div></div>",

Sounds like a good engine on her. No miles. A few blemishes on the paintwork but, hey, that's acne for you. Enjoy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe engine was still running, purring gently. It was a damn fine looking sports car (Michael had always been sporty after all). George ran a possession hand over the glossy metallic curves and bonnet, feeling the engine thrum slightly as he did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"About your old car...\" the bureau employee said, nodding to the beat up family Prius parked outside the doors. \"Would you like to get rid of it for you? We offer very competitive part exchange that you can still take advantage of.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no no,\" George shook his head. \"This is merely a temporary arrangement. My boy will be back to normal in wee- um, months, so I'll be holding on to the old car. I don't intend to be driving him frequently.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe employee clicked his tongue in disapproval. \"Sounds a waste of a good machine if you ask me, but each to their own. If you need a few tweaks doing to it, you know where we are. Something with a little more feminine chassis for the missus perhaps? Don't hesitate to call us, we offer excellent after-change service.\" George thanked the man but declined.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Heated seats</i>, George thought, as he slid into the driver's seat, the warm leather seeming to rise up to hug his back. <i>What luxury.</i> As the car door clicked smoothly closed, he found himself enveloped in that wonderful new-car-smell, and took a long, deep breath of expensive leather scent. His hands darted briefly over the control panel that controlled the car's in built sat-nav, audio system,  and state of the art self-driving AI. He caressed the steering wheel before giving the accelerator a light tap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe engine roared into life, the vibration from it running through his body. He felt the power of it, and felt young again. Slamming the car into 1st gear, he roared out of the parking lot, navigating the new car not down the sidestreets home, but on to the freeway. Who cared if they were expecting him back home, right now he wanted to see what this engine could do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe acceleration pushed him back in his seat as he screamed up the on-ramp to the freeway, cutting across two lanes at once in his eagerness to get into the fast lane. A car horn hooted at him, but was quickly left behind as he accelerated to 70mph and beyond in seconds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith one hand steering them past car after car, the left hand clicked the audio system on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"-dad, you're driving me too fast, you're going to hit someone! Slow down!\" came Michael's electronic voice from the speakers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUgh, that was the last thing he wanted, George groaned. It had taken him long enough to figure out how to stop the Prius' sat nav from bleeping at him every time it detected a speed camera ahead, now the new car was doing it too!</span></div></div>",

Are you sure you don't want to stay a car? It's like you were built to drive.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't want to be a car in the first place, let alone stay one,\" the radio screeches electronically. \"That's assuming I even make it back to the Bureau with the way you're driving! You almost clipped that car back there, slow down!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, relax, you're insured. If I crash you, I can always get a new one,\" George said in a jocular tone, though the words were true.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not funny, I don't like this. Turn around. Slow down. Take me back to the Bureau. I want to be a human again.\" Blah blah blah. George rolled his eyes, the same way he did at the sat-nav in the Prius whenever it told him off for missing a junction, or going 3mph over the speed limit. Fortunately with that, he'd found a way to silence most of that. Guiding the car with one hand, and with one eye on the road, he flicked through the menu on the dashboard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMenu &gt; Sat-Nav &gt; Audio &gt; Voice Selection<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot <i>that</i> had promise. He'd heard of people swapping out their sat-nav voices for celebrities, like Arnold Schwarzenegger or Brian Blessed before. One option caught his eye - Female, Sultry. He pressed it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, what are you doing? Stop altering - - loading audio template - - things. H-hey... hey, what have you done to my voice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeorge could barely suppress a giggle as his son's insolence, teenage boy tones changed in a second into a soft, feminine purr, a young woman's voice like warm treacle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, god, I sound like a chick,\" the car moaned in horror, though there was more than a hint of orgasmic groan in the way the audio elongated the 'ohhh god' part. \"I sound like fucking Siri.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now that's what I call an upgrade. You're certainly a lot less abrasive on the earlobes.\" His eyes fell on the AI-Inside sticker on the dashboard and he pondered something. \"Say, speaking of Siri, you don't have that kind of voice control built in,do you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a sudden silence from the car that spoke volumes. George's grin was so wide it almost split his face. \"Say.... Andy, what's the weather like today?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe voice responded immediately of course - it was a computer responding to its owner after all, which it regarded as anybody holding the keys. The tone of the words was clipped, a detectable undercurrent of anger there, but slathered in the honey-sweet voice distortion that all but masked Andy's true emotions with horny-borderline-orgasmic femininity. \"The weather outside today is <i>sooo</i> wet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And how about petrol? How are we doing for that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooh, my tank is <i>sooo </i>full.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tee hee! This is great! Though remind me to turn this off before your mother hears this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Reminder set - change settings.\"</span></div></div>",

Her job is to find those customers and use any means necessary to recover the Bureau's loaned attributes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRanjit Chandrasekhar (age 27, 5'11'', 185 pounds, Indian) \u2014 More of a contractor than a salaried employee, he is an office worker tasked with sending out notices and judgments to customers. For customers located in rural areas, he must make personal visits. He's willing to bring customers current on their loans or forgive their debts entirely... at a price.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam Drummond (age 50, 6'1'', 230 pounds, English) \u2014 Legal expert in owning, holding, and disposing of Bureau-owned corporeal estate. If customers severely erode their borrowed attributes to the point of little salvage value, such as by doing drugs or dying unnaturally, the law allows the Bureau to take custody of their body.  He uses forensics and the law to harvest bodies in this brave new world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKim Harris (age 29, 5'8'', 150 pounds, English) \u2014 More of a loan officer than a collections agent, she makes loans to \"high risk\" customers who are not expected to repay their debts. These collateral-based loans, often made with little forethought by the customer, help the Bureau to obtain rare and trendy attributes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr perhaps you are someone else in a different department?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You're waiting outside the Italian restaurant on this crisp autumn evening. You apply some gloss to your lips and smack them together one more time, looking around for your date. The Bureau's files indicate he chose the figure of an attractive man, late twenties, with an angular jawline and washboard abs. Chestnut brown hair, tall but not too tall, broad shouldered but evenly toned like a swimmer or a triathlete. Someone you wouldn't mind seeing full time... if not for your job.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA silver Mercedes pulls into the parking lot, and a man matching those features steps out. He slips his arms into a jacket, hands the valet the keys, and strides up to the entrance. That's when you introduce yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClearing your throat and brushing your bangs out of your eyes, you look up at this perfectly coiffed Adonis. \"Excuse me, you wouldn't happen to be Steven, would you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man, whose jawline was just as cut and rugged as his online dating profile image showed, glanced down at you. His eyes wrinkled a bit as his mouth contorted into a warm smile. \"Yes, my name is Steven. Are you Heather Smith?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded, letting him take your arm within his. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry for having you wait outside for me like this.\" He murmured, listening to your heels clicking on the pavement up to the entrance. His voice was low and smooth as silk, perfect for radio if he weren't so hunky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I wasn't out here that long.\" You replied. \"Plus, a guy like you seems like he's worth the wait.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Likewise.\" He said, opening the door for you like a gentleman. \"You look beautiful tonight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou warmed at the compliment. It took you over two hours to get ready for the date, although most of that time was spent reading case files on the man. Learning about his old identity, how he skipped out on settling his debts with the Bureau at the last minute and fled New York City. How it took months for the Bureau to find him again and assign you to his case. It was a shame you had to collect what was owed, but you've done this before and have little remorse for people who don't live up to their end of a deal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut collect you do. That's why you're the Bureau's Senior Collections Officer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow inside the ritzy Italian restaurant, a server escorts you to a table. There are wine racks and paintings on the wall, a man playing a slow sonata on a grand piano, and a chandelier suspended atop the white sea-shelled ceiling. The lights are dim and aided by flickering candles on every table including your own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, this is nicer than I imagined. Glad we managed to get a reservation on such short notice.\" Steven murmured, pulling out the chair for you. You set your purse down on the seat next to you and took off your jacket. \"That's a big purse! What do you keep in there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, this old thing?\" You laid your jacket on top and smoothed it out. \"You're going too fast if you're asking about things like that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven winced. \"Right. Sorry \u2014 kind of new to the whole dating thing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"New, huh?\" You chuckled, \"Then why don't we start with the basics. What do you do for a living?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven rolled up his shirt sleeves, handing you a wine menu. \"I used to be a foreman. Worked at a factory for several years until it closed down. But to tell you the truth, I haven't worked for a long time, what with the economic downturn and all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You look like you're doing well for yourself though,\" You set the menu down, \"I saw your Mercedes this evening.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" He furrowed his brow. \"Actually, I inherited my wealth. I figured I would have to mention this at some point to you tonight. But... I used to be married.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm so sorry,\" You placed a hand on your mouth. \"We don't have to talk about it if \u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No no... that's alright.\" Steven sighed. \"Her name was Doris. She passed away a few years ago.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my God!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It wasn't a surprise though,\" He reassured. \"She had been in poor health for a long time. There was a time for grieving, wondering whether I'd ever be able to capture that spark again. But I feel like I'm ready to move on, with somebody special.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour face flushed, and that was without even a glass of wine. \"Are you... are you sure you feel fine to start dating again? I mean I had a friend who got married after high school at 18 and I can't imagine them not being together.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven blinked. \"Of course \u2014 we were married since high school. She had some kind of illness that ran through her family.\" He tugged at his collar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe server returned and took your orders. Steven pointed to a bottle of Shiraz and before long the cork popped off and red wine glugged into a carafe. From experience you know that your targets are easier to subdue if they've had plenty to drink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go ahead, we can always call an Uber or Lyft if that's where our night takes us!\" You encourage Steven, pouring his glass full despite his protest. But he slumps his shoulders and drinks deeply from the glass. He gives in. They always give in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I feel like I've done all the talking so far tonight,\" Steven complained. \"Tell me about yourself, Heather.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...\" You begin, \"I've lived here in Chicago for about eight years now. I graduated from Northwestern and got into nursing, currently working over at Cook General.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know the place...\" Steven said, staring into you with his gorgeous hazel eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tell him a few stories you've practiced in front of the mirror. Fake stories involving sick patients and long shifts, bitchy coworkers and roommates who never existed. Carefully crafted stories that have been focus grouped by the Bureau de Change. Stories most likely to get targets to empathize with the speaker, to make them think they're learning about someone's authentic life experience. And before long, you have Steven eating out of the palm of your hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And that's why my roommate is out of town this weekend.\" You finish. \"Her father just <i>has </i>to have her see his exhibition featured at the Guggenheim. I just don't see what the fuss is about \u2014 <i>avant garde</i> is only meaningful if it makes sense, you know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven chuckled in his low baritone. \"I guess I never thought of it that way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So are you much of an art fan? Because you might be a better fit for my roommate than myself if you are.\" You sip your glass coyly, waiting for him to respond.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not really,\" He laughed, cutting into his Chicken Marsala.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you're like a work of art to me, if I'm not being too bold.\" You whisper, tapping his leg with your foot beneath the table. He nearly dropped his fork. \"I might as well take you home and hang you up on my wall.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now who's the one getting ahead of herself?\" Steven suggested smugly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you wanna know what I think about beauty in general?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Beauty is in the eye of the beholder,\" You giggle. \"I mean, society tells everybody how to look, how to talk, how to act. I remember my great-grandmother used to tell me about natural beauty. This was back when you had to work to look nice, not just buy it at the store.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or a bank...\" Steven muttered to himself, but you could hear it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you know that several hundred years ago, back in the times of people like Shakespeare, their idea of female beauty was a full-figured woman with pale skin.\" You continued. \"Back then there wasn't as much wealth to go around. If a woman was pale it meant she didn't have to work in the fields; if she was overweight, it meant she could afford plenty of food and enjoy leisure time. And those things translated to wealth and privilege back then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like in that painting, over there.\" Steven pointed to an oil portrait of a Rubenesque young woman leaning against a windowsill. \"Is that what you're talking about?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, thank you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I never thought of it that way. I suppose in the time of your great-grandmother, physical fitness was considered attractive because of its rarity.\" He replied. \"I mean, there was plastic surgery in the past but you couldn't <i>buy</i> a better body like you can today. Is that what you're saying?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven sighed. \"I think I know what this is about. You're wondering if this \u2014 all of it \u2014 is real?\" He gestured at his chest, swept a hand over his arms, rubbed across his hard jawline and ran his fingers through his hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no I would never assume that about you,\" You lied. \"To tell you the truth, I've had some... some <i>work </i>done on me in the past.\" You pointed to your cute, button-like nose. \"Not proud of it, but you should have seen the thing before.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven chuckled, as if a weight was lifted from his shoulders. \"Is that all? There's nothing wrong with a bit of rhinoplasty.\" He reached out to place his hands over your own. You noticed the long, pinkish scar running down the back of his hand and wrist. \"If that's all you've got done, then I'd say you could be beautiful at any time in history.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blush again at his compliment. Such a gentleman \u2014 shame that his attributes have to be collected. He's played his part well enough to fool most Bureau employees, which is how he got this far in the first place. But you're certain of this guy's true identity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDinner was pleasant, especially considering 'Steven' offered to pay the bill. He ended up drinking more than you did (by design), and you're not sure he can drive. Where do you take your date next?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Through the Bureau, all personal attributes can be purchased and sold, exchanged, or invested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAny attribute can be traded, with the exchange rate dependent on how in-demand that particular attribute is and with the bureau taking it's own cut. Years are highly valued commodities and a stable investment, while the value of other attributes like cups (the unit by which breast size is traded), masculinity-femininity or skin pigmentation fluctuates depending on the latest trends. Many traders make a living playing the attribute market.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA client of the bureau may choose to bank any amount or type of attribute that they please into their account, and in return they receive a certain amount of interest on it, dependent on current market forces. Bequeath a metre of your height for example and you will immediately shrink that much, but your height will be taken and invested responsibly by the Bureau, loaned to those in need of extra inches, such as a basketball player. In return, your investment will be rewarded with 3% interest, or 3cm, per year. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Attributes can be deposited, withdrawn or traded at any time, either in-branch, through one of any of thousands of ATM (Automated Transformation Machines) located around the country, or through their new mobile app. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs well as banking, the bureau offers an array of other services, such as life insurance.</td>",
