            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You let out a heavy sigh as you walked down the halls of the empty palace while the sum shined down outside. The reason for this was because you found yourself being quite bored. Mostly because the wolf Amicus who had brought you to Adastra from Earth about two weeks ago was gone doing political things to gain the other wolves votes to become the next Emperor. Though his younger brother Cassius was off doing the same today as well. And the jackal Nefru had gone out to the city for his own reasons. Though that seemed to be the case for the cat Alex as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so this was why you were wondering the halls in a slow like manner, though you were glad that Cato was gone as well otheriwse you'd have to pretend to be very dumb intelligence wise and if you were being honest you dind't like doing that. But thankfully those thoughts were pushed to the side when you passed by a very dusty looking door that looked to be a bit open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis prompted you to turn your head to trhe right in slight confusion as you thought out loud, \"Huh, that's weird. I wonder why this is partly open. Along with that I wonder if it can even open up fully.\" And so you walked up to the door and placed your hand on the panel. And to your surprise you heard the door slide open which then revealed an empty room with only tables in it after the lights for it came on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, after you had walked inside you noticed that something was on the middle table. Which prompted you to walk up to it and upon a closer look you saw a pedant that was light blue in color. But every so often you saw some white shapes flast on it every so often. This made you curious as you took a hold of the pedant and saw that it oculd even be split into four pieces. But then this led to the question what exactly this was? Was some kind of Parent Tech that was hidden away? Or was it just some kind of odd pedant?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo many questions and yet you had a feeling you wouldn't find out the answers to your questions anytime soon. So instead another idea came to your head that being of who you should give this pedant too? Of course the first choice was Amicus since he had been kind to you despite how things started out between you two. Then there was Neferu who may be a bit flirty with you, but you had a feeling he more so did this to get under Amicus's fur. Well either that he just liked to flirt a lot. Then there was Cassius who you honestly didn't know much about, mostly due to him treating you like a pet and actually believing you were dumb. So doing this might expose Amicus's idea of making you play dumb. But wouldn't that be bgood if he treated you differently. Plus it could make up for what happened to his tail after Amicus pushed him onto the floor. And then there was Alex, who you had gotten along with since you had came to Adastra, and even though you hadn't seen lately maybe giving him a gift could show that you have still been thinking of him in a way. And then you could even give all four of them the pedant in a way if you split it into four pieces from those small panels on it. You'd just have find some extra string of some kind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so after you had walked out of the room and made sure the door was back to the position it was in you decided to give this odd pedant to......</span></div></div>",

And even though you didn't like being here, you knew that he was the only one on the moon who you could trust. So with these thougthts in your head you decided to go back into Amicus's room and wait for him to return.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout an hour or so later you saw the door to Amicus's room slide open thus revealing the large muscle gutted wolf who let out a heavy sigh. But upon seeing you a smile spread across his face as he greeted you with, \"Marco, I'm sorry that my travels to the city took so long.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah, it's okay Amicus. I figured that'd be the case since you and Cassius are trying to become the next emperor after all.\" You reassured the large wolf, as you got up off of the couch and then gave him a hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon doing this you heard the anthro let out a chuckle to which he then returned the hug to you. But while you two were hugging you felt oneof his huge furry ahnds reach into your pocket and then pull out the pedant. After doing this you then saw him look down at you while he asked, \"Oh, what's this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis question prompted you to blush a little bit while you confessed, \"Well I found this pedant and I figured I'd give to you as a gift.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww, that's very kind of you Marco. Thank you very much for this gift. I bet this will be my new good luck charm, besides you of course.\" The black and gray furry wolf replied, as he put the pedant on and it was up against the middle of his two ;arge pecs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter doing this the two of you then enjoyed dinner and chatted for a bit of what the wolf did out in the city to convince the other wolves to vote for him to become emperor. And before you knew it was dark outside and the two of you went to bed for the night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning both you and Amicus woke up and got ready for the day that was ahead of you. However, when Amcius was getting dressed you noticed that when the large wolf was getting his pants that they seemed to be......</span></div></div>",

He had to suck in his gut a bit to get the pants to tie together. Seeing him slightly occupied with this you walked over to at least help him with the other parts of his dressing, picking up his red shawl and wrapping it around the wolf's stump like neck which you swore felt more toned than previously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Amicus, I think you should moderate yourself on you eating, looks like you are bulking up...\" You mockingly scolded the princely wolf, finding the whole thing amusing that for once you can tease him for once after all you have been subjected to your self since being abducted by the roman space wolf who was now your master and made you a slightly reluctant participant in the contest to be the new emperor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! Stop it, Marco!\" Amicus protested, while he looked at you from over one of your massive shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce you had finished helping him get dressed you look up at him while noticing how tight all of his clothes looked on him when you replied, \"I am just saying the truth Amicus!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe! But at least I am not scrawny like Cassius is!\" He countered, to which you had to admit that he had a point there. \"Also it's all muscle!\" The wolf added to further his point, as you looked on as he began to pace around the room<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure it is!\" You sarcastically commented which resulted in a slightly annoyed glance from the burly wolf who looked to you to even be maybe slightly taller than normal. Then again you were a human after all and much shorter than the Adastran wolves, so it was likely just you imagining things. By this point, you even kinda forgot about the pedant you gave him which he still was wearing. Resting proudly between his two furred pecs and almost looking like it was glowing slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha! That's enough Marco! I need your help to me as emperor not to hear anymore sassy remarks from you! You do want to return to Earth, don't you?\" The muscle gutted wolf remarked, to which you just rolled your eyes at his light-hearted jab.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so to change the subject you asked him, \"So what's the plan for today, master Amicus?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmicus turned to you and then said...,,</span></div></div>",

But the only problem was tha the didn't seem any the wiser to it. Which was a bit worrying since you'd hate for his pants to pants to rip while either parcticing or during the actual trail. however, you did have hope that amybe he'd notice the difference in his size before the actual trail. But knowing him, he might not notice it until it was too late. Plus you still had no idea how he grew to begin with. Though you had a small hench with the pedant between his pecs which wasn't glowing anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, while you were in your own thoughts you felt one of the wolf's large furry ahnds on your shoulder when he asked, \"Marco, is everything okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-Huh? Oh, yes, everything's fine. I just got lost in thought about something is all.\" You reassured the muscle gutted wolf, before you gave him a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter you did this you saw him smile down atyou as wlel before the two of you waliked out of his bedroom and made your way to the throne room. And upon reaching and then entering the massive room you both walked to the center of it before Amicus turned to you and went over the basic steps of the dance and what roles you'd both playing. Which well that part was a bit confusing at first, but after he explained what the dance represented for their history it made sense to you in some ways.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough once the actual practice started you noticed Amicus's hands were even bigger when up agaisnt your side or when he held one of your hands. And you alos noticed that your head wasn't at the normal eye level with Amicus's body like it was yesterday either. And to your surprise Amicus seemed to finlaly notice the difference when he asked, \"Hey Marco, is it just me, or do you seem smaller then what you did yesterday?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Erm well, no not really. I think you've grown somehow Amicus.\" You replied back, which caused the black and gray furred wolf to stop practicing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then saw him take in a breathe of air before letting it out.

But on the other hand you figured this was a smart thing to do since not only could you say that this was a gift between friends. But also maybe try to convince the jackal that you'll help him get Amicus to be onboard with the alliance between the wolves and jackals. So with this idea in your head you decided to go back to Amicus's room and wait for the anthro to return to the palace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was about an hour or so later until you heard Com's voice when he told you, \"Neferu has returned to the palace Marco.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks Com.\" You replied, as you then made your way out of Amicus's bedroom. You then walked into the hallway and after making a few turns here and there you saw the heavily muscled anthro jackal about to walk into a room. But before he placed his palm onto the panel you attempted to get his attention with a wave of one of your arms while you called out, \"Neferu, welcome back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked on as one of the black jackal's golden ears twitch before you saw him look over at you and then completely to face. Upon doing so you saw him smile at you in greeting as you walked up to him as he replied, \"Ah Marco, good evening to you. And so what do I owe this company of ours?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing this question and seeing give you such a big smile prompted to blush a very small amount as you reached into your pocket and pulled out the pedant. You then presented it to him as you said, \"Well I found this pedant and figured I'd give to you as a gift. As a sign of friendship.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter saying this though you saw the black furred and golden marking covered jackal look at you with a raised eyebrow while he replied, \"Oh, a gift of friendship you say? Or you sure it doesn't have another meaning behind it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Erm no, it's just a gift of friendship. Plus I was hoping this could help get you and Amicus to get along with each other better.\" You confessed, as you saw the jackal gently take the pedant from you and then put it over his head to which it then laid against his pecs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then saw him smile down at you again as he responded back with, \"Well I'm not sure if this will help Amicus and I get along better. But it's nice to know that I have someone on this moon who seems to care about me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, wait, I didn't say that.\" You protested back, while your face turned a darker red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry Marco, I'm only teasing you.\" Neferu reassured you, to which you then saw him place a hand onto your head and gently rub his fingers through your hair. After doing this though you saw him wink down at you when he added, \"But if you change your mind about us being friends you know where to find me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter this was said you saw him walk away from you and into the room he had opened up earlier. Once this happened you let out a heavy sigh and then returned to Amicus's room where you ate dinner and then went to bed since you didn't feel like waiting for Amicus and have him get super jealous after telling him what you did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCome the next day however, when you walked into the gardens along with Amicus you saw that......</span></div></div>",

Well that's only thanks to you my friend.\" Neferu replied, while he closed his eyes and gave you a big smile and flexed one of his massive arms a little bit just by moving it.

And upon doing so he went on with, \"Marco here found this pedant and decided to give to me as not only a gift of friendship, but as a way for you and I to establish an alliance together. Or at least help us get there I would assume.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, I see...\" The muscle gutted wolf let out, while he calmed down but still had a large glare on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Amicus, I'm sorry I didn't tell you about this last night. But I knew that if I did then you'd get really jealous and might have said or done something that you'd had regretted.\" You explained, while you moved from behind the black and gold marked jackal and stood next to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I.....suppose that is true....\" Amicus admitted, as he clamed himself down. Though this didn't last long as the glare was still on his face when he continued, \"But is it just me or are you taller then me now, Neferu?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain the anthro jacakl just gave a big smile before he said, \"Oh, I suppose I am, aren't I?

Though speaking of the wolf you saw him look the jackal up and down still with a glare on his face. Though this didn't last long as he then turned his gaze over to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd upon so you felt a cold shiver go down your spine when he said, \"Well Marco, I don't what you did, but I hope you're proud of yourself?\" You then saw him turn away from both of you and then added, \"But that doesn't matter right now since I have to go into the cities and gain support. So I don't when I'll be back.\" You then saw him look at you again from the corner of his eye before he ekpt going, \"But maybe it's the best that we have some space from each other for the time being.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't you think ou're overreacting a little bit? LIke I told you a moment ago Marco's gift was only that of friendship and nothing more.\" Neferu stated, clearly trying to defend your intentions from yesterday.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tch, whatever.\" The black and gray furred wolf let out, as he then walke3d further into the garden and then down a dirt road.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd once he was gone you let out a heavy sigh while you commented, \"Great, looks like I messed things up again somehow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, you did nothing wrong Marco. If you ask me, Amcius is just being a bit over dramatic right now. So if you'd like you're more then welcome to accompany me wherever I go until his cooled down. Though if he doesn't then I hope you know that you can count on my support and aid to get you back home once this whole deciding the next Emperor has ended.\" Neferu reassured you, now with a soft smile on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first you were caught off garud by the jacakal's offer. Though given that what happened earlier could have gone better you decided to accept the anthro jackal's offer as you just smiled back up at him in return and replied, \"Thanks Neferu, that means a lot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are quite welcome my friend.\" Neferu responded back, befor eh offered you one of his now slightly bigger arms to hold onto.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis prompted you to blush a light pink as you placed both of your hands onto the jackal's left arm.

Seeing this from the white wolf prompted to frown a little as you weren't expecting to see from him. Though with his bone illness maybe even doing that type of was still straining on him. Though most likely you figured it was more a mental strain then a physical one since he didn't appear to be in any pain. Though as you made your way over to him you put your hand into the picket the pedant was in as you took in a sigh of air and then released it before you let out, \"Well here goes nothing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then saw one of Cassius's ears twitch before you saw him look over at you before he remarked, \"Oh, it's you, human.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My name is Marco.\" You corrected the thin wolf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, yes.\" The anthro wolf replied, while waving his hand dismissively. You then saw him sit upright before he added, \"So why did you come out here? And how exactly did you know I was out here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I asked Com.\" You simply responded back with, while you let out your own sigh. And I have to apologize for what happened to you after we first met?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tch, so my brother is having his brother apologize for something he did?\" Cassius spat back, with a frown on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope, he doesn't even know that I'm out here since he hasn't come back yet from his giving his own speeches to various speeches around the palace.\" You explained, as you saw the white wolf give you a surprised look with one of his eyebrows raised. Seeing this only made you sigh even more when you continued with, \"And I know this is very odd for you to hear me speak so well compared to the other times we've interacted with each other. But that wasn't my idea. It was Amicus's.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course it would be.\" The thin anthro muttered out, to which you then saw him stand up in front of you. After doing this he then went on, \"So was all that you wanted to tell me? Becuse if so then I will take my leave now. But thank you for being honest with me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing this made you panic a little as you blurted, \"Wait a minute, please!\" Right upon letting these words slip from your mouth you saw the wolf give you a curious look again before t I wanted to give you a gift too. Just so there wouldn't be any problem between us anymore.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so you pulled out the pedant from your robe pocket and presented it to the younger brother of Amicus. After doing this you saw the wolf's eyes widen in both shock and surprise as he most likely wasn't expecting you to give him a gift or apologize to you. And so with baited breathe you watched as the white wolf slowly reached out and then took the pedant from you and then proceeded to put it over his head to where the pedant itself was laying up against his flatish pecs as you saw him smile at you in earnest before he told you, \"Well this is certainly unexpected. But I will gladly accept this gift from you Marco. However, I still feel like I don't know much about you. So with that said I officially will make you my pet tomorrow morning once both Amicus and Alex return to the palace.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Erm wait, can you even do that?\" You asked, not expecting this from the white wolf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, it won't be that difficult depending on whether or not both my brother and Alex agree to this. Plus then this way I can learn more about you. Like where you are from for example.\" Cassius explained, still with that smile on his face. Hearing this prompted you to become nervous as you saw this coming, but you still weren't expecting it. Howeve,r to your surprise you saw and felt Cassius place one of his hands onto one of your shoulders as he added, \"I can tell from your reaction that you don't feel comfortable telling me where you're from. But I assure you that I won't force you to do nor will I tell anyone else about this. The location of your home planet will be kept between only you and I.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, I guess it couldn't hurt to give this a try.\" You replied back, as you thought you saw Cassius's tail sway from side to side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExcellent! Now we just have to wait to make this \"trade\" of pets official.\" Cassius said, still with a confident smile on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so you both went your separate ways for the rest of the night. Though in the back ofyour mmind you wonder how this trade between Amicus and Cassius would go down. However, you knew not to bring this up to Amicus, otherwise he'd most likely march to his brother's room and accidentally really hurt him out of angry. So once the dinner tray was brought to Amcius's room you pshed it in and ate some dinner. After doing this you then decided to go to bed for the night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning however, when you took Amicus out to the garden to be traded to Cassius, you saw the two other nathros standing outside waiting for you. And after Cassius had explained what he wanted to do you soon saw.......</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You found yourself wincing when you saw Amicus's eyebrows narrow in pure anger and his fur blistered out and his muscles were bulging outward when he shouted, \"YOU WANT TO WHAT?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I said that I wast us to trade pets, Amicus.\" Cassius calmly replied back, while you found yourself taking a step back. After doing this though you heard the white wolf's voice again when he added on, \"Besides it's not like I'm forbidding you from seeing Marco whenever you wish.\" You then saw him cross his arms in front of his himself before he continued, \"But let's just say that I've gained an interest in the human.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, really? So then what was that ugly comment you made some time ago? And how do you know that Marco is a human? Unless.....\" The muscle gutted wolf questioned, as he quickly trailed off and looked over at you. You then found your eyes widen in slight fear when Amicus aimed his next sentence at you when he went on with, \"Oh, I get it now. You decided to stab me in the back did you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-what, no Amicus, I just got sick and tired of pretending to be dumb. And plus I wanted to apologize to Cassius for what happened to him after you pushed him onto the floor.\" You explained, while you saw Alex have a very worried look on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cat then swallowed a lump in his throat before he muttered out, \"I'll go and wait for you in your room Amicus.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter saying this you heard the large wolf let out a grunt and within seconds Alex ran out of the garden and into the palace. Once this occurred you felt one of Cassius's furry hands genlty take a hold of yours as he told you, \"Well I think we'd best take our leave and let Amicus cool down Marco.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSadly while you were passing by Amicus you soon felt one of the black furry hands of the wolf forcibly take a hold of you and then add a lot of pressure to it before he muttered out, \"So this is how you thank me for bringing you to my home and trying to keep you safe? Well I'll make you regret this decision Marco.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon hearing this from Amicus you couldn't help but get a bit angry as you snapped back, Oh yes, because briinging me against my will and having me pretend to be dumb is really keeping me safe!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then felt the pressure start to build up as you thought you felt some of his claws dig into your skin which caused you to let out a yell of pain thus causing you to lose any anger you had in a matter of seconds. Upon doing this though you felt Cassius let go of your hand and then take a hold of Amicus's hand that was on your shoulder while he yelled, \"Let him go, Amicus! You are clearly hurting the human!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis prompted you to look up at the muscle gutted wolf hoping that maybe if he saw how hurt you were he'd let go of you. Instead however, you saw nothing but hurt and rage in his own eyes which only caused you to shiver in actual fear as you weren't sure what you did was the smartest idea anymore. However, while Cassius continued to pull on Amicus's hand he yelled out again, \"Amicus, I told you to let go of him!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this moment you found yourself closing your eyes as a bright light flashed from the pedant that was around Cassius's neck. Along with this you heard both Cassius and Amicus let out their own yelps of surprise. Though for the white wolf he let out various yelps here and there, obviously in pain of some kind since you could heard his bones creaking for some reason. But after you opened your eyes you saw Cassius looking down at you with concern over your injury and Amicus looking completely taken aback by what he had just seen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd once your eyes had adjusted you saw that Cassius had changed because not only did he seem taller, but he seemed more muscular as well. In fact his tail seemed to be healed as well as it swayed from left to right clearly showing that perhaps his bone illness was gone considering how he looked now. In fact once he had turned away from you and stood in front of you, you quickly realized that not only had Cassius grown in both hieght and muscle, but he actually looked to be....</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You found yourself letting out a gasp of utter shock when you saw nothing but Cassius's now massive and wide muscled white furred back. And when you moved your eyes lower down his body you saw his long white furred tail wave behind him above his now two large and firm looking buttcheeks. Thigh owever, caused you to blush and quickly look way from the new Cassius as you thought you saw him looking at you from over one his large shoulders and had a smile on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough this didn't last as it turned into a frown and he looked away from you. After that was done you heard Amicus let out a grwol of frustration when he demanded, \"What the heck just happened?! How in the world did you become as big as I am?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I honestly have no idea what exactly happened Amicus. But now that I'm this size I won't let you lay a hand on Marco. You need to accept the fact that I wanted him as my pet.\" Cassius replied, while he crossed his massive arms in front of his massive pecs. He then added, \"In fact you could have stayed friends with him and could kept on visiting him when he wasn't busy doing various things for me. But after what you did you won't be able to come near him at all once I become Emperor.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah?\" The black and grey furred wolf countered, with a raised eyebrow and a glare on his face. After doing this he then balled up one of his hands into a fist and punched Cassius right in the face. But when he didn't hear any bones breaking or his little brother yelling pain he took a step back while he went on with disbelief in his voice, \"W-What?! That punch should have crushed that part of your face. Why didin't it work?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon seeing this reaction from his brother prompted the white furred wolf ot smirk at his older brother as he commented, \"Hmm, it would seem that my bone illness is a non factor after this change.\" His teybrows then narrowed and he showed some of his fangs when he kept going, \"So now I'll ask you to leave. Otherwise I'll punch you back and maybe I'll add a kick as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"tch, fine. But you own't beat me in becoming Emperor. Even with this change Cassius.\" Amicus remarked, to which H ethen turned away and made sure his cape was flowing behind him. But while he was walking he added in a loud voice, \"Oh, and you'd best get some new clothes since as of right now you're walking around naked. That's pretty inappropriate for a posilbe Emperor to be doing don't you think?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing this remark prompted the white furred wolf to turn his head away and blush as he said under his breathe, \"Hmph, still going to make a comment a pup would, huh?\" You then found yourself look up at him when you heard heavy footsteps  in your direction. You then turned and saw him looking down at you with concern on his face before he asked you, \"Are you alright, Marco?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-Yeah, I think so.\" You replied, while you looked over at the white wolf's rock hared abs, and massive pecs, Though when you found yourself looking down at his now large white balls and black cock you quickly looked away from him and at your right shoulder. You then went on, \"Though I think my arm is bleeding a little bit from Amicus's claws....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"hmm, yes it would seem so. We'd best get you a doctor to ahve treated befor eit gets affected.\" Cassius stated, before you found yourself being lifted into the white wolf's massive arms making you gasp in surprise. After doing this you then found yourself looking up at the white wolf's face as he let out a light chuckle and added, \"Such an odd sound for being caught off guard. I won't lie, it is quite....cute.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Erm um thanks Cassius...\" You muttered out, before you found yourslef being held up against the wolf's massive furry body while he walked to his room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce he had done this he then set you gently down onto his bed and told Com to have a doctor come to his room along with another bot to make him some new clothing for his new size. Though he made sure to have his new clothes look his old clothes, just in a much bigger size. At least for the time being until he became Emperor. And once your shoulder had been patched up and he was wearing his new clothes which he made sure to put on in the bathroom while the doctor worked on you so that he wouldn't see his new size the white wolf then decided that he wanted to take you......</span></div></div>",

Sure you had been in there before with Amicus and Neferu. But never had you shared it with Cassius before. Not to mention that he was now the same size and height as his older brother which only made you feel a bit more shy then you were expecting. Though considering you were now his pet you somehow had a feeling this was going to happen at some point in time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>No, come on Marco. You've been in here before. You can do this.</i>\" You thought to yourself as Cassius put his hand ontot he panel thus opening the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then were a bit surprised when you saw the white wolf ushered you into the room. Though you tried to not dwell on it for very long as you walked into the large room and he followed suit thus causing the door to slide shut. You then felt yourself swallow a lump in your throat as you heard him walk past you and then reveal what little clothing he was wearing. This ended up giving you a view of his massive muscles starting with his shoulders and arms. Though your eeys did move to his massive pecs and rock hard abs and muscled thighs and legs. But you couldn't help but stare at his large balls now and soft black colored cock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahem! I know I have quite the body now. But I'm eyes are up here, Marco.\" Cassius told you, to which you instantly looked up at his face expecting to see a scowl on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo your surprise though you didn't see a frown on his face, but a slight smirk along with a light blush on it and his arms crossed in front of his chest. And upon seeing this you couldn't help but smile a little bit yourself as you walked over to the bench and started to remove your own robe and clothes. Sadly when you stared to move the cloth off of your hurt shoulder you couldn't help but let out a small groan of pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter this had happened you heard some footsteps and then felt two large furry hands gently help you remove the robe and the rest of your clothing off of your body. You then found yourself letting a gasp of surprise as you found yourself in Cassius's arms again as he wlaked over and slowly got into the bathing pool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile he di this though you couldn't help but look away with a blush on your face again as you slightly protested with, \"Cassius, I appreciate the help with removing my clothes. But I could get into the bathing pool no problem.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That maybe true, Marco. But you know the doctor said that you shouldn't get the bandages wet. So this was the easiest way to prevent hat from happening.\" The muscled white wolf replied, as he carefully sat down onto the bench in the pool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd after he did this you were then set down into his lap and then felt his right arm go around you and hold you up against his massive body and let out a sigh. Though you were relived that he had made sure that your injured shoulder was away from pressing up against his two large pecs. Not that it'd hut, but better to be safre then sorry you figured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough when you looked up at him you saw him look down at you as he told you, \"Though I feel I must apologize since you got that injury due to me suggesting this idea to Amcius. Perhaps I should of waited a day or two to do so.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, it's okay, Cassius. We both know how quick to anger Amicus can get.\" You responded back with, in a attempt to comfort the wolf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo this you saw him nod his head in agreement before he attempted to try to change the subject as he asked, \"But now if you don't mind me asking, what is Earth like?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Erm well it has many different cultures and countries. And we mostly keep to ourselves for the most part. Though we do trade various goods to each other every now and again. Or send help if one of our allies is in a war with another country.\" You explained, though you didn't want to give away too much info as of yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain you saw the white wolf nod his head. AFter doin gthis though you saw him give you a more serious expression when he asked, \"Then let me ask this then, Marco. How has your planet faired with the Parents?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis question caught you off guard, though you knew it'd be brought by him at some point. And so you figured you should be honest with him as you answered back, \"Well....actually we don't communicate with the Parents at all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? Your people never once spoke to the Parents at all?\" Cassius asked, clearly taken aback by your answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Never. And honestly I think we humans have done quite well for ourselves regardless of this. Though now that I think about it there is a place called Egypt that has pictures of various anthro like creatures. So those must be a race of silbing that they drew on the walls.\" You admitted, as you decided to lay up against him now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first you felt the wolf tense up a little bit from you doing this. Though this only lasted moment before you felt him push you slightly closer up against him and letting out another sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter doing this though you saw him look down at you in content, but also slight confusion when he asked, \"Really? Hmm, perhaps more then one sibling has been to Earth?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe? I honestly am not sure since that's the only place that has had any sign of them. So I suppose all of our countries were started by different siblings, wolves included since there is a place called Rome Italy. Which from what I've read was very similar to what it's like on here. Well minus the drones and sliding doors and what not.\" You replied back, now wondering over these things yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"hmm, how interesting. But thank you for telling me this, Marco.\" Cassius replied, now with a smile on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure Cassius. But why are you thanking me?\" You asked, happy to help of course, but not quite sure why he was thanking you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo this you heard and saw the anthro wolf let out a light chuckle before he told you, \"Because once I become Emperor I plan to make some changes to our way of life. But for the better since I think trading between the siblings may work. But I also feel that we don't need the Parents at all. If Earth can survive without them then so can we. And I know that it won't be an easy path. ...But I think with you by my side I maybe able to accomplish my goal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-Oh, um thanks Cassius. I'll do my best to help you as best as I can. Though I hope you'll promise to take me back home since I'm sure my family is worried sick of me.\" You responded back with, as you tried not to blush from the wolf's kind words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course Marco. Once things have settled down after I've become Emperor, I promise to take you home safely.\" Cassius reassured you, as you saw him lean and gently nuzzle his large head against your own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis caused you to blush even more before the two of you just sat in the water for thirty more minutes in silence. Though it wasn't an awkward silence. It was more like a calm and content silence surprising. And once Cassius had gotten up out of hte tub and had helped you dry off and get dressed you then saw him get dressed as well, to which you tried not to stare to at his massive back and two large, muscled,a nd firm buttcheeks as his tail lightly swayed from side to side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut once he was dressed and the two of you were walking out of the bathing room you soon saw that you were about to.......</span></div></div>",

And before you knew it the large white wolf had placed his hand on the panel and opened one of hte doors to it while ushering you inside again. So you walked into the very large room and walked up to the center of it as Cassius now walked behind you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough once you had turned around you saw his arms were crossed over his large pecs as he asked, \"So you know why I brought you here yes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, because you want us to practice for the first trail?\" You replied back, while you fixed the robe you were still wearing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter asking your question you saw the younger brother of the royal family of Adastra nod his head before he said, \"Yes, that's right. But now tell me, did Amicus tell you what the dance was about?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing this question prompted you to place a hand underneath your chin while you carefully replied back with, \"Well....I know it's a dance based off of a legend of the first Emperor of Adastra Drusus and a female tiger sibling named Meera who loved each other very much, right? And I know in the end she sacrificed herself for some reason also.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\".....Yes, that is correct. But did he tell you that there will only be howls and growls during the dance?\" The wolf questioned, now with a raised eyebrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou just stood in place in complete and utter shock as you slowly shook your head from side to side as you had no idea that something like that would be done during the trail. Though in the back of your mind you somehow knew that it made sense since they were wolves after all. So why would they have actual lyrics for their music.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough once you had borken out of your shocked state you saw the younger sibling of the royal family smirk down at you as he remarked, \"I thought as much. He would leave out such a detail. Obviously out of excitement I'm sure.\" However, as soon as he uttered these words you saw his shoulders slump while he let out a heavy sigh and added, \"My apologies Marco. I know I shouldn't continue to bring him up or talk porrly of him. However, as you know my brother just never thinks things through.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, that much is obvious. But let's try to focus on practice alright?\" You suggested, as you really didn't wnat to think about the muscle gutted wolf anymore after what had happened earlier in the day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course.\" Cassius softly let out, before he told one of your hands into hsi and the practice began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou found yourself letting out a sigh of relief once Cassius had finally called it a day for when it came to practicing for the first trail. And at first you saw a large smile on the wolf's face obviously happy with how things went. Though once you saw him look you from top to bottom you heard him let out a sigh of his own. However, this one sounded like one of slight annoyance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then saw him look in the eyes while he commented, \"I'm sorry, but this won't do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh. Did I not do well with the practice or something? I mean sure the howls you did to let me know what they meant for each part of the dance was a bit surprising a little rough on my ears. But I still feel pretty confident about how it went.\" You confessed, as you in turn looked up at the wolf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce you did this though you saw the white furred wolf's gaze move away from yours as he admitted, \"no, that isn't the problem. It's your clothes. ...Or rather lack of clothes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon hearing this you let out a nervous chuckle while you told him, \"Y-Yeah, this isn't what I originally arrived in I assure you. But my old clothes got really dirty and I was never able to get new ones made since everything was moving so quickly. Plus Amicus thought it'd be a good idea for me not to wear my Earth clothes when you guys first saw me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see...\" Cassius let out, before you saw him look up at the ceiling. And upon doing so he called out, \"Com.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Cassius.\" The robotic voice from above asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please have some new clothes made for Marco that are similar to what he was wearing upon his arrival to Adastra. And please make sure that are in my chambers once they are done.\" Cassius calmly ordered, before you saw him lok back down at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Cassius.\" Com simply replied, before going silent like normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You really don't have to do that, Cassius.\" You lightly protested, as you saw him walk up to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then saw and felt one of his large furry ahnds place itself onto your uninjured shoulder while he replied, \"It really is not a problem Marco. I want you to be comfortable while you're here after all. So having clothes made for you is one way to do it then it shall be done.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"T-Thanks Cassius...\" You let out, while you tried not ot blush since you weren't expecting this from the white wolf who seemed to keep on surprising you now after his change in size earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo this you saw Cassius give you a warm smile before he turned around and walked out of the throne room while still having his hand onto your hsoulder thus bringing up against him a little bit. And once the two of you had entered the room you saw a row of pants and tunic like shirts in front of Cassius's bedroom door. Along with this was the tray of food, though it seemed to be a much larger amount of food. Though considering Cassius had larger clothes made for himself earlier today it stood to reason he'd think ahead for when it came to food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so you pushed the tray into his food and put on the soft material made pants and tunic like shirt which seemed to fit you pretty well actually. The two of you then ate dinner together and after talking with each other for an hour more you both decided to call it a night and went to bed in Cassius's bed together. And even though it was a bit awkward at first you quickly got used to it and soon found yourself falling asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassius looked down at Marco after the human had fallen asleep, obviously exhausted from the day he had gone through. And even though the white wolf was also tired he found himself looking down at the pedant that the young amn had given to him which had caused all of this happen. And even though he was grateful for the changes that it had given him the younger sibling of the royal family wondered if it was worth keeping the pedant on or not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, after Cassius had quietly sat up in bed and looked at a nearby nightstand he decided to......</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Cassius's red eyes stared down at the pedant that was between his two large pecs as he contemplated on what do. He knew he could just remove it if he so pleased and if he explained to Marco why he did so he was certain the human would understand. And even if he kept it on and never took it off he had no idea what result that would bring. So he came to the conclusion that he'd only keep it on for one more day. And after that he would take off the pedant and put it away somehwere safe in his bedroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, after deciding this one of the wolf's white ears twitched when he heard the human that was a sleep next to him start to move around in his sleep while he muttered out, \"No. You're wrong....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon hearing this the white wolf looked down the human with a concerned look on his face as he thought to himself, \"<i>Hmm, Marco must be having some sort of nightmare. Though I suppose such things would only be natural considering his on an unfamiliar planet and far away from his own home.</i>\" And so in a attempt to calm the human down the white wolf laid down next ot he human and carefully wrapped his large muscled around him and held him up against his large pecs as he told him in a hushed voice when he felt the human start to move around again, \"Shhh, it's alright Marco. You're safe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then waited until he felt the young man finally calm down and just lay still. Upon seeing this Cassius placed the bottom of his head on top of the human's own head and also fell to sleep with a slight smile on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked around and saw nothing but pure darkness. But from somehow nowhere and yet everywhere you heard a voice when it said, \"<i>You are on the wrong path.</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? What do you mean by \"the wrong path\"?\" You asked, not quite sure what this voice as gettin gat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd if whatever was tlaking ot you knew what you were thinking it replied, \"<i>The False Emperor. You gave that epdant to him and have now thus changed the plans that were in motion for you and others.</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing this only made you a even more confused a bit annoyed as your eyebrows narrowed and you shot back with, \"No.You're wrong.... I know Cassius will come around and want to make some sort of allaince with the other siblings.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>This may be true. But he wishes for all of the siblings to not rely on <u>us</u> any longer.</i>\" The voice replied back, to which you noticed a bit of angry in the voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And who or maybe I should say what exactly are you?\" You questioned, still not sure what's going on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo this you heard nothing but silence from whatever or whoever had been talking to you. And right when you were about to call out to the voice you felt a warm surround you and before you knew it you heard a voice whsipering to you telling you that everything would be alright. And upon hearing this you found yourself waking up in the arms of Cassius and that your head was up against his two large muscled pecs. This made you blush a dark red as you weren't expecting it. However, that would explain the warmth that surrounded you during tht tense conversation with whatever you were talking with who told you that being with Cassius was \"the wrong path\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd even though those specific words stuck out to you, you had no idea what the meaning behind it was. But perhaps in time you'd find out this answer. And so you soon found yourself giving back into sleep while the white wolf still held you up against his muscled body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce it had became morning though you found yourself waking up when you heard the felt the bed creak from Cassius getting off of it. And as you sat up you looked over at the white wolf and saw him stretch his body before he turned to face you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd upon doing this you saw him smile down at you before he said, \"Good morning Marco.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning Cassius.\" You replied back, while you also got up out of bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce that was done you both then got your day started by each taking a shower in his bathroom. After that was done and you had gotten dressed you then helped Cassius get dressed and even rubbed some of the liquid fragrance that he had ontot he space spots on his body like you did for Amicus. Though you did for Cassius due to him not being able to reach some parts of his body now that he was the same size as his brother. But while you put the fragrance on him you noticed that it did not smell like lavender at all. In fact it seemed to smell like roses, which surprised you a bit, but he obviously would have his own taste when it came to this sort of thing. And you did have to admit that it did smell very nice on him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that was done you saw Cassius smile down at you while he told you, \"Thank you Marco. I just hope I can get used to this new body of mine when it comes to daily things soon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sure you will Cassius. Besides I'm more then happy to help until you are used to it.\" You replied, to which you saw him nod his head in understanding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce he had done this the two of you then left his bedroom and walked down the hallways of the palace. Though while you did you this you wondered if you should bring up the odd dream you had to Cassius since you didn't remember going to sleep with him hold you like that. However, you decided to wait until a bit later to tell him about it since you saw that you two were heading towards the......</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You found yourself becoming quite a bit confused after Cassius had brought out to a section of the garden area where you saw a small table and two chairs set down on the grass along with some teacups and teapot and some snacks of some kind set on top of the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd as you saw the drones float away from the area you looked up at the white wolf and asked, \"Uh Cassius, what's going on? I thought we'd be having breakfast in the dining room like usual?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I suppose we should be doing that. But I wanted to have some more one on one time with you, Macro. Plus I know taht both Alex and Amicus would be quite cross while being in the same room as us.\" The red eyed anthro explained, while the two of you walked out into the garden. And once you had reached the table he pulled out your chair for you and then added, \"Also I don't need Cato noticing my changes just yet. Otherwise he might get very suspicious of everything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter he had told you this you then felt him push the chiar up against the table before walking over and then sitting in his own chair across from yours. Upon seeing this you got up out of a bit and then reached out to take a hold of the kettle to pour the tea into both of yours cups. And when you saw the snacks you figured that you'd want to put some of those on his plate before putting any of your own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, right when you had taken a hold of the handle of the kettle you felt one of Cassius's large furry ahnds go on top of yous before he asked, \"Marco, what are you doing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing this prompted you to look up at him quite confsued as you replied back, \"I'm pouring the tea for us? Isn't that what I'm supposed to do as your pet?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo your surprise you saw the younger brother of the royal family look off to the side while he responded back with, \"Well yes, that is true I suppose. But like with my brother I only ever want you to do that when we are around the others. But when it's just you and I, you don't need to do that. So please just sit down and relax and allow me to handle this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded your head and sat back down into the chair and watched Cassius poured you both some time and put some snacks out for the two to enjoy. Though once the white wolf had sat back down and taken a sip of his tea he took note of your surprised look on your face as he raised a eyebrow and gave you his own confused look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then saw a light blush spread across his face as he looked away from you and asked, \"Why are you staring at me like that Marco? Is what I just did really all that surprising?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Erm well no, it's not that. Well okay it kind of is. But it's just that it seems like that pedant really did change you in more then ways then one.\" You commented, while you took a sip of your tea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo this you saw a slight frown form on the wolf's face when he remarked, \"Well I will admit that it did change me for the better physically. But it did not change me emotionally or mentally.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I see. then I apolgize for assuming so.\" You told him, before you took a bite of one of snacks that was on your plate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo this you saw the wolf shake his head from side to side before a smile spread across his face and he replied, \"There is no need to apologize, Marco. Besides it has been some time since I have shown this side of myself to anyone.\" You then saw him place a hand underneath his chin as he added, \"Though I suppose that's not true since I did show this side to Alex of course.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo this you nodded your head and replied, \"Yes, that does make sense since he was your pet for some time before I arrived here after all.\" And you were about ot take another sip of your tea. Howver, you stopped yourself from doing so as you saw Cassius conitnue to move his fingers along his chin which prompted you look at him a bit concerned while you continued, \"Uh, Cassius. Is everything okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm? Oh, yes, I'm fine. However, it seems that I failed to notice that I had lost my piercings after I grew yesterday....\" The red eyed anthro confessed, while he moved his hands over his ears and you saw him fell around for them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAFter he di this you then saw him push his chair out a bit and upon seeing him pull his orange color kilt like bottoms out a bit along with what you assumed was his undergarments you found yourself almost sipping out your tea. But you made sure not to do that an dthus cause a mess, though from your shock you did find yourself swallowing it a bit more quickly then you were expecting which led to you coughing a little bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough while you were coughing you hear Cassius let out a gasp of shock before you heard him run up to you and gently pat your left shoulder blade as he asked, \"Marco?! Is something the matter?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked up at him and waited a few minutes to regain yourself from coughing. And after doing so you told him, \"I-I'm sorry Cassius. It's just that I wasn't expecting you to do that.\" You then felt your face grow warm as a light blush spread across your face when you kept on going with, \"But um why did you do that anyway?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo this you saw a blush spread acroos the wolf's features yet again as he looked away from you and let out in a hushed voice, \"I....um.....have or should I had a piercing done down there...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis caused your eyes to widen in shock as you looked up and asked in pure surprise, \"You had a dick piercing?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight after you had accidnetly asked his a bit too loudly you felt one of Cassiu's large white furred hands over your mouth as he told you, \"Shh! Not so loud!\" Though once he had calmed down a bit he removed his hand from your mouth and added, \"A-Anyway yes, I had a piercing there. Is it that surprising?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Erm well a little I suppose since I didn't see you as that kind of well wolf to do that. Though I guess I shouldn't be super surprised since people on here do piercings like you and your other siblings and Neferu have done. Some even do it on their tongue and bellybutton.\" You explained, to which you saw a smile spread across the wolf's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah I see.\" It seems Earth and Adastra aren't that different after all. Well besides the race of people who live on the planet.\" Cassius remarked, while he walked back to his seat and sat down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I don't know about that. But you'll see yourslef once you take me back home after this whole who willl be the next Emperor thing is done and over with.\" You replied back, to which you saw the wolf nod his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then saw him take a bite out of one of his own snacks and then swallowed the food before he crossed his arms over his chest and then pointed out, \"By the way Marco, last night you were moving around quite a lot in your sleep and were ven talking in sleep. ....Were you doing that due to a bad dream?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon hearing this you found yourself swallowing a small lump in your throat as you weren't for sure what you exactly were dreaming last night. Though knew that keeping the wolf waiting wouldn't be fair to him so you figured you'd try to explain it as best you can.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo you took in a breathe of air and then released it and then confessed, \"Well to be honest Cassius, I'm not sure what I was dreaming about. All I know is that I heard this voice telling me that was on \"the wrong path\" or something like that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, I see. Did this voice say anything else to you?\" Cassius asked, giving you his full attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well the voice also said that you wanted to wolves to not rely on them anymore. Though I didn't quite understand that part.\" You admitted, to which you saw the wolf close his red eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd after a bit of time had passed Cassius reopened his eyes as he said, \"I see. It must of been the Parents who were talking to you. They obviously know that once I became Emperor I would make sure that we no longer would need their \"guidance\" to get by in this universe anymore. Kind of like how it seems Earth has survived without their influence for so long.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, but if you did that wouldn't you not be able ot use the ship that is meant for Emperor anymore?\" You asked, while you both finished your tea and snacks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd once you had both finished them you saw the white wolf just smile at you while he replied, \"Ah, but that is why I feel your idea of becoming trade partners with the other siblings is a smart idea since then we could learn how ot use our own Stretch Drive like how the Khemians do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-Oh, well glad that I could hlep out in some way then.\" You replied, as you tried to not let your surrpsie show too much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough to this you just saw the wolf nod his head again while h replied, \"Of course, though we can worry about such manners of those once I've become Emperor. For now let's enjoy our tea and snacks shall we?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter this was said and done the two of you took the time to finish off the rest of the tea and a few more of the snacks. Once that was done the drones came by to clean up and take away the dishes. And while they did that Cassius stood up and offered you a hand which you took and he helped you up out of the chair. However, while you two walked around outside the palace you both were unaware that Cassius was about to have another growth spurt and thus add three more feet to his height along with some more muscle mass and have some more new sized clothes made right before he was about to..........</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After giving it some thought you figured you'd give the pedant to Alex. Mostly due to the fact that besides Amicus, the anthro cat was the only one who you felt you could fully trust. Even if he had told Neferu that you were smarter then you had been pretending to be. And since that was the only misstep the cat had done you figured this could be a good way to make things up to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so you decided to wait in Amicus's room until he had returned to the palace. Thankfully this only took about an hour or so as Com informed you, \"Marco, Alex has returned to the palace ahead of schedule. He is currently in the hallyway.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon hearing this information you left Amicus's room and walked down a few of the hallways until you saw Alex at the end of the hallway. This prompted you to wave an arm at him in both greeting and to get his attention as you also called out, Hey Alex, do you have a minute?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight after you had uttered out these words though you saw Alex's ears and fur shoot up along with a worried expresssion on his face as he ran up to you and covered your mouth with one of his hands while he asked, \"Marco, what are you doing? Do you want either Cassius or Cato to find out that you're smarter then what you've been letting on?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, yeah I guess not. Sorry about that Alex, I guess I just got excited because I wanted to give you a gift is all.\" You confessed, after the cat had removed his hand from your face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh a gift you say. Well as much as I'd love to accept it. Let's go into another room first.\" The dark and light dreen furred cat suggested, before you found yourself being led down another hallway and into the dining room of the palace. Once you had both entered the room you saw Alex turn to face you with a smile on his face when he added, \"Now then, what is this gift that you wanted to give me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis question prompted you to take out and reveal the odd colored pedant to the cat as you told him, \"Well I found this pedant earlier today and I figured I'd give to you as a gift of friendship.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo your surprise though you saw a hesitate expression on the cat's face as he asked, \"Oh really? Even after I accidently told Neferu something that I should have kept between us?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I still want to give this even after that happened. Besides Neferu hasn't done anything that information. However, if I give this to you then you have to promise me that you'll keep it for yourself and won't give it away to anyone, okay?\" You replied back, before you offered the pedant to the anthro cat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough within seconds you saw the anthro's furry ahnd came over and take the pedant from your hand and then put over his neck so that the pedant itself was on top of his pecs. You then saw him give you a big smile when he said, \"I promise that won't give this to anyone else. Or take it off since this is the nicest gift anyone hasn't given me. Thank you very much Marco.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're welcome Alex.\" You responded back with, as you returned the smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alex, Marco, both Amicus and Cassius have returned to the palace.\" Com stated, which prompted you both to open your eyes and look upward for second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, it looks like our little chat will have to end here for today. But let's chat again soon.\" Alex told you, beofre you saw him walk out of the dinner room to which you then followed and you both went your separate ways.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe following day however made you quite surprised when Alex......</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Once you had followed behind Amicus into the dinner room you were quite surprised to only see Cassius and Cato sitting on their beds like they always did during breakfast. However, there was an obvious missing person that being Alex who was sitting down next to the white wolf's bed like his usual was. This prompted you to look at the spot quite confused as you thought to yourself, \"<i>Huh, I wonder Alex is? I figured he'd be here like he is always to serve breakfast like I'm going to have to....again.</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough as if knowing what you were thinking you heard Amicu's s voice when he asked his brother, \"So Cassius, where is Alex?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon hearing this question you saw one of the white wolf's ears twitch as he waved a furry hand dismissively when he answered back, \"Apparently he wasn't feeling well this morning. Though if you ask me he didn't sound that sick, but I suppose illnesses affect all of us differently.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes I suppose that is true.\" The black and grey furred wolf replied, before he sat down on his bed as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter he did this you found yourself letting out a heavy sigh as you knew you'd have to serve both Amicus and Cassius this morning. And so you decided to get to work on putting food on their plates and filling their goblets with wine when they wanted a refill. Thankfully though when Amcius saw that you trying to rush through this you told you to sit down and that he'd take care of his own food. This made it a little easier since then all you had to do was serve Cassius here and there. But once all three wolves had left you let out a heavy sigh of relief as you sat on Amicus's bed alone while you had gotten your plates set with food along with Alex's in case he happened to show up for breakfast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd as if on cue you heard Com's voice when he asked, \"Marco, Alex is outside the door, but would like to know if anyone else is in there with you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Erm no com, tell him that I'm alone.\" You replied, now feeling confsued by the question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter giving your reply Com then went silent on your end obviously telling Alex your answer. Then within a few seconds you heard one of the doors being opened and then quickly closed. Once this occurred you found yourself turning around and upon doing so you found yourself becoming confused when you saw a figured covered up by a heavy blanket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing this prompted you to get off of the bed and walk towards the anthro cat as you asked, \"Alex, are you sure you should be right now? Aren't you sick?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I'm not sick Marco. I'm afraid that I had to lie to Cassius just so he didn't get suspicious.\" The covered cat explained, as you noticed that he seemed to be looking down at you from inside his blanket made cloak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Erm okay. Well I'm glad you aren't sick But if you aren't sick then what's wrong?\" You wondered, while the two of you walked over to Amicus's bed and sat down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut once you had sat down you figured that the dark and light green furred cat would go sit down on Cassius's bed. Instead however you heard the bed groan in slight protest as he got onto it and sat down next to you. You then saw him look at you when he asked, \"Marco, if I show you something can you promise to keep this between us?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course I will Alex. Besides that friends do on my planet.\" You reassured the cat, while you attempted a reassuring smile to boot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo your surprise you heard the cat let out a light chuckle before he replied, \"How interesting. But I'm glad to hear it because erm well you see.....

Though this made a lot of questions pop into your head. How did this happen? Why did this happen? And when did this happen? However, you did notice that the pedant was still on the cat and was now between his two massive pecs as it had a light glow, however that quickly went away after a few seconds. This prompted you to look up at Alex's face as you noticed that he a concerned look on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were then brought out of your daze like state when he asked, \"Marco, are you alright? You've been staring at me for some time now.....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? Oh, sorry about that Alex. But can you blame me for staring? I mean look at you? You're most likely the same size as Neferu is.\" You pointed out, as you did your best to remain calm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo this you saw the cat rub the back of his head with one of his hands before he replied, \"Yes, you might be right. Though it was quite the surprise for me as well. Though if I\"m being honest I don't think I really mind these changes all that much.\" You then felt him get onto the bed again until his face was up close to yours. This caused you to blush asyou saw him give you a sly smile when he added, \"And I get the feeling you like these changes too, don't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"U-Um, well.....\" You stuttered out, as you swallowed a lump in your throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter you dot this though you saw Alex just give you a big smile while he commented, \"I think I just got my answer. But putting that matter to the side for the time being I think you and I should go somewhere else before anyone else sees me.\" You then felt your face get warm again when you felt his lips up against your right ear when he continued in a hushed voice, \"And don't worry I promise to thank you properly for having to serve breakfast all on your own this morning, marco.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt yourself wanting to give the anthro cat some kind of response to this comment. However, nothing came out of your mouth word wise as this side of Alex you had no idea even existed. Could he be acting more daring due to this change? You knew that there was more to the different shades of green furred anthro then what he had been showing you when you first arrived here. But how far did that go personality wise?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSadly you weren't able to get this question out as you saw Alex cover himself up with the blanket again once he had stood up onto his feet and had gotten off of the bed. But this time you then found yourslef being pulled up against the cat's massive muscles and into his large arms as he carried you bridal style and walked out of the dining room. And while you were up against him more and more questions were being brought up in your head. Though the most important one was where exactly was Alex taking you?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough after some time of him walking down the hallways of the palace you soon saw that the now much larger cat had taken you to.....</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>From what you could see from underneath the large blanket was that Alex was now at the gate to the palace and just like that he threw the blanket off of you both and just strolled out of the palace without any issues. This made a little bit confused at first, though since you knew that he was an ambassador for his home planet he obvioulsy has those kind of advantages. Though you found yourself a bit confused when he set you down onto the ground onto your feet and set down a large sakc that you just now realized that he had been carrying along with you this entire time.Once that was done you saw him pull out to cloaks of different sizes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then saw him pas it to you while he told you, \"Here. Put this on before we enter the city.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alex? What is going on here exactly?\" You asked him, as you became even more confused with the cat's actions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd after he had put his cloak on and you had put yours on he placed a large hand onto your shoulder and replied, \"I'm afraid right now isn't the best time to explain. But let's just say I'm giving us back our freedom. Though I do promise to explain everything once we reach an inn I saw in one of the cities.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon hearing this uyou let out a sigh as you really wanted to push the matter further. But from the looks on the cat's face he didn't want to into details about whatever he was doing out in public. Though you couldn't help but wonder what he menat when he said that he was giving you both back \"your freedom\" while you walked beside him. And after quite a bit of walking and seeing and hearing various wolves talk amonst themselves you finally arrived at a vary large building. You then followed behind Alex and into the large building. ANd upon doing so you soon saw that he had taken you to an inn of some kind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then watched as he placed a large sack onto the front desk which seemed to cause the grey wolf who owned the place very happy as he nodded his head and then gave the cat a room key. Once that was done you then felt one of Alex's hands take yours into his before he walked you both upstairs and into a room on the second floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd once you had entered the very nice room which you noticed had only one bed in it which made you blush a little bit knowing that you'd be sharing the bed with the large anthro feline. You heard the anthro close the door and then let out a sigh of relief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then saw him turn around ot face you now with that familiar smile on his face when he said, \"There. Now both you and I are free from being those spoiled wolves \"pets\" anymore.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing this prompted you to tilt your head a bit in confusion as you asked him, \"Wait a minute, Alex. What do you mean by that exactly? Didn't you and Cassius sign a contract to make that official or something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, we did do that. But do you really think I wanted to be a pet to that wolf? No thank you. I only did it because I missed the ship that was leaving this planet.\" The different green furred cat shot back, now with a very serious look on his face. Though this soon became one of slight regret as he looked off to the side and added, \"Erm I'm sorry about that Marco. I shouldn't be snapping you like that. But you must know that those wolves only think of non one but themselves. However, now they'll have to find replaces for their first trail I wonder imagine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh....okay? And how does that help us exactly?\" You responded back with, still not sure what the cat was getting at.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain you only saw Alex give youa  big smile before he reassured you, \"Don't worry Marco. I promise to tell you why I did what I did in due time.\" You then saw him move closer to you until he was right upa gainst you as he went on with, \"But first allow me to repay you for this wonderful pedant that you gave me. Because if you hadn't then I never would of gottten the courage to leave that accursed palace.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd within seconds your nose was filled with a scent of grapes as you found out that the heavily muscled cat was going to thank you by......</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>While looking at the pedant in your hand you figured that the only fair thing to do was to split the pdenat into four smaller pedants. That way no one would feel left out and this way maybe no one would think you were paying certain attention to anyone in particular. And so you walked back to Amicus's room and got to work as you were able to find some extra string and you carefully pressed against the small panels that were sticking out on the pedant which then turn the large crystal into four smaller crystals. In fact you were so focused on your work that you hadn't heard Com tell you that everyone was returning to the palace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlong with this you hadn't even noticed Amicus's bedroom slide oepn and the large wolf walking up behind you and then wrapping you up in his large arms as he greeted you with, \"I'm finally back, Marco.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, hi Amicus. I hadn't realized that you had gotten back. I guess I got too focused on what was I doing to notice.\" You confessed, as you let out a light laugh more so aimed at yourself then anything else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I could see that. So what are you doing with those small pedants?\" The black and gray furred wolf asked, as he looked down at them from behind your right shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I found this large pedant in an empty room and I decided to split the pedant into four smaller ones and give one to you, Neferu, Alex, and even Cassius.\" You explained, to which you felt Amicus let you go and let out a light scoff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter doing this he then protested, \"I can understanding giving one to me of course. And even giving one to Alex. But why Neferu, or even my brother?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because this could help make an alliance between the wolves and jackals come about more easily. And for Cassius, I figured it'd be a good way for you two make up in a way, you know?\" You explained, before you took all four pedants and handed them to the muscle gutted wolf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce you do this you saw him give you a confused expression for a few seconds before a large smile spread on his face and he commented, \"Oh! That's actually a very smart idea Marco. I'll go give these to them now. But I'll make sure to say that you made these for them. Which might be a bit hard to sell for Cassius since he thinks you're dumber then what you actually. But I'm sure I'll think of something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then watched as the black and grey furred anthro wolf walked out of his room after putting his pedant around his neck. Seeing this though only brought a smile to you face as you hoped this could make things a bit more relaxed and not so tensed between everyone. I mean sure Amicus and Cassius were competing to become the next Emperor, but that didn't mean that they needed to hate each other because of that. And so feeling like you accomplished something you went over to the couch and decided to rest for a bit until Amicus pushed the dinner cart into the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day however, you noticed that not only wee all fouir male anthros wearing the pedants that you had made them, which they thanked you for.

In face his muscles seemed a bit bigger too. And his stomach a bit more defined too. In fact when you both walked down to the dinning room to have breakfast (well Amicus would have breakfast while you served him yet again) you even noticed that same thing had happened to Neferu, who had waved over at you and gave you a quick thank you while you nodded in understanding, not wanting to make Amicus get impatient.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd when you both entered the dining room you noticed that Cassius also seemed a bit taller. IN fact he looked like he had gianed a bit muscle as well. This was even the case for Alex as well which caused you to have even more questions runing through your head. Was this due to that pedant that you had slipt into four yesterday? Were these changes permit? Could all four of them grow again?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSadly you did not kow the answers to any of these questions while you served Amicus breakfast and ate your own breakfast with Alex. In fact you were so lost in your own thoughts that you weren't even sure what Amicus had told you this morning before you had entered the dining room since Neferu had caught your attention. And this only made you feel a bit worse as you weren't exactly sure what Alex had said to you along with thanking you like Neferu had done earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough you were soon brought out of your thoughts when you heard one of the four anthro voices as they called out to you, \"Marco?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis prompted you to let out a, \"Huh?

Would you mind helping us out here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um sure, Amicus. What did you and Neferu need me to answer for you?\" You replied back with, as you tried to figure out what they might ask you though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, you found yourself blushing a bit when the black and golden tattooed jackal asked you, \"We need you to tell us who's bigger? Is Amicus bigger? Or am I?\" Right after asking this though you saw the now larger jackal give you a happy smile and flex one of his arms before he added, \"Though we both know the answer is me don't we, Marco?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?! No, Marco knows that I'm way bigger then you are jackal!\" The black and grey wolf snapped back, while he turned to face the jackal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter doing this though both you and the wolf let out gasps of shock when you saw Neferu reach down and stroke the front part of his pants. He then winked and commented, \"Well yes, you are certainly quite large down there from what I saw when the three of us were in the bathing area together.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou just looked on in complete and total shock from this action. And to your surprise even more Amicus didn't move his clothed groin away from the hand. Though after a few more seconds he did clear his throat and looked way with a light blush on hi face as he remarked back, \"U-Um well I'm sure you're pretty big down there too.... From waht I could see considering you have a sheath.*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why thank you.\" Neferu replied, now with a big smile on his face once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou on the other hand just stood there in total shock at what was playing out in front of you as you let out, \"Um....if you guys think that you're both so large why did you want my opinion on the matter?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon hearing this both anthros turned to face you before Amicus explained, \"Well we more so wanted you to see which one of us had the bigger muscles.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-Oh, well I would give my opinion on that. But you both have very different body types. Amicus you're very muscled of ourse. But you do have quite the gut on you from eating so much over the years I'd assume.\" You told the wolf, as you did your best to stay calm. You then looked over at Neferu and continued, \"While you Neferu just have massive muscles all over your body. So honestly you're both pretty large in my opinion.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce you had uttered these words you saw both anthros stare at you for a minutes or so which made you start to feel a bit tense and wonder if you said something wrong. However, you soon saw both anthros smile down at you again and they both even placed a hand onto your shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce that had been done Amicus said, \"You know I had a feeling you'd try to be the peacekeeper between us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I agree. Though that's not a bad thing if we want this alliance of ours to be fulfilled.\" Neferu agreed, before you then felt both of the hands go over your entire back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling this though only made you a bit more confused as the two anthros then started to walk out of the room while Cassius and Alex chatted with each other at the other end of it.

Though considering both of them looked not only taller, but had bodies with large muscles on them perhaps that was why they weren't afraid to show their affections for each other privatily anymore. However, this was only a guess on your part since you honestly had no idea whh they'd change their minds like this out of the blue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, you had this feeling that you were about to get some kind of answer once you saw the dark and light green furred cat smile at you when he greeted you with, \"Oh Marco, hello!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi Alex, and good morning to you too, Cassius.\" You replied back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo this you saw the white furred wolf let go of the cat's hand and then cross both of his arms in front of his now large pecs before he responded back with, \"Good morning Marco.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd upon seeing the slightly stern look on the wolf's face made you a bit nervous you couldn't lie to yourslef.

However, instead you small a smile spread across his muzzle while he confessed, \"yes, we are.

And so we must thank you for these pedants Marco. Because well we aren't sure what happened.

You then saw him walk up to you and look down at you when he continued with, \"So I thank you Marco. I feel incredible.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-You're welcome Cassius...\" You let out, while you tried not to blush again now with two large anthro men on either side of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAFter uttering these words you saw Alex lean over to Cassius and wishper something in his ear.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You looked on very surprised upon seeing the now bigger Neferu standing next to a bigger Cassius, who had nothing but all muscle on him just like the jackal did. However, you could tell that the white wolf didn't have any interest in showing it off or flaunting it like the jackal did as  light blush was on his face. You even saw him muter something under his breathe while he crossed his arms over his pecs and looked away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis caught your interest a bit as the two walked up to you and you asked them, \"Hello Neferu, Cassius. Is everything alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeferu was the first to reply as he looked down at you and just gave you a big smile and flexed an arm before he replied, \"Ah Marco, hello my friend. Though I assure you that nothing is wrong per say. I was giving Cassius a compliment on how he looks now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight after syaing this though the white wolf quickly looked up at the bigger anthro and shot back with, \"Hey, it's not like I was expecting this to happen after my brother gave me this pedant! No less was I expecting it to be a gift from his pet!\" Though he then calmed down and let out a heavy sigh before he looked over at you and added, \"However, I suppose I msut thank you for doing this Marco. For if you hadn't then not only would this not of happened to me. But it seems that my bone illness has vanished completely.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-Wow, really? Well that's great that you don't need ot worry about getting hurt from doing everyday things anymore Cassius. And so you're welcome for the gift since I figured it was only fair to give all four of you guys each a pedant.\" You replied to the wolf, as you tried not to be too taken aback by what he had just said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough this was quickly throw to the side completely when you saw and then felt one of Neferu's larger arms go around you and then pull you up against his rock hard abs and massive pecs when he suggested, \"Well Cassius, if you won't tkae my word for how good you look now. Why don't we ask Marco here for his opinion on the matter?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why?\" Cassius asked, as he raised an eyebrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well why not? I'm sure he'll give you an honest opinion on how you look won't you my friend?\" The black and golden tattooed jackal replied, while you saw him look down and then wink at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing this did make you blush a little bit as you swallowed a lump in your throat before you nodded your head and let out, \"O-Of course..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wonderful! Then by all means please tell Cassius here that he looks amazing after whatever change befell him last night.\" Neferu urged you on, still with a large smile on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that was said you looked over at the white wolf and did take notice of how much taller he was now. And how muscle he had gained as well as he was very large all around just like Neferu was. Massive arms and shoulders, followed by two massive pecs and below that was a six pack of rock hard which were just as defined as Neferu's now eight pack was that you saw from the corner of your eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo you did your best not to stare for too long as you swallowed another lump in your throat and confessed, \"Y-Yeah, you look pretty good Cassius....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo this you saw the white wolf blush a bit and look away from you while he let out, \"Not you too....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut after a bit of awkward silence you suggested to both Neferu and Cassius that you should take a walk. And to your relief they agreed. Though while you did this you were quite surprised when you noticed that.....</span></div></div>",

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">Hello again everyone and so here I am again with a second Adastra based interactive story. This time though as the title says it will be focusing on growth. Though there are some rules we must go over before Marco (aka you) has to deal with a growing anthro.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. Please keep the point of view in second person.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. There are different sets heights that you can make the characters grow up to. 10 feet is the smallest and 500 feet is the biggest. However, if you have the characters grow past up to or past 20 feet then they must leave the capital and go to one of the islands since well I feel it's the logical thing to do in that situation. Also the growth is both height and muscle based, though that might be stating the obvious, lol.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. Speaking of growth please make sure that the growth is at a slow or medium pace sine I'd like to have it be drawn out each of the storylines that can be picked from.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n4. Only M/M interactions of course.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n5. No death, toilet humor, or destruction. Though if say a chair or clothes rip because of the growth then that's okay, but make sure none of the characters don't go around destroying buildings and what not since that'd be way out of character.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n6. Please keep everyone in character at all times. Though character development due to the growth is fine along with said character and Marco ending up together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n7. Please try to use good grammar when typing out chapters. If there are a few spelling errors then I will try to find and fix them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n8. Have fun and enjoy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh, also just as a reminder to you guys, Cassius's bone illness is always cured thanks to the pedant on any of this story paths and the four pedant story paths too. But of course by all means feel free to let that be known in each of those story paths in different ways. Be as creative as you want when it comes to that.</td>",
