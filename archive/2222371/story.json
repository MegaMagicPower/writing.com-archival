            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You let out a heavy sigh as you walked down the halls of the empty palace while the sum shined down outside. The reason for this was because you found yourself being quite bored. Mostly because the wolf Amicus who had brought you to Adastra from Earth about two weeks ago was gone doing political things to gain the other wolves votes to become the next Emperor. Though his younger brother Cassius was off doing the same today as well. And the jackal Nefru had gone out to the city for his own reasons. Though that seemed to be the case for the cat Alex as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so this was why you were wondering the halls in a slow like manner, though you were glad that Cato was gone as well otheriwse you'd have to pretend to be very dumb intelligence wise and if you were being honest you dind't like doing that. But thankfully those thoughts were pushed to the side when you passed by a very dusty looking door that looked to be a bit open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis prompted you to turn your head to trhe right in slight confusion as you thought out loud, \"Huh, that's weird. I wonder why this is partly open. Along with that I wonder if it can even open up fully.\" And so you walked up to the door and placed your hand on the panel. And to your surprise you heard the door slide open which then revealed an empty room with only tables in it after the lights for it came on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, after you had walked inside you noticed that something was on the middle table. Which prompted you to walk up to it and upon a closer look you saw a pedant that was light blue in color. But every so often you saw some white shapes flast on it every so often. This made you curious as you took a hold of the pedant and saw that it oculd even be split into four pieces. But then this led to the question what exactly this was? Was some kind of Parent Tech that was hidden away? Or was it just some kind of odd pedant?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo many questions and yet you had a feeling you wouldn't find out the answers to your questions anytime soon. So instead another idea came to your head that being of who you should give this pedant too? Of course the first choice was Amicus since he had been kind to you despite how things started out between you two. Then there was Neferu who may be a bit flirty with you, but you had a feeling he more so did this to get under Amicus's fur. Well either that he just liked to flirt a lot. Then there was Cassius who you honestly didn't know much about, mostly due to him treating you like a pet and actually believing you were dumb. So doing this might expose Amicus's idea of making you play dumb. But wouldn't that be bgood if he treated you differently. Plus it could make up for what happened to his tail after Amicus pushed him onto the floor. And then there was Alex, who you had gotten along with since you had came to Adastra, and even though you hadn't seen lately maybe giving him a gift could show that you have still been thinking of him in a way. And then you could even give all four of them the pedant in a way if you split it into four pieces from those small panels on it. You'd just have find some extra string of some kind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so after you had walked out of the room and made sure the door was back to the position it was in you decided to give this odd pedant to......</span></div></div>",

And even though you didn't like being here, you knew that he was the only one on the moon who you could trust. So with these thougthts in your head you decided to go back into Amicus's room and wait for him to return.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout an hour or so later you saw the door to Amicus's room slide open thus revealing the large muscle gutted wolf who let out a heavy sigh. But upon seeing you a smile spread across his face as he greeted you with, \"Marco, I'm sorry that my travels to the city took so long.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah, it's okay Amicus. I figured that'd be the case since you and Cassius are trying to become the next emperor after all.\" You reassured the large wolf, as you got up off of the couch and then gave him a hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon doing this you heard the anthro let out a chuckle to which he then returned the hug to you. But while you two were hugging you felt oneof his huge furry ahnds reach into your pocket and then pull out the pedant. After doing this you then saw him look down at you while he asked, \"Oh, what's this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis question prompted you to blush a little bit while you confessed, \"Well I found this pedant and I figured I'd give to you as a gift.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww, that's very kind of you Marco. Thank you very much for this gift. I bet this will be my new good luck charm, besides you of course.\" The black and gray furry wolf replied, as he put the pedant on and it was up against the middle of his two ;arge pecs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter doing this the two of you then enjoyed dinner and chatted for a bit of what the wolf did out in the city to convince the other wolves to vote for him to become emperor. And before you knew it was dark outside and the two of you went to bed for the night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning both you and Amicus woke up and got ready for the day that was ahead of you. However, when Amcius was getting dressed you noticed that when the large wolf was getting his pants that they seemed to be......</span></div></div>",

He had to suck in his gut a bit to get the pants to tie together. Seeing him slightly occupied with this you walked over to at least help him with the other parts of his dressing, picking up his red shawl and wrapping it around the wolf's stump like neck which you swore felt more toned than previously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Amicus, I think you should moderate yourself on you eating, looks like you are bulking up...\" You mockingly scolded the princely wolf, finding the whole thing amusing that for once you can tease him for once after all you have been subjected to your self since being abducted by the roman space wolf who was now your master and made you a slightly reluctant participant in the contest to be the new emperor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! Stop it, Marco!\" Amicus protested, while H looked at you from over one of your massive shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce you had finished helping him get dressed you look up at him while notciing how tight all of his clothes looked on him when you replied, \"I am just saying the truth Amicus!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe! But at least I am not scrawny like Cassius is!\" He countered, to which you had to admit that he had a point there. \"Also it's all muscle!\" The wolf added to further his point, as you looked on as he began to pace around the room<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure it is!\" You sarcastically commented which resulted in a slightly annoyed glance from the burly wolf who looked to you to even be maybe slightly taller than normal. Then again you were a human after all and much shorter than the Adastran wolves, so it was likely just you imagining things. By this point, you even kinda forgot about the pedant you gave him which he still was wearing. Resting proudly between his two furred pecs and almost looking like it was glowing slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha! That's enough Marco! I need your help to me as emperor not hear anymore sassy remarks from you! You do want to return to Earth, don't you?\" The muscle gutted wolf remarked, to which you just rolled your eyes at his light-hearted jab.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd os to change the subject you asked him, \"So what's the plan for today, master Amicus?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmicus turned to you and then said...,,</span></div></div>",

But the only problem was tha the didn't seem any the wiser to it. Which was a bit worrying since you'd hate for his pants to pants to rip while either parcticing or during the actual trail. however, you did have hope that amybe he'd notice the difference in his size before the actual trail. But knowing him, he might not notice it until it was too late. Plus you still had no idea how he grew to begin with. Though you had a small hench with the pedant between his pecs which wasn't glowing anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, while you were in your own thoughts you felt one of the wolf's large furry ahnds on your shoulder when he asked, \"Marco, is everything okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-Huh? Oh, yes, everything's fine. I just got lost in thought about something is all.\" You reassured the muscle gutted wolf, before you gave him a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter you did this you saw him smile down atyou as wlel before the two of you waliked out of his bedroom and made your way to the throne room. And upon reaching and then entering the massive room you both walked to the center of it before Amicus turned to you and went over the basic steps of the dance and what roles you'd both playing. Which well that part was a bit confusing at first, but after he explained what the dance represented for their history it made sense to you in some ways.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough once the actual practice started you noticed Amicus's hands were even bigger when up agaisnt your side or when he held one of your hands. And you alos noticed that your head wasn't at the normal eye level with Amicus's body like it was yesterday either. And to your surprise Amicus seemed to finlaly notice the difference when he asked, \"Hey Marco, is it just me, or do you seem smaller then what you did yesterday?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Erm well, no not really. I think you've grown somehow Amicus.\" You replied back, which caused the black and gray furred wolf to stop practicing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then saw him take in a breathe of air before letting it out.

But on the other hand you figured this was a smart thing to do since not only could you say that this was a gift between friends. But also maybe try to convince the jackal that you'll help him get Amicus to be onboard with the alliance between the wolves and jackals. So with this idea in your head you decided to go back to Amicus's room and wait for the anthro to return to the palace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was about an hour or so later until you heard Com's voice when he told you, \"Neferu has returned to the palace Marco.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks Com.\" You replied, as you then made your way out of Amicus's bedroom. You then walked into the hallway and after making a few turns here and there you saw the heavily muscled anthro jackal about to walk into a room. But before he placed his palm onto the panel you attempted to get his attention with a wave of one of your arms while you called out, \"Neferu, welcome back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked on as one of the black jackal's golden ears twitch before you saw him look over at you and then completely to face. Upon doing so you saw him smile at you in greeting as you walked up to him as he replied, \"Ah Marco, good evening to you. And so what do I owe this company of ours?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing this question and seeing give you such a big smile prompted to blush a very small amount as you reached into your pocket and pulled out the pedant. You then presented it to him as you said, \"Well I found this pedant and figured I'd give to you as a gift. As a sign of friendship.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter saying this though you saw the black furred and golden marking covered jackal look at you with a raised eyebrow while he replied, \"Oh, a gift of friendship you say? Or you sure it doesn't have another meaning behind it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Erm no, it's just a gift of friendship. Plus I was hoping this could help get you and Amicus to get along with each other better.\" You confessed, as you saw the jackal gently take the pedant from you and then put it over his head to which it then laid against his pecs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then saw him smile down at you again as he responded back with, \"Well I'm not sure if this will help Amicus and I get along better. But it's nice to know that I have someone on this moon who seems to care about me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, wait, I didn't say that.\" You protested back, while your face turned a darker red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry Marco, I'm only teasing you.\" Neferu reassured you, to which you then saw him place a hand onto your head and gently rub his fingers through your hair. After doing this though you saw him wink down at you when he added, \"But if you change your mind about us being friends you know where to find me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter this was said you saw him walk away from you and into the room he had opened up earlier. Once this happened you let out a heavy sigh and then returned to Amicus's room where you ate dinner and then went to bed since you didn't feel like waiting for Amicus and have him get super jealous after telling him what you did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCome the next day however, when you walked into the gardens along with Amicus you saw that......</span></div></div>",

Well that's only thanks to you my friend.\" Neferu replied, while he closed his eyes and gave you a big smile and flexed one of his massive arms a little bit just by moving it. Though this only lasts for a few seconds more before he lowered his arm and then reopened his arms to look down at you when he added, \"You must have very good taste indeed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Erm well I don't know about that...\" You lightly protested, as you rubbed the back of your head with one of your hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, right after those words had left your mouth you hearda  light growl come from behind you before Amicu asked, \"Marco, what is he talking about?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh didn't he tell you?\" Neferu pondered, before you saw him ove in front of you a bit. And upon doing so he went on with, \"Marco here found this pedant and decided to give to me as not only a gift of friendship, but as a way for you and I to establish an alliance together. Or at least help us get there I would assume.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, I see...\" The muscle gutted wolf let out, while he calmed down but still had a large glare on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Amicus, I'm sorry I didn't tell you about this last night. But I knew that if I did then you'd get really jealous and might have said or done something that you'd had regretted.\" You explained, while you moved from behind the black and gold marked jackal and stood next to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I.....suppose that is true....\" Amicus admitted, as he clamed himself down. Though this didn't last long as the glare was still on his face when he continued, \"But is it just me or are you taller then me now, Neferu?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain the anthro jacakl just gave a big smile before he said, \"Oh, I suppose I am, aren't I?

Though speaking of the wolf you saw him look the jackal up and down still with a glare on his face. Though this didn't last long as he then turned his gaze over to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd upon so you felt a cold shiver go down your spine when he said, \"Well Marco, I don't what you did, but I hope you're proud of yourself?\" You then saw him turn away from both of you and then added, \"But that doesn't matter right now since I have to go into the cities and gain support. So I don't when I'll be back.\" You then saw him look at you again from the corner of his eye before he ekpt going, \"But maybe it's the best that we have some space from each other for the time being.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't you think ou're overreacting a little bit? LIke I told you a moment ago Marco's gift was only that of friendship and nothing more.\" Neferu stated, clearly trying to defend your intentions from yesterday.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tch, whatever.\" The black and gray furred wolf let out, as he then walke3d further into the garden and then down a dirt road.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd once he was gone you let out a heavy sigh while you commented, \"Great, looks like I messed things up again somehow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, you did nothing wrong Marco. If you ask me, Amcius is just being a bit over dramatic right now. So if you'd like you're more then welcome to accompany me wherever I go until his cooled down. Though if he doesn't then I hope you know that you can count on my support and aid to get you back home once this whole deciding the next Emperor has ended.\" Neferu reassured you, now with a soft smile on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first you were caught off garud by the jacakal's offer. Though given that what happened earlier could have gone better you decided to accept the anthro jackal's offer as you just smiled back up at him in return and replied, \"Thanks Neferu, that means a lot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are quite welcome my friend.\" Neferu responded back, befor eh offered you one of his now slightly bigger arms to hold onto.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis prompted you to blush a light pink as you placed both of your hands onto the jackal's left arm.

Seeing this from the white wolf prompted to frown a little as you weren't expecting to see from him. Though with his bone illness maybe even doing that type of was still straining on him. Though most likely you figured it was more a mental strain then a physical one since he didn't appear to be in any pain. Though as you made your way over to him you put your hand into the picket the pedant was in as you took in a sigh of air and then released it before you let out, \"Well here goes nothing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then saw one of Cassius's ears twitch before you saw him look over at you before he remarked, \"Oh, it's you, human.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My name is Marco.\" You corrected the thin wolf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, yes.\" The anthro wolf replied, while waving his hand dismissively. You then saw him sit upright before he added, \"So why did you come out here? And how exactly did you know I was out here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I asked Com.\" You simply responded back with, while you let out your own sigh. And I have to apologize for what happened to you after we first met?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tch, so my brother is having his brother apologize for something he did?\" Cassius spat back, with a frown on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope, he doesn't even know that I'm out here since he hasn't come back yet from his giving his own speeches to various speeches around the palace.\" You explained, as you saw the white wolf give you a surprised look with one of his eyebrows raised. Seeing this only made you sigh even more when you continued with, \"And I know this is very odd for you to hear me speak so well compared to the other times we've interacted with each other. But that wasn't my idea. It was Amicus's.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course it would be.\" The thin anthro muttered out, to which you then saw him stand up in front of you. After doing this he then went on, \"So was all that you wanted to tell me? Becuse if so then I will take my leave now. But thank you for being honest with me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing this made you panic a little as you blurted, \"Wait a minute, please!\" Right upon letting these words slip from your mouth you saw the wolf give you a curious look again before t I wanted to give you a gift too. Just so there wouldn't be any problem between us anymore.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so you pulled out the pedant from your robe pocket and presented it to the younger brother of Amicus. After doing this you saw the wolf's eyes widen in both shock and surprise as he most likely wasn't expecting you to give him a gift or apologize to you. And so with baited breathe you watched as the white wolf slowly reached out and then took the pedant from you and then proceeded to put it over his head to where the pedant itself was laying up against his flatish pecs as you saw him smile at you in earnest before he told you, \"Well this is certainly unexpected. But I will gladly accept this gift from you Marco. However, I still feel like I don't know much about you. So with that said I officially will make you my pet tomorrow morning once both Amicus and Alex return to the palace.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Erm wait, can you even do that?\" You asked, not expecting this from the white wolf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, it won't be that difficult depending on whether or not both my brother and Alex agree to this. Plus then this way I can learn more about you. Like where you are from for example.\" Cassius explained, still with that smile on his face. Hearing this prompted you to become nervous as you saw this coming, but you still weren't expecting it. Howeve,r to your surprise you saw and felt Cassius place one of his hands onto one of your shoulders as he added, \"I can tell from your reaction that you don't feel comfortable telling me where you're from. But I assure you that I won't force you to do nor will I tell anyone else about this. The location of your home planet will be kept between only you and I.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, I guess it couldn't hurt to give this a try.\" You replied back, as you thought you saw Cassius's tail sway from side to side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExcellent! Now we just have to wait to make this \"trade\" of pets official.\" Cassius said, still with a confident smile on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so you both went your separate ways for the rest of the night. Though in the back ofyour mmind you wonder how this trade between Amicus and Cassius would go down. However, you knew not to bring this up to Amicus, otherwise he'd most likely march to his brother's room and accidentally really hurt him out of angry. So once the dinner tray was brought to Amcius's room you pshed it in and ate some dinner. After doing this you then decided to go to bed for the night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning however, when you took Amicus out to the garden to be traded to Cassius, you saw the two other nathros standing outside waiting for you. And after Cassius had explained what he wanted to do you soon saw.......</span></div></div>",

After doing this though you heard the white wolf's voice again when he added on, \"Besides it's not like I'm forbidding you from seeing Marco whenever you wish.\" You then saw him cross his arms in front of his himself before he continued, \"But let's just say that I've gained an interest in the human.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, really? So then what was that ugly comment you made some time ago? And how do you know that Marco is a human? Unless.....\" The muscle gutted wolf questioned, as he quickly trailed off and looked over at you. You then found your eyes widen in slight fear when Amicus aimed his next sentence at you when he went on with, \"Oh, I get it now. You decided to stab me in the back did you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, no Amicus, I just got sick and tired of pretnding to be dumb. And plus I wanted to apologize to Cassius for what happened to him after you pushed him onto the floor.\" You explained, while you saw Alex have a very worried look on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cat then swallowed a lump in his throat before he muttered out, \"I'll go and wait for you in your room Amicus.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter saying this you heard the large wolf let out a grunt and within seconds Alex ran out of the garden and into the palace. Once this occurred you felt one of Cassius's furry hands genlty take a hold of yours as he told you, \"Well I think we'd best take our leave and let Amicus cool down Marco.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSadly while you were passing by Amicus you soon felt one of the black furry hands of the wolf forcibly take a hold o fyou and then add a lot of pressure to it before he muttered out, \"So this how you thank me for bringing you to my home and trying to keep you safe? Well I'll make you regret this decision Marco.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then felt the pressure start to build up as you thought you felt some of his claws dig into your skin which caused you to let out a yell of pain. Upon doing htis though you felt Cassius let go of your hand and then take a hold of Amicus's hand that was on your shoulder while he yelled, \"Let him go, Amicus! You are clearly hurting the human!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis prompted you to look up at the muscle gutted wolf hoping that maybe if he saw how hurt you were he'd let go of you. Instead however, you saw nothing but hurt and rage in his own eyes which only caused you to shiver in actual fear as you weren't sure what you did was the smartest idea anymore. However, while Cassius continued to pull on Amicus's hand he yelled out again, \"Amicus, I told you to let go of him!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA this moment you found yourself closing your eyes as a bright light flashed from the pedant that was around Cassius's neck. Along with this you heard both Cassius and Amicus let out their own yelps of surprise. Though for the white wolf he let out various yelps here and there, obviously in pain of some kind since you could heard his bones creaking for some reason. But after you opened your eyes you saw Cassius looking down at you with concern over your injury and Amicus looked completely taken aback by what he saw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd once your eyes had adjusted you saw that Cassius had changed because not only did he seem taller, but he seemed more muscular as well. In fact his tail seemed to be healed as well as it swayed from left to right clearly showing that perhaps his bone illness was gone considering how he looked now. In fact once he had turned away from you and stood in front of you, you quickly realized that not only had Cassius grown in both hieght and muscle, but he actually looked to be.....</span></div></div>",

And when you moved your eyes lower down his body you saw his long white furred tail wave behind him above his now two large and firm looking buttcheeks. Thigh owever, caused you to blush and quickly look way from the new Cassius as you thought you saw him looking at you from over one his large shoulders and had a smile on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough this didn't last as it turned into a frown and he looked away from you. After that was done you heard Amicus let out a grwol of frustration when he demanded, \"What the heck just happened?! How in the world did you become as big as I am?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I honestly have no idea what exactly happened Amicus. But now that I'm this size I won't let you lay a hand on Marco. You need to accept the fact that I wanted him as my pet.\" Cassius replied, while he crossed his massive arms in front of his massive pecs. He then added, \"In fact you could have stayed friends with him and could kept on visiting him when he wasn't busy doing various things for me. But after what you did you won't be able to come near him at all once I become Emperor.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah?\" The black and grey furred wolf countered, with a raised eyebrow and a glare on his face. After doing this he then balled up one of his hands into a fist and punched Cassius right in the face. But when he didn't hear any bones breaking or his little brother yelling pain he took a step back while he went on with disbelief in his voice, \"W-What?! That punch should have crushed that part of your face. Why didin't it work?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon seeing this reaction from his brother prompted the white furred wolf ot smirk at his older brother as he commented, \"Hmm, it would seem that my bone illness is a non factor after this change.\" His teybrows then narrowed and he showed some of his fangs when he kept going, \"So now I'll ask you to leave. Otherwise I'll punch you back and maybe I'll add a kick as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"tch, fine. But you own't beat me in becoming Emperor. Even with this change Cassius.\" Amicus remarked, to which H ethen turned away and made sure his cape was flowing behind him. But while he was walking he added in a loud voice, \"Oh, and you'd best get some new clothes since as of right now you're walking around naked. That's pretty inappropriate for a posilbe Emperor to be doing don't you think?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing this remark prompted the white furred wolf to turn his head away and blush as he said under his breathe, \"Hmph, still going to make a comment a pup would, huh?\" You then found yourself look up at him when you heard heavy footsteps  in your direction. You then turned and saw him looking down at you with concern on his face before he asked you, \"Are you alright, Marco?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-Yeah, I think so.\" You replied, while you looked over at the white wolf's rock hared abs, and massive pecs, Though when you found yourself looking down at his now large white balls and black cock you quickly looked away from him and at your right shoulder. You then went on, \"Though I think my arm is bleeding a little bit from Amicus's claws....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"hmm, yes it would seem so. We'd best get you a doctor to ahve treated befor eit gets affected.\" Cassius stated, before you found yourself being lifted into the white wolf's massive arms making you gasp in surprise. After doing this you then found yourself looking up at the white wolf's face as he let out a light chuckle and added, \"Such an odd sound for being caught off guard. I won't lie, it is quite....cute.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Erm um thanks Cassius...\" You muttered out, before you found yourslef being held up against the wolf's massive furry body while he walked to his room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce he had done this he then set you gently down onto his bed and told Com to have a doctor come to his room along with another bot to make him some new clothing for his new size. Though he made sure to have his new clothes look his old clothes, just in a much bigger size. At least for the time being until he became Emperor. And once your shoulder had been patched up and he was wearing his new clothes which he made sure to put on in the bathroom while the doctor worked on you so that he wouldn't see his new size the white wolf then decided that he wanted to take you......</span></div></div>",

Mostly due to the fact that besides Amicus, the anthro cat was the only one who you felt you could fully trust. Even if he had told Neferu that you were smarter then you had been pretending to be. And since that was the only misstep the cat had done you figured this could be a good way to make things up to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so you decided to wait in Amicus's room until he had returned to the palace. Thankfully this only took about an hour or so as Com informed you, \"Marco, Alex has returned to the palace ahead of schedule. He is currently in the hallyway.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon hearing this information you left Amicus's room and walked down a few of the hallways until you saw Alex at the end of the hallway. This prompted you to wave an arm at him in both greeting and to get his attention as you also called out, Hey Alex, do you have a minute?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight after you had uttered out these words though you saw Alex's ears and fur shoot up along with a worried expresssion on his face as he ran up to you and covered your mouth with one of his hands while he asked, \"Marco, what are you doing? Do you want either Cassius or Cato to find out that you're smarter then what you've been letting on?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, yeah I guess not. Sorry about that Alex, I guess I just got excited because I wanted to give you a gift is all.\" You confessed, after the cat had removed his hand from your face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh a gift you say. Well as much as I'd love to accept it. Let's go into another room first.\" The dark and light dreen furred cat suggested, before you found yourself being led down another hallway and into the dining room of the palace. Once you had both entered the room you saw Alex turn to face you with a smile on his face when he added, \"Now then, what is this gift that you wanted to give me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis question prompted you to take out and reveal the odd colored pedant to the cat as you told him, \"Well I found this pedant earlier today and I figured I'd give to you as a gift of friendship.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo your surprise though you saw a hesitate expression on the cat's face as he asked, \"Oh really? Even after I accidently told Neferu something that I should have kept between us?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I still want to give this even after that happened. Besides Neferu hasn't done anything that information. However, if I give this to you then you have to promise me that you'll keep it for yourself and won't give it away to anyone, okay?\" You replied back, before you offered the pedant to the anthro cat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough within seconds you saw the anthro's furry ahnd came over and take the pedant from your hand and then put over his neck so that the pedant itself was on top of his pecs. You then saw him give you a big smile when he said, \"I promise that won't give this to anyone else. Or take it off since this is the nicest gift anyone hasn't given me. Thank you very much Marco.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're welcome Alex.\" You responded back with, as you returned the smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alex, Marco, both Amicus and Cassius have returned to the palace.\" Com stated, which prompted you both to open your eyes and look upward for second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, it looks like our little chat will have to end here for today. But let's chat again soon.\" Alex told you, beofre you saw him walk out of the dinner room to which you then followed and you both went your separate ways.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe following day however made you quite surprised when Alex......</span></div></div>",

However, there was an obvious missing person that being Alex who was sitting down next to the white wolf's bed like his usual was. This prompted you to look at the spot quite confused as you thought to yourself, \"<i>Huh, I wonder Alex is? I figured he'd be here like he is always to serve breakfast like I'm going to have to....again.</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough as if knowing what you were thinking you heard Amicu's s voice when he asked his brother, \"So Cassius, where is Alex?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon hearing this question you saw one of the white wolf's ears twitch as he waved a furry hand dismissively when he answered back, \"Apparently he wasn't feeling well this morning. Though if you ask me he didn't sound that sick, but I suppose illnesses affect all of us differently.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes I suppose that is true.\" The black and grey furred wolf replied, before he sat down on his bed as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter he did this you found yourself letting out a heavy sigh as you knew you'd have to serve both Amicus and Cassius this morning. And so you decided to get to work on putting food on their plates and filling their goblets with wine when they wanted a refill. Thankfully though when Amcius saw that you trying to rush through this you told you to sit down and that he'd take care of his own food. This made it a little easier since then all you had to do was serve Cassius here and there. But once all three wolves had left you let out a heavy sigh of relief as you sat on Amicus's bed alone while you had gotten your plates set with food along with Alex's in case he happened to show up for breakfast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd as if on cue you heard Com's voice when he asked, \"Marco, Alex is outside the door, but would like to know if anyone else is in there with you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Erm no com, tell him that I'm alone.\" You replied, now feeling confsued by the question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter giving your reply Com then went silent on your end obviously telling Alex your answer. Then within a few seconds you heard one of the doors being opened and then quickly closed. Once this occurred you found yourself turning around and upon doing so you found yourself becoming confused when you saw a figured covered up by a heavy blanket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing this prompted you to get off of the bed and walk towards the anthro cat as you asked, \"Alex, are you sure you should be right now? Aren't you sick?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I'm not sick Marco. I'm afraid that I had to lie to Cassius just so he didn't get suspicious.\" The covered cat explained, as you noticed that he seemed to be looking down at you from inside his blanket made cloak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Erm okay. Well I'm glad you aren't sick But if you aren't sick then what's wrong?\" You wondered, while the two of you walked over to Amicus's bed and sat down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut once you had sat down you figured that the dark and light green furred cat would go sit down on Cassius's bed. Instead however you heard the bed groan in slight protest as he got onto it and sat down next to you. You then saw him look at you when he asked, \"Marco, if I show you something can you promise to keep this between us?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course I will Alex. Besides that friends do on my planet.\" You reassured the cat, while you attempted a reassuring smile to boot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo your surprise you heard the cat let out a light chuckle before he replied, \"How interesting. But I'm glad to hear it because erm well you see..... After you gave me that pedant last night I've gone through some changes....so to say.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Erm what do you mean by that?\" You asked, while you tilted your head to right a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter these words had left your lips you saw Alex get off of hte bed and then start to remove the blanket that was covering him.

However, you did notice that the pedant was still on the cat and was now between his two massive pecs as it had a light glow, however that quickly went away after a few seconds. This prompted you to look up at Alex's face as you noticed that he a concerned look on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were then brought out of your daze like state when he asked, \"Marco, are you alright?

You're most likely the same size as Neferu is.\" You pointed out, as you did your best to remain calm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo this you saw the cat rub the back of his head with one of his hands before he replied, \"Yes, you might be right. Though it was quite the surprise for me as well. Though if I\"m being honest I don't think I really mind these changes all that much.\" You then felt him get onto the bed again until his face was up close to yours.

However, nothing came out of your mouth word wise as this side of Alex you had no idea even existed. Could he be acting more daring due to this change?

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>While looking at the pedant in your hand you figured that the only fair thing to do was to split the pdenat into four smaller pedants. That way no one would feel left out and this way maybe no one would think you were paying certain attention to anyone in particular. And so you walked back to Amicus's room and got to work as you were able to find some extra string and you carefully pressed against the small panels that were sticking out on the pedant which then turn the large crystal into four smaller crystals. In fact you were so focused on your work that you hadn't heard Com tell you that everyone was returning to the palace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlong with this you hadn't even noticed Amicus's bedroom slide oepn and the large wolf walking up behind you and then wrapping you up in his large arms as he greeted you with, \"I'm finally back, Marco.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, hi Amicus. I hadn't realized that you had gotten back. I guess I got too focused on what was I doing to notice.\" You confessed, as you let out a light laugh more so aimed at yourself then anything else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I could see that. So what are you doing with those small pedants?\" The black and gray furred wolf asked, as he looked down at them from behind your right shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I found this large pedant in an empty room and I decided to split the pedant into four smaller ones and give one to you, Neferu, Alex, and even Cassius.\" You explained, to which you felt Amicus let you go and let out a light scoff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter doing this he then protested, \"I can understanding giving one to me of course. And even giving one to Alex. But why Neferu, or even my brother?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because this could help make an alliance between the wolves and jackals come about more easily. And for Cassius, I figured it'd be a good way for you two make up in a way, you know?\" You explained, before you took all four pedants and handed them to the muscle gutted wolf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce you do this you saw him give you a confused expression for a few seconds before a large smile spread on his face and he commented, \"Oh! That's actually a very smart idea Marco. I'll go give these to them now. But I'll make sure to say that you made these for them. Which might be a bit hard to sell for Cassius since he thinks you're dumber then what you actually. But I'm sure I'll think of something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then watched as the black and grey furred anthro wolf walked out of his room after putting his pedant around his neck. Seeing this though only brought a smile to you face as you hoped this could make things a bit more relaxed and not so tensed between everyone. I mean sure Amicus and Cassius were competing to become the next Emperor, but that didn't mean that they needed to hate each other because of that. And so feeling like you accomplished something you went over to the couch and decided to rest for a bit until Amicus pushed the dinner cart into the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day however, you noticed that not only wee all fouir male anthros wearing the pedants that you had made them, which they thanked you for. But you also noticed that they seemed to be......</span></div></div>",

In face his muscles seemed a bit bigger too. And his stomach a bit more defined too. In fact when you both walked down to the dinning room to have breakfast (well Amicus would have breakfast while you served him yet again) you even noticed that same thing had happened to Neferu, who had waved over at you and gave you a quick thank you while you nodded in understanding, not wanting to make Amicus get impatient.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd when you both entered the dining room you noticed that Cassius also seemed a bit taller. IN fact he looked like he had gianed a bit muscle as well. This was even the case for Alex as well which caused you to have even more questions runing through your head. Was this due to that pedant that you had slipt into four yesterday? Were these changes permit? Could all four of them grow again?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSadly you did not kow the answers to any of these questions while you served Amicus breakfast and ate your own breakfast with Alex. In fact you were so lost in your own thoughts that you weren't even sure what Amicus had told you this morning before you had entered the dining room since Neferu had caught your attention. And this only made you feel a bit worse as you weren't exactly sure what Alex had said to you along with thanking you like Neferu had done earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough you were soon brought out of your thoughts when you heard one of the four anthro voices as they called out to you, \"Marco?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis prompted you to let out a, \"Huh? Oh, y-yes...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then looked up and saw that the anthro who was trying to get your attention was......</span></div></div>",

This time though as the title says it will be focusing on growth. Though there are some rules we must go over before Marco (aka you) has to deal with a growing anthro.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. Please keep the point of view in second person.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. There are different sets heights that you can make the characters grow up to. 10 feet is the smallest and 500 feet is the biggest. However, if you have the characters grow past up to or past 20 feet then they must leave the capital and go to one of the islands since well I feel it's the logical thing to do in that situation. Also the growth is both height and muscle based, though that might be stating the obvious, lol.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. Speaking of growth please make sure that the growth is at a slow or medium pace sine I'd like to have it be drawn out each of the storylines that can be picked from.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n4. Only M/M interactions of course.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n5. No death, toilet humor, or destruction. Though if say a chair or clothes rip because of the growth then that's okay, but make sure none of the characters don't go around destroying buildings and what not since that'd be way out of character.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n6. Please keep everyone in character at all times. Though character development due to the growth is fine along with said character and Marco ending up together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n7. Please try to use good grammar when typing out chapters. If there are a few spelling errors then I will try to find and fix them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n8. Have fun and enjoy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh, also just as a reminder to you guys, Cassius's bone illness is always cured thanks to the pedant on any of this story paths and the four pedant story paths too. But of course by all means feel free to let that be known in each of those story paths in different ways. Be as creative as you want when it comes to that.</td>",
