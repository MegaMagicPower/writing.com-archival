The staff, by necessity, have been organized into a strict hierarchy; with management at the top; technicians, writers, and actors a rung lower on the ladder; and sanitation, maintenance, and grunt workers at the bottom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nActors are the most sought-after positions; for both the prestige of such a position and the benefits afterward. Contracts are set for five years at the minimum, and anyone who makes it through that crucible can get any Wondertainment-owned role they desire. The selection and training process is rigorous too, a strict regimen of lessons to teach them how to stay in-character no matter their form or situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMany a proud graduate of that program have been bitterly disappointed by the nature of their assignment. Gender, age, height: all these and more are no barrier to the Wondrous\u2122 auto-surgeons of Meconstruction!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWriters are assigned to create exciting new Plotlines for their awaiting guests. There are a few that create Wonderful\u2122 experiences every time they put pen to paper, but a fair amount of the writer\u2019s room is burnt out, and just rehash usual tropes for their none-the-wiser guests. A few luminaries are employed as coaches for the actors, watching plots unfold through contact-lens cameras whilst whispering plot twists and story directions into the actor\u2019s cleverly hidden earpieces. Whether the actors listen or not is a bit of a toss-up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTechnicians are stretched to their creative limit as well by Wondertainment\u2019s nigh-unmeetable quota: designing new animatronics for creatures and roles unoccupiable by humans; new gadgets and special effects to enhance the realism of each environment; and pushing the envelope of Meconstruction\u2019s technology.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(There are rumblings of discontent among the actors about artificially intelligent robots created to take their starring roles in the park, but those are mostly dismissed with much rolling of the eyes and scoffs of \u2018Science fiction!\u2019)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWonder-World\u2019s mantra is \u2018customer-obsession\u2019, after all. Who needs to follow labor laws when you have mountains of cash?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat being said, who are you?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Here are a few of the many roles you may find yourself playing in the sleek metropolis of Wonder-City:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Captain Capable</b>; the archetypical \u2018flying brick\u2019 with a cornucopia of other Plotline-convenient superpowers and one of the founding members of the \u2018Utopian Alliance\u2019, he\u2019s a bit of a boyscout: humble in his accomplishments but steadfast in the face of the evil. His civilian identity is Chet Tompkins, a mild-mannered insurance salesman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe actors that are chosen to play him usually aren\u2019t nearly as humble or kind, however. It\u2019s one of the most sought-after positions for many a reason: the well-muscled athletic physique, the uncountable female Guests hanging off their arms, and the center-stage focus in many a storyline.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, all this means that the actors for the Captain are easily shunted off to other roles, what with all the eager mummers in queue behind them\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Mighty Maid</b>; She\u2019s also a founding member of the Utopian Alliance, though you\u2019d never guess it. In her civilian identity, she goes by the name Margot Marseille, a young thing who has earned the dubious honor of the cities\u2019 top maid with inconspicuous use of her \u2018super-cleaning\u2019 powers. With an auburn bob topped by a ruffled headband, a ridiculous French accent, a nigh-physically-impossible hourglass-figure, and a penchant for getting caught in the most basic of traps, her detractors claim that she sets feminism and the reputation of a certain Western European country back fifty years.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWonder-Land, of course, dismissed these opinions outright. Hundreds of trust-fund teens and lecherous old men paid out the nose for a chance to ogle the \u2018Servant of the People,\u2019 with the Writers and Technicians eagerly obliging: the former managing to get a checkbox for \u2018Mighty Maid romance,\u2019 on the Wonder-City guest application, and the latter designing intentional flaws into her corset for more wardrobe malfunctions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn fact, Mighty Maid was the focal point of one of the company\u2019s few legal losses : the sight of a sniffling young thing tearfully telling tales about mincing around for the hungry eyes of the elite was a bit too much for the public and courts to stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe financial loss was relatively minor, in the scope of all things, but Wondertainment vowed to never let it happen again. So now, if you carefully watch the graduation ceremony of the Actor Training Program, you can see one or two young men goggling at the contents of their enveloped assignment. If you choose to follow them to the auto-surgeon, you can watch them wobble out of their appointment looking markedly different; a good amount of their former mass flushed down the medical waste chute, save for a specially preserved piece. Even if they talk after their contracts are up, who would believe them?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly the actor, direct coworkers, and management are privy to this secret, the former two threatened with immediate severance without pay nor form reinstitution if they disclose the secret to any guest or refuse to play their part. Despite this, you can find quite the number of red-tressed doppelgangers in nearby cities. To this date, no one outside of Wondertainment has quite connected the dots.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Black Sable</b>; real name: Carmilla Yahontov, a rich heiress who moonlights as a super-villain, pilfering the contents of vaults with usage of her super-intangibility (Which is realized in the park by cleverly hidden secret passages.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough many female actor aspirants try to snag the role of the Sterling Scoundrel with the hope of being the full-fledged badass she is on the silver screen, most are disappointed by the steady stream of moneyed masochists who come to be degraded by the near-amazon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome are fine with it, of course.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho shall you be playing the part of, then?</span></div></div>",

The Town Hall of Wonder City, normally the site of dazzling, effects-laden battles between the forces of good-actors and evil-actors, has today been fitted out with several hundred cheap plastic chairs to accommodate the forty gowned graduates of the Wondertainment Actor Training Program and their friends and families.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd there you are, front-row seat. Being here, in the vaulted halls right at the heart of the WonderWorld complex, you can't help but feel excited and trepidation in equal measure. How many thousands of actors have given their utmost to amaze the audience, to bring a touch of magic into a mundane world. How many millions of excited visitors, men and children alike, have passed through here and watched in wonder, believing for just a moment that dreams really can come true? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe weight of that obligation presses down from you, made all the more real by the stern, granite visage of Doctor Wonder staring down from the stone statue of '<i>Mayor Wonder, Established Wonder City in 1837</i>' at the front of the hall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNervously you fiddle with the hem of the rental graduation robe. Your fiance notices and slides her hand within yours, interlacing her fingers to stop you fidgeting, and gives you kiss on the cheek. \"You're going to do great. We're all excited to see who you're going to be,\" she says warmly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Speak for yourself, I'm just here for the base package,\" your dad jokes, slapping you on the back so hard that it dislodges your mortarboard hat. \"Three days in WonderWorld almost makes up for the three years of tuition we paid.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I promised I'll pay that back.\" By which you mean, 5 years on your contract and Wondertainment will void the debt. Nobody pays off loans of that magnitude on an actor's salary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUp on the podium, Mayor Hamilton Hayworth Hill III - or at least the actor now known as such - glances at his watch in impatience. The Town Hall is set aside for this occasion for one hour every year, and one hour only. In 27 minutes 14 seconds, the villain known as Firefly is due to burst through the front doors and the pyrotechnics under the floor will go off, with or without a roomful of graduates sat on top of them. Where the <i>hell</i> is Captain Capable?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry for the delay, ladies and gentlemen! Had to stop a bank robbery on the way here, you know how it is!\" comes the valiant call across the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lighting technician is at least partially on the ball. The lights dim. A spotlight swinging up to one the empty balconies of the auditorium, drawing the audience's gaze. The spotlight quickly shifts a different balcony where stands Captain Capable, his bleached white smile shining brilliantly. Striking a noble pose, he rises into the air and floats over the crowd.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"More like Captain Cable, I can see the wires,\" Maria whispers in your ear. You hush her, not wanting to ruin the magic for the rest. The audience watches transfixed as the Captain makes his landing beside the podium and extends his red-white-and-blue gloved hand to shake the hands of the scowling mayor. There is a brief pause as a stage hand dressed as the sidekick Boy Competent rushes on stage to release the harness on the Captain's back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're gonna make such a better Captain than that guy,\" says Maria, looking at you with admiration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In my dreams am I going to get that lucky,\" you reply, showing her your crossed fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ladies and Gentlemen gathered here today...\" begins the Captain, glancing at the clock. \"... let's begin.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne by one, the graduates' names are read out. They go up on stage to shake the Captain's hand, receive their diploma, an envelope containing the details of the role they will be playing, and most importantly, a few private words of wisdom from the Big C himself. Then it's your turn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWow, your hands are sweaty. Thank god the Captain is wearing gloves. With every eye and a swelteringly hot floodlight on you, it feels to take an age just walking to the stage. Somehow it is challenge just to move one foot after the other without tripping over the steps or themselves. How have three years of stage school not prepared you better for this moment? Your heart feels like it is beating out of your chest...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n... and then it stops as a cry of \"we love you, Charlie!\" comes from your fiance. The crowd titters at the sudden outburst, and the Captain himself puts his head back and gives a theatrical guffaw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe leather of the Captain's glove is worn smooth from hundreds of hands as it shakes yours. He hands you your diploma and the envelope, though his head is turned away, fixated on somebody in the front row. \"Quite a mouth your girlfriend's get on her,\" the Captain  mutters below the threshold of the microphone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, yeah, she's got a pair of lungs on her alright\", you laugh in embarrassment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Captain leans in, your heart leaping in anticipation of his words of encouragement. \"Oh, she's certainly got a sweet pair of <i>something</i>,\" he sneers, slapping your shoulder and guiding you with a shove towards the far side of the stage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe far side of the stage is dark and quiet, the sounds of the auditorium soon swallowed up by the thick red velvet curtains. A set of stairs leads down and down. As you descend, the gilded, baroque architecture of the Town Hall very quickly becomes grey concrete and stark fluorescent lighting. Yet this mundane, industrial area thrills you. This is <i>the actual</i> WonderWorld utility network! The Wonder Kingdom is fabled to have the largest utilidor system in the world, a network of tunnels running under the park to allow its actors to get from place to place out of sight of the visitors. This is where the magic is made!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take a deep lungful, savouring the moment. Oddly, it doesn't smell much like magic. It smells like rust and sweat. And there is the strange, strong scent of hot fat and burnt hair which only grows stronger as you progress further down the corridor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere is nobody here to greet you, and it is eerily deserted even of actors. There is just a misspelled sign - '<i>gradautes this way</i>' - pointing down half a mile of industrial corridor before there is another sign - '<i>garduates check number</i>'. Beyond, the corridor is lined on both sides with numbered doorways.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe stench of cooking flesh and burnt hair is overpowering here, and there is an odd, muffled noise just at the edge of hearing, a repetitive thud echoing through the concrete like somebody hammering against a wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the moment of confusion, you look to the envelope for guidance. Printed on the front in glitter is the number '7'. You step through door 7, tearing open the envelope as you go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe room beyond is little larger than a closet with a bare bulb illuminating side walls of steel, a floor-to-ceiling mirror in front of you, and a concrete floor crisscrossed with drainage channels and a wide drain. The door seals shut behind with a heavy, pneumatic clunk.</span></div></div>",

No. Your name is right there at the top of the letter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMighty Maid is a joke of a character, a sexist relic of a time in the 1970s when comic books were written by misogynists and illustrated to pander to the 13-18 male demographic, after they discovered that a big breasted French maid on the front page tripled sales. Her creator, William Byrne, had been infamous for his love of bondage, and so her stories usually involved her being tied up after (once again) naively accepting the job of cleaning the evil villain's volcano lair, and typically ended with her being rescued by Captain Capable and spanked over his knee on the steps of the town hall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was frankly baffling to you that company as progressive as Wondertainment had deigned her appropriate for a role in their Wonder Cinematic Universe, let alone their theme park. Fortunately they had chosen to improve the poor actress' working conditions after that disgruntled employee had come forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello?\" you say again to the cubicle. \"I think there's been a mistake.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo your surprise, with a tiny electronic click, the mirror in front of you suddenly becomes a window. A window on to a broad, darkened room illuminated by the thousands of glowing switches on banks of computer terminals, and the light that streams from your cubicle and the cubicles either side of you. Though you cannot see into the cubicles next to you, you can see the light from them playing over the faces of the men in white coats seated at the computers - some of the light is blue and ripples, as if shining though a spray of chemicals pouring down the window; another distinctly shows the shadows of arms thrashing before the bulb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man at the console situated in front of your cubicle leans towards a microphone at his desk. \"No mistake.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*click* The window becomes a mirror once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What! I'm not Mighty Maid!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*click* The mirror becomes a window. \"Not yet.\" *click*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA cold sense of dread is starting to form in the pit of your stomach.

In a moment, you look as if you've fallen into a port-a-potty as the acrid stuff drips down your torso, soaks through your clothes, until you're sodden to the skin. You splutter in protest. The man cranks the dial further and the mist becomes like a heavy rain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere is something thicker dripping down the back of your neck. You reach your hands up to your head and pull them away covered in black goop. The mortarboard hat was... melting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, that was a <i>rental</i>!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe letter, envelope, and diploma in your hands are becoming mush, the thick parchment like a rice paper that tears apart and dribbles through your fingers. You can feel the deep groves of the drainage channels beneath your feet, as the thick rubber soals of your shoes begins to melt and wash away. The heavy graduation gown slings to you, chunks of it bubbling and sloughing away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe treacle-like melted plastic and fabric of the mortarboard dribbles still down your scalp. You try to pull more of it out of your hair. Your fingers comes away matted in a handful of your auburn curls.</span></div></div>",

Hold there.\" The second technician is beckoned over again. The two men consult for a minute, each stepping up to the mirrored glass in turn, pressing their noses almost to the glass and inspecting you closely. You scowl back at them, though their attention is more focused on your ass than your face, and they pay you no mind. Your tormentor is unshaven, dark rims under his eyes and coffee stains about the lapel of his labcoat. He looks like a man at the tail end of an 18 hour shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe returns to the console, twisting a second dial. The gentle spray of chemicals above narrows into a tight, high-powered jet, blasting with impeccable aim down the crevice of your spread buttcheeks. Like one of Doctor Wonder's cartoons, you almost hit the roof. You might have grabbed the nozzle if you hadn't been distracted by the sharp sting in your backside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou land a gasping, shaking, dripping mess, hurling insults at the mirror that are quickly muted. The two technicians reexamine you with an impassive eye, like bored kids staring at a particularly dull slug behind glass at WonderZoo. A switch is flicked on the console. They fumble in their pockets for loose change and move out of sight of the narrow field of view provided by the booth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blue has stopped. A fine mist of cold, clear water starts to fall from the ceiling, washing away the defoliant and any last trace of hair or blemish. In the mirror, your hairless male body looks odd, inhuman - like a child's doll with the hair piece and clothes removed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man returns with a plastic cup of steaming liquid, setting it down among the dozens of empty cups littering the console. He reclines in the seat and cracks his fingers in front of him, piano-maestro-style. Then with a flourish that seems to drip sarcasm and boredom, he presses a single button.</span></div></div>",

He\u2019d snagged a quick 20-min nap in the break room that only served to whet his insomnia, but now it was back to the grindstone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQA for Mighty Maid was a <i>nightmare</i>. Checking the process for the big CC was piss-easy; just make sure you had the right blend of steroids and check on the muscle grafts, then you could knock out a couple of sudokus at the console. Silver Sable was even smoother; knock them out a bit while the autodoc snips away at various tendons and bumps them up a cup size or two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Maid-to-be\u2019s had been and always would be the worst to deal with, always whining and whinging and squirming. Zach\u2019s reservoir of empathy was bone-dry by this point; you would think that they\u2019d\u2019ve caught on with WonderCollege\u2019s adage of \u2018Preparing you for <i>any</i> role.\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe took a sip of his stale coffee and flicked the lightswitch on the console. The pink-shrouded cubicle, however, did not light up. The damn bulbs in the ChemoPods seemed to always be on the fritz. Zach stared at the stucco tiles of the ceiling with a baleful gaze as the filament took its sweet time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, lightbulb or not, it was a sight better than when the bot did the whole thing with a scalpel. You\u2019d come back from lunch break and see a flayed skeleton, or watch a surgical saw go to town on a couple of vertebrae. It was hard to watch the minxy maid totter about the park when you\u2019d seen the gristle-covered bags of fat that served as her derriere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe light finally guttered, on, lighting Zach\u2019s grimace with a pale rose sheen. Great. He\u2019d come at just the right time. The figure in front of him was a sight away from his form two hours ago. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust, er, not in the <i>best</i> way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSkin hung off of him like ugly drapes, some of it squashed against the edges of the MetaGel mold, other flaps left to dangle. His ribs lined his sides like crosswalk stripes; his abdomen was just a sunken incline from chest to groin; his limbs practically twigs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZach pulled up a clipboard and checked off \u2018Metabolic Rate Expedited,\u2019 with a frown. This was always the worst part of the process, looking at an emaciated mannequin with a critical eye. Thankfully, everything seemed to be going well. He had heard tales of processes that went completely unsupervised: poor bastards came out the other end looking like a melted Kewpie doll.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust a little snip-snip \u2018down there\u2019 and an hour or two of neutering his endocrine system, and all the hormones being pumped into the poor sap should work in concert with the Nutri-Gel to fill all that loose skin with soft curves, with maybe a nip-and-tuck here and a little volumizing there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Then he\u2019s the writers\u2019 problem,</i> Zach sleepily smirked to himself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust four or six hours to go\u2026 </span></div></div>",

There was much you could hide within those voluminous skirts of those ballgowns. The actors could be allowed to keep in it in their pants on the proviso that the paying public never witnessed what was hidden beneath their legs, and it worked as an excellent incentive for keeping their compliance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot so with Mighty Maid. That three-inch hemline, those delicate white panties, neither offered anything to the imagination. Combined with a wolfish audience (that was one way of putting it), there was nowhere to hide even the smallest scrap of manhood from the prying camera lenses and fingertips of her fans, not even one of the vestigial, drug-shrunk organs the princesses ended up with. It would have to go. All of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo time like the present. Right now there was a war waging inside the Maid-to-be's body between his true body chemistry and that which the corporation was wishing to install with their synthetic hormones and metabolic moderators. A few snips would quickly decide the victor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo joysticks were placed in front of the console. During the slow hours, they were used for playing Rocket League. Zach activated them, placing his fingers about their buttons. At the same time, panels opened within the cubicle and a pair of segmented, metal, tentacle-like manipulators emerged into the solidified goop. Their end of one was tipped with a steel claw much like those found in the arcade machines just 30 feet above, where children paid a quarter for a chance to manipulate the claw into grabbing a stuffed toy and depositing it into a chute. The other manipulator was tipped with a scalpel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZach fancied he was getting very good at this game, as indeed it had become to him, and unlike the machines played by the visitors, this one wasn't rigged. He left the scalpel manipulator where it was for now, not wishing to accidentally nick an artery, and maneuvered the other around the leg of the mannequin-like figure. The manipulator moved through the gel like an eel through water, coiling around one thigh. The figure twitched, the vitals and accelerated heart rate spiking even higher, as the cold steel of the manipulator teased aside the folds of excess skin that draped from the stomach to find its prize.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe organ was already a sad, shrunken thing. The drugs were not being kind to the actor's masculine pride. The three steel claws opened and inched forward, two of the claws snagging under the man's testicles, the other clamping down from above. Zach squeezed the button to tighten the nose, noticing his patient squirm in the millimetres available to them as the claws dug in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he drew the manipulator back, the organ popped free. The gel was making it slippery, and there was barely anything to get purchase on. Deftly he adjusted the pharmaceutical composition of the next food bolus - sildenafil, quebrachine, a few others. He watched and waited patients while the nutrient-drug mix was pumped down the man's throat. It was only a minute before the man's loins began to swell - nothing to write home about, but enough to hold on to. The last erection the gentleman would have for five years, or longer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe claw gripped again. Again it slipped. With a huff of impatience, Zach jammed his thumb down on the button, the arcade machine claws closing like a steel trap about his genitals, digging deep into the soft flesh. The manipulator pulled and pulled, stretching it out away from the body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRemarkable how much the patient could thrash even when their muscles were reduced to sinew, Zach thought, as the scalpel manipulator began to carefully slice away at the flesh where the penis met the torso. He sometimes wondered how conscious they really were during the procedure. This was not one of these days. His mind was primarily on what he was going to be having for dinner, as the man's manhood was neatly cut away. It came free from the claw, floating inert in the gel while the two manipulators went to work tidying up the messy gash between the legs, tying off the tubes and arteries and cutting away some excess flesh to make room for the new organs that would be stitched into place. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce that was done, the genitals were snagged once more and deposited within a hatch. They would be...</span></div></div>",

Making a  new phallus was surprisingly difficult: all those tubes and flaps and bambosh were <i>hell</i> on the autodoc. Meconstruction's suggestion to save the things was a catalyst for inspiration, really; rebellious actors would be taken to the writer\u2019s office with a conspicuous organ \u2014 gussied up with a bit of the excess material from their en-maidening, otherwise the desiccated lil\u2019 thing\u2019d just look like a vaguely cylindrical cyst \u2014 placed off to the side in a conspicuous tank.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a tad ironic; the Maids that clung to their manhood fervently often got the best reviews, after their \u2018motivational-meetings\u2019. Anyone who continued to protest, well\u2026 <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt all worked out in the end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey\u2019d cross that bridge when they came to it, though, and Zach, thankfully, was not a part of \u2018they\u2019. Instead, he idly flipped through a catalog of colors, trying to find the right groin-color to match MM\u2019s pale skin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wouldn\u2019t get much use out of it for the first couple months, but he\u2019d get more than a reprimandation if a bit of caramel-colour was revealed with a flip of her skirt. With a quick turn of a joystick, a small circle of gel was cleared right at the poor sap\u2019s navel. Zach looked at the catalog, then at the skin, then back again, and once more... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPretty Porcelain,\u201d he muttered to himself. It was standard for Mighty Maid bits, but sometimes the subject reacted oddly to the chemical agents. A few years back, one Mighty Maid came out virtually albinistic; the writers had thrown together some story about her coming from the Negaverse for a few days, and then quickly shunted him off to some alien love interest in WonderGalaxy, to avoid having a blistered City centerfold. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe input a quick sequence of numbers into the console\u2019s keyboard, checked the vitals once again, then languidly leaned back to play a game of Solitaire. After a few hands that he actually managed to lose, a short chirrup roused him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbove the pink biogenic gel were two of the segmented manipulators, one tipped with what looked like a frosting pipette, the other a claw. The claw holds something that, for all intents and purposes, looks like a small chalky softball, with a puffy pink slit in the centre.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite his sense of professional detachment and the overwhelming sense of boredom, Zach couldn\u2019t help but be a mote impressed by how quickly the vaginal graft was produced. Its NervStim function would have to be setup in a week or so, after MM got her sea legs, but that would be someone else\u2019s messy problem, thank <i>god</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZach plugged the twin joysticks into the requisite USB port with a trill of his lips. The alternate manipulators sprung to lifel, and after a quick jolt from side to side to check the controls, he got to work. The claw slowly rotated the piece of artificial flesh in a circle as the other one dotted the ball with bits of orangeish ointment, until the whole thing looked like an alien fungi. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZach had smelled the ointment before, when he had watched on a, eurgh, <i>manual</i> Meconstruction. It smelled like death and burning, and one of the moronic spectators who actually touched it came out with a melted fingertip. With it, though, the area around the vagina should be smooth, unbroken line of skin, vat-grown flesh indistinguishable from the real thing, <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, time for the shoving. With a quick flourish of rotation, Zach navigated the manipulator down below the sunken stomach, lifted the skin once again with the ointment applicator, checked to make sure the damn thing was frontways, and shoved it in with a push forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again, the limbs of the Actor shook in their tight mold, and once again Zach did not pay it much mind. He instead concentrated on moving the applicator to get the spacing of the biodegradable staples <i>juussst</i> right. It wouldn\u2019t matter much in a few days\u2019 time, but it\u2019d bother him for a few hours if he didn\u2019t get it right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n He whistled a short song as the subject twitched with every fastener-injection.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Up above, thousands of visitors would be sitting down at one of the many themed restaurants the resort had to offer. Culinary dishes from all over the world could be consumed (including one restaurant with tables laid out like the nations of the world), and even food from the imagined realms of the Wonderverse could be had. The Gelatina Dessert Factory was one of Zach's favourites.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Canthrope Carvery is a popular joint, serving meat of all kinds, so fresh it still bleeds. Out front, the restaurant is industrial-chic, tastefully exposed concrete and metal plumbing in keeping with a retro-future aesthetic. In the back, it is simply industrial; the place where the livestock is unloaded and held before being dispatched and butchered-to-order for maximum freshness, the restaurant's clientele blissfully unaware that their order of barbecue ribs has just signed the death warrant of an unfortunate heifer in the backroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe resort prides itself on its recycling initiative. Not for any virtuous reason (though they do market it as such) but because the good Doctor hates to waste anything that can be turned to profit. The off-cuts of the meat are not simply thrown away for landfill. They are repurposed. A tube smeared in encrusted yellow grime and labelled 'fat' receives offerings from the butchers, who treat it as a game to liven up their workdays, tossing globs of bloody flesh too fatty to be served up into the mouth of the tube. Where it goes, they don't know. They assume to the pigs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lumps of fat are sucked down the tube, joining other tubes from restaurants elsewhere in the park. They are collected in a vat. The fat is rinsed of gore, is sprayed down with chemicals, and then the vat is very gently, very carefully heated - not enough to kill the cells, but enough to soften the fibrous parts until it all liquefies, the flesh of hundreds of different animals flowing together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHuman adipose tissue is expensive, hard to come by, and tightly controlled, which means outside eyes prying into the resort's business. Animal fat is plentiful and even more effective for Meconstruction purposes due to fact that the human body struggles to utilise it, to burn it. A recipient could diet and exercise to the extreme, and the animal adipose would remain unchanged throughout it all even as the rest of the body grows thinner and ultimately starves. There have been people who've died of malnutrition while still sporting their generous Meconstruction endowments.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was an additional benefit to sourcing the fat locally. Wondertainment owned the farms where the animals came from, it owned the animals that were slaughtered, and it owned the restaurants where they were butchered. It had a very solid legal case for claiming ownership of the adipose tissue. Once inside an actor, the Wonder-brand fat might make up 5 to 15% of the body mass. Which could be argued to imply that the corporation now owned 15% of the actor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZach thumbed the buttons on the controls. The manipulators retracted, the pharmaceutical gel slowly oozing back in to fill the channels they left behind. The gel about the waist was gradually turning from pink to a deeper red, but there was much less blood than one might expect. The biogel was very effective at controlling blood flow, both through the constant pressure it exerted and the coagulants mixed in it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA dozen clear, needle-tipped manipulators circled around the figure, like the arms of an octopus about to seize its prey. They found their targets, plunging deep into the loose skin of the thighs, buttocks and breasts. They would first do the bulk of the work to inflate the emaciated man, then flesh out the finer details, smoothing out the curves and styling the fleshy parts with a thousand microinjections all over the body to form the precise anatomy fans had come to expect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoluses of sticky, off-yellow animal lard start to pulse down the clear tubes. The needles move under the skin, distributing it here it needs to go. Gradually, the skin is filling out and tightening. The chest is already a pair of developing mounds. Not yet enough for a training bra, but growing fast.</span></div></div>",

Having implants in the wrong place was eminently fixable, but it was better to excise any mishaps before they blossomed into unsightly lumps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe allowed a smile to grace his lips for a second; everything seemed to be in order. The future superheroine resembled a prisoner of war less and less with every second. Right now, the subject looked rather like a gangly undeveloped teen, though the undeveloped part was slowly but inexorably changing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was the \u2018gangly\u2019 part that was the problem. WonderCity, and WonderWorld as a whole, had strict stipulations for every character\u2019s image. Captain Capable: heroic. Princess Allaria: overwrought. Silver Sable: dominant. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMighty Maid, though, had firmer guidelines. She was the focus of many a story, true, but never actually the protagonist, always cooing in admiration at a Guest playing a hero, or trussed up and thrown over the shoulder of a villain. Once a month, the Writers might throw her a bone and let her thwart a bank or convenience store robbery, but those would always be gaffes; the criminals slipping on a Maid-mopped floor or sent into uncontrollable fits of sneezing after she accidentally whirled a cloud of dust into their face; that sort of thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErgo, she had to look the part of the damsel in distress. Her diet and exercise were carefully monitored to discourage excess muscle growth; her skin treated with scads of lotions, creams, and unctions to ensure it remained soft and silky; and even her civilian outfits assiduously selected to quash the slightest hint of authority.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe height was a feature that Meconstruction had struggled with for a bit, preferring to select shorter male graduates for, but that made it harder to produce the right hourglass figure; narrower hips, and all that. After a few botched surgeries, a technician had proposed working directly with the skeleton, and well, the rest was history.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZach typed in a short request on the console, and the nutrient tube happily obliged, pumping a few extra painkillers into the subject\u2019s stomach. He was could stomach the majority of the Meconstructive process, but he had accidentally left the cubicle-microphone on during this process once and, well\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe hadn\u2019t been able to eat breadsticks for a week.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith another tap on the console, the cubicle rotated, giving Zach a full view of the subject\u2019s back, taking especial notice of the slowly ballooning rear. He gave it a short, sharp nod; there was enough flesh in there to hold the SkelBatons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZach maneuvered the controls yet again, and seven small rectangular ports opened up in the cubicle, manipulators with small scalpels emerging from them. Thin, segmented metal rods rode passenger on the arms, clinging to their vehicles with small centipedesque claws. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe little SkeleBatons were impressive even for Meconstruction. Inside each segment was a small blade tipped with diamonds that could cut through the toughest ossein in a matter of seconds; a series of servos and telescoping parts that could retract to half their size; and a set of tiny metal mandibles able to exert several thousand newtons of force.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe manipulators dove through the gel at Zach\u2019s command, artfully weaving around the adipose injectors with a practiced flair. It was with small delicate movements that Zach directed the incisions, one at the atlas, the two shoulder blades, the top of the femur, and either side of the buttocks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother press of a button, and the SkeleBatons took off. The patient twitched as the little machines burrowed into his flesh like hungry maggots, visibly squirming underneath the loose skin before vanishing from sight. Zach checked his watch: it would take about\u2026 six minutes for the machines to latch on to their targets, enough time for a coffee break.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne cup of joe later, Zach returned to a virtually unblemished patient and several input fields on the vitals screen. The SkeleBatons were relatively low-maintenance compared to other parts of the Meconstructive kit; after receiving instructions, they\u2019d run silky smooth ninety-five times out of one hundred. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, those five times were enough that he still had to do his job for the next few hours. Had to make sure their new Maid\u2019s spine didn\u2019t pretzel, that kinda stuff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNumbers blipped on and off the screen with rapidity: the subject\u2019s current height, the minimum and maximum adjustments, hip size, armspan, leg length, so on and so forth. The Maid-to-be could be pared down 20 cm before risking the range of motion and stiffening the limbs; more than enough to satisfy the guidelines.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n15 cm should do it for the height: take most of it from the spine to keep a leggy silhouette whilst still rendering the overall size petite. The hips had to go through a much less dramatic change; the male skeleton that laid underneath just had to be widened the tiniest amount and either femur tilted ever-so-slightly inward.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nIronic, really; it was easier to create an hourglass figure on a regular man than a slender woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe incongruous nature of life considered, Zach typed in the desired measurements into the console and sat back. Inside the cubicle, the gel would hardly be able to muffle the whir of small motors, the buzz of blades, and the creaks, snaps, and groans of a skeleton being reshaped. Thankfully, the soundproofed walls <i>did</i> muffle all that to a tiny whine, which itself easily drowned by a well-time don of his headphones.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blades would saw a bit of each vertebrae and compress the spine downwards, little mandibles wrapping the cord in a tight embrace to monitor electrical signals and promote flexibility. Gymnasts would blush at MM\u2019s range of motion; the Actor could stick a leg behind their head or perform a perfect split with ease. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe biogel would keep constant pressure on the subject as the ribs were pressed inwards; the arms foreshortened; the legs slightly diminished. In three or so hours, no one would be able to tell that the cubicle had contained a figure of average male height.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter waiting those three or so hours, Zach duly watched the hip-widening process, rock music pumping into his ears. The pelvis would be cracked like a wishbone and forced apart by the rods, the bone healing into the perfect Mighty Maid mince. There <i>were</i> override options in the SkeleBatons, ways to force the right walk, hop, or skip if the actor didn\u2019t surrender to the natural motions of their new form, but those were reserved for the third disciplinary meeting onward. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nInforming someone that you have remote control over their skeleton doesn\u2019t exactly foster goodwill.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The broad nose. The angular jawline and cleft chin. The thick brow. The masculine features were made even uglier by the flinches and grimaces the patient gave with each treatment, which stretched the loose skin in ways that made it resemble an oversized, rubber halloween mask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were some graduates, even some male ones, that only needed a few gentle alterations to make them fit the blueprint, but those  were few and far between. This one needed resculpting right down to the bone. It would requires drills and bonesaws and chisels to whittle away to excess into a sculpted work of art.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZach loaded the headshot of the last Mighty Maid onto his monitor. Such a shame what had happened to her. He'd liked her, more than most - she'd been compliant. He found some solace knowing that she would continue to exist in some small part through his work here today. Wondertainment liked to ensure continuity in its live-action performers, and though the characters had definitely changed over the years to fit trends and fandom whims, they tried to make it a gradual process. By making one actor partially resemble the previous one, it helped cover up the seams of just how frequently one was swapped out for another. How rapid the turnover of staff was here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe computer was analysing the sadly departed Mighty Maid's profile, determining how much work needed to be done. Zach already knew the answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>[TOTAL OVERHAUL NECESSARY]</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nFaces were too complicated. Hundreds of minuscule muscles and tendons all pulling in different directions, all wound around each other like a bag of snakes. You could modify a few and be okay, the rest would compensate, but eventually it was simpler just to scrap the whole thing and start over again. It made sense - they'd be excising much of the bone that the existing tendons anchored to, reattaching the tendons would be just as complicated as getting new ones altogether.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Howdy and welcome to Canthorpe's Carvery! The finest fare this side of the Seven Systems! My name is RX-734. How can I serve you today?\" The thick silver face-paint emphasised the deep lines on the waiter's face as he smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria chewed her lip, her eyes glazing over as they surveyed the menu once again. \"I can't decide on the <i>Black Hole BBQ</i> or the <i>Hot Plasma Burger</i>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRichard scoffed at his soon-to-be daughter-in-law across the table. \"Nonsense, everything is All Inclusive for the next three days. She'll have both,\" he told the waiter. \"And I'll have the <i>Out-Of-This-World Steak</i> with the <i>Pulsar Fries</i>. And a bottle of wine. And two beers, thanks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That seems a bit wasteful,\" Maria fretted, watching the waiter go. \"I'm not even sure if I'll be able to eat anything, I can't stop wondering how he's getting on. He's been gone an awful long time. What do you think that means?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It probably means he's having a wonderful\u2122 time without us, so we should be having a wonderful\u2122 time too,\" he chuckled. \"Besides, my tuition fees are paying for this little holiday so I'm relying on you to get our money's worth!\" Noticing his son's fiance remained deep in worried thought, he softened his tone. \"I'm sure he's doing fine. Heck, you know how eager he is, they've probably gotten him in costume already. He could be here already and we wouldn't know it. Y'know I <i>thought </i>I recognized our silver-faced waiter today,\" he said with a wink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah right, he wouldn't be caught dead accepting a bit part like that,\" Maria laughed back. \"I'm just nervous for him. He put his heart and soul into this, I want him to get the character of his dreams.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, I'm sure they're getting him pumped up to play one of those silly costumed superheroes as we speak.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the time until their food arrived, Richard performed a comical impression of his son being inflated with a bicycle pump, puffing out his cheeks and pretending to float out of his seat, much to Maria's guilty delight. He felt relieved to see the girl relax. She was a nice lass. Sometimes he felt his son didn't realise how lucky he was to have found her and more importantly kept hold of her during the financially tough years of his study. She put up with a lot, he felt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Best deflate myself before I pop,\" Richard chuckled as he picked up the sharp steak knife accompanying his meal. Just as he liked it, the steak was blue - that is to say it was lightly seared on the outside, not literally blue, although the establishment did indeed serve \"Space Steaks\" soaked in blue food colouring. Yet after a few bites he felt himself spitting a wad of ruminated beef into his napkin. It was gristle and chewy tendon, not the tender sirloin advertised on the menu.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe summoned the waiter over, who took one look, apologised, and swept the plate away into the back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe waiter crossed the room to a pipe marked 'cartilage/ligaments' and scraped the food, chewed and all, down the chute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe machines had finished their grisly work of cutting a circle around the face that ran along the hairline, down behind the ears and under the jawline. A halo of darker red infiltrated the gel around the head. The loose flap of flesh at the top of the head was too small for the claws to grasp, so Zach selected the suction implement. The hose snaked towards the head, pressing its nozzle to the skin of the forehead and sucking until the skin was tightly lodged. Then it began to pull back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe face began to peel away from the skull from the top down. It was almost satisfying to watch, like somebody peeling the plastic off a new iPhone, especially with how expertly the snicker-snacking scalpel blades severed the hundreds of muscles from their bone anchorings so that it was all coming away in one, clean piece.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was becoming harder to tell as the expression of distress literally disappeared from the patient's face, but the body language of angry, impotently twitching limbs conveyed their displeasure well enough. The peeling took the eyelids with it, exposing to the gel the bare eyeballs in their sockets. They roved back and forth, but always came back to fix on Zach. If looks could kill...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe skin of the nose was drawn back. Zach guided a surgical hammer-tipped tendril into place. It obliterated the alar cartilage with a single sharp strike, shattering the shape of the nose into a slowly dispersing cone of shards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe began work to file down the thick bone of the brow into the scaffolding of something delicate and feminine, trying not to make eye contact as he did. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe face finally came away completely from the skull. It drifted for some minutes in front of the unclosable eyes of the patient, crumpled like an ugly rag, until a larger caliber suction tube came along to suck it away. Even still, the thick muscles of the jaw clogged the opening, and he had to spend a few minutes using the scalpels to cut the face into pieces for the tube to whip away one-by-one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was nearing the end of lunchtime. The new batch of xenograft muscle, tendon and cartilage grafts were arriving from the restaurants above. They would be woven like an intricate mask over the refined skull to form a new face, one capable of expressing only sweetness and smiles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe teeth were all extracted. They were in good condition, but the whiteness wasn't quite there and in truth unattainable by human standards. A full 32-piece acrylic set was drilled into the maxilla and mandible.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The grafting system was remarkable in its efficacy, though that could be said about many things in WonderWorld. Tendons, T-bones, and all other sorts of animal viscera would be sorted through carefully-yet-quickly by a machine eye, picking out the least cooked bits of leftover food to drape over the latest actor\u2019s face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlitches in the past led unsupervised Meconstructive machines to staple xenografts-faces made of melting fat and cooked tendons over a poor sap\u2019s face, creating a visage that looked horrifying but smelled rather good. The thought made Zach cringe a bit, but <i>was</i> the main reason why he had a job now, so gift horses and all that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were still a few things to work on. The subject had quite the chin, almost Captain Capable level \u2014 shame the position wouldn\u2019t be open \u2018till next year. For now, he had to shave the chin down to a more-feminine, rounder mandible, to go along with the Mighty Maid mission statement of nonthreatening curves and coquettish innocence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA block plane with an attached vacuum tube was applied to the jawbone, Zach assiduously watching the projected \u2018after\u2019-visualization on his screen as he absentmindedly joysticked the manipulator back and forth. The peels of bone were sucked off to a repurposing plant, either to be used once again in another Meconstructive process or melted together with other scraps to make realistic decorations for horror-themed branches of the park. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZach set his sights on the throat next. Though not a <i>strict</i> step in the facial Meconstruction, it was nicer to get it over with right now, and not risk damaging the pretty facade draped over all this ugly bone. A scalpel was applied to the beginning of skin around the neck and drawn downwards, the patient\u2019s eyes still unnervingly fixed towards him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZach chose not to let his heebie-jeebies show and instead bothered himself with the adam\u2019s apple. Some women did have it, and indeed, some newly Meconstructed women were allowed to keep theirs \u2014 whenever a man was shunted into the Silver Sable role, they generally kept the throat bulge; it looked more intimidating. Mighty Maid would be given no such cartilaginous leeway, however, so the whole thing had to go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully, this operation was almost fully automated, for a mistake could leave you with a mute actor, which was about as useful as a Swiss cheese parachute. Zach watched the sharp metal and tweezers shave down the cartilage before descending upon the larynx proper. Glottises of all shapes and sizes are cut to different lengths, pinned, and cut away entirely. A projected simulation of the new Maid\u2019s voice piped \u201cWelcome to WonderWorld!\u201d ad nauseam through Zach\u2019s headphones, differing in pitch, tone, and fry with an incremental adjustment of a dial.. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n He settled on a breathy, melodic soprano, same as the old Maid. Best to not shake any boats, and it might serve as a little tribute to her. The scalpels and tweezers made the requisite adjustments then moved back, two claws moving in in their place. They draped the lily-white skin up over the mass of blood, stapled muscle, and carved cartilage and smoothed the incision with a line of ointment, leaving an unmarred, swanlike neck, proficient at soft coos and dramatic gasps. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA small alert blared on Zach\u2019s screen. The new face was ready, mounds of muscle and fat covered by a good amount of the subject\u2019s new skin to ensure no \u2018tanlines\u2019. Zach summoned a squad of needles filled with neon-bright liquids with a delicate depression of the console, and with another flick, all of them injected their contents into the few muscles still left on the subject\u2019s face, paralyzing any flexable thews that could interfere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA drawer extended from a cubicle wall, clearing a mass of gel around it. For all the effort gone into it, it simply looked like a detailed masquerade mask, though maybe a little too large to rest on anyone's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZach let out a breath he had been holding for a long while as the arms plucked the face out of its chemical bath. It was nearly over; just the hair and he\u2019d be done. His eyes fell upon the subject\u2019s eyes, still twitching angrily in their sockets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe there\u2019d be an extra step.<br>\r\nZach watched bit by bit as the Maid\u2019s new face was layered on; bits of tendons and muscle threaded over the skull and lined affixed with tendons; fat applied strategically with a repurposed pastry tip; and the whole thing lined with an affixative ointment, bringing to Zach\u2019s mind an image of a particularly grotesque cake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe skin was stretched over the gristle and held there with biodegradable staples, and though it was not quite done yet, Zach couldn\u2019t help but smile. The face was classic Mighty Maid; blue eyes wide enough for eyelashes to flutter diaphanously with every blink; eyebrows arched enough for the most minute raise to broadcast surprise to any onlooker; button nose placed over pert pink lips that parted at rest, flashing the upper row of her impossibly white teeth; and a subtle feminine curve to the whole thing that brought to mind the a young girl\u2019s doll.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverything was perfectly arranged to create the image of someone who was attractive, but oblivious to that fact. Their \u2014 forthcoming \u2014 hair could be tousled, their makeup smeared, the whole package wrapped up in a frumpy jersey and sweatpants, but her radiant looks would shine through. That was classic Mighty Maid, heedless of the leers and lecherous gazes she invited simply by going about her day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe main trick to that effect was inside the manifold strands of sinew underneath the pale dermis. There were a million ways the new thing could smile: a wide delighted grin, a flirty smirk, or the small polite simper of one who hasn\u2019t quite understood what\u2019s just been said. But, in defiance of the adage of a frown using more muscles than a smile, the bands of flesh that were usually used to express disappointment, anger, or sadness were either atrophied, removed, or otherwise weakened. The closest thing to a negative expression that could be, well, expressed was a petulant pout that looked more coquettish than cantankerous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe new Maid would, unfortunately, develop the requisite muscles for frowning, snarling, anguish, and the like underneath the xenograft, but it would be two or so months before that, long enough for the tallest poppy to be cut to size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZach ordered the hair, a chin-length bob of wavy red, that would always diffuse the faint aroma of strawberries. Once again, he met the gaze of the newly-beautified subject. Their eyes crackled threateningly in their paralyzed facade. He heaved a sigh; there was always this kind of sort. You could strip away \u215d  of their body weight, most of their strength, a half-foot of height, and pump \u2018em full of soft curves, but they\u2019d still try to bite your ear off the moment they got out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis would need a solution. Nothing <i>too</i> permanent, just a little fiddling around in their lobes to show them what could happen if they decided to rock the boat. Or just put some little Mighty Maid habits in there to make sure that any consternation would be thoroughly in character. Or he could just coach the poor bugger on what the game\u2019d be when they got out, he'd been through enough for a day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZach sighed once again. They didn\u2019t pay him enough to make <i>choices</i>. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

They didn\u2019t pay him enough to make choices.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that the subject in front of him resembled a human more than a lump of meat and organs, it was harder to dehumanise them. He decided he would do them a favour by offering a little behavioural training, just enough to place the seeds of a few of Mighty Maid's habits in their grey matter. If nothing else, it might help them adapt, and the last thing he wanted was to be sat here prepping yet another Mighty Maid in just a few months. He'd been through that too many times.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment, he just stared into his coffee, thinking of the night they dragged Mighty Maid out of the lagoon. That had a grim night. What they'd done with her after had been <i>worse</i>. Wondertainment hated to waste anything...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis ruminations were interrupted by an alert heralding the arrival of the hair, which was disgorged from a drawer and tumbled down through the gel like an undulating, red jellyfish until he snagged it with his manipulators. Using an implement that resembled an over-sized tattoo machine, he needles the scalp all over at 100 pricks per second until the entire surface was raw and ready to receive tresses. The new follicles would grow into the thousands of tiny wounds in the skin, affixing there permanently, and choking out any of the old follicles that remained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second before lowering the new hair into place, he remembered. The brain grain! Always do the hair after the grain otherwise it got matted with bone and blood, and made siting the implantation much harder. He withdrew the hairdo and selected the grain implanter. It required his personal code and ID badge to authorise - the grains were more expensive than any other part of the procedure, more than he made in a year.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe implanter was a drill affixed to the end of a mandible with the grain itself stored behind the drill bit. Flicking the joystick, he pressed the metal teeth against the thick bone located just behind the subject's ear and squeezed the trigger, making sure that the microphone was switched off first. The sound of metal-on-skull was not something he wanted to hear twice. A minute later, there was a perfectly circular hole, 1 cm wide and 6mm deep, within the temporal bone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe drill bit slid aside and the grain itself was released and nuzzled carefully into the hole. It was of a similar shape and size of a large grain of rice, and made of titanium. Readouts on his monitor indicated that the signal strength was strong, and that its battery was fully charged and capable of lasting 37 without charge, and there were wireless chargers dotted all over the park and in the actors' restrooms that would constantly top it up, keeping it fully functional 24 hours/7 for the next 5 years. He made sure it was in before burying it in the cavity with a spurt of bone paste. Then he carefully sited the hair over the scalp, concealing the wound.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBone anchored hearing aids had been a thing since the 1970s. They worked by vibrating the bones of the skull, bypassing the middle ear and conducting sound directly into the inner ear. It was perfect for the resort, as it allowed the writers watching from CCTV to feed lines and instructions to the actors without anyone else hearing them. 'The Voice of God' the actors called it. It couldn't be turned off, and they could be called up at any time, day or night. It was one of management's favourite gadgets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was even said that management had audio recordings of all the actor's original voices, which were used to fabricate sentences which could be fed to the actor's at a low volume in their own voices. Subtle words that were difficult to discern from one's own internal voice, able to hijack the thoughts of the subjects.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich was, of course, nonsense. All the actors thought it was nonsense.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir feelings, on the other hand, were acute paranoia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the grain was a step beyond a simple hearing aid.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>So close to the brain, just a few mm of bone separating the two, the tiny titanium implant was capable of detecting to electrical impulses coursing through the grey matter, which were then relayed to the central computers and assembled into a 3D readout of the subject's brain activity. It was cutting edge medical technology originally intended for monitoring seizures in epileptic patients. Wondertainment could find a way to twist anything good and noble for profit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZach watched as the spectral, grey-tone vision of the graduate's brain gradually began to fill, starting from the left ear and scanning across, with flashes of colour that zipped between lobes. He was looking at neurons firing, emotions and thoughts being processed, memories being archived and retrieved. Of all the drudgery in his day, Zach felt this might be a highlight. It was really an honour to be able to witness this, to look down on a person's innermost thoughts, their very soul.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Even if their soul is 75% water</i>, cynically grumbled the part of him that had spent years turning people into meat and back again<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were dozens of lines of light, cognitive processes, zipping up from the corpus striatum to the prefrontal cortex, other processes retrieving information from the hippocampus. They followed a repeating pattern. This brain was planning something, simulating in its mind's eye a hundred different ways of solving a problem. Planning an escape perhaps?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe amygdalae were ablaze with activity too. Playing a primary role in emotional response, especially fear, anxiety, and aggression, they appeared as two bright, bubbling green spots deep in the brain. The fight-or-flight response was working overtime and, judging by the intensity of the unwavering gaze, Zach guessed it wasn't flight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs well as monitoring these electronic surges, the titanium grain was capable of producing its own in the form of weak, localised magnetic fields that were readily absorbed by the high water content of the tissue surrounding it. They could be targeted to any area of the brain he wanted, creating artificial signals that would baffle or excite the targeted neurons. He could, if he wanted to, shut down the amygdalae with this electronic interference, robbing the individual of the ability to feel anxiety or aggression. The subject's emotions would be muted, though it wasn't any guarantee of compliance - the fear that kept them obedient would be gone too, and they would still be quite capable of <i>thinking</i> of and enacting aggressive actions, even if they didn't feel it in their monkey brain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo shut down so much activity in such a big area of brain would be taxing on the grain's nickel-cadmium batteries too, which meant more charge cycles and a shorter life-cycle for the product, which was expensive. There was further the possibility, however remote, that too much stress on the device would cause it to explode like a Samsung phone, which was unideal considering its position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was also using the hardware like a cudgel. The same result could be achieved with a fraction of the battery power without rendering the subject an emotion zombie, just by...</span></div></div>",

He had the volume set too loud. He readjusted it. \"Hello, can you hear me?\" Naturally, the paralysed patient could not respond, but the flurried brain activity in Wernick's area was response enough. \"Good. That's good. I'm just running a few tests just to confirm everything is working. Hopefully I can do something to help you settle in around here. Stop you going against the <i>grain</i>, so to speak,\" he said, chuckling at his own pun. \"First of all, can you tell me your name?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo response, obviously, but a single yellow bolt of thought zipped to a location in the hippocampus and returned with lightning speeds along well-worn signal pathways. Zach put thumb and finger on the touchscreen and zoomed in on that area. \"Good. One more time. Just your name.\" Again, the signal shot to a specific node within the hippocampus and bounced back with the answer. Zach paused the real-time feed, rewound a second, zoomed again and tapped his finger against the millimetre of brain matter the signal had bounced back from. He instructed the grain to baffle any further brain activity from that area.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One last time, what is your name?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time, the grain detected the incoming signal and released its counter-signal. A burst of white ballooned within the area a fraction of a second before the yellow signal arrived, which was lost within the white static and did not return. The yellow signal came again, but was again intercepted. The signals came faster and faster as the brain sent increasingly urgent requests for what should have been basic information. Information request signals began taking other pathways in attempts to come to the answer in round-about ways, but they were anticipated by the tiny machine in the skull and shut down appropriately. Zach couldn't help but chuckle as, after about 30 seconds of this, 26 regimented requests were sent elsewhere in the memory center in succession - the brain was trying to remember its name by going through each letter of the alphabet one at a time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe brain didn't like that at all. The amygdalae were surging again, and multiple erratic thoughts were zig-zagging all over, going nowhere and dying as a dozen more swamped them. It was unmistakable panic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good. Very good. Now I want you to, if you can, recall the face of your fiance.\" The thoughts seemed to recoil in on themselves, yet one traitorous yellow blip wandered to the fusiform gyrus and back. Zach honed in on that area. \"Good. One more time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time, the brain was catching on. It bombarded the fusiform gyrus with requests, forty or so yellow-coloured signals flashing across the computer monitor as the patient tried to recall any face other than their fiance's. It was too late for that - his tormentor was already on the scent and trying to control one's thoughts was like herding cats. It wasn't long before the brain betrayed itself. It wanted to remember the thing it was forgetting so that it could remember to forget it. A second yellow request hit the location Zach had narrowed down. \"Gotcha,\" he exclaimed, shutting that area down too. \"One last time, your fiance's face please.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe brain scan resembled a lightning storm in a bottle. It was <i>furious</i>. Rage and fear-filled thoughts crashing impotently into one another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZach considered his options. The device looked to be functioning well. He could lift the memory restrictions with a touch of a button, although it wouldn't hurt to keep the man's recognition suppressed at least as long as his family members remained in the resort. It would stop him wasting his energies trying to contact them for help, but it ran the risk of him running up to any random visitor in the belief they were a close family member. It wouldn't do to have Mighty Maid desperately begging a member of the public for help...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe decided to...</span></div></div>",

Yellow light illuminated his face, rendering his reflection sallower than he would\u2019ve liked. It was all for the actor\u2019s best though; longing stares at a woman certainly wouldn\u2019t be tolerated by the watchful gaze of the staff \u2014 Mighty Maid was strictly heterosexual, save for extenuating circumstances such as mind-control rays, body-swap events, etc. \u2014 and any civilians who could detect a hint of wistfulness in the curvy cleaner\u2019s eyes and decided to <i>complain</i> would further exacerbate the issue. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe\u2019d be popped into a disciplinary session faster than he could say \u2018<i>Mon dieu</i>!\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuashing their original name recognition was also fairly standard, at least for the first couple of months, to wean them off the moniker. Margot would have to do in the meantime, or any nicknames the writing staff could come up with. The brain was a very plastic thing; any semblance of a replacement would stick in the empty space in his hippocampus like a burr. There had even been actors who had insisted that their new name <i>was</i> their true one, though those thespians\u2019 tenure was\u2026 shorter than the rest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZach cracked an errant knuckle and enlarged the brain scan once again. Time to pair the stick with the carrot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright, second test coming up.\u201d The amygdalae <i>flared</i> once again, purple and red scything across the screen like St. Elmo\u2019s fire. Zach bit his tongue to refrain from giving the \u2018It\u2019s for your own good,\u2019 spiel. Despite being <b><i>true</i></b>, many actors usually railed against any actions that followed with all their might, though that never really worked out for them. It just required more mental blocks and general-purpose occlusion to sand down that square peg for Wondertainment\u2019s round hole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBetter now than never. \u201cI want you to picture yourself, um, doing housework.\u201d Shit, that wasn\u2019t specific enough. Still, the screen went wild, yellow arcing every which way, interspersed by arcs of warm colors, a whirlwind of anger, fear, and plain simple defiance. Zach frowned. Maybe he should\u2019ve led with this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHolding a feather duster.\u201d The subject\u2019s brain crackled again. Zach\u2019s frown deepened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<i>Using</i> a feather duster.\u201d Indiscernible arcs. Some were similar to the first, but the subject could be concentrating on other things than they were supposed to. He didn\u2019t want to link <i>walking</i> with the good stuff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBending at the hip to dust a chest of drawers.\u201d The same static. Zach rolled his eyes; he didn\u2019t <i>want</i> to have to do this, but he left him no choice. Well, that was a bit of a lie. This was fun.<br>\r\nWith practiced swipes of his finger, he navigated to the midbrain. John Doe followed him with wide eyes, filled with oceans of rage and just the tiniest spark of fear. With a quick tap right in the center of what was helpfully labeled the ventral tegmental area, he flooded the mind with dopamine, the equivalent amount of three orgasms at once.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe effect was immediate, both on the display screen and the subject.  He rocked forward the inch that the mold allowed, squashing his sizable prow gently against the pink goo. His botoxed jaw trembles around the breathing tube, teeth teasing at the pillowy flesh of his bottom lip as his eyes roll back as far as they\u2019re able.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe screen is so filled with green that one could mistake it for the default color. Zach drummed his fingers on the table as it faded to a more manageable lime tint, the subject\u2019s breath steadying to normal levels. His bright green eyes stare vacantly forward, seemingly through Zach. Lovely. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was rather like softening clay before working with it, Zach considered. A mind swimming in the heady chemicals of an afterglow <i>this</i> great was unlikely to mount resistance against, well, almost anything. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright, picture a feather duster in your hand. Waving it around, getting dust out of those pesky corners\u2026\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA yellow line lazily slithered across the screen like a drunken snake. Zach grinned. \u201c<i>Great</i> job.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so it went, the Grain cataloguing a variety of busywork-related imagery, from dipping the hips to collect a piece of litter to tottering around with a serving tray held in a delicate mitt. Zach grouped all of them together with a swift tap of control+a and set them under the \u2018Reward\u2019 category.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a nifty little functionality, designed to make certain actors do what they might not exactly want to do. Just a quick tracing of the visualized activity from frontal to occipital lobe, and bang presto! Any activity with the same start-to-endpoint would be rewarded with a quick jolt of chemical pleasure. That same jolt could be adjusted in strength, from the slight tingle of joy from a good fit of laughter, all the way to the mind shattering bliss of direct nerve stimulation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe actors who used it could tell that the sensation was fake most of the time \u2014 it didn\u2019t take a rocket scientist to figure out that the sense of complete personal fulfillment they got off of  wrangling a vacuum cleaner wasn\u2019t entirely authentic \u2014 but that didn\u2019t stop the little sparks of pleasure and joy from actually <i>happening</i>.The humiliation and rage from their baseline reaction to the linked activities would still run hot through their veins, but pleasure conquered pain nine times out of then. The little tingles would be a constant companion that the actor would get used to bit by bit until their \u2018normal\u2019 was a drab grey in comparision.<br>\r\nZach plugged in his headphones once again and started a playback of his voice, starting five minutes ago. Though the Reward system was an excellent tool for potentially rebellious actors, you did have to be careful with it. Any commands vague enough or poorly worded could influence the subject\u2019s behavior in unforeseen ways, like some jackass genie. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the early days of the Grain, a recently-Meconstructed heroine named Majestic started making  a fuss about her character\u2019s costume \u2014 an underboob-flashing spandex crop top and what was essentially a pair of bike shorts \u2014 and some idiot Writer had decided to put the sensation of being ogled in the Reward category to shut her up. A Technician managed to catch her in the changing room before she went out into WonderCity stark naked, fortunately, and the Writer vanished \u2014 though the next Majestic did look even more ill at ease with their garb than the previous one\u2026 <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverything checked out. No \u2018You want to serve man,\u2019 or other cannibalistic double-entendres; just clear-cut descriptions of cleaning. Good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n All that remained of the task was setting the intensity. Too low, and the the chap skives off his work to go on a family-hunt, most likely; and too high gives the writing staff a giggly idiot that goes weak in the knees every time they grab a mop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe set it to...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Subtle enough that it might pass beneath the subject's awareness long enough for them to accept the programming. Not high enough to turn them into a orgasmic mound of quivering female flesh in front of young visitors for brushing away a cobweb. It shouldn't be too demanding on the Grain's batteries, avoiding any nasty battery fires. Now <i>that</i> would be a mind blowing orgasm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the end of the surgery, came the paperwork. Zach pulled out the checklist for a fresh Mighty Maid, ticking off the many boxes. Epilation - check. Castration - check. Facial feminisation, skeletal refashioning, dental clearance - check check check.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, I think we're done here,\" he beamed, kicking back his chair. He rose, cracking the vertebrae of his tired back and neck. His eyelids were itching. With just a few clicks, he set the booth to 'Rest and Recuperate'. The syringe drivers ceased pumping the patient with pro-metabolic drugs. The bulk of the chemical and hormonal reworking of the flesh had been done now. He would be given the night to rest and recuperate, the body settling and ripening into its final form, the refilling flesh softening the abrupt edges where the xenograft implants met the human meat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe paced towards the glass front of the booth. The emerald eyes, alerted to his approach, blinked away the last of the orgasmic fugue, and watched him with wariness and open hostility. The pearly white teeth gnawed on the feeding tube in rage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt last able to see the complete work, he gave a low whistle. There were days when he thought the pressures of this job had truly killed off the man in him. Days when he saw such unpleasantness enacted upon the human form that he doubted if he'd ever look at a human as anything other than meat. He'd already sacrificed one marriage and god-knows-how-many girlfriends to this job - the inopportune flashbacks to vivisected actors certainly made lovemaking difficult.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was thankfully not one of those days, even though he could remember exactly the raw materials this thing had been just hours ago. That fierce, predatory look in the eyes.... What he wouldn't give to have a woman - a real woman - look at him with such intensity. Though he knew it was a look of hatred, a hunger to tear him limb-from-limb, it could just as easily be seen as a different kind of hunger by anyone who didn't know better. The work to paralyze certain key muscles of the brow turned murderous intent into deep lust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn, you're beautiful,\" he breathed, aware that he was metres away from the microphone and finally able to speak his mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice of you to notice,\" cackled a voice behind him. The night janitor had wheeled his cart in while Zach was distracted, and was beadily eyeing up his workstation. \"You finished with that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. Yes, I think she's finally complete.\" Zach heaved with a heavy sigh. <i>'She'</i> was complete. He loved that moment, when the subject flipped from <i>he </i>to <i>she </i>in his mind. It meant his work was done. It meant his shift was over. It meant bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I meant the coffee,\" the janitor frowned, pointing to Zach's mug as he swept the empty candy wrappers and crisp packets littering the terminal into a black bin liner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right, yeah, of course,\" Zach nodded, rubbing his itching eyes. \"You good to lock up here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe janitor waved him away, and Zach gratefully collected his jacket and personal belongings. A glance at his watch told him that it was 2:23am, 7 minutes until the next staff shuttle. He bid the man a good night and hastily departed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe janitor watched him go, and locked the door behind him, so that it was just him in the room. Him and the wall of glass-fronted booths containing four ex-graduate, perfected female forms floating in their gel like preserved museum specimens. The janitor smacked his lips in excitement and flashed the pretty creatures a grin of yellow, half-missing teeth. He could have retired years ago, but this was what got him out of bed <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">in the morning</span> in the evening for his 10pm-7am shift. He selected his filthiest rag, and spent a good ten minutes studying each one closely to determine his favourite, before shambling over to the flame-haired beauty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeld aloft in her tank, the stunning creature floated above him like some nude descending angel, evoking many coos and throaty, phlegmy noises of lust from the decrepit janitor. She, in turn, regarded him with intense desire, he imagined. As he brought the filthy cloth up to begin the cyclical process of dirtying and cleaning the booth window, thereby justifying the two hours he spent unsupervised in this room most night, her eyes fell on the dirty rag. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere came a bleep from the console and the dark room was illuminated by a green glow from the monitor, though he paid it no mind. The girl's eyes followed the rag as he wiped it left and right against the glass, back and forth, almost hypnotized, as faint trembles coursed through her body.</span></div></div>",

Zach stands a metre away from the metal table you're laid out on, hosing the gel residue off your skin, while making sure none of it gets on him. The gel is washed away down a drain in the corner of the table, while you are sharply reprimanded whenever any of your weak movements cause the gel to drip on to the floor. They must be repurposing it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe jet of water is freezing cold and stings your skin, but so refreshing after the unbearable heat of the last day that you just lie there and accept it. Besides, your limbs are too weak to resist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the gel is gone, Zach wipes down every inch of you with a towel, lifting your arms to get your armpits and spreading your legs to sponge between your thighs. You keep your eyes focused on the fluorescent lights above.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZach clucks his tongue. \"Can you feel this?\" You look down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe is poking the lips of your vagina with his index finger and thumb, manipulating them gently while glancing from it to your face and back again. You shudder is revulsion, shaking your head numbly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry. You should recover sensation in a few days. It will take a while to mesh.\" His finger traces the almost invisible line on your thigh where the real flesh meets the graft. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis arm reaches under your shoulders and raises you into a sitting position. Your breasts shift and slosh like liquid. The weight of them pulls you forward, and he straightens you again, holding you up with one firm hand on your shoulder. He studies your face keenly. His fingers slip inside your mouth to massage the gums, check each tooth for wobbling. He examines your lips. He shines a torch up your nose. He pulls on your earlobes as if making sure the ear doesn't drop off. He pinches your cheek hard and times how long it takes for the flesh to spring back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you talk?\" he asks finally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a pained swallow, you try. \"<font class=\"size1\" style=\"\">ngh</font>\" comes the weak noise. \"<font class=\"size1\" style=\"\">guh</font>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you have had that thing shoved down your throat all night. You're lucky Mighty Maid doesn't have many speaking lines. If she did, we might have to leave you to recuperate for a few days.\" He gives you a smile that you think he thinks is reassuring. \"We should be good to have you entertaining crowds by today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe goes away, out of eyesight. You try to muster the strength to turn your head, but every joint is stiff and sore. You slump forward under the weight of your own breasts, like a puppet with its strings cut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sense him stepping up to the head of the table behind you. Something white and frilly is pulled about your chest, straps tightened over your shoulders and under your arms. You realise in disgust that he is putting a bra on you. He lifts your left breast into the cup of the bra, then the right into the soft prison. \"Perfect fit,\" he says with professional pride. \"I sized you up perfectly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe drops a handful of black-and-white fabric between your legs. Not a particularly large handful. A pair of bleached white panties sit atop a pleated black skirt with white, frilly underskirt. It is a maid's uniform. He is dressing you as one would a doll.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShifting the pile to the end of the table, he takes your legs, which remained spread from the toweling, and maneuvers them closer together so that he can slip one foot and then the other into the panties. He carefully teases the thin garment up your slender lower legs and around your broad, soft thighs. The panties slide into place over your flat crotch, and he reaches around you to wedgie the rear nicely between your ass-cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere is nobody else in this sterile, industrial room of a dozen metal decanting slabs. His callous professionalism, as he coldly manipulates and dresses you, is both terrifying - as it is evident how little he cares about or even registers your presence - and reassuring, as he appears to show no personal interest, and you are acutely aware of how vulnerable you are, unable to move your arms or legs, resist, or even cry out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe night had been an unpleasant, eye-opening experience.That disgusting old janitor had stared at you for what must have been hours. Just watching you. Getting off on watching you immobile and helpless. If you hadn't had that feeding tube jammed down your throat, it would have made you sick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe is fitting something around you chest. <i>A bodice, do they call it? </i> He is pulling tight the straps, cinching in the waist, tightening under the breasts, which takes the weight off but forces them upwards and together, forming a perky, pink shelf of cleavage that bulges above the top of neckline.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Since it is your first day, the writers'll be starting you off easy. Your role for today is simply...\"</span></div></div>",

That sounded good. Why did it sound good?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZach nods at a green flashing smartwatch on his wrist, then shoots an indulgent smirk your way. Your heart finds the strength to hammer underneath your prodigious chest. What did that look mean?! You furrow your brow the five millimeters your face allows and sift through the hazy heap of trauma that was yesterday. What did he do to you?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvidently some amount of concern shows on your face, because another not-quite-smile splits Zach\u2019s face once again. \u201cDon\u2019t think too hard about it.\u201d <br>\r\nBefore you can fully process the sentence, let alone the implication, his hand cups your waist and lifts you up like you weigh nothing. With a smooth, practiced movement, he lays you front-first on the metal table, your head facing the right. Your arms dangle limply at your sides as Zach\u2019s hands cup either one of your thighs, his fingers sinking into the soft flesh, slowly arching your rear up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Panic surges through you. God, was this it? Was all of this an elaborate foreplay before the deed was done, a funerary rehearsal for the last vestiges of male dignity in you?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSoagh,\u201d you grunt, summoning all of your strength. \u201cNurgh.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut your attempts to thrash merely pivots your body around your plump tits, exposing more flesh to the chill surface of the table. You try to move once more, but you only manage to wiggle your pantied bottom in a way that just <i>feels</i> coquettish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStop squirming,\u201d he grouses. \u201cIt\u2019s just a little prick.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe undersell takes the fight out of you. Nothing can be done now, except to lie back and think of England\u2014<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA sudden pinch of pain emanates from your right buttock, then nothing more. An arm flips you over like a buxom pancake and you\u2019re met with Zach\u2019s vaguely smug expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust a little pick-me-up,\u201d he explains, scooping you into his arms, bridal-style. You let out a short gurgle of protest, instinct nearly sending an arm looping around his neck, but you manage to restrain yourself. He\u2019s forced to readjust his grip, however, and the small shift in position squashes your bare chest into his coat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA little mix of stimulants and painkillers,\u201d he continues, heedless to your consternation or the ballooned flesh pressed into him. \u201cI usually take it for rough shifts, but I\u2019m sure it can ward off the worst of the Meconstructive doldrums.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA lot of your square footage wobbles as you\u2019re plopped into a nearby wheelchair. \u201cJust a little trip to makeup,\u201d says your butcher offhandedly. \u201cFinishing touches and all that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA chill passes by your exposed thighs and you scythe one leg across the other half-unconsciously. There\u2019s a quick tap on your shoulder, and you shoot your eyes up to see a wide grin on Zach\u2019s upside-down face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI knew they picked you for a reason.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thought does not comfort you as you\u2019re wheeled through a pair of burnished metal doors, and off to an uncertain fate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">~~~</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, it wasn\u2019t exactly uncertain. You stand near the perimeter of a round banquet room absolutely packed with people. Sharply dressed waiters and waitresses expertly travel the small space that remains space around round white tables, interspersed the occasional spandex-clad super-whatevers greeting jubilant Guests.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOccasional glances are shot at you, but the most prominent offender is the distorted redhead reflected in the domed tray you\u2019re carrying in one hand. The makeup artist went at you with a fervor matched only by the machines that slit you open yesterday; wielding pink poofs, bristled brushes and tubes of waxy lipstick as expertly as the segmented metal manipulators.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe effect was almost as potent as the surgery: your lips pinked beyond what you thought possible, your eyes widened by rings of dark and light powders, your eyebrows drawn into thin arcs of surprise. You look one-hundred-percent Maid, leapt from the pages of some smutty pinup book, the orbs on your chest stymieing any attempt you might make to see your feet, your skin improbably pale, and your bulbous rear turning even the hardest bench into a pillowy throne.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt\u2019s humiliating, and the scraps of cloth that are <i>supposed</i> to hide your shame do more to exacerbate it in the end. You yank the short skirt down with one hand, but only manage to mash the lacy hem into your cheeks, nearly fumbling the tray for your trouble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverything is awful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut also, good? Somehow? Sure, you have five pounds of ballast attached to your chest and a special tailor for any pants you might want to wear on your off-time, the room\u2019s hot enough to have sweat pool in the compressed couloir of your cleavage, and the only trace of your actual name and fiance are memories of memories, but holding this tray feels <i>really</i> nice...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShit. You shake your head to clear it, and flash a whirlwind of strawberry-scented curls into the air. Something is clearly up. Your greatest aspiration in life wasn\u2019t to wait <i>tables</i>, after all. You just had to deliver a tray or two to some table, then you could figure out what to ask around about. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout a voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat might be a little difficult. You take a step forward.... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd stand there for a few seconds, eyelashes fluttering as fingertips of pleasure brush up your spine. The resultant shiver sends ripples through your soft flesh, and something in your chest rumbles and moves upwards, eventually emerging as a sweet sticky moan, turned ragged by your abused larynx. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou return to reality with a series of diaphanous blinks, revealing a contingent of stares from the tables lining the perimeter. Redness percolates on your cheeks, but you take another step to spite it. The resulting sensation is much less intense, thank <i>god</i>, but a small hum of satisfaction still worms its way through your pert lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou settle into a sedate mince through the tables, trying not to enjoy the quivers of gratification in your core \u2014 and not quite succeeding. The mantra \u2018Put down the tray and you\u2019re done,\u2019 repeats in your head on loop, trying to wrench you back to your original goal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut despite that, the surgically affixed smile feels a little less artificial with every sashay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size1\" style=\"\"><i>Ooh, if you do a good job, maybe they'll give you a <b>feather duster</b>~!</i></font><br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The swinging door resembles the golden gates to paradise in your mind's eye, an escape (albeit brief) from this humiliation and the hundreds of fascinated eyes that track you, Mona Lisa-style, as you move about the restaurant floor. It is like being under a microscope. With each turn, there is a guest putting their eyes back in their head as they hurriedly raise their gaze to your eye-level.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf all the dishes being served, you are the main course, as dozens and dozens of men devour you with their eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are halfway to the kitchen when an arm juts out to obstruct the narrow path between tables. You come to a stop with short mincing steps, the rest of your jellied form rippling to a halt soon after.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl attached to the arm is giving you and your attire a scathing look. She is... caucasian. Mid-twenties? She registers as pretty - with a fine amount of cleavage spilling out from her frumpy cardigan - yet at the same time completely plain, as if you're unable to register any discerning details, no matter how much your eyes flit across each of her features.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet despite being utterly non-descript, there is something <i>almost</i> familiar about this woman. Not the face perhaps, but the body, the way she holds herself...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer tone is biting as she says, \"I'm sorry, but we've been waiting nearly thirty minutes to be served, and my mother-in-law has diabetes. I've seen you-\" Her eyes dart condescendingly to the heels strapped to your feet. \"-walk past our table four times now. Is there <i>any </i>chance we can get served before closing time\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere are tears building in your eyes, as you look at this girl. Not tears; your eyes won't stop running as you try to focus on this girl. It's like staring at a Magic Eye painting. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, for heaven's sake.\" The young woman rolls her eyes in annoyance at the tears beginning to well in the corner of your eyes. \"I wasn't criticising you - I'm sure you're <i>very </i>overworked and underpaid - we just want some <i>service</i>. Ideally before my mother-in-law passes out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, don't worry about me, \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, I've got some candy bars in my purse. I'll be perfectly fine for a while longer,\" an older woman at the table soothes. She is... caucasian too, a little overweight... in her.... mid-fifties...with curly, dyed-brown hair and... Nope, that's all you can determine. She unclasps her handbag and takes out a bottle of pills and a Hershey's bar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of your eyes begins to spasm, your eyeballs veering away from this woman in separate directions. Tears are rolling down your cheers. Searching around for anything to dab them away with, you quickly determine there are no pockets on this outfit, and resort to robbing the frilled wrist cuffs against your cheeks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, sweetie, there's no need to get upset. Now you don't want to be smudging your make-up, do you,\" the older woman coos soothingly. \"We're perfectly fine waiting a little longer, aren't we, \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIs it the noise of the busy restaurant affecting your ears? Each time she says that name, it's like static in your brain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, it's <i>not</i> fine. If \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 were here, he wouldn't be putting up with this. When was the last time you checked your blood sugar?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My blood sugar of fine! Don't you worry about my blood sugar, worry about yours,\" the older woman chuckles back. \"\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 always said you got hangry when you missed a meal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"'Hangry'? He said that about me? He's lucky we haven't seen him in days or else I'd kick his butt!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA gnawing, disturbing familiarity has begun to build in your the moment the middle-age woman pulled out the bottle of diabetes medication. You might not be able to remember your mom's face or her name, but you can remember precisely the dose of metformin she takes twice a day. It was something you had to remind her off til you were blue in the face. Could this be them? Your fiance and your own parents sitting right in front of you, and yet unable to tell? Your ears strain to hear a recognisable tone as the two women bicker back and forth, while your eyes stream and water to try to find an identifiable mark on them, but it is as though every detail has been stripped from your mind - you can't even remember what colour hair your fiance has.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, you turn to the third guests seated at the table, a man. He is...</span></div></div>",

You can see his hair \u2014 greying, bald spot on the top, scalp red and shining with sweat \u2014 and his clothes \u2014 flannel shirt slightly baggy on his rotund form, pair of slacks lightly dusted with breadcrumbs \u2014 but his face is inscrutable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, distinguishing-features-wise. If you look <i>jusst</i> a bit past him, you can make out what the inscrutable parts are <i>doing</i> in your peripheral vision. His lips are stretched into a wide grin, the teeth within slightly yellowing. His nostrils: flared. His eyes: wide open, wolfish, and, most worryingly, directed your way. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLook at that!\u201d he murmurs at a volume clearly intended to be heard. \u201cThey even got the <i>mole</i> right!\u201d A fleshy sausage of a finger is jabbed far to close to the lacy cups of your top and you take a step back, the upsetting sensation of the wobbling implants thrumming through your drug-numbed nerves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou quickly crane your neck forward to peer at the curvature of your chest. The man is right \u2014 a small lesion rests upon the swell of your corseted cleavage \u2014 the sheer size of your chest concealing it from your non-craned vision.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour own staring must\u2019ve been apparent because the younger woman makes quite a show of her ensuing huff. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHeaven\u2019s <i>sake</i>, \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588,<i>you</i> probably know more about her birthmarks than she does.\u201d An angry gesture is aimed at her silver wristwatch. Did your fiance wear a wristwatch? Once again, your brain fails to provide adequate information. \u201cAnd your wife is right <b>here</b>!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man draws his brow together in response, though his gaze remains locked onto your ponderous endowments. \u201cHey now, \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 didn\u2019t get the third degree when she was inspecting the seam on Nightcowl\u2019s trousers.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe older woman lightly titters and pops a white pill into her mouth, but the younger one remains unamused. \u201cUgh, I can\u2019t \u2014\u201d She fumbles for words, then turns to you, face pinched into a scowl. \u201cJust get our food, <i>please</i>. Table 55.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou bob a quick nod and mince away as fast as you can without flipping your skirt. You struggle to make out their conversation in your absence, though from what you can hear, you\u2019re quite the hot topic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWas she on <b>drugs</b>?! All that staring \u2014 and that <i>crying</i>. Did she even say a word? And\u2014\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s all part of MM\u2019s <i>lore</i>, \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588. Seen and not heard: the most important phrase in the servant\u2019s handbook.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI hope \u2018eat a bit\u2019 is a chapter in that thing; the poor dear\u2019s needle-thin.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot where it counts, heh heh\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh <i>god</i>...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou\u2019re drawn from the back-and-forth by a sharp pinch of pain in your carriage \u2014 one of the few sensations that the drug cocktail coursing through your veins <i>doesn\u2019t</i> numb \u2014 but you don\u2019t bother looking for the perpetrator. The first time you did that, your best visage of contempt was reflected in the tray as a sort of vague cluelessness, and your accusatory sweeps of the head a frisky \u2018oh, you shouldn\u2019t have!\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe deck is stacked against you, clearly. Any sort of human response or interaction seems to have been carefully snipped and trimmed into the Platonic ideal of a serving wench, and the most important people in your life reduced to vague recollections. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut still, there\u2019s <i>hope</i>. This enforced fuzziness around Table 55 \u2014 that <i>had</i> to be <i>something</i>. It might be some symptom of the extraordinary mental fatigue you\u2019ve managed to inadvertently hoard, a brief bout of Maidly psychosis, but fuckit, it\u2019s the best chance you have.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stride through the swinging doors with determination in your sashay. Just pick up a tray right quick, and take it to Tabl\u2014<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA domed metal tray is shoved into your hands by a chef who is clearly rushing, evidenced by the brevity of his ogling of you. \u201c<i>Finally</i>, you\u2019re here. Table 55, M&amp;M, and you better do every goddamn thing they tell you \u2014 chump there ordered you special and you\u2019ve kept them waiting a dog\u2019s fuckin\u2019 age.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor once, your sexualized caricature of a face perfectly reflects your abject confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">~~~</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tray you\u2019ve been given is a heavy one, necessitating the usage of both of your delicate hands to avoid dropping the thing. It\u2019s certainly a sacrifice: your free hand was an excellent shield against any wandering hands or skirt-flippers aspirants. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou\u2019ve heard mutterings among a  small cadre of metallic-faced busboys of a competition of sorts; a quarter bouncing competition, with you as a featured springboard. You shake off the vague offense of only being worth 50 points \u2014 just because it\u2019s <i>easier</i>, the nerve! \u2014 and mince your way to the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you,\u201d says the younger lady with near-explicit tones of <i>finally</i>. She lifts up the sesame-spotted top bun of her burger and starts assiduously removing the pickle chips therein. Your heart soars. Your fiance \u2014 whatever her name was \u2014 didn\u2019t like them either! \u201cI <i>did</i> say no pickles, though.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh don\u2019t make a fuss, dear,\u201d coos the older woman, after a brief bout of fanning her piping hot chili. \u201cShe\u2019s not the one in the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, don\u2019t sell the poor girl short, \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588.\u201d speaks the man, an indulgent smile aimed your way. \u201cWhy, I\u2019m sure she\u2019s a whiz at the stove.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou bob your head in short agreement as the younger woman once again scoffs, tipping her wineglass to her lips. You never were quite that good with cooking \u2014 your fiance always said you could burn cereal \u2014 but whatever kept you here the longest would suffice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut having a buxom figure garbed in stripperesque garb doesn\u2019t seem to spark any conversation, just gazes. Residents of other tables roam their eyes up and down your pale skin. The older woman occasionally shoots a look of vague concern your way, and the younger woman all but glares at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man\u2026 well, you try your best to not think about what he\u2019s doing. Or <i>looking at.</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat becomes unavoidable, though, as he rests a hand on the small of your back, nearly sending you flying out of your surgically-softened-skin. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you take a seat?\u201d he offers, voice honey-sweet. You gratefully nod once more, before noticing the lack of extra chairs at the table. Smile growing on his indiscernible face, the man shifts his bulk to the edge of his chair and pats it, a wide grin splitting his lips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou...</span></div></div>",

You take your shared seat with hesitance, \u2018eep\u2019ing at the contact of bare skin with the slightly-warmed surface before you remember yourself and smooth the skirt underneath your derri\u00e8re.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe resultant dinner is a nightmare. The older woman is the only one who tries to make conversation with you, but a quick act of charades \u2014 apologetic shakes of the head and gesturing wildly at your neck \u2014 nips that quickly in the bud. The rest of your time is spent avoiding harsh glares from the younger woman; trying not to look directly at the three to avoid tears; and enduring the endless, obvious, <i><b>flirting</b></i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt\u2019s hidden underneath a heap of feigned etiquette and banal requests \u2014 smoothing a napkin onto your lap is clearly an excuse to touch your soft thighs, and asking you to pour a glass of water a ploy for you to turn your prodigious bust towards him \u2014 but it\u2019s so damn <i>obvious</i>. The younger woman\u2019s face and sneer turn a shade redder and a touch more sour with every hamfisted come-on, and the older woman seems to be wryly amused, of all things!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat\u2019s worse is that all of this horseshit makes you feel <i>good</i>. Sure, your mind is generally against the idea of serving as a voluptuous cupbearer, but watching the water flow into the faux-glass cup speaks to something <i>deeper</i> in you. Passing the salt provides a similar thrill, and cutting the man\u2019s food for him is nearly enough to make you squirm in your seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA distant <i>clink</i> draws you out of your servility-induced reverie, steak-tipped fork halfway to the man\u2019s mouth. The younger woman\u2019s wineglass lies askew on the table, pool of red soaking into the tablecloth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh noo, clumsy me.\u201d she moans unconvincingly. \u201cIf only there were some homewrecking <b>floozy</b> around to clean it up.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDear!\u201d the older woman says, lightly hitting her younger counterpart with a napkin, but you pay no heed to the insult, instead halfway minced over to her, back turned to the lech and cloth napkin in hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis could be your chance! Verbal communication was a no-go, but a message writ in wine could be your first step to familial recollection! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA multitude of options dance through your head. Would \u2018Fiance?\u2019 do? Or maybe a brief \u2018Help.\u2019 You could mime an excuse to the kitchen staff, then spirit yourself away to their hotel rooms\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe red pool deepens on the cloth. You frown internally. That wouldn\u2019t do. Any writing would get all smudge-y. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou drape your held napkin onto the pool, and, on further deliberation, grab another and add it to the puddle, heat building inside of you. Still the pool soaks into the fabric, so you fold the hem of the tablecloth onto the mess and weigh it down and sashay off in a hurry to the kitchen\u2019s supply closet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou\u2019d need a sponge, maybe another rag, and <i>ooh</i>, maybe some <i>Windex</i>! All the materials are quickly scooped into your thin arms, and conveyed to the table, heedless of the metal discs impacting you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou arrive there with a smile, and an inventory of eyes fixed on you and get to work quickly, sweeping up the wine that dripped on the floor with two firm swipes. You wobble to your unsteady feet and peer at the lacquered wood with a critical eye. If this wasn\u2019t taken care of, the finish might be damaged!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou position yourself above the spill then, upon second thought, lean over the stained wood, air chilling your pantied cheeks. This feels right. The sweep of the rag from right to left: that feels right. The tuneless melody you\u2019re humming: Perfect. The clean table: wonderful!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWait. You stiffen in your reverse L-pose. This.. wasn\u2019t supposed to happen. Your metaphorical inkwell was now quite literally dry, and all at your own hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look to the inhabitants of the table. The younger woman is looking at you with abject confusion, peppered heavily with disgust, and the older woman\u2019s face is etched with worry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for the man\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cHey, she has the mole back here too!\u201d he cries enthusiastically, hot breath gusting your bottom.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The way the pleated skirt tickles against your soft flesh as it ripples slides higher up your back under the hot breaths. It's like stepping out of a hot shower on a morning, when you're already late for work - you know you <i>should</i> stop, but what could it hurt to stay there a few seconds more?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBesides, the floor isn't quite clean yet. It needs to <i>shine</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour right hand dabs the rag against the lacquered floor, yet your left hand snags your wrist, pulling you away. With an effort, you straighten. The strain is predominantly mental, though hoisting the sheer weight of your jiggling chest fixtures on your butchered back muscles isn't insignificant. As buoyant as they look within their cups, they are anything but.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou flatten the skirt back down over your cheeks. This is better.

You're starting to get used to people talking about Mighty Maid as if she isn't there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Probably find them off a street corner,\" the younger woman mutters beneath her breath. \"I doubt it takes a higher education to wait tables.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, but she does it so well!\" he crows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's not wrong, you know,\" says the voice in your ear. \"From how you acted during your treatment, could have sworn you were going to be a problem, yet here we are - you've no idea how much pain that saves us in the long run, for both of us. Poor service aside, we're already getting great feedback from the customers.\" <i>Great</i>, <i>feedback</i>, and <i>customers</i>, something about those words used together in a sentence sends a warm sense of pride through you. \"I was wrong about you, graduate.

Almost simultaneously with the money's arrival, a strange delight fills you, an intoxicating sensation of gratification in your heart and an invasive though not unpleasant heat between your plump thighs. A throaty moan gurgles up from your throat as a hot flush makes your cheeks glow. Almost dropping the plates tucked under your bosom, you steady yourself against the edge of the table to support your trembling legs. As your knees finally buckle, you tumble backwards...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n... and are relieved to fall back into the lap of the elder gentleman who catches you with waiting arms. He notices your indisposed state, bouncing you lightly on her knee as he shushes your indiscreet groans. Snatching a napkin from the table and wedging it between your teeth is the only way to muffle them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two women at the table have not noticed.

Add that to the fact that your makeshift gag was distinctly barbecue-flavoured, and that every instance of \u2018<i>good</i>-girl\u2019 that he was so intent on murmuring started a fresh fit of pleasure, eliciting more bottom-wiggling and pleasured groans. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe vicious cycle is stopped with a heavy hand on your back pushing you off of his knee and to your wobbly feet. You would squawk in outrage at the man, but most of your mental energy and gaze are directed at your heeled feet, which struggle to find purchase on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA snap of the fingers draws your gaze upwards to the likely reason you were catapulted off the man\u2019s knee. You meet the indiscernible faces of your maybe-mom and paramour, and then quickly look past them to avoid the tears. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, we\u2019d like a \u2014 what is <i>that</i> in your mouth?!\u201d asks the younger woman. A redness once again rushes to your cheeks as you spit out your gag, partially from embarrassment and partially from the tingles that your apologetic curtsy sends through you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stares with open disgust at you before continuing: \u201cWell, <i>anyways</i>, we\u2019d like to order drinks. Do you want to get a pen and paper, or would you try to eat those too, you \u2014\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<b>Dear</b>!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe rolls her eyes at the older woman, and continues. \u201cAnyways, I\u2019d like a Capable Cosmopolitan, \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2019ll have a Nightcowl Negroni, and, here, \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, the menu...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe extends her phone to your former massage chair, but he declines it with a smile. \u201cMighty Mojito, dear.\u201d he smirks. A wink is sent your way. On a whim, you receive it with a silent giggle and an \u2018oh you\u2019 hand-swat, and are rewarded with another surge of pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe older woman titters at the seeming sight of you going weak-kneed at the complement, the younger one scowls, and waves her hand to dismiss you. You comply with a curtsy, and mince off with a spring in your step.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hall\u2019s layout is almost familiar to you, allowing you to avoid the worst of the swats and gropes, though the few that get through do nothing to dislodge your cargo of dirty dishes. You\u2019re too lost in the pleasant afterglow of whatever was done to you to pay much mind to them or the fact that you were jiggling about for what was most likely your family.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt\u2019s as if your mind is wrapped in cotton as you glide into the kitchen once more, depositing your dirty dish cargo, and placing yourself right next to the swinging doors, hands folded patiently in front of you, bouncing on your heels as well as you can.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGod, you\u2019re <i>perfect</i>,\u201d breathes Zach into your ear. No chemical rush follows the praise though, to your disappointment. You\u2019d pout if you could, maybe then he\u2019d get a \u2014<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello? Uh, M&amp;M?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou startle at the noise, splayed hand flying to your mouth, the warm glow of the action offsetting the shock. The source of your fright is a nervous looking lad in a busboy\u2019s uniform, shaky gaze aimed at your face with heroic effort. He\u2019s taller than you, but you\u2019ve quickly accepted that as a part of your <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">sentence</span> tenure. The name \u2018Walter\u2019 is pinned askew on his lapel, which is otherwise uncostumed \u2014 a relatively common theme amongst the grunts of the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou give a little wave, and his nervous grimace bends into a small smile. \u201cSo, uh, what do ya need?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrabbing him by the hand \u2014 internally grimacing at how his fingers stiffen \u2014 and direct his attention to the drink menu on the wall, pointing out the specific ones you aim to collect. You raise your eyebrows at the price \u2014 the whole menu together could clean someone out!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gangly youth nods shakily, the nervous vibration a common theme amongst every motion he takes. \u201cYup, uh, I can do that. Over here.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe gestures to the other side of the kitchen, and you trot along there with him, artfully dodging through the sea of waitstaff. You approach a large contraption shaped like a fridge and studded with a wide variety of buttons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cSo, I\u2019ll just, um\u2026\u201d Walter darts off quickly and returns shortly after with an armful of glasses and a large envelope. He busies himself with the buttons, sneaking glances ever-so-often that grow less and less subtle every time. Meanwhile, you\u2019re free to do what you want, a range that\u2019s dwindling second by second. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA tight, familiar panic is burgeoning in your billowy chest with no prickle of pelvic warmth to chase it away. The kitchen is a tight ship, with no maid-shaped niche for you to squeeze into. Your attempt to languidly pick up a dropped fork \u2014 and maybe add a little wiggle in for effect \u2014 got the utensil snatched out from under your nose for your trouble and a glare leveled at you that evoked a sense of humiliation with no groinal warmth to counterbalance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut with the clammy sense of shame comes <i>purpose</i>. There\u2019s no man whispering husky compliments into your ear, no maybe-dad cupping and pinching your expansive rear, but the artificial and overwhelming sense of pleasure that they brought in tow was merely a distraction. You needed to get back to that table, maybe borrowing a pad-and-pen from a busboy, so you could \u2014<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, th-the drinks are done.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>give the customers their drinks a good maid would give them their drinks</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take the round tray Walter offers with a dumb smile and hands trembling from reverence. \u201cOne sec,\u201d breathes Walter, doubtlessly confusing himself as the target of your elation. He fumbles with his envelope and produces three laminated pieces of paper, sticking them onto the rims of the cups.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cY-you\u2019re good to go,\u201d he murmurs. \u201cDo you think that maybe you could \u2014 after work of course \u2014 mee-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut you\u2019re already off, your vision captured by the paper resting on the lime-garnished liquor. The other cellulose sheets depict the built-like-a-yield-sign Nightcowl and Captain Capable, but the Mighty Mojito features <i>you</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRed hair tops a cherubic face bent into a smile, coke-bottle-curved body sloping and bulging appropriately, deep cleavage exposed and lassoed with frills. You look down at your own chest-mounted feet-obscurers and giggle mindlessly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou\u2019re happy, you\u2019re elated, but something in your mind says that\u2019s wrong. Tears sparkle at the edge of one eye, and the other crinkles in delight. You mince haltingly towards the kitchen exit, an odd tango of hesitation and exuberance to serve \u2014<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen a supply closet opens up and a rough hand snags you around your hips, dragging you into the closet as you hoarsely squeal in delight/fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt\u2019s a miracle that any of the drinks didn\u2019t spill.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

A part of delights in the feel of your tiny body being so easily manipulated by a strong, confident hand about your waist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat is less pleasant is the immediate claustrophobia of the linen closet into which you are pulled. You catch a brief glimpse of stacks of table linen piled to the ceiling and a blur of red, white and blue in the moment before the door is shut behind you, plunging the closet into darkness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the pitch black, the hand remains resting in your hip. Behind, the stacks of starched linen press against your backside when you try to take a step back. In front of your face, though you can't see it, you at least sense the impressive <i>physicality</i> of the other body filling the tiny room from wall to wall. Overiding the starch and fabric cleaner, a strong smell of rubber, cologne and masculine aroma assaults your nasal passages.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sheer size and musculature of the other person shifts the air as they make a small movement with their free hand above your head. \"Now where was that thing... so much for infra-red vision... here we go...\" comes the smooth, confident voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a flick of a lightswitch, a bare bulb flickers on. It illuminates a wall of contoured blue lycra a centimetre away from your nose. Captain Capable's washboard-like abominable muscles - swollen, cleanly partitioned into an eight-pack with a layer of patriotic costume seemingly sprayed on top - fill your vision.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCraning your head back, you take in the two muscular orbs of his pectorals above you, almost as large as your own, much softer pair. Above them, the World's Mightiest Hero grins down at you, the bare bulb above his head making his curly, golden hair glow like a halo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There, that's better, now we can see each other, can't we?\" he smirks, his baby blue eyes drinking in the birdseye view down your cleavage. He shifts an inch closer. His abdominals are as hard and unyielding as concrete. Your breasts yield before the immovable object, squashing and bulging up out of the bodice. His smile widens. \"And what a sight it is. You're cuter than the last one. From this angle anyway.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis body has you pinned. The pain in your crushed, surgery-raw breasts is intense but worse in the weight on your chest - you can't breath! You struggle for air, each rapid indraw of breath rising your chest higher. The walls seem to press in closer. The bare bulp seems to fill the closet with nauseating, confusing shadows. Even when he takes a step back, your head continues to swim as your breathing increasing in rapidity. Beyond the golden stars emblazoning Capable's uniform, stars begin to glitter on the edge of your vision.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaptain Capable clucks his tongue in realisation. \"Yep, those Meconstruction booths will really put you off closed spaces a while.\" His free right hand slides up under the flimsy uniform, pressing against the flesh. \"Your heart is going a mile a minute. Must be terrifying, right? No space - unable to breathe, unable to move, powerless. You can't stop thinking about all those hours trapped in that vat. Even if your body escaped, or parts of it at least, your mind is still in there.\" Your body has gone limp, supported only by the Captain's hands now, your head lolling like a doll. On the edge of consciousness, you can feel something large and growing larger, pressing against your bare thigh. \"Thank your stars I like my damsels in distress. You're having a panic attack. Let me help you with that, cutie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Captain leans down, his mint-scented breath whispering in your ear, \"Good girl... Excellent customer service... five stars...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crushing feeling on your chest starts to lessen as his words trickle into your mind. Drained and washed out, your breathing slows as he continues to soothingly utter, \"I'm going to recommend you to all my friends... and give you a huge tip... Such a pretty waitress... so feminine... so delicate... so servile...\" His fingers, pressed over your heart, shift. \"There, that's better, isn't it? Lucky for you the Captain knows what the ladies like to hear.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly your vision starts to clear. To your surprise, the tray of drinks remains held in your hand, not a drop spilled. Remarkable, considering the rest of your body almost rag-dolled a moment ago, how your arm had continued to hold them as steady and flat as a spirit level... as if operating on separate programming while your mind almost blacked out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you're wondering what I'm doing here...\" The Captain plucks the laminated circle from the rim of the Capable Cosmopolitan, admiring the image of himself on it, before replacing it. \"... I was summoned by a guest. Looks like they want you too.\" He snags the cellulose coin of Nightcowl from its drink, scowling at it as if wanting to crush the thing within his fist. \"Looks like Nightcowl will be here soon too. Which gives me just enough time for...\"</span></div></div>",

Plus, they have to deal with Brighteyes\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Brighteyes:<br>\r\n</b>The Wondertainment-mandated perky sidekick to Nightcowl, this role is the most malleable of all of WonderWorld\u2019s! Depending on the direction that the Writers decide to take the plot, this bushy-tailed being could be a girl, boy, tall, short, any ethnicity under the sun, smart, dumb, etc.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, Wondertainment would <i>never</i> shell out the amount of money it would take to hire separate actors for each one, so whichever sorry sap gets the role has to spend quite a lot of time in a Meconstruction booth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErgo, most Brighteyes\u2019 are a bit\u2026 unstable. You don\u2019t get a turnover rate that high without a reason, after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Fantasti-Lass: <br>\r\n</b>The first thing that someone might notice about Captain Capable\u2019s own sidekick \u2014 alter ego dubbed Audrey Palmer \u2014 is how darn <i>cute</i> she is. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFive feet three inches of cuddly dynamite; the smattering of freckles over her face; the bit-too-bulky black boots and gloves; and, of course, the black pair of super-underoos over her bright yellow spandex costume. All of it ties together to create one of the friendliest faces of Wonder-City! (Behind the Captain himself, of course.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThose who are looking with a more <i>lasivicious</i> eye, perhaps, might notice the set of flotation devices anchored to her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a little in-joke pulled by the artist of her issues: drawing her chest just a <i>litttle</i> bigger each issue to see what he could get away with \u2014 executives only noticed when her endowments were near-head-sized. By then, the sales were too high to justify any rollbacks: a spandex-clad pair of baps skyrocketed demands among the teenage demographic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe curvy coed was put in WonderCity for much of the reason as Mighty Maid: another soft body for monied Guests to grope, but fate had a different idea in mind for the Golden Girl of WonderCity\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt turned out that ages 4-9 just <i>loved</i> the Lass. Maybe their eyes were drawn to the overabundance of nonthreatening yellow; maybe her short stature seems to be a common denominator for the precocious picknies \u2014 the reason didn\u2019t quite matter. All that Wondertainment was able to suss out was that she made an excellent daycare manager while the parents were off engaging in salacious superheroics.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven the most twisted tycoon balks a bit at feeling up the lass you're leaving your kids alone with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, just pop the most motherly graduate in the overbuxom form of Audrey and you\u2019re off to the races, right? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWondertainment wants its roles \u2014 and consequently, the actors forced into them \u2014 to be <i>flexible</i>. What\u2019s the point of just having a simple babysitter when you can have her work double-time as an understudy?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt\u2019s well-known that only one graduate gets to be the star of the show, the Captain himself. But, of course, you\u2019re going to have a runner-up or two. So, shove the second bananas into the sidekick, and bang, presto, you have a perfectly personnel-efficient part! It\u2019s a bit on-the-nose; both actor and their sidekicked-role learning at the Captain\u2019s side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat\u2019s that? Placing some of the most ambitious graduates in a bit part that\u2019s only made of sweet smiles, endearing naivet\u00e9, bending over backwards for rich brats, and near-constant backpain might create a deep-seated resentment towards their more-successful Captain counterparts?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat\u2019s ridiculous. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Before you can plead for him to calm down, your dad has intruded directly into your personal space, craning his head directly over the book you were reading and resting his arms on <i>your</i> armrest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe turns his bearded face to you, eyes gleaming, and more needless trivia spews out of his mouth. \u201cDid you know that they have special transport to each borough there?

The very same company that churned out roughly eighty percent of the world\u2019s most insipid entertainment and bought out the schmucks who produced the rest of that superlative.

But he had won, and thus sealed your fate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last you had seen of your house was your mom\u2019s sympathetic eyes gazing at you from the window; most of your mother-son bonding time was through the shared misery of the family costumes he forced you into for some esoteric convention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou risk a look at your dad\u2019s seat, but thankfully, his attention is off you or the window.

You roll your eyes and let out a groan that your pop thankfully doesn\u2019t notice. God, he must\u2019ve played this about a thousand times. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man on screen is Dylas Canthrope, the hero of Universal Odyssey, the show that your dad had devoted roughly a third of his life to. A two seasoned series that \u2018was cut down in its prime\u2019 according to your dad, it followed the pompadoured space-pirate as he roamed across galaxies, thwarting the nebulous Hegemony and helping out various alien species in a way that wasn\u2019t very pirate-like at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour dad\u2019s grin widens as he watches Dylas point imperiously at his co-pilot seat. Its shapely occupant snaps into a smart salute and minces over to the engine room to stabilize the positronic flux thingamijigs or whatever. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat character, who went by the consonant-covered moniker of Cjara, was the only reason you stomached that show anymore. A petite, mostly-sapient gynoid, you suspect that she was primarily created so the crew could watch the actress cavort around in thigh-high boots and a high-legged leotard. You envy the makeup artist who got to gussy her up in gold metallic paint.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs a child, you had made the mistake of asking why a robot needed to look human and have all the requisite jiggly bits, and your dad answered your question with a detailed description of the servos and gyroscopes in her base that just <i>happened</i> to resemble wide hips, and of course because she\u2019s a pilot she <i>needs</i> to have a good deal of gel padding, for inertia and all that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou suspected that dad appreciated the show for something other than its rich worldbuilding, and your suspicions were deepened by the traces of golden paint on your mom\u2019s face the night after their anniversary. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn your attention back to your book, but whatever interest you can find pales in comparison to what you can see out the window. The embers of filial affection flare up a bit in your chest, and you tap at your dad\u2019s shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLook at <i>that</i>,\u201d you breathe, staring at the massive Dysonian sphere that looks to be only a thousand feet below your metal tube. Your dad joins you in goggling, thankfully silent, as you admire the mega-structure. You may not <i>like</i> Wondertainment, but even you have to cop to brilliance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s where we\u2019re going,\u201d your dad crows, his eyes shining. \u201cWonderGalaxy. There\u2019s more than \u2018a hundred little locales in there, each a little slice of an alien world.\u201d He taps his seat-screen demonstratively, where Dylas and Cjara are stumbling around unconvincingly \u2014 an asteroid had struck their clunker, apparently. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe company shelled out for the \u2018Part of the Experience\u2019 package, too, so this is gonna be extra special.\u201d He lightly punches you on the arm and grins, and you magnanimously allow it. \u201cJust you and me, sport, traveling the galaxy!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou return his toothy grin with a rare smile of your own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n This might actually be pretty cool.</span></div></div>",

Your seatbelt is buckled even before the seatbelt sign winks on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ladies and Gentlemen, this is your uh Captain speaking.  We uhh apologise for the slight turbulence. We are encountering stronger thermals rising from the WonderGalaxy dome than usual, and are recalculating our landing vector to avoid them. Uhhh, as we should be landing in a little under 20 minutes, we ask you to remain in your seats for the remainder of the journey. Thank you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe plane banks to the right, the steel geodesic sphere dropping from view as the window swings nauseatingly upwards at a clear, blue sky. Not content just to create its own microclimate within the WonderGalaxy, the sheer scale of the construction has caused ecological chaos for the local wildlife. The sunlight that reflects from the polished metal is said to cook any wildlife that strays too close and has created a desert out of the lagoon for a half mile radius, while the hot air rising from the sun-baked metal is enough to set planes quivering a thousand feet up. There are stories that Wondertainment had been forced to relocate the carpark after the sheer, focused sunlight melted a car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's Wondertainment in a nutshell. Audacious, with enough money to trample any legislation or common sense that gets in their way, and totally uncaring of the consequences.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe plane flattens out. Pushing your head back in to the headrest, you fixate on a point directly head, trying to blot out the sloshing in your stomach and your ear canals. You clench your stomach to stop the bile from rolling up into your throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Relax,\" dad crows, even as the plane rattles like a tin can. \"These things are engineered for way worse turbulence than this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The same engineers that built a theme park that can cook an alligator at 200 meters?\" you retort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn an attempt to take your mind of your situation, you switch your focus to the show still playing on dad's back-seat screen. Perhaps that was a bad idea - Dylas and Cjara throw themselves around in their seats, as their command consoles burst with sparks and smoke. Shields were, as they permanently appeared to be, at 13%.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How come the actors are shaking about but the golden dice hanging from the console aren't?\" you ask, pointing an accusatory finger at the obvious gaff. \"Don't they have the laws of physics in the 31st Millennium?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad points with finger-guns (or finger-phasers), doing his best imitation of Dylas Canthrope roguish mannerisms as he quips \"laws don't apply to Dylas Canthrope.\" You roll your eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn screen, a sleek fighter bears down on Dylas Canthrope's ship, guns strobing. A shot from within the cockpit shows what you suspect to be an out-of-work porn actress from the 1960s, slathered in green paint and KY jelly and practically poured into a silver catsuit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about <i>those</i> for physics?\" dad says with a wink and a nod at her bountiful breasts sloshing about, barely contained, while what is clearly the arm of a stagehand wobbles the set from side to side. \"Gelatina: the most sensual single-celled organism in the Galaxy. One of Canthrope's most persistent nemeses - well, she was in two episodes anyway.\" He jabs a finger at her glistening, green tits. \"See, a lot of people complain that her outfit was exploitative, but its actually designed to maintain her shape - in her natural form she's a shapeless amoebae. The science is all there in the Universal Odyssey: Insider's Guide.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh huh. What's her deal?\" you ask, fishing around for a question to appear genuinely interested in the subject matter after realising you've been staring at a (probably long dead) actress' breasts for far longer than is socially acceptable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's a Space Marshall - it's her job to bring Dylas in. She aint bad but she's got one hell of a stick up her butt. See, she's terrified that if she ever relaxes, she'll lose her form completely and turn into primordial goo. That's why she's so uptight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seems a little...\" Your thoughts are derailed as a proton torpedo collides with Gelatina's fighter, sending fresh quakes through the actress. \"Is,uh, she at the park?\"</span></div></div>",

Her arms are trussed to a metal surgical table, and some uniformed group of Hegemonic baddies are tic-tac-ing the zipper of her clingy catsuit down, an act that would probably discorporate her in-universe and get the show bumped up a few letter grades in the real world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrustratingly, the screen <i>plunks</i> off right after the zipper crosses the event horizon.

Trolls stand next to space aliens, and princesses in poofy gowns are placed unusually close to spandex-clad superheroes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat a mess,\u201d you mumble, as you heft your carry-on past the lip of the bridge. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe airport staff that greets you are a motley bunch of half-costumed freaks. A representative of Wonder-Kingdom wears bulky foam-core armor as he practically frogmarches a bemused couple away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and your dad are greeted by a fair-looking attendant clad in a red low-necked tunic-cum-miniskirt. You play up your nausea a bit to have her coo over you for a bit, eyes surreptitiously dipping to her cleavage as she dabs your forehead with an errant handkerchief, but frustratingly, your dad waves away her ministrations.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nher attention is quickly drawn by your dad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you have the\u2026\u201d He mimes a scribbling pen, and the attendant nods animatedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCertainly, sir!\u201d She minces off to go fetch whatever-the-hell and you glare at your dad in response. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat wasn\u2019t worth a pen and paper,\u201d you grumble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour dad throws his head back and a thunderous Canthropian guffaw escapes his lips.

She catches you sneaking a peak at the low cut of her crimson tunic and you think you catch a flicker of annoyance on her face before the corporate smile replaces it. \"I, uh, like your badge.\" You point at the metal symbol pinned just above her left breast, as if that was what had held your interest all this time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks,\" she says with a knowing, exasperated tone.

Which is for your father to decide.\" She leans around his arm for a glance at the customization sheets dad is filling in. Judging by the frenetic pencil scritches, he is sketching something down. The pencil tip just seems to revolve in broad circular motions as he draws. Her eyes widen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad glances up, scrutinizing you. \"What would you say your volume is?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My volume?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, we can extrapolate from weight, it's fine,\" the attendant assures.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's 130- uh, 150 lbs,\" you reply, not wanting the girl to think you're a dweeb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe continues to scrawls long enough for the arrivals hall to empty of the last plane of passengers, as each visitor is filtered away by their respective costumed attendants. You sit on your suitcase with a huff as the minutes go past, habitually checking your phone in boredom. No signal. Another thing the humongous metal dome interferes with. Fair play to the attendant, she continues to pretend to be fascinated by the scree of nonsense he is no doubt putting to paper - her eyebrows repeatedly rising or her mouth opening wide in surprise. Another one of his terrible fanfictions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perhaps your father should become one of our writers. I'll go start making preparations, if you'll excuse me one moment,\" she titters lightly, stepping away and mincing down the hall, thought not far enough away that you can't overhear as she taps her badge and speaks into it, her girlish manerisms falling away and her tone dropping an octave as she says, \"yeah, sorry for the hold up guys, looks like I got another mega-nerd.... yeah.... uh huh... yeah, I reckon I'm gonna need a crew on this one... let's start with like a gallon of t-serum for the dad and-\"</span></div></div>",

Are you ready to begin your vacation?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are we ever,\" dad cried, clapping his hands together and grabbing his case. We are led away from the initial arrivals area, down travelators that run the mile-long length of the hanger-sized terminal. Dad continues to be ebullient about his plans for the holiday, which you zone out. Dad in turn is zoning out the gentle remarks from the representative about how the role of the main character, Canthorpe, is limited in number and, since we will be sharing the Galaxy with many other visitors, the company may be unable to guarantee his first choice of character. Her polite requests if he has a second choice fall on deaf ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the far end, where the terminal splits off in many directions, are hundreds of small cubicles containing a desks and chairs. Costumed Wondertainment representatives sit in each booth, going over paperwork with the individuals or families there. There appears to be an exchange going on too - some of the visitors are being handed what look like pills, others strange coloured liquids to drink, some are opening boxes and pulling out full-body, skin-coloured suits. The sounds of the thousands of visitors is a cacophany and there is muzak being pumped in at full volume, but there are shouts of delight and surprise, and you swear you hear a distant scream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA representative vacates one of the booths with a family of golden retrievers about his ankles - two adults and two puppies. The animals move ungainly on four legs, making headway mostly by the sharp tugs on their collars that the representative gives. 'Gena Nova' moves in to his vacated booth. You sit in the still-warm plastic chairs across from her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo big cardboard boxes are brought to the table. They are labelled Welcome Packs. Dad takes a deep inhalation of the packaging like he's doing an unboxing video as he slowly opens his. There is a 2 litre plastic bottle of water in his, and clothing neatly folded and wrapped in a square of paper. There is a smaller box which he shakes near his ear containing what sound like metal implements or gadgets. \"That's a phaser if ever I heard one!\" he remarks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he goes to unwrap the clothing, Gena Nova says, \"we have changing rooms just in the next area. If you'd just like to drink the full two litres of liquid provided and continue down that walkway, you should be ready to change by the time you arrive.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe nods eagerly, lifting his Welcome Box to his chest and taking the bottle in the other. He makes a face on his first gulp, and you can smell the chemical smell from here, but guzzles it down regardless. \"See you on the other side, champ,\" he grins at you, wiping definite-not-water off his chin, before turning and heading down the indicated travelator. The costumed representatives and visitors heading that way are far more tonally consisted than the previous mish-mash of themes - an abundance of silver spandex, lycra, and naval uniforms in primary colours. This must be where people are split in to their separate resorts. Another travelator heading off in a different direction is predominantly girls in poofy ball gowns.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry about him. He's so embarrassing. When he starts talking about Universal Odyssey, it's hard to shut him up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not at all, it makes our writer's work easier when our guests know what they want. And your father certainly knows what he wants,\" she says, fixing you with an odd look. \"Speaking of which, your costume...\" She reaches over and opens your box. It is quite empty. There is just a single pill, a small bottle of water to wash it down with, and a folded polyethylene bag. \"If you just want to take the pill and then place yourself in the bag.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>In</i> the bag?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. And if you can make sure the bag is complete sealed once you are inside it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is this a coronavirus thing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Something like that. It's for your safety. I'll give a few minutes to get changed and will be back to pick you up,\" she says, stepping out of the booth.</span></div></div>",

Your breath mists the inside of the bag, and it soon starts to get humid and close inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIs this safe? Don't you need air holes?

The flesh under the skin is getting softer and softer, running like jelly, and as you try to squash the digit back into shape, it soon resembles the knobbly creation of a baby with play-doh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere is a sickening crunch-squelch from your knees, and your height drops by inches. Your trousers are beginning to stretch outwards, as if your legs are melting and sinking into themselves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou try desperately to tear your way free. The plastic is tough and even your fingernails are soft. You try to bite your way out. Your teeth have all the consistency of gummy bears. A weakness permeates every muscle. You can barely gather the strength to lift an arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnder the weight of your torso, your legs have concertina's to a third of their height. To your horror, the flesh of your leg starts to gloop from out of the hem of your trousers, like hot wax. There is no doubt about it now - you're melting!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour head is sinking in to your double, then triple, then quadruple chin, which in turn sinks into your neck, which is becoming one with your torso. There is a churning, boiling feeling inside of your internal organs liquefying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot exactly filled with hope but desperate to get out of here, you try to take a step and, despite the fact that your legs are now melted beyond all use, your entire body seems to surge forward against the walls of the bag, which rolls forward. Like a hamster rolling in a ball, you continue to push and the sealed bag (now more closely resembling a misshapen, flesh-coloured blob with a face) rolls out of the cubicle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>This is actually becoming easier</i>, you think after a few more tentative rolls, not noticing that the rolling of the bag is churning up your body even further, like a trifle in a washing machine, mixing your clothes, your phone, your wallet, and your rapidly-liquefying limbs, torso and head together into a thick soup. You look around desperately for help, anyone but that evil woman who gave you the pill! Legs and suitcases pass you by, people paying little heed as they are steered away from the gurgling, thrashing fleshbag by their smiling attendants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour frantic rolling takes you free from the sea of cubicles. Ahead, there are four travelators. Behind, the attendant known as Gena Nova gives a cry of 'stop that bag!', bearing down on you, a silver catsuit clutched in her hand. Glorping as fast as you can glorp, you aim for the travelator signposted as...</span></div></div>",

Your dad\u2019s the one who knows science fiction shit, right? He can fix this. Probably. Maybe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpsettingly, one of your eyes has drifted to near the back of your curvature, giving you a full view of your erstwhile-mini-crush chasing after you. Fortunately, she seems to be inept at running in heels as you are at rolling, so you\u2019re able to maintain your lead. She stumbles into a tank of startled mermaids as your eye drifts back to the front.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou slop onto the travelator with a satisfied gurgle. You\u2019re home, er, galaxy free. You sidle closer to the side to avoid the busybodies walking down the grid and relax whatever you can still relax, sending the melted stub of your nose off to god knows where.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, just as you\u2019re thinking of the title of your tell-all memoir about the sordid workings of WonderWorld, you stop. You oscillate in confusion. Then, you see it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA wide exhibit of various spacey Wondertainment properties lies ahead of you, with a motley group of aliens and jumpsuitted humans gathered at each one. But, more importantly, the travelator has stopped. Your bag is curling itself into the landing platform, inexorably inching you towards the dreaded gap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou burble in panic and throw yourself against the far end of the bag, but to no avail. You\u2019re pulled towards your gummy fate, clogging the mechanisms of some awful treadmill in the world\u2019s shittiest theme park. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt can\u2019t end like this! You haven\u2019t even been laid!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGot ya, little shit.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour burble of supplication is interrupted by a sharp tug on your plastic prison. Another one shortly follows, and you plastic prison suddenly jostles itself out of the sticky situation. You wriggle your mass in a circle to view and maybe communicate thanks to your savior, but the shapeless mass of goo that your heart now is plummets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGena Nova towers above you, her pretty face etched with anger. Aside her stands a man whose uniform ripples with muscle, his forehead ridged with what appears to be bone. He holds your bag a foot above the travelator\u2019s crevice with one thick arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNova turns to the exhibit quickly, plastering a winning smile on her mug. \u201cSorry, for the disturbance, all. Me and the ensign,\u201d She gestures to the strongman beside her and he returns a look of vague offense, \u201chad to catch a rogue Ameboid!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou launch yourself against the walls of the bag, trying to share your desperation to the crowd, but they only smile briefly at the display before looking away.  Gena waves to them sweetly as she struts to and through a door marked \u2018STAFF ONLY\u2019, the \u2018ensign\u2019 following shortly after.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer facade of corporate cheer sloughs off her face the moment the door clunks shut, balling her fists at her side and adding a stomp to her step that echoes down the concrete hallway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man holding you clomps behind her, before booming out a single word: \u201cEnsign?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNova throws her hands up and scowls at the man. \u201cI was thinking on my feet, <i>Tactical <b>Officer</b></i>. Don\u2019t get your puz\u2019jar in a twist.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe chuckles low and loud. \u201cI\u2019m sure Mark would <i>love</i> to know about your exquisite problem-solving capabilities, Gene. Along with the fact that you nearly let a Guest gum up the gears.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe whips around and stares at him with desperate eyes. \u201cYou <b>wouldn\u2019t</b>.\u201d He returns a smirk. \u201cHe\u2019ll bump me up three cup sizes and shove me into some bridge bunny bit part!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot my problem.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGod, you\u2019re an <i>asshole</i>.\u201d she moans. \u201cI\u2019ll buy drinks for the next week.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe shakes the bag menacingly, and you perform an inadvertent somersault in your plastic cell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUrgh, <i>two</i> weeks.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe grins, nods, and strides past her with a \u201cYou\u2019re too kind, Junior Lieutenant.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe has to jog a bit to keep pace, mumbling darkly and shooting you the odd dark look.

The tiled walls have none of the sheen of the visitor area, splattered with grime and multicoloured stains. The worktops set around the walls contain implements of all sorts, and tubs and jars of chemicals. From the ceiling, hang what appear to be cybernetic limbs and other sci-fi props.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's get the kid finished up quick. Can't have the dad missing his squeeze. Get it? <i>Squeeze</i>?\" Nova leers, grabbing a handful of your plastic-encased flesh and squashing it between her fingers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere is a large metal box with a funnel on top which seems to yawn like a mouth as you are carried over to it. Your body molds itself to the shape of the funnel as you are tossed in. Nova takes a knife from among the implements and plunged it psycho-like into the stretched plastic, which bursts. The horror of the knife plunging deep (albeit harmlessly) into your body is replaced by a terror and claustrophobia as your entire form swirls down the funnel hole into pitch darkness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you pour and settle into the container, a hand squeezes through the aperture above. The sensation of it sinking through your flesh, of your own body contracting about their wrist, is more alien than any of the rubber-headed aliens staffing the gates to Galaxy World, but not entirely unpleasant. A quiver of pleasure ripples through you as the delicate fingers sweep and search within you. They snag your twisted, sodden t-shirt. The feeling of the rough fabric being ripped from your insides is much less pleasant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, might want to wring that out. That thing is soaked. Don't want him transforming back an inch shorter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Screw it. Pudgy fucker can deserve to lose a few pounds.\" The hand descends again, fishing your trousers out. There is the creak-slam of a bin being opened and shut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only light comes from the aperture above you, which is further blocked by Gena's sneering face staring down at you, but you can deduce enough by the new conformation your liquid body has poured in to. The container pressing tightly in on you is a cube about 3 feet in each dimension, and there is a circular configuration of metal teeth digging painfully into your underside. You're in an industrial blender!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again, sheer terror overcomes any unfamiliarity you might have had with an amoeboid body. A jiggling pseudopod bulges up from your topside, grasping its way back up the funnel aperture. Gena shrieks and slams something flat and hard down on your appendage, which bursts, showering her in goo. You cringe your pseudopod back inside like a snail retreating into its shell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe knife jabs through the opening, plunging in to you repeatedly. \"Stop. Making. My. Job. Even. Fucking. Worse,\" Gena snarls with each strike, as goo dribbles off her chin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tactical officer's chuckles echo off the tiled walls. \"Don't act like it's your first time being gooed by a visitor.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's in my <i>mouth</i>, Derek!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like I said, not the first time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are <i>such</i> an asshole! Why don't you make yourself useful and grab the food colouring?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few moments later, a small quantity of dark emerald liquid is poured ontop of you and begins to mingle into you. A second liquid is poured in - a floral, feminine perfume, only concentrated to such industrial strength as to be cloyingly sweet. Then a third liquid. And a fourth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething is vibrating inside you, sending more waves of delight and pleasure coursing through you, encouraging the liquids to mix. It's your phone, propped up on one of the blender blades. No doubt it's mom phoning to make sure the plane landed safely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lid slams shut on the blender, plunging you in darkness except the illumination of the ringing phone. \"One teenage boy smoothie, coming up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>VRRRRR!</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>/No/<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0/wait!/<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0/that/<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0/phone/<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0/is/<br>\r\n<br>\r\n/on/<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0/contract/</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\n, as your thoughts are shredded into whirling confetti.

And the rest of your favorite orifices. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, considering all that, it\u2019s some perverse miracle of science or magic or whatever the hell is going on that you still have the use of all five senses. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can taste and smell the metallic walls of your cell mixed with the odd chemical scent of the unidentified liquids within you; you can feel the whirring blades and bits of phone plastic as your surprisingly durable eyes bounce off them; and you can hear the cacophonous grind of the blender\u2019s motors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt\u2019s all you can do to concentrate on each bit of every sensation to truss together your disintegrating psyche, along with the prospect of revenging yourself on the Junior Lieutenant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou focus on the image that your scattered synapses produce: Gena\u2019s face streaked with fat tears, desperately hurling apologies in your direction as her wrists are slapped with space-manacles, and she\u2019s dragged off to space-jail. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou\u2019re on the third episode of these imaginings \u2014 Nova is being \u2018disciplined\u2019 by the warden for brewing waste-disposal-chute wine \u2014 when the blades scything through you come to a halt. A slow bubble rises through your mass to join the tingly froth that rests on your surface.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverything is dark. Whatever you use to smell has long grown used to the potpourri of flower-fascimile and metal. You almost long for the blender to start up again, to put an end to this awful, painful <i>stillness</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLight suddenly illuminates your prison, a small hole in the bottom letting a dim green illuminate your small cube. You will yourself towards it, but no motion whips your ameboid body into action. The thin membrane you used for movement has been shredded into tiny bubbles. This troubling fact established, you swirl down the hole with an accompanying gloop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou flow through a series of bends, the light getting stronger with every second and a vague sound echoing, until you spurt out into air with an unceremonious <i>phrrt</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first thing that you notice as you fall is the bright red and yellow uniforms of Gena and \u2014 you assume \u2014 Derek. They\u2019re huddled around a large console that, in lieu of an actual keyboard, has a trackball, brightly colored arrows, and a ball-top joystick. They\u2019re in the throes of an hands-waving, red-faced whispered argument, but they both stop momentarily to look at you spout out of your spigot: Derek with wry amusement, Gena with a contemptuous sneer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second thing you notice is what you\u2019re actually settling into. It\u2019s a shiny silver catsuit that\u2019s standing up as if starched. A badge that matches Nova\u2019s rests right above the breast, which bulges outwards presumably in anticipation of a well-endowed occupant, the front-facing zipper not quite reaching all the way up to the neck. Boots are built-in to the outfit, the heels impractically high.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou\u2019re once again treated to the nauseating experience of split vision, one eye sinking past the narrow waist and settling in the green tinted bulge of a shaped buttock, the other bobbing at the top of your volume, peeking out of the deep scoop neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou\u2019d shiver if you could. Was this what you were a part of now? A Wondertainment conspiracy to turn teenage boys into catsuit-lube? You concentrate as hard as you can and try to flex your cytoplasm, but the expected nothing happens. At least you\u2019d get to be pressed up against a naked female body in your last moments.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gruesome twosome\u2019s argument reaches a coherent volume. You swivel your eye to view them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThey\u2019re <i>big</i>,\u201d hisses Gena, cupping two hands in front of her chest. \u201cNever-see-your-feet-again big! He drew it, I checked the show, just <i>listen</i> to me, for Chrissake!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rugged man snorts. \u201cYeah right. Misery loves company, Gene, and you\u2019re a miserable sod.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGena purples for a second, then coldly fiddles with the console. You can\u2019t quite make out what\u2019s on the screen \u2014 it looks like a kind of silver-green smear from here \u2014 but it evidently has Derek impressed, if the curve of his ridged brow is anything to judge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow,\u201d he breathes. \u201cGuess it was a different time back then.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTold you so.\u201d crows Nova. The two confer a bit more, before once again shifting their gaze to you. Once again, you fail to shiver. Nova\u2019s smug smirk switches to a predatory leer as she stalks towards you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, I\u2019m going to <i>enjoy</i> this.\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She\u2019s clad in a pink dress that\u2019s an odd mix of clingy and poofy with a neckline that practically plunges to her navel and a hemline that barely reaches her thigh. Two large masses of ballast practically yank her forward with every swish, and the long pointy ears that stand out against her long mane of blonde  currently are flattened against her head like a scolded dog.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sigh in disgust, but you continue your scrutiny of the animated figure. Your ethos of general parent-scorning insists that you avert your gaze and maybe throw a sneer your dad\u2019s way, but your teenage libido insists that your eyes remain on the screen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOut of the corner of your eye, you can see your dad in a similar state of observation, streamers of drool practically hanging from his mouth. You\u2019re not particularly sure <i>why</i> he\u2019s so engaged; he must\u2019ve seen this a thousand times.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe show is \u2018Legend of the Hallowed Lands,\u2019 a kitschy pulp-fantasy cartoon-anthology series made primarily to sell toys, and the voluptuous elven figure on screen is called Princess Allaria, a functionally useless twit of a ruler.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, not <i>that</i> useless; her voluptuous figure and vague wisps of clothing were probably the only reason the show has lasted long enough in the public consciousness to be purchased by Wondertainment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe on-screen princess is currently overcome with emotion, slamming her tiny fists against her ornate fluffy bed, big blue eyes teary and her chest heaving like a roiling sea. You frown; you\u2019re normally all for watching a billowing bosom, but only if it\u2019s an <i>earned</i> chest-oscilation. According to the subtitles, all Allaria had been through so far was a snide comment on her dress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mental grandstanding is almost immediately contradicted as you affix your eyes on yet another bouncy fit of hysterics, the busty elf covering an exaggerated gasp with a dainty hand while the twin mountains on her chest wobble like puddings. She\u2019s received a letter from an admirer and her demeanor has switched from soul-crushing-despair to tittering jubilation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDoes she ever <i>stop</i>?\u201d you moan, a bit of your breakfast from five hours ago nearly escaping your stomach with another jolt of the plane.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour dad rolls his eyes in response. \u201c<i>Clearly</i> someone doesn\u2019t understand the perils of court life. The wrong choice in dress could mean a lifetime of obscurity in the decadent courts of Tyr.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, <i>that\u2019s</i> why you watch this show,\u201d you retort. \u201cThe gripping political intrigue.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour argument is interrupted by the on-screen princess mincing over to her anachronistic modern walk-in closet and unlacing her corset, the curvature of the orbs visible from behind her back\u2014<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd the scene abruptly cuts to some generic teen hero swording and sorcery-ing a horde of knobbly-kneed goblins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow did this <i>air</i>?\u201d you ask, after overcoming the staggering sense of disappointment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTimes were different back then,\u201d your dad sighs wistfully. \u201cLess rating agencies and board of executives, more passion and dreams.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou raise your eyebrows at the remark, but let it pass unretorted. Better to let him reminisce rather than suffer through a tirade of how her bi-episodic kidnappings are central to her character arc.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe plane screen flickers and your stomach spins in circles as the plane banks to the left. You rest a hand on the window and stare fervently at it to stave off the worst of your motion sickness, but are only greeted with something that makes you sicker. Just, uh, ideological-wise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLarge swathes of fluffy green coat the ground, interspersed by small smatterings of houses, varied in size and roofing choice. Small antlike wagons clatter along dusty roads from larger settlements, each wildly different than the others. One is built on a lagoon, each building separated from the other with reservoirs of clear blue; another is hewn out of stone, with small squat prisms of rock presumably serving as houses. The entire mass of land is so big that it extends beyond the narrow aperture of your window.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt looks like a Luddite\u2019s wet dream, and you might be able to muster a few seconds of widened eyes if it <i>was</i> hand-built. But this is Wondertainment, after all. The trees are nature-defying constructions of concrete with tarpaulin leaves; the lagoon-city doubtless scented with tonnes of chlorine and artificial blue coloring; the entire mountain citadel a dun mass of plaster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis is WonderKingdom, a branch of WonderWorld that decided to crib a fair bit of its InterStoryStructure\u2122 \u2014 God knows what that means \u2014 from tabletop games and RPGs, with a dizzying array of guilds, good-guys, and baddies of conflicting themes and allegiances, with some quest-based system to put some extra confusion in the mix.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn short, it\u2019s a nerd\u2019s paradise, which means your dad is beyond amped to be here, judging by the leg adjacent to you that\u2019s practically vibrating.

The runway you appear to be descending towards is disconcertingly tan and dusty, but the harried flight attendant that you hail down assures you that it\u2019s <i>faux</i>-dirt, for authenticity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou cling onto that promise almost as tightly as your armrest as the pilot chirps the ubiquitous landing spiel. Your dad has been and remains enviably asleep throughout this entire ordeal \u2014 likely sleeping off the few cocktails he had ordered mid-flight, the lucky bastard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hit the faux-earth tarmac with a thankfully familiar shuddering grind of wheels against solid earth. You catch sight of a variety themed planes as you hurtle down the strip of brown: one a green-scaled dragon with perpetually stretched wings; another a pegasus with equally extended ells; a third opulently decorated with skeins of different fabric and bedazzled with (hopefully) faux jewels. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>That must be hell on the aerodynamics,</i> you think as you mercifully, blissfully, fall unconscious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">~~~</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWake up, Rob.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<b>mghrrfump</b>\u201d Waking up seems bad. Sleep is better. No planes in dreamland.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWake <i>up</i>, or I\u2019ll send your middle-school photos to that girl you like.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes shoot open and almost immediately punish you for opening them. Everything is bright. As your pupils slowly contract, you\u2019re greeted with the unpleasant sight of your father gazing impatiently down at you, and the equally unpleasant sight of the WonderKingdom airport terminal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs with all of Wonderworld\u2019s boroughs, WonderKingdom is carefully curated to ensure maximum immersion. But because the WonderKingdom experience starts at landing on the artificial island, the airport has been interjaculated with the horribly high-fantasy gimmick that it prides itself on. Stalls line the walls in the stead of stores, offering greasy meat-products or gimmicky jewelry, all purchasable with the local currency of faux metal coins. Knights line the security gates in lieu of TSA agents whilst a harried employee garbed in traditional star-and-moon wizard robes waves a magic wand over queue waiters. The roof looks to be made of wood and straw, and you pray that the latest jet departure doesn\u2019t whip it off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTapestries hang from the walls depicting Wondertainment fantasy media, though, disappointingly, the only glimpse of Allaria you can catch is her knife-eared head in \u00be profile, her wide blue eyes narrowed and plump lips twisted into a pout, all in a feeble attempt at authority. You guess that it wouldn\u2019t probably do well for publicity if a full-figured portrait of the  lush lass festooned the welcoming walls. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, yeah, cool isn\u2019t it,\u201d your dad mumbles. Before you can assure him that it isn\u2019t at <i>all</i> cool, he slaps you on the shoulder and starts to crab walk away. \u201cNeed ta use the little adventurer\u2019s room. Piss out a couple brews.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat am I supposed to do?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour dad stops his hasty egress for a second to hook a thumb a ways off to your left. You follow the invisible line to a figure in puffy-panted jester\u2019s garb. A smile is plastered on a face that you would describe as elfin if it weren\u2019t too on-the-nose, any lock of hair concealed by the belled hat. They stand half a foot below you and are frighteningly androgynous, but you assume she\u2019s a woman, for convenience<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2018ello there, acolyte adventurer! I\u2019m Jingle the Jester, your guide to the Wondertastic World of WonderKingdom!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wince at the cacophonous greeting. \u201cYeah, uh, nice to meet you..\u201d You scratch the back of your head and desperately scan the room for Dad. \u201cIs there\u2026 anyone else here to greet us?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gives an animated shake of her head, sounding a light tinkle from her belled cap. \u201c\u2018Fraid not, sirrah! Just little ol\u2019 Jingle! Follow along carefully now!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe beckons you forward with a rainbow-gloved hand, and you do your best to turn your grimace into a polite smile as you comply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">~~~</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last fifteen minutes could perhaps qualify for the \u2018most mind-numbing\u2019 superlative. A squeaky-voiced harlequin \u2014 who didn\u2019t even have the good manners to be nice to look at \u2014 coaching you on the lore of this insipid place? Your dad\u2019s wet dream, probably, but worse than a root canal for you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMost of your time is spent shooting jealous glares at the Hawaiian-shirted tourist who\u2019ve been lucky enough to have an elf clad in a skimpy leaf camisole point animatedly out the window at a giant tree, or a duo of amazons in matching chainmail bikini explain the minutiae of the token-based economy. You catch some hastily spoken words from Jingle: \u2018Implicit Waiver\u2019 and \u2018legally binding tacit agreement\u2019, but the rest of her spiel goes one ear and out the other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou only snap back to the present when the pesky Pierrot waves a sheaf of faux-yellowed parchment in your face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWh<i>ackthp</i> is it?!\u201d you splutter through the sheets of cellulose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA character sheet, sirrah!\u201d Her smile is nauseatingly sweet. \u201cOne o\u2019 ya ordered the premium package!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd those are\u2026?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA carnet to a fantastic, <i>authentic</i> WonderKingdom experience!\u201d Great, more sonnets instead of straight answers. You\u2019d ask what she <i>actually</i> means, but you don\u2019t want to open that can of verse-spouting worms. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou flip through the sheets, where a dizzying amount of stats, description boxes, \u2018drawing reference\u2019, and a spell list all greet you, all empty lines that, you realize with a shudder, you are supposed to lace with words. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAm I supposed to fill in\u2026 all this?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother tinkling nod. \u201cRight you are! No need to make haste!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour face pales. There <i>is</i> a need to make haste. If Dad gets back before each and every category is filled in, you\u2019ll never leave this airport. You squint at each category vaguely, not even sure of what you\u2019re supposed to be writing for. Some kind of companion? Is an actor going to follow you around, spouting lines from some esoteric 80s show?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWait.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, can I put, like, an existing character in this?\u201d You ask, nearly dropping a page in your haste. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCertainly, sirrah! Second-to-last page!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou see it. A refreshingly succinct page, only containing a simple \u2018Character Name,\u2019 Guest Name,\u2019 and\u2026 \u2018Roleplaying Aid\u2019?\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat does this mean?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJingle tilts her head in a manner that she appears to think conveys friendliness, but it more closely resembles a psychotic mannequin. \u201cAh, that\u2019s just a little rigamarole we put the ol\u2019 box \u2018neath to make sure everythin\u2019s <i>context sensitive</i>,\u201d She punctuates the last two words with a jostle of her bells and a tap of her head. \u201cNo point in havin\u2019 a \u2018You\u2019 or \u2018Why\u2019 when a \u2018Thou\u2019 or \u2018Wherefore\u2019 \u2018ll do!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou return a hesitant nod. By the sound of it, they\u2019ll send out a theater kid. A weird one, by the sound of it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Rob! What\u2019re chatting up the clown for?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA finger of ice creeps up your spine. A peek over your shoulder reveals your dad, bowleggedly hobbling his way back from the bathroom. Quick as a flash, you write the only character you know on the form \u2014 Allaria Seraphina \u2014 and pause on the next line. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt would be nice to have a busty elf cling to your arm for the duration of the trip, but on the other hand, your dad might actually attempt filicide if he susses out your secret. And sure, you might be able to suss out a grope or two if you give \u2018<i>prima nocta</i> to your pop, but it wouldn\u2019t feel quite the same...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHastily, you write ____, and shove it into Jingle\u2019s gloved hands.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

A square has been cut out of the glued-together pages to insert a handheld document scanner. She slips the parchment face-down on the glassy surface, snapping the tome shut again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The contract signed, the quest begins, the odds seem insurmountable! Wondertainment accepts this waiver, and can't be held accountable!\" she proclaims.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rob, you didn't!\" dad whines, his face falling. \"I had <i>plans</i>! <i>Years</i> of D&amp;D characters. You don't even know the lore...\" He turns to Jingles, for a moment looking ready to snatch the tome and parchment out of her hands, but the jester gives a surprisingly nimble hop backwards with a clattering of bells. \"Tell me I get a do-over.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do-over? Nay, the ink is dry, what's done is done is done! Hush now, Princess, don't you cry, just try to have some fun!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"'Princess'?\" dad gasps, his face paling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We-well, you... always did have a soft spot for elves,\" you reply weakly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGamboling over to him, Jingles prods him in his fleshy chest with a stave spiraled with coloured streamers. \"Soft spots, aye, it's fair to say she'll have those in abundance! They'll serve you well, more than 'er, when lost within dark dungeons!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Not. Helping</i>,\" you hiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But surely you couldn't possibly make an elf out of me?\" dad splutters, hoisting his beer gut for emphasis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaising her bright stave and giving a sharp flick of it, the amazonian duo breaks away from their client and moves across the concourse towards dad. Jester titters and capers about him, seizing handfuls of his belly fat in her hands. Her whole demeanor has changed upon the signing of the contract, becoming suddenly impish. \"Our apothecaries, skilled in their arts, for guests they do outdo! Why, there's flesh enough for not one elf, I'm sure they could make two!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe finishes her rhyme with a leering, lopsided grin up at him. As the amazons take their places at his elbows, Jingles raises her fist to her lips, unfurls it, and blows, a cloud of magenta glitter hitting him full in the face. His head snaps back as if struck by a heavy object and he falls, unconscious, into the waiting arms of the warrior women. His sandals scrape against the floor as he is dragged bodily away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is he going to be okay?\" you fret.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Paternal flesh, they will contort, come dawn he'll make a comely consort.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Consort? Hey, I never said that I wanted a- a -\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You ticked the box for roleplay aid, you'll find her more than just <i>context</i> sensitive,\" Jingles crows with a wink. \"Your own obedient, winsome maid - try not to look so pensative. This world is yours, and all within. To take, to seize, to win! And she'll soon take her role as well; once you fill her in...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a deranged smile, Jingles pushes a second piece of parchment into your hands. Its edges are gilded, and it is addressed to the owner of the 'Premium Package'. It is similar to the last - a slot open for your character description, the option for a premade, or a third option...</span></div></div>",

It is shaken emphatically, its holder\u2019s bell-wrists jingling in time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome now, young sir, there\u2019s no time to balk,\u201d warns the jester. \u201cCan you hear that? It\u2019s the tick of the clock!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShut up, I\u2019m thinking!\u201d you shoot back, scanning the page over and over again. Each innocuous description now seems laden with sinister meaning. You eye the sculpted backs of the amazons as they enter a swinging door disguised as brick and mortar. Are they what passes for a \u2018martial class\u2019? Could stroke of the pen could confine you to a similarly striated form, or worse, a similarly buxom, pointy-eared fate to match your dad\u2019s?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJingle\u2019s grin stays wide and manic as you fret over the options. Well, for the first two minutes of fretting. By the third, it\u2019s switched to a small smirk, and by the fifth, any trace of mirth has been wiped off her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour desperate rereading is interrupted by a finger slamming onto the page, which is lowered to reveal the humorist\u2019s humorless face. \u201cIf it\u2019s change that you fear, just select Option 3!\u201d She hisses. \u201cThere\u2019s a queue waiting here, can\u2019t those eyes of yours see?!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou follow the black-nailed finger to its pointed destination; and sure enough, the jumbled jokester seems to be telling the truth. A host of fellow tourists stand there, varying in garb, walks of life, and sunburn levels, but all carry vague looks of impatience on their faces. The leaf-clad elf stands knock-kneed in front of all of them, apparently trying to assuage their frustration with a loredump as Jingle did, shooting nervous glances back at the selfsame jester ever so often.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou read the option she\u2019s pointed: \u2018Otherworldly Adventurer\u2019. Unlike the premade options that sit above it or even the empty character sheet with its countless footnotes and asterisks, the option\u2019s description is small enough to render it remarkably inconspicuous in comparison. It reads: \u2018Boosted XP gain: No MeConstruction.\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s a MeConstructi\u2014?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSign it!\u201d growls Jingle, impatience evidently boiling over. The queue behind her jostles a bit more, their beleaguered guide waving her hands wildly to regain their attention. You meet the jester\u2019s glare for a second\u2026 then check off the option, scrawling your John Hancock on the bottom of the page. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure, you may have consigned yourself to a maybe-eternity as some fantasy-pastiche stereotype, but the mirthful jester\u2019s countenance looked downright murderous. Better a sorceress than a stain on the tarmac.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo your quick relief, no magenta-knockout-glitter is sprayed into your face, nor are you suddenly accosted by unusually muscular women. Your wrist is encircled by Jingle\u2019s unusually strong hand, though, and you are dragged to the airport\u2019s main exit, despite your best efforts to wriggle out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA refrain of \u201cOwfuckgoddamn<i>STOPPIT</i>,\u201d echo into the empty halls accompanied by, of course, the slight tinkle of bells.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">~~~</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou\u2019re around two minutes from any human sighting \u2014 save your personal harlequin-tormentor \u2014 when you are finally released, Jingle choosing instead to slam your paper into the same book-cum-document-scanner as you lightly massage your tender wrist. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou examine your surprisingly austere surroundings \u2014 there\u2019s no trace of any fantasy aesthetic save for a (comparative to the landing hall) small mural of a dragon on the otherwise bare blue concrete walls. A (faux, you think) wooden door with the labeling plaque \u2018STABLES\u2019 lies on the other end of the largeish rooms, red leather ropes hemming in a surprising dearth of tourists.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou give Jingle a wide berth as she impatiently fiddles with a velvet rucksack with the helpful moniker \u2018BAG OF TRICKS\u2019 sewn into its back. One half of you is urging that you <i>get the hell away from this maniac</i> and the other emphatically insists that you do <i>not</i> run, lest she turn you into a newt or something. You\u2019re obeying the second urge right now \u2014 WonderWorld, as promised in its manifold adverts, has made a part of you believe in magic, but certainly not the good time<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJingle stops her rummaging and turns her attention to you, a sharp movement of her wrist propelling something your way. You overcome your coulrophobia long enough to obey the implicit order of \u2018Catch\u2019, enclosing the object in your hands. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt\u2019s some kind of amalgam of a smart watch and a tablet, too big to be called the former and too small to be called the latter. The edges surrounding the black mirror of the center appear to be made of some kind of imitation brass, little bumps of fake rivets punched into it. All in all, it\u2019s kinda steampunky, which isn\u2019t exactly matching the aesthetic of the \u2014 <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>SNAP</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wince, and incline your gaze to the jester once more. One hand is raised in post finger-snap but quickly transitions to impatient gestures of strapping something to her wrist, marking the second occasion of her eschewing the annoying rhymes for mimery, which, in a way, was kinda wor\u2014<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>SNAP-SNAP</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou raise a hand to your ringing ears and frown at the Jester, who answers back with a sneer. \u201cI liked it better when you talked,\u201d you mumble, as you fasten the thing to your wrist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe screen shines to life, a little plate-armored knight walking across the bottom in lieu of a loading bar. Little messages pop up: \u2018Initializing Guest \u2018Robert\u2019, \u2018Aligning Stats,\u2019 \u2018Injecting Status ConditiCard.\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA pinch in the base of your wrist accompanies the last notification, drawing a small squawk of pain from your lips. You fiddle with the buckle desperately, but the band seems to tighten, if anything. You brandish your hand at Jingle, hissing \u201cWhat did you <i>do</i>?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe\u2019s smiling once again, and shrugs casually. \u201cIt\u2019s standard practice, dearest boy.\u201d She resumes walking forwards, cavorting over the leather ropes with graceful pointe. \u201cYou\u2019ll have much fun with your new toy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grumble and follow her to the wooden stables door, still fiddling with the band of the computer. The knight has progressed through \u00be of the tablet-watch, his sword raised in a display of heroic valor. The stables continue the painfully artificial world of Wonder\u2122 you\u2019ve come to expect; each stray bit of faux-hay anchored to the floor; walls, pillars, and swinging doors each formed of wood-textured plastic; and a fleet of uncannily still horses lashed to chariots. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou suspect animatronics.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJingle stands next to a particularly ornate carriage, a round bulb of white laced with white filligree, snow-coloured horses attached with ivory bridles that the small segment of your heart that is bleeding hopes against hope is artificial. A small tinkle accompanies each impatient foot-tap, smile stretched across her face now with a jagged and kind of strained edge to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, my dear, here\u2019s our ride!\u201d A quick flourish and tap of her stave against the vehicle reveals a fairly comfy-looking compartment, lined with red velvet. \u201cNow we\u2019re off to meet your bride!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTh- I <i>said</i> that\u2019s not what I wanted!!\u201d you splutter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s what you wrote and what you\u2019ll find, valued guest,\u201d coos the jester. \u201cA princess in mind, and also in chest!\u201d Jingle cups two sumptuous handfuls of air in the front of her own flat uniform. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, this was a concerning-slash-<i>extraordinarily</i>-intriguing possibility. \u201cJesus, are you guys going to brainwash him?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJingle seems to be in her element as she pirouettes around your carriage, adding in a slight skip ever so often to keep things fresh. \u201cHis mind shan\u2019t be washed, just given a rinse! You can be what you want, from offspring to prince!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA wink accompanies the last statement, along with a deep bow and flourish directed at the carriage\u2019s open door. You enter, dry-mouthed as potential scenarios whirl through your head, from potential revenge from all the cons you were dragged to and the girls scared off by fantasy-trivia; to how maybe, potentially, you could ask your bipolar guide if you could take the princess home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat is of a very low concern is the how or if of turning him back.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The red velvet cushions are comfortable enough, though there is the distinct smell of disinfectant within the bulbular carriage. They must rinse these things down after each use - they are ivory-and-gold coloured plastic vehicle was a <i>wedding</i> carriage after all. Artificial roses and lilies adorn the outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA number of guests use the park as romantic getaways, acting out sensual fantasies and whirlwind romances in the space of a week, culminating in a wedding. Some even use the opportunity to renew their vows, and it is said that the entire staff is legally ordained to conduct such ceremonies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe satin drapes fall into place over the windows, placing the carriage into chlorinated shade, illuminated by the glow of the screen about your wrist. With just the slightest creak of rusty servos, the animatronic horses break into a canter, all at once, throwing you off balance. As you catch yourself with your hand, you notice the fingers of the arm strapped to the device are sluggish and numb. You rub some sensation into them. The digital knight, having finished his quest to the end of the loading bar, is now stripped of his armour, sweat beads emanating from his head as struggles to heft his pixelated broadsword in a repeating 2-frame animation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-- synchronising guest--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe numb sensation is crawling up over your elbow. Above the knight, the interface cycles through a series of numbers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPower: 7..... Finesse: 6..... Cognition: 11..... Ardor: 12..... Arcanum: 0..... Divinity: 0..... Luck: 1<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWere these <i>you</i>? Your, or rather your character's, attributes? You've sat in on enough of your father's D&amp;D games to make an educated stab at what the attributes mean. Power 7 could be referring to your physical strength, with 10 presumably the average. It's almost enough to raise your indignation but a testing flex of your scrawny, pubescent biceps quickly douses that fire. They're not wrong. You'll just have to be happy with Cognition 11.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinesse must be a measure of nimbleness - somehow Wondertainment or the machine at least, must know how clumsy you are. Ardor - you surmise that must be charisma, passion, strength of will, that sort of thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wonder if dad is being \"statted\" up right now too. There are probably technicians working behind the scenes to put his \"character sheet\" together. That will be the easy part. Making him match the character, the role of Princess Allaria, that will be enough job entirely. You refuse to believe it is possible. Not even sculpting his sagging middle-age flesh into that fey, feminine form, but getting him to play the part. Impossible. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen again, you've seen him play female characters in his tabletop campaigns before. Sure, he had always approached the roles with an over-the-top high-pitched squark that wouldn't be out of place in a Monty Python sketch. Sure, his comprehension of womanhood was to hide behind the male characters. But Princess Allaria was a charicature of a distressed damsel - he may well do the role justice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe carriage emerges from the stables onto a cobbled street. Pulling back the drape and glancing back, you watch as Jingle waves you away, before a puff of purple smoke at her feet almost conceals her tugging out a pack of cigarettes as she ducks into a side door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe carriage bounces along between rows of wattle-and-daub buildings carefully built by architects to lean precipitously towards one another over the street, providing shade for the taverns, blacksmiths, guildhalls and such that line the streets. The carriage travels at quite a pace, the legs of the horses cantering at a blur, granting you only brief glimpses at the guests thronging the walkways. The predominantly colour is human pinks and browns, but you catch flashes of spiked, emerald humanoids; a red and gold woman whose robes undulate like flames; and a rather high number of figures walking around this supposedly family theme park in the nude. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe carriage brakes to a halt suddenly to allow a pedestrian to cross, giving you enough time to notice a young girl breaking away from her mother's hand to nervously tugging at the robes of a fearsome seven-foot giant, pointing at the nude figure at his side. The giant bears his tusks in a grin, tugging harshly at the silver chain in his hand that leads to the figure's collared neck. The figure - not nude but covered in a layer of short fur from head to toe - obediently lowers its head for the child to pet the catlike ears that sit atop them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mother of the young child doesn't even notice. She is otherwise distracted, locked in the passionate embrace of a slender, elven woman. The elf's hands explore the human guest's body, which goes unnoticed by the crowd. Such things must be commonplace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn advertising, Wondertainment plays down the sexual aspects of their park. It is \"for kids and adult kids\". Yet put a bunch of people in their dream bodies, tell them to live out their wildest fantasies, and give them free reign to do as they please with the park's staff, and of course their baser impulses are going to rise to the surface.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat was it Jingles said? '\u201cYou\u2019ll have much fun with your new toy.\u201d Well, thank God you have 'Cognition 11' and 'Ardor 12'. Smarts enough to see through the phoniness of Wondertainment, and the mental strength to resist any temptation. So what if you have Princess Allaria to yourself for the entire vacation - there was no way you're going to forget who she really is on the inside, no way that you might lose your inhibitions for a moment, to sample her body, use her, plunge yourself between the velvet folds of her quivering, fey pu-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAh, the burden of <i>Cognition 11</i>. With some relief, the numbness exuded by the watch has spread down over your midsection and groin. Dad can count on you to keep a cool head. Speaking of which, your jaw goes numb. Your head is getting fuzzy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe watch bleeps. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-- One free advancement --<br>\r\n-- Please select --<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt must want you to chose one of the stats to add to.

Sure, you could put a few points in Power and bulk yourself up to bodybuilder-tier levels, but you\u2019d hardly need that much to <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">manhandle</span> <b>protect</b> your slope-eared ward. Probably. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe not-unpleasant static in your body intensifies enough to buckle your spine, exhorting you to lie languidly down on the velvet cushions. The artificial scent of lemon disinfectant grows stronger as you approach the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou lazily contemplate Finesse. You\u2019d argue with the <i>6</i>, but your brief stint with baseball in second-period gym would argue right back. You somehow managed to pitch the ball right over the backstop. Speccing into it seems a waste.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuck seems an intriguing possibility. How would that manifest in the plastic-and-staff run WonderKingdom? Built in release-mechanisms in all noble elves\u2019 dress? Foes tripping and breaking their necks before combat? Your finger hovers over it, but you decide otherwise. Starting you off with only <i>one point</i> seems an insult, and you don\u2019t want to humor any staff that were possibly watching. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other ones considered, you gravitate towards your 0-point options, <i>Divinity</i> and <i>Arcanum</i>. Both are interesting, if you\u2019re looking at it from a character-building sense. Would more <i>Divinity</i> allow you to ask for a boon from a staff member playing at apotheosis? Could <i>Arcanum</i> let you conjure flames from nowhere, and conjure pretty light shows with a flick of the hand? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou vacillate between the two, finger slowly drooping from lethargy, until it lands down somewhere on the screen. A little <i>boop</i> confirms your choice, but your heavy eyelids are already falling, with your mind, into a deep sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">~~~</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wake up to a particularly jolt-y bump of the carriage that raised and dropped your head onto the soft velvet. The light filtering through the curtains has taken an ochre hue, and the fuzziness is altogether gone from your body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stretch the sleep from your limbs with a languid groan, your fingers brushing the corrugated metal of the carriage. You blink once. Then twice. A third for good measure. How long were you out?  Did you lose a day?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stand up unsteadily and lurch to the curtains, snicking them open as surreptitiously as you can. Stood in front of a plastic tree just a ways ahead is an elven woman, dressed in armor that would <i>probably</i> be useful in a fight, provided no one targeted her midriff, arms, the outer part of her thighs, or her collarbone. Her weight is lazily balanced against a spear tucked in the crook of her arm. One hand is brought up to her lips, the other fiddling with a lighter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe watches you roll up with sullen irritation, before bringing one hand to her pointed ear while wincing, hiding the other behind her back. Her eyes widen in surprise and she snaps into a wobbly salute at your carriage, her smile rimmed with bloodshot eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pull the curtains back. You\u2019re in elf-country now, you assume, judging by similar guards down the line standing in front of similar trees, though none quite as\u2026 distracted as that one. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou suspect that love of \u2018pipeweed\u2019 is not in elven lore. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou slouch back with a putter of the lips and stare up at the ceiling. Come to think of it, what <i>is</i> elven lore? From what you can cobble together from your bad memories of Dad\u2019s beloved fantasy show, the answer would be \u2018not much\u2019. You think you saw precisely one elf in (the same vital-organ-baring) armor during that animated drudgery, and she might have been part of a background cel. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMost of the elvery you saw was dialogue-and-intrigue-centric, which probably was an animator\u2019s trick to minimize budget or effort, the lazy clods. When the generic protagonist got into a fight \u2014 and he often did, the rapacious scamp \u2014 both hero and foes\u2019 limbs jerked about like clockwork automatons. Still, Allaria\u2019s animation was shockingly fluid, so the person who sketched the manifold rounded edges of the elf must\u2019ve done so as a passion project.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, you\u2019d doff your cap to whomever put pen to bosom \u2014 provided they weren\u2019t on the streets, a cursory internet search revealed that the show was absolutely <i>reamed</i> by ratings boards after its first airing, incurring enough fines that any amount of horny cartoon-aficionados couldn\u2019t save it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo it was a long-burning torch that your dad held for the Princess, probably. And now \u2014 if the rhyming jester\u2019s words were to be believed \u2014 he <i>was</i> her. Was that ironic? It felt ironic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn your mind to thoughts about how you are <i>definitely not</i> excited for this. You then squeeze your knee as hard as you can to dispel your morning wood, which chose this purely coincidental time to show itself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou\u2019d both probably laugh about this in a while. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour watch flashes. The pixelated knight has once again donned his armor and is facing the screen, pumping his sword holding arm up and down. The words \u2018NEW QUEST\u2019 flashes above him in golden gothic font. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou idly thumb it. A grey box expands as the knight unfolds his arms like a circus ringleader, accenting the rectangle with the point of his sword. \u2018MEET THE PRINCESS\u2019 heads the top of the box in the same gold-filigreed text. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hammering of your heart becomes more pronounced, but a blinking \u2018!\u2019 notification takes the balance of your attention. You press it whilst trying not to frown out of impatience, but the urge disappears when the text \u2018SELECT SPELL\u2019 appears on the screen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wide grin across your face is filled with childlike wonder instead of lascivious anticipation for once. A small pseudo-benefit of dad\u2019s insistent show-pushing was a fascination for the arcane arts, an interest that was thoroughly quashed by the stodgy first law of thermodynamics and a host of other disappointing realities.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour 6 <i>Finesse</i> certainly didn\u2019t help with any of the close-up magic tutorials you attempted, but it seems that your least favorite megacorp might lend a helping hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeciding to blithely ignore all the frightful environmental and labor law violations for <b>now</b>, you eagerly tap the two words of promise\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...only to be greeted with a disappointingly brief 3-option list that provides, \u2018Kindle\u2019, \u2018Create Water\u2019, and \u2018Chill Touch\u2019 as your only three options. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou frown. What a gyp. Where were the Firebolts and the Power Words, the Raise Dead\u2019s and Eldritch Blasts? Leave it to Wonderworld to corpora-sanitize <i>magic</i>. A few determined scroll reveal a larger list of tantalizingly greyed magicks, including \u2018Charm Person\u2019 and \u2018Brew Potion\u2019, though no stat requirement is listed next to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe descriptions bring similar disappointment. The most promising option \u2018Kindle\u2019 specifies the start of \u2018small fires\u2019 in \u2018predetermined spots\u2019, quashing any of your latent aspirations to pyromania; \u2018Create Water\u2019 is limited to two cups of water per hour; and Chill Touch, well, is <i>Chill Touch</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pick Create Water with the hardest consternated tap you can muster. Maybe if you\u2019re thirsty, you can slake your thirst, though you doubt a vacation resort would try to starve out its guests. The screen flashes with instructions: Apparently all you have to do is bend your right hand\u2019s fingers like so\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA mist of what you dearly hope is water sprays from an invisible port on your tablet as if from a motor-powered spritzer, which is probably what it is, judging by the buzz from your tablet.. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou unclench your fingers after five seconds of power-rapt staring, but it\u2019s enough to leave all of your velvet cushions soaking wet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of your ten-minute carriage ride is spent standing, balefully staring at the wet pillows. You\u2019re thankful that the carriage door automatically opens, having some elvish guard hide their giggles at your sodden seats would be too much to bear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take a step out into what is presumably the fey kingdom of Tyr \u2014 with more than one glower at its soaked interior \u2014 and\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Internally \u2014 and begrudgingly \u2014 you admit that the sight is\u2026 <i>somewhat</i> impressive. The architectural style of Tyr seems to be some kind of Roman-and-art-deco pastiche, with smooth huts made out of faux-marble with tall pillars lining the dusty paths somewhat haphazardly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the constructions seem to eschew wood as a building material, save for the giant tree that stretches above you all, its leaves glinting unnaturally in the sun. A large archway seems to be <i>grown</i> into the tree\u2019s base, and you can catch glimpses of an ornate hall beh\u2014 you catch yourself before you engage in unabashed admiration of your hated, company foe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverything is <i>fake</i>. Everything was probably made on the backs of unpaid workers, and used by the debaucherous elite to engage in their basal urges; you just happen to be caught up in the teeth of its grinding, corporate gears. You <i>mustn't</i> enjoy yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour half-stagger towards a nearby foodstand run by a perky, spike-eared youth is simply to grease the wheels of rebellion, nothing more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter receiving the fare with a quick, wrist-tablet transaction \u2014 wow, it really <i>can</i> do it all \u2014 you nibble your hunk of cheap, leafwrapped cornbread while walking about the theme park\u2019s district. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe elvish folk seems to be a race whose post-pubesence turns you into slim, androgynous figures that flash maddeningly secret smiles at Guests no matter <i>what</i> you decide to do. At least you can catch glimpses of leg and toned midriff through their gauzy clothes, though you\u2019re not quite sure if it\u2019s a guy or a girl that you\u2019re ogling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Of course, there\u2019s a few Guests \u2014 or lucky employees \u2014 who have locked themselves into intimate, handsy embraces with the adult fey-folk, and <i>once</i>, you hear a warbling moan from a member of the fantastical race, but you can find no more signs of emotion out of the figures; save for the obligatory smug, ageless smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe \u2018younger\u2019 elves are more your speed. Bright, bubbly, and filled with some kind of naive curiosity towards \u2018mayflies\u2019 \u2014 the somewhat insulting nickname given to the mortal races. The food vendor you chatted up wasn\u2019t <i>actually</i> fifty, you were pretty sure, she certainly was experienced in acting, with the way she cooed and her put a sparkle in her bright eyes as you stammered an (error-ridden) explanation of how waterwheels worked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou\u2019ve been sat on a grassy knoll for a bit, finishing off your food\u2019s wrapping \u2014 the leaf was made of fondant! \u2014 when you remember the pressing issue you must address. Prodding a sticky finger into your tablet computer, you bring up the \u2018MEET THE PRINCESS\u2019 quest. Frustratingly, no flavor text accompanies, though a \u2018TRACK QUEST\u2019 button is nestled neatly in the corner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stab it, expecting some costumed actor to appear out of a nearby trapdoor\u2026 not the brief but intense migraine that accompanies the <i>bloop</i>. After the few seconds of pain, you open your eyes to a small illuminated line on the ground. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt shimmers and waves as you stare at it, like a mirage or luminescent floater, but you can see, out of the corner of your eye, the path leading into the large plaster tree on the horizon. You follow the path at a crooked gait, trying to balance not looking directly at the image with actually <i>following</i> it, all the while considering that this is a <i>massive</i> violation of your body, an event that you <i>specifically</i> wanted to avoid \u2014<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen a shrill, feminine scream echoes from the tree\u2019s arched halls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour heart hammers. A sound <i>that</i> high, and <i>that</i> wheedling\u2026 it can only be the Princess. You summon every last bit of your <i>12 Ardor</i> to proceed forward bravely, despite your lack of any means to thwart any kidnapping attempt. What could you do with a measly <i>7 Power</i> and two cups of water?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stride forward nonetheless. Your <i>11 Cognition</i> will find you a way out of this, somehow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrouched over in a half-skulk, you sneak to the first step\u2026 only for the wind to be, quite quickly and completely, taken out of your sails.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn top of a steep, velvet-lined staircase a tall, flaxen-haired figure in elaborate, gold-lined clothes is dabbing at the face of a shorter, but <i>much</i> more eye-catching figure with a handkerchief. The diminutive one is squirming in an attempt to escape the shoulder-grip of her taller captor, pointy ears flattened against her head \u2014 all the while hurling out squeaky curses that you\u2019re one-<i>hundred</i> percent sure aren\u2019t Wondertainment-friendly \u2014 but to no avail, either her captor is too strong, or she\u2019s simply too weak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour breath hitches in your chest for a second, and the taller one takes notice of the noise, ceasing her unwanted ministrations and drawing the shorter one\u2019s attention towards you with a gentle wave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe taller, androgynous figure gently plucks a golden circlet off of the other\u2019s head, placing it gently on a nearby velvet pillow, but she doesn\u2019t seem to notice her new lack of headgear. She doesn\u2019t seem to notice much else besides <b>you</b>, and you\u2019re reciprocating her rapt attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe holographic line is swirling around her feet, but you don\u2019t need it to know who she is. You\u2019ve seen her in glimpses of old taped episodes and on the plane: Princess Allaria, in the flesh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The rounded, smooth, bared-in-manifold-places, flesh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer outfit plays a dangerous game between the borders of \u2018poofy\u2019 and \u2018exposing\u2019, with a shoulder-baring neckline that hugs the outer swell of her sizable breasts, a corset as pink as the rest of her dress hugging her waspish waist before blooming out into a short bustle that pulls double duty in exaggerating her already-wide hips while putting the shapely, soft ivory pillars she has in the stead of thighs on display. The most amount of coverage she has is her knee-high heeled boots and a pair of long, white opera gloves \u2014 and even the latter stops at the base of her fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, swayingly, as if upon an ersatz, inclined catwalk, she starts to descend the stairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou moisten your dry lips with your tongue. Shit. Did you brush your teeth before getting on the plane? Put your deodorant on? Maybe she caught you staring at her tits, fuck. Dad always said\u2014<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then the thing that you <i>definitely should have</i> remembered hits you. If mischievous WonderWorldian jesters were to be believed, that was your <i>dad</i> mincing towards you. You squint at her cherubic face. Is there makeup? A mask? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA terrifying prospect crosses your mind. Could the same holographic-pathmaker put an alluring fey veil over your paunchy dad? Is that damned <i>perpetually-smirking</i> elf up there simply watching the most awkward family reunion, with dad\u2019s hairy belly poking out of his lace-and-taffeta costume?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blink away your waking nightmare to focus on reality. Allaria is moving faster. She \u2014 or he, is taking two or more steps at a time, imbuing her impressive bust with mesmerizing motion\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShit, she definitely caught you staring there. Her wide blue eyes sparkle with an emotion you can\u2019t identify as her lips curl into a\u2026 snarl? smile? You can\u2019t especially tell, the princess\u2019s <b>or your dad\u2019s holographic</b> face saturates every expression with ingenuesque-but-still-alluring innocence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nActually, now that you look at it, the princess is pretty close. And <i>wait</i> she\u2019s jumping!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n <i>right at <b>you.</b></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou raise your arms half to catch her and half to shield yourself as the heir apparent hits you <i>hard</i>, sending the both of you sprawling onto the ground, with twin <i>oof</i>s.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou struggle to breathe, both from the force of the impact, and from the sheer, soft <i>weight</i> on your diaphragm. As you blink the stars from your eyes, you lean up as best you can and push at random and your hand finds purchase on an area that\u2019s oddly soft, warm, and <i>round</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe princess tumbles off you with a squawk as you stare at your hand.

Sure, it was in the panic of asphyxiation, but it <i>definitely</i> still counts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe princess, however, does not seem to echo your joyful sentiment.

With feet wide and planted, her stance looks ready for a fight, as if she's intends to body barge herself into you once again, yet her hips are angled coquettishly, emphasizing the graceful arch of her lower back and thrusting her bustled backside into the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer fists, while clenched tightly for a fight, seem to drift away from in front of her to rest atop her hips, changing her posture from one of open conflict to a girl huffily admonishing a boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had drawn herself up to her full, modest height, yet some part of her evidently wishes to bring her to lower and more immodest - it is as though some elastic tension in her spine is pulling her forward, angling her so the spectacular swell of her bountiful breasts are always presented front and center.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a sudden awareness of her stance slipping towards something sensuous, she tries to consciously amend it. Her legs begin to tremble and wobble like a person on stilts, and she looks immediately unsteady and out-of-place within her knee high boots, perched precariously atop her 3 inch heels, where before she had sprinted at you with no difficulty. Evidently her subconscious has a better handle on certain things than she did herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer face is the greatest display of conflict, once you look past the immaculate beauty of it. Her lips are held in a sweet, welcoming smile, which only occasionally twitches at the edges into a scowl that is not matched by the rest of the face - the mask, the facade... It occurs to you that, just like the cheap t-shirts and the branded children's lunchboxes, she is a product of the park, a model of it in miniature - a sweet and welcoming surface veneer that conceals the ugliness underneath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly the eyes do not lie. Transfigured into sapphire limpid pools they may be, but the hate in them is too much to conceal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don't know what to say. Staring at her, a vision in soft, pink lace and soft, pink flesh, it is hard to believe that she is real. In appearance, in pose, and especially in proportions, there is captured a lot of her cartoon incarnation, particularly in the way her curves seem to deny gravity. It is as though she has been plucked straight from the pages of a larger-than-life fantasy novel, or a dream...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you speak?\" you stammer, hoping that she might break the awkwardness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fire in the eyes flares but the tone - if perhaps not the words- that emerge from the lips are honey sweet, \"of course I can speak, hero.\" She hesitates after hearing the last word, raising her hand to her slender throat, before continuing. \"Didst thou think they took my tongue, as well as my manho- manners, my lord?\" She shakes her head, curls shifting like molten gold. \"Nay. Though they took the rest of me, my tongue is still <i>very</i> much intact, hero.\" That last line is spoken like a promise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow,\" you gasp. You become aware of your hand, the fingers of which are still partially curled as if still holding on to the memory of the orb of pliant flesh that you can still feel pressed against your palm. \"It's hard to believe you're really real.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I have you to thank for that,\" the voice coos, while the eyes glower. \"It is because of you that I stand before you now. Was it not by your wish and your will that I was brought into being?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose you could say that.\" You try to hide your smirk. \"It wasn't my fault, that damn jester was trying to hurry me. You - ...Princess Allaria - was the only character I knew.\" Your eyes do a full circuit of her from head to toes. \"But I never believed that <i>this</i> would be possible.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tiptoes forward. Her mind elsewhere, her mastery of the heels has returned. She thrusts her face up close to yours. With those furious sparkling eyes so close to yours, you read it as an aggressive move, invading your space to get your attention. Moving just an inch back to take in the entire view makes it seem so much more flirtatious, her ruby lips so close to yours. \"If thou didst not believe it, then why didst thou do it?\" she asks, finishing with a coy giggle. \"Nothing is beyond the reach of the Gods. Methinks my knight simply acted first without consulting me. How <i>dashing</i>.\" She eyes glower at the emergence of the word 'dashing'. She tries again. \"How <i>daring</i>.\" She bites her lip, sparkling tears welling in the corner of her eyes as she focuses her entire will into controlling her word choices. \"How <i>bold</i>!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere is a sharp crack of heel against stone as she stamps her foot in anger. She steps back, pacing in agitating. Though her face remains serene, it is obviously she is fretting, her hand constantly reaching to her throat, massaging at the smooth spot where her adam's apple might have been a few moments before. Her other hand is clasped over her mouth, terrified of what words might emerge if she opens it again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is everything okay?\" Seeing her in distress like this, you take a step nearer, wanting to help her, comfort her, physically console her. At the last moment, you stop yourself. <i>Think of the hairy paunch. Think of the male-pattern baldness, the dandruff.</i> \"Is it... is it really you in there, dad?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why, who else would it be in me... but me?\" she titters flirtatiously, eyelashes fluttering. You swallow hard, morning wood returning with a vengeance, despite it being the afternoon. \"Yes, it is me. Your fa-... your faaiance.\" She curses abruptly - at least you assume it to be a curse word, the word and pronunciation sound distinctly foreign and 'elvish'. \"My humblest apologies, Sir Knight. It seems when I am around you I... I cannot control myself.\" A crimson blush flushes into existence on her cheeks in a second. \"The winds of Fate doth guide my actions and my words. Tellst me, master, is this how thy wished to have me? Aren't thou not happy with thy work?\"</span></div></div>",

The \u201cWow\u2026\u201d that escapes your lips is almost unintentional.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe whirls around at your remark, flush still burning red on her lips before evidently thinking better of saying anything. With her nose in the air, she turns her back to you, the quick motion whipping her bustled skirt up a bit, flashing bleached-white panties across a smooth, flat crotch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThou mayst look, but thy hands would be better suited far hence,\u201d she huffs over her shoulder. A small smile asserts itself on her face; porn-y as the statement may be, it\u2019s probably the most venom she\u2019s managed to muster. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cuntilourweddingnight,\u201d bursts from her mouth in one uninterrupted breath, and judging by the way her shoulders tense, it was <b>not</b> intentional.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs this the, uh, Roleplay Aid-thing?\u201d you ask, edging closer towards her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe leaps away from you as if struck, surprisingly nimble on the tall heels. \u201cMayhaps,\u201d she coos, \u201cT\u2019would make much sense; one so starv\u2019d for a woman\u2019s touch would form a maid so\u2026 tractable. \u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe smile on her face is bold, bright, and uninterrupted by any affectionate subversions. Apparently, she\u2019s found a way to rail at you: indirectly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour face is still coloured red as she pumps her fist at the minor victory. Sure, it <i>might</i> be true, but it wasn\u2019t the <i>reason why</i> \u2014<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn idea sneaks its way into your head and you stiffen your arms to your sides, snapping your legs together shortly thereafter. You let out a (fake) yelp of surprise, and the Princess\u2019 blue eyes flit to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat mischief are you up to, Sir?\u201d she asks, eyes narrowed in suspicion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTime to meet fire with fire. \u201cOh, \u2018tis a wicked enchantment!\u201d She squints harder at you, moving oh-so-closer. \u201cI cannot\u2026 moveth! The work of a great, malevolent enchanter, I am sure!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gasps, a high, dramatic intake of breath, and all traces of suspicion vanish from her body, only to be replaced with sheer panic. She cocks her elbows limply to bring her forearms to either side of her overburdened chest, her wrists drawing tight circles of feminine alarm. You maybe catch a glint of skepticism deep in her sky-blue eyes, but it\u2019s minimized to the point of insignificance by the way in which she flits side to side, looking for someone else to help. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAn abjurer! Someone, <i>please</i>, hail an abjurer!\u201d she cries, and you once again notice the tall figure at the top of the stairs. They make no moves towards the two of you, however, and instead choose to walk further, their white-gold hair disappearing from view.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo matter. This wasn\u2019t really a spectator\u2019s show.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThey cannot help us, fair maid. Th\u2026 the hex is centered around my di\u2014 my <i>manhood</i>. Only the touch of royalty may free me...\u201d You fake a groan of dramatic pain and immediately suspect you\u2019ve overdone it, but the body-wracking gasp of the princess dispels such doubts. \u201c... before \u2018tis too late!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe meets your eyes, and her maidenly panic is transformed into a mask of grim resolution. Or, as grim as she can make it; a girlishly determined furrowed-eyebrow pout. The wobbling breadth of her chest still laboriously heaves with every breath, though. You\u2019re not quite sure whether it\u2019s the hidden panic; the pampered, kept nature of Allaria; or, underneath it all , the pulmonary system of a relatively inactive forty-six-year-old man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerhaps it\u2019s all three: the lush curves of the Princess don\u2019t <i>feel</i> like simple water-weight after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAllaria presses herself closer to you than necessary, the twin softnesses of her bosom pressing against your ribcage. Your body, and\u2026 lower areas stiffen with more than a hex of paralysis at the contact, and you thank your foresight in choosing not to wear sweatpants this morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, languorously, the princess sinks to her knees, tracing your body from back to buttocks with her dainty hands, and dragging her soft bosom across your clothes down to your thighs before leaning forward, giving you a clear view of her pale cleavage and a pair of pink, pebbled flesh of her areolae \u2014 the fit of her dress clearly wasn\u2019t designed to be dragged on denim. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer hands assiduously roam towards the front of your pants, and, besides being impressed with how she\u2019s able to support her topheavy half with core and middle-aged spine alone, a sudden sense of doubt overcomes you. A nervous chuckle escapes your lips. This was, uh, maybe a little too far. She brushes her fingers across your leather belt, shooting it a confused gaze as if it\u2019s some sort of alien device, but still manages to undo it with alacrity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTh-that\u2019s f-far enough,\u201d you stammer, but the princess ignores you, having better luck with the tack button.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCease thine t-tomfoolery, maid!\u201d you command in your deepest register. The princess, instead of listening, experiments with your zipper, face lighting up with joy when the fastener yields to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhether it\u2019s your <i>Ardor 12</i> or the mental image of having your Dad\u2019s chapped lips wrapped around your shaft, you muster up the willpower to tumble backwards, out of the Princess\u2019 grip. Still, though, she advances on all fours, blue eyes gleaming with some predatory instinct, reaching for your now-exposed boxer briefs...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDesperate, you look at your hands in mock-wonder. \u201cOh, forsooth!\u201d you exclaim. \u201cMine body hast been, er, freedeth from the wicked hex!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stare, red-faced and wide-eyed at the princess, who has frozen mid-crawl, as if her string had been cut. The determination, panic, whatever is replaced with a blank mask of incomprehension. <br>\r\nShe looks at you. <br>\r\nHer outstretched hand. <br>\r\nHer outstretched hand currently wrapped around the hem of your underwear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with a short squeal, she surges to her feet, thankfully not exposing you in her haste. The one arm she had used to grasp your clothing is shaken desperately as if unclean; and the other smooshes her tits into their proper, nipple-concealing place in her dress, before the thin limb snaps to try (and fail) to cover the vast expanse of cleavage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<i><b>Oh you\u2019re</b></i>\u201d she starts, voice and face jagged with rage \u201csafe, dear knight.\u201d she finishes, her tone and visage now soft with relief. A fist clenches. \u201c<i><b>I\u2019m going to</b></i> thank the gods for their timely intervention!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHands curl in the puffed-up skirt of her bustle and tears once again sparkle at the edge of her eyes. You hastily pull up your pants and stumble to your feet, but the Princess doesn\u2019t seem to notice. Her eyes are scrunched up in focus and her full lips are moving at a rapid rate; you can barely catch a muttered \u2018knight\u2019, \u2018prince\u2019, and \u2018hero\u2019, each followed by a quick Elvish curse. She appears to be attempting to break the buxom, winsome mold she\u2019s found herself in, and the sight \u2014 and her evident failure \u2014 is simply pitiable. After one attempted word is converted to \u2018love\u2019, she lets out a choked gasp of horror and gives up on the exercise entirely, instead choosing to stomp at the ground petulantly with a white-heeled boot, her soft arms bapping at invisible foes. You think you spy a few tears escaping her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou\u2019d mention that she\u2019s not making a mark on the stone, but you don\u2019t want to make things worse.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nYou approach her before you think, gently placing a hand on her head in a manner that you <i>hope</i> is comforting. \u201cThere, there,\u201d you murmur. The princess lets out an angry grunt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the sake of your curiosity, you stretch a thumb down to one long ear, circling your thumb over the cartilage. The effect is startling \u2014 after Allaria\u2019s momentary squark of protest. Slowly, the tensed muscles of her face relax, then her fists, then her hostile body language. A hand slowly traces up her leg, hiking up her bustle a tetch before it lazily snakes to your shoulder, draping all of her slight weight against your torso.. Her already-arched feet lift the short distance that they are still able to nuzzle her head into your hand, a low \u2018mmm\u2019 escaping her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA small <i>bleep</i> sounds from your arm as you abruptly stop your ear massage. This was <i>way</i> too weird. You were fairly certain that <i>ears</i> weren\u2019t erogenous zones, and you\u2019d never heard of anyone you could turn on by stammering bastardized <i>Old English</i>. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou vow to forget this <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">for now</span> and hope that she does too. It\u2019d be best to just play dumb \u2014 maybe she\u2019d be too blissed out to remember.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou fiddle with your wrist-tablet as the Princess groggily stirs herself to the cognizant world. You\u2019ve earned a level advancement, apparently. The lion\u2019s share of the XP that brought you there is not from completing your quest, but for a \u2018Roleplaying Bonus\u2019. <i>That\u2019s in poor taste.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2026 happened, dearest?\u201d murmurs the princess, only affording the term of endearment a brief scowl. She rubs the bridge of her nose lightly, straightening her posture whenever a traitorous hip threatened to cock itself outwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, absolutely nothing,\u201d you burble innocently. \u201cYou were just\u2026 telling me about this tree\u2014 this castl\u2014 this tree-castle\u2019s architecture!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI.. was?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMhm! It was <i>fascinating</i>,\u201d You turn away feign intense study of a nearby pillar. You\u2019re not sure whether she remembers the ear-debacle, and you hope against hope that she doesn\u2019t recall the made-up malediction, but it\u2019s best not to press. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou decide to distract the befuddled princess with...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Even as she gets within a few feet of it, she recoils slightly, as if deflected. You notice her slender wrist is bare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You didn't get one of these?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer lips are pursed, but she shakes her head emphatically. You can tell she is fascinated - after all, tabletop games are totally his jam, and this is definitely in that territory - but something is stopping her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, shutting her eyes tight, she steps close to your elbow, entwining her arms around your raised forearm and resting her chin within the crook of your elbow. She reopens her eyes, looking at the wrist-tablet out of the corner of her vision. Her ears are long and slender, and twitch like those of a curious animal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Any advice?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe extends a hand towards the device, only to recoil from it as if touching a hot plate. \"Such things are beyond me, champion,\" she coos.  \"Only a hero may use the Tablet of Fate.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh, fine. Guess you're more part of the scenery that a player character.\" The petulant huff from her nostrils tickles the hair of your forearm at your comment.

You're grateful to have dad close at hand as obscure things like '<i>Eldritch Adept</i>' and '<i>Lingering Performance</i>' scroll past.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe <i>Followers</i> menu is much more interesting.<i> -- Two Followers added to your stable --<br>\r\n-- Horse [Mount] (Inactive) --<br>\r\n-- Princess Allaria Seraphina [Level 1 Tender] (Active) --<br>\r\n-- Advancements may be spent to upgrade Followers --</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"By Azura, by Azura, by Azura,\" you quote, laughing. \"My very own Adoring Fan. So you're...Tender?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A Tender is an Elven title, hero, given to those whom commit themselves to tending to nature. They art adept in the healing arts, as well as possessing knowledge of the natural world. As they develop, they can even channel the spirits of animals.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So like a cleric? A healer?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe squeezes your arm, staring up at you wide those wide, beautiful eyes brimming with concern. \"Art thou injured, hero? Doth thou need my Tender touch? Tell me where it hurts so that I might see to it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou swallow hard. That certainly explains her reaction to your 'hex' earlier. She's your healer now, essentially little more than an NPC buddy whose only function is to follow you around and heal you up any time you get hurt. How that works, exactly, you're not sure. Certainly you can see no room for a first aid kit within that corset, filled to the brim as it is already.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreat for you. Kinda sucky for him. \"Is that all you can do? I doubt you expected your vacation to be looking after my cuts and bruises.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe heaves a forlorn sigh upon your elbow. \"Thy speaketh truthfully.

It seems fitting revenge for all the pre-built characters you\u2019d been frogmarched into playing in place of his absent group members \u2014 and with his attitude, he <i>hemorraged</i> players \u2014 and you can hardly imagine the Princess\u2019 waifish arms lifting a sword. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA brief flick through her stats seem to agree with you. Seraphina possesses a piddling 3 <i>Power</i>, a measly 4 <i>Finesse</i>, and a so-so 9 <i>Cognition</i>. After that, they really start to pick up: Her <i>Divinity</i> is an is a staggering 14, her Arcanum a respectable <i>10</i>, and her <i>Ardor</i> rounding it \u2014 and her, you surmise from a sneaking a peek at her lush curves \u2014 out at with 16 points. Her <i>Luck</i> is goose-egg, though: 0, worse than yours, and looking at how everything shook out, you deem it an accurate assessment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe investment you made seems to have given her a one-point boost in both <i>Ardor</i> and <i>Divinity</i>, raising them to their towering heights, and it comes with a few new abilities.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt says you have, um, \u2018Commune with Animals,\u2019 now.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA high titter of effeminate glee escapes her lips, which curl themselves into a mischievous grin. \u201cTruly? I should love to hearken to the steeds in the stable: they surely hath <i>won</i>derful things to say!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou aim a side-eye at the princess, and after seeing no sign of hidden hate or resentment in her grin, continue browsing. Ungulate-gossip aside, talking to animals <i>was</i> kinda cool. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou also got\u2026\u201d You trail off as your eyes flicker over the longer ability-names. \u2018Kiss of Truth\u2019? \u2018Healing Embrace\u2019? Even \u2018Inspire Growth\u2019 sounds similarly lewd, though a quick peek at the description reveals that it only applies to plants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou moisten your suddenly-dry lips and stammer, \u201cUh, Minor Restoration and, D-dispel Poison.\u201d It seemed better not to inform Dad as to his\u2026 intimate methods of aid. Elf culture seemed to be sex-adjacent, if not sex-obsessed. Was this expanded universe content, or just a Wondertainment flair, to help appeal to visitors of the fey kingdom?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBetter not to ask. Dad seems to have pretty much bought your fiction, and instead has chosen to kill time with trying to start a dialogue to a caterpillar on the floor, wiggling her sculpted eyebrows like mad and exaggerating every word with dramatic gestures that do beautiful things to her cavernous cleavage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou imagine that she can only communicate with Wonder-brand animatronic beasts, but the display is cute enough to deter you from bursting her enthusiastic bubble. You turn your back to her and surreptitiously scroll through the follower menu. There aren\u2019t any sneak-previews to future \u2018Tender\u2019 abilities, but there is a \u2018TACTICS\u2019 tab, to organize a group\u2019s strategy or force a specific ability from a delinquent follower. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour brief peek into party management is interrupted by a melodramatic huff behind you, and a tug on the hem of your shirt. A turn reveals the princess far closer to you than expected, her topheavy form practically vibrating with excitement. \u201cWe simply <i>must</i> go to the stables; I\u2019m afraid Sir Morton isn\u2019t much for conversation,\u201d She waves a forlorn hand at the fuzzy worm from before, who is now inching up a marble wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smirk. Dad made a point of smashing any bug that entered his field of view, and he <i>certainly</i> didn\u2019t name any of the smears afterwards. You\u2019re not sure whether his new sense of mercy is spurred by the sheer excitement of magical ability, or if Seraphina is guiding him more than he\u2019s realized.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright,\u201d you say indulgently, just refraining from ruffling the Princess\u2019 hair. \u201cLet\u2019s hear it from the horses\u2019 mouth.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gives a brief frown at the bad joke, but her ensuing bright smile is otherwise unmarred by negativity as she pulls you by the hand farther into the castle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr rather, she attempts to pull you, and you obediently hurry forward: her 3 <i>Power</i> isn\u2019t much to work with, after all.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Seraphina runs through the corridors of the castle, down spiralling staircases, tugging you along behind her. Her skirt is demurely hiked up to allow her legs to sprint, and you can't help but admire the skill with which she navigates the twists and turns in those heels without breaking an ankle. Arriving at an intersection, she pivots balletically on a heel as she takes a hard right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wasn't even out of breath, nor sweating (although you doubt if Wondertainment-brand princesses ever sweat). Dad would have been bent double and gasping by now. Either they seriously boosted his cardio when they did... whatever it is they did, or it is just the removal of half of his body weight that has really taken a load off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do you know where you're going?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can hear them!\" she cries back giddily. She hops and skips down another flight of stairs to a lower floor, dances past an elven scullery maid, and turns a corner into the stables. Screeching to a surprise halt with a gasp of delight, you bump hard into the back of her, only the shock-absorbing properties of the bustle and her luscious backside stopping her from being propelled forward into the mounds of fresh hay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo dozen horses stand to attention within their stalls along each wall. Halfway down the stable, you catch sight of a slim elven girl jumping up from a bail of hay. She seeks around for anywhere to stash the immersion-breaking smartphone she was just playing on, settles on quickly stuffing it down her cleavage, before grabbing a horse brush from the wall and darting into one of the stalls. You catch sight of her peeking nervously over the top of one of the horses at the two of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeraphina hasn't noticed. She is standing ramrod straight, her eyes closed in an expression of rapture and her hands held either side of her head as if she's Professor Xavier. \"So many voices... I can hear them all!\" she cries in delight. She dashes to the closest horse, throwing her slender arms about its neck and resting her head against its fur. \"This one... his name is... Heartblossom...\" She plants a gentle kiss on his snout. \"I hear you, Heartblossom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn that moment, she looks the very image of a Wonder\u2122 Princess. <i>Oh God, if she's going to start singing about Colours of the Wind or Circles of Life, I'm out.</i> She moves to the next horse along, eagerly naming that one Silverlight, stroking her hands over its fine grey coat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wonder what part of her is in control right now. There is little of the inner turmoil evident in this moment - perhaps dad's love of medieval fantasy roleplay and whatever force puppeteers her have found a common ground. She seems genuinely delighted to be imagining herself able to hear the voices or thoughts of these beasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf beasts they are...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis place looks like a stable. But it doesn't smell like one. Sure, it has the smell of fresh hay, yet what stable ever smells <i>fresh</i>? The golden hay piled high about your feet doesn't show the slightest touch of manure, and the air lacks a certain horsey tang of sweat and animal urine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile the horses <i>look</i> real - no visible metal joints at least - it occurs to you that none of the stalls are closed, and the horses are completely untethered, but they don't run. They could be medicated, of course. They could be animatronics. Or they could be controlled by the same guiding force that has dad under its spell. Certainly if they can control a man to talk and act in such a way, making an animal stand to attention must be child's play. As you watch Seraphina continue to frollick about the horses, a disquieted shudder runs down your spine at the thought of the power wielded by this corporation. The power to control bodies and minds, power never meant for mortal men, let alone money-grubbing corporate executives.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething <i>has</i> to be done about this. When you're back at school, you swear to make your next presentation a scathing diatribe about this holiday. You wonder if they'll let you use dad as show-and-tell... You're sure your male friends would like that...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>You're not taking him home, let's nip that one in the bud right now.</i> Can you imagine getting him past passport control looking like this? Or what your mom would say if he came back in feminine frocks and frills. This is only temporary, and in just a few days he'll be back to his normal, flabby, middle-aged self, and you'll both be left to deal with the horrible, awkward fallout of it all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><font class=\"size2\" style=\"\">-so might as well make the most of it while you can-</font></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nDirecting your curiosity back to the horses, you step closer to the nearest - Heartblossom she'd called it. It doesn't react to your presence beyonf a small turn of the head. Running your fingers through the coat, the fur certainly feels real. The muscle underneath is suitable flesh-y. If it <i>is </i> indeed animatronic, it is at least real horse hide stretched over a metal skeleton.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only thing of note is a small plastic stud hidden behind one ear. Squinting closer, in tiny letters there is a name - <i>Heartblossom</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh. I'll be danged. Maybe she <i>can</i> speak to the animals,\" you ponder aloud. Or she has the knowledge of the animal's names burned into her brain, the same way she seems to know the layout of the castle or how to walk in heels. There is perhaps one way to find out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grab the horses' ear and give it a sharp tug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!\" Seraphina marches towards you, a displeased sulk on her face. She draws herself up to her lackluster height and jabs you in the center of the chest with an accusatory finger. \"You bully!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me?\" you ask innocent, overtly delighted at this adorable display of intimidation. \"What I do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yon gentle steed says you nearly pulled his ear off!\" She moved to soothe the horse with strokes and sweet words, while you can just gawp.</span></div></div>",

For the sake of your own pillar, this one serves to take your gaze and your mind away from <i>her</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pillar in question is one of five made of stone-patterned concrete, etched with \"ancient\" cracks and vines, that rise up through the center of the great tree. Swirling symbols glow dimly from within, flowing up in a steady stream from the base of the pillars to the ceiling, where the stone-patterned concrete meets the wood-patterned concrete of the tree. For all its effect, it is the same technology on your Christmas tree at home - thousands of embedded, computer-controlled optical fibres creating the illusion of shifting Elven script. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's, uh, really neat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They art the Pillars of Pen-hadar,\" Allaria intones. \"The Pillars of Neverwinter. T'is said that they draw warmth from the deeps of the world, such that this place - The Glade of Springborn - shalt ne'er feel the bite of even darkest winter. For ist in this place that live survives, and from this place that life ist renewed at the turn of the winter solstice. Without yon Pillar to protect us, this forest and all beyond, would fall forever into darkness.\" The Princess is staring up at the Pillar with rapt reverence on her face but as the spiel ends, she turns her gaze sharply to you. \"Mayhaps if thou had paid more attention to thine lore, I wouldst not be in this situation?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And maybe if <i>you </i>hadn't left me with a bloody dancing goon to go have a piss for fifteen minutes, I wouldn't have had to be the one making the decision.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thou hardly appear dismayed about, my lord,\" she croons sweetly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou roll your eyes. \"Ughh, okay, dad, I <i>get</i> it, you're not a hundred percent happy about how this vacation is turning out. If you're going to spend the entire time being passive aggressive about everything then-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aggressive? Me? I wouldst <i>never</i> raise a sword, hero,\" she gasps in faux outrage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I said <i>passive</i> aggressive. Don't tell me Allaria doesn't know what <i>passive</i> means.\" Perhaps another stroke of her ear would remind her. \"You keep making all these snide, glib remarks like you think I won't notice. God, you haven't changed <i>at all</i>, have you?\" you snap, years of repressed frustration springing out. You're aware of the absurdity of the last remark as you speak it to a 46-year old man poured into the shape of a nubile fey maiden. \"Yeah, I know you're pissed off. But I also know you can't say that to me directly. So why don't you just get over it, or I'll just start ignoring all the undertones of what you say, and just focus on the <i>overtones</i>, Seraphina.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudging by the eyes, she doesn't like that at all. The thought of you willfully ignoring the soul silently screaming from within to treat her as the two-dimensional behavioural programming she finds herself trapped in must fill her with terror. With a deep inhalation, you add, \"look, I'm sorry, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe musters the cutest little pout you've ever seen. \"Tis easy to be gallant, when thou art the victor.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All I'm saying is, let's just let bygones be bygones. <i>And speaking of bygones</i>,\" you segway seamlessly. \"-tell me more about this pillar.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the time being at least, that settles things. It isn't entirely clear if it is dad or Princess Seraphina exuberantly launching into a description of the history of the Pillars of Pen-hadar. Needless to say, he has been trying to tell you this lore for years, but <i>she</i> is far more easier on the ear and the eye. While you think he is the one with the knowledge, her actions are more suspect - her small hand slips into yours as she guides you from pillar to pillar, her free hand gliding over several of the shifting symbols as she describes their meaning. To both of your delights, her Elvish is quite fluent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt great length, you are taught of the carving of the Pillars ten thousand years ago by the great hero Pen-hadar from the stone of Mount Tal-sharada during the Age of Winterdeep, when the entire world was covered in ice. With his tremendous strength, the hero had driven the pillars deep into the molten core of the planet, filling the world with warmth and new life. Each year, at the winter solstice, the enchantments that maintained the pillars had to be renewed through a ceremony or else spring would never come.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was deeper lore than the cartoon had ever implied. Perhaps added in the expanded universe novel and comic that had come after, although you'd heard Wondertainment had stricken all those from canon recently in preparation for creating their own sequel. \"Huh. I never knew the elves were so fleshed out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you'll find I'm <i>quite</i> fleshed out, hero,\" Princess Allaria purrs, intertwining her arm further with yours so that your upper arm is pressed against her delectably soft breast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um... so this ceremony- what does that consist of?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe lowers her gaze coyly and blushes deeply. \"Tis a ceremony to bring new life to a dying world -how else does one create new life?\" She gestures around at the circle of pillars, the center of which you now stand. \"The pillars are the masculine - hard, potent, unyielding, rising up to penetrate the feminine - the Great Mother Tree, Womb of the World, bringer of life. Through their coupling, life is renewed.\" She twists to face you, such that your arm is now fully encased between her two succulent breasts. She inclines her head towards the stone at your feet, where a slight divot a centimetre deep and about the length of a person has seemingly been worn, as if be great age and use. \"The Ceremony is a simple affair. One man. The pillar. One woman. The vessel. As the man fills the vessel with new life, so do the Pillars unto the world.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can barely focus on her words, lost as you are in those beautiful, blue, angry eyes.</span></div></div>",

Or rather, the plaster-and-plastic divot that underpaid laborers carefully set into the mold and <i>WOW</i> was it hard to think with your forearm encased in fey tit. \u201cGood thing it\u2019s not midwinter, huh?\u201d you joke as you carefully \u2014 with a hint of regret \u2014 pry your arm from its pillowy prison. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe princess lets your arm go with only a stray hand outstretched towards longingly, that the other, more sensible hand, forces down. She nods gratefully at your jab, though. You turn once again to the divot. Are those <i>stains</i> there?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou are sadly mistaken, my dearest,\u201d sounds from behind. You whirl around to the Princess, whose eyes are wide with panic, her tiny hands covering her mouth as if it\u2019s betrayed her, which for all intents and purposes, it <b>has</b>. Though muffled, her mouth keeps moving. \u201cIt is \u2014\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe middle of <b><i>JULY</i></b>,\u201d you finish for her, firmly gripping either side of her slight shoulders, stopping just shy of shaking her. \u201cI fu\u2014 I saw a lady with <i>heatstroke</i> at the concourse!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of her arms trembles from its protective position and makes its way to her forehead, her palm facing you and her fingers splayed dramatically. \u201cAy, \u2018tis a strange turn of events, to be true,\u201d she coos sadly, though betraying her calm tone of voice are her eyes rolling in their sockets like a spooked horse. \u201cWinterdeep follows no code or canon \u2014 th\u2019 cruel whims of nature are not bound by chivalrous code, unlike mine <i>brave</i> \u2014\u201d She steps towards you the small amount she is able, with a wide, languid, rolling gait that is <i>completely</i> unsuitable for effective movement \u2014 \u201c<b>strapping,</b> knight.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough her core is close enough for you to feel a constant, pulsing, heat, her torso appears to have other plans, her spine bending as far away from you as is biologically possible, the effort of such an odd position sending small quivers through her bountiful breasts. Her face further betrays the rest of her body, though the teeth teasing at her pink parted lips express a deep, carnal <b>need</b>; her pupils have contracted to the size of pinpricks, continuing their acrobatics routine around her sockets; and her ears are flattened firmly against the side of her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou too, are panicking, though far more openly than your marionette-stringed dad. Wonderworld Staff appeared to be <i>bastards</i> \u2014 though your experience at the airport should have clued you in to that fact. Was every technician behind the scene gunning for you to <i>shtup</i> your dad?! You\u2019re wryly reminded of some weird kids all the way back in elementary school, who mashed their dolls and your G.I. Joes together in a futile attempt to make them kiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure, you\u2019d be lying if you hadn\u2019t <i>thought</i> about it. On a purely objective, intellectual basis, she was just shy of perfect. And what red-blooded male couldn\u2019t imagine taking the Princess in their arms, ripping the small wisps of cloth she had in place off her luscious body, and taking her right here and now on the cold stone, using her long ears as handlebars as her legs, in turn, <i>are wrapped around you, locking you into <b>her, each thrust sending ripples through the ample swell of her royal rear as you make her y\u2014</b></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pinch your nose to bring you back to the real world. Man, <i>Cognition 11</i> was a bitch-and-a-half. Still, you had to do something: as long as Seraphina didn\u2019t speak any dreaded, canon-confirming words of or relating to this \u2018sex-to-stop-the-cold\u2019 nonsense, you could plausibly ignore this massive, dangling, plot-hook. Probably. Maybe the next trial you\u2019d have to be face would be soap-opera-y: the Princess would have a disease that you\u2019d have to <i>fuck</i> out of her an\u2014 <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWait. That\u2019s, uh, a pretty good idea. Save for the sex part. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThinking quick, you lean forward and raise a hand to the Princess\u2019 forehead. You draw it back just as quickly, shaking your hand as if it\u2019s been scalded. \u201cAlack!\u201d you cry. \u201cAlas!\u201d is added, for good measure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAllaria, for her part, is confused enough to stop resisting the inexorable demands of her character and curls her arms around you in a tight embrace,  the doughy flesh of her bust flattened tantalizingly against your torso. \u201cWherefore art thou concerned?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThy temperat\u2014 temp\u2019rature! I fear thee \u2014 thou \u2014 thy <font class=\"size2\" style=\"\">whatever</font> hast a fever!\u201d Behind her back, you flick through some pop-up notifications on your tablet and allocate a point into \u2018Power\u2019. Your limbs tingle, and you hope that 8 will be enough\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe princess extricates herself from you and leans against the pillar, legs wobbling in fear. \u201cOh! Now of all times, before the Ce\u2014\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<i>Yes</i>,\u201d you interrupt with a growl. \u201cBefore thy <i>Celebration</i>\u2026 of yon fiftieth Maidenhood Ball.\u201d That seemed to be the rocky years of pubescence for elves. \u201cTo cel\u2019brate a half-century \u2014 <i><b>AND MANYETH MORE</b></i> \u2014 of chastity.\u201d Hopefully those horndogs behind the scenes would take the <i>damn <b>hint</b></i>. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAllaria, though, seems to not take to this farce as well as she did the hex-one, her wide blue eyes shimmering with confusion as she staggers against the high-tech pillar. \u201cI hadst bethought\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou are <b>ill</b>, woman!\u201d you intone loudly, taking a step towards her. She quails at your exclamation, and your ceremonial tool twitches at the submission. \u201cThou art simply <i>drenched</i> in sweat!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looks at her bone-dry arms with even more confusion, but a quick finger-flexion of your right hand fixes up that cognitive dissonance right quick. Soon, the swell of her chest is glistening with tablet-generated liquid, and her clothes are flattened against her body and <i>wow</i> that bustle wasn\u2019t exaggerating much \u2014 <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeraphina Allaria, however, lets out a forlorn coo fit for one so gravely ill and her legs give way, her fecund form crumpling to the ground\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut not before you catch her, with new strength in your stick-thin arms. Apparently, <i>Power 8</i> was enough to carry the cut-up weight of your dad; you ascertain as you hoist her into your arms with only a modicum of effort. The princess, still conscious on some level, brushes a hand across your face dramatically, before once again slumping in your arms at the perfect angle to smoosh her sodden cleavage against your chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough you appreciate the cheesecake, you do <i>not</i> appreciate the way she\u2019s getting Wondertainment-brand Water all over your favorite travel-shirt. There are other benefits to carrying the royal burden, though: being able to run your hand over the smooth softness of her legs, staring at her positively a<b>dor</b>able sleeping expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMan, they really did a number on Dad, didn\u2019t they? Sleep apnea replaced with Sleeping Beauty, squat legs lengthened and pressed into gams that a model would <i>kill</i> for. It almost seems a waste\u2026 <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou spy someone down the hall in black and white garb \u2014 a servant, you presume, distracting you from your reverse-Oedipal thoughts. Hopefully, they were someone who could direct you to a place to dump the princess where she can disentangle herself from this constant <i>horniness</i> they\u2019ve written around her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe Princess ist <i>sick</i>!\u201d you bellow to them, louder than you expected. Maybe statting <i>Power</i> was a good idea after all. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey jump at your exclamation, hastily opening a door and waving you into it. Gratefully, you rush into it and find yourself in\u2026 <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You stumble forward over the thick, vibrantly pink shag carpet that comes to your ankles, nearly dropping your elven charge. You shift her weight against you and your grip, one hand slipping further down the smooth, soft thigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a bang and a click, the door is closed behind and locked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt is a bedroom - <i>her </i>\"royal\" chamber, judging by the way the drapes match the dress. Blinking against the dazzling effect, you search around for any scrap of blue or green or red, but find only hues of pink. Even the dressing table is made of some pink wood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>-- Area Unlocked! Princess Parlour! 1200 XP Granted! Double advancement attained! --</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sweet, I'm absolutely killing at this game,\" you mutter to her sleeping form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAllocating the advancements proves more a challenge with your hands otherwise engaged. You heft her higher, bending backwards slightly so that her upper body is draped over your left shoulder, the soft swell of her breasts pressing against your chest. To free one arm, you shift all her weight onto your left hand, cupping her spectacular buttocks. As pleasant as the sensation of her swollen, silky ass flesh contouring around your fingers is, the overall posture is rather uncomfortable. Your limbs are swiftly shaking from the exertion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith your free right hand, you part the fabric of her bustle to uncover the smart watch on your left wrist, quickly assigning the two new advancements to <i>Power</i>. There was that surge again emanating out from the wrist to innervate every muscle. Soon, the weight of the Princess becomes almost nothing. You cradle her easily with one arm, holding her against your chest with as little difficulty as one might a cat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour heart is thumping hard. You feel good. You feel <i>great</i>. Even carrying her, your steps feel lighter. It starts to dawn how loose and gangly your teenage limbs had been previously, as you move with strength and purpose to the magnificent (and pink) four-poster bed. <i>How high do these attributes go?</i> you wonder. <i>Is 10 an average score and 20 double that?</i> On the contrary, it rather feels as if each point assigned is boosting your strength exponentially.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's get you tucked into bed, huh?\" you say to her sweet, sleeping face currently passed out on your shoulder. Gently you lower her against the satin sheets...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>*flash* *flash* flash*<br>\r\n</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere is a rapid trio of dazzling bulb flashes from the head of the bed. Taken by surprise, your grip slips, sending the Princess tumbling onto the sheets and you atop her. Her legs part as if on impulse, knees up, and as your vision clears you find yourself between them, one hand on the sheets beside her head to steady yourself, the other hand resting on her left tit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>*click whiiiiir*</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nA square of black card is disgorged from a discreet slot set into the wall above the bedspread and flutters down to the sheets. At the top is written:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'WonderWorld: Making Wonderful Memories...<br>\r\nHappy Anniversary!<br>\r\nYour account has been debited $10'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt is a polaroid slowly fading in from black. You gawp at the candid image of dad spread out unconscious of the sheets beneath you, bare legs spread, the hem of his dress concealing yours and his crotches as you fall into him, fingers mangling his tender breast, eyes burning red and devilish in the flash.</span></div></div>",

Owned and operated by the eccentric but brilliant Walter Wonder, the company has as many business ventures as it has outstanding lawsuits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn an odd move around eight-or-so years ago, Walter (or Dr. Wonder, as he likes to be known) purchased the pharmaceutical company Meconstruction, a contender in the growing industry of automated plastic surgery. Investors and the public were puzzled at the new move, some postulating that they were pivoting away from entertainment altogether.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMostly though, it was forgotten and dismissed as one of Walter\u2019s insane pet projects. It was a massive surprise to all parties when the 23rd annual Wondercon was not centered around movie-promotion, but the opening of WonderWorld; \u2018The Theme Park of the Future, Today!\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe park boasted a variety of environments to immerse their guests in:<br>\r\nWonder-City, a sprawling metropolis populated by a plethora of caped heroes and spandex-clad villains;<br>\r\nWonder-Kingdom, a medieval land of sword and sorcery, its forests populated with mysterious elves, and rocky plains inhabited by savage monsters;<br>\r\nWonder-Academy, a venture into the vast amounts of intellectual property purchased from Japan, where improbably-colored hairstyles are the norm and the genre can change at the drop of a hat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Other boroughs are pending, of course.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe roar of mouth-frothing fans drowned out the announcement of the extraordinarily exorbitant pricetag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIncluded in the base package are three days in the Wonder-Place of your choice and a free body-resculpting to match the locals. Additionally, you are given a basic \u2018Plotline\u2019 to follow; a recently recruited hero for Wonder-City, a new adventurer for Wonder-Kingdom, a transfer student for Wonder-Academy, etc. etc. Packages have to be upgraded if you want to inhabit the role of an established character.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAny hanky-panky above PG-13 or violence beyond mild-roughhousing is strictly prohibited from both staff and guests \u2014 though one can bypass the former through underground channels. The actors in the park are well-trained, however, and can easily fake a dramatic death or budding romance at the drop of the hat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs with anything owned by Wondertainment, the cheery facade masks a dark underbelly. The staff, by necessity, has been organized into a strict hierarchy; with management at the top; technicians, writers, and actors a rung lower on the ladder; and sanitation, maintenance, and grunt workers at the bottom. Bright eyes dazzled by the magical prospects touted by employment ads and the roaring river of Wonder-media usually leave the park glassy and disillusioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nActors are the most sought-after positions; for both the prestige of such a position and the benefits afterward. Contracts are set for five years at the minimum, and anyone who makes it through that crucible can get any Wondertainment-owned role they desire. The selection and training process is rigorous too, a strict regimen of lessons to teach them how to stay in-character no matter their form or situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMany a proud graduate of that program have been bitterly disappointed by the nature of their assignment. Gender, age, height: all these and more are no barrier to the Wondrous\u2122 auto-surgeons of Meconstruction!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Rumors swapped amongst the maintenance staff suggest that willingness is equally dismissable, as exemplified by the impetuous thespians who left their \u2018disciplinary sessions\u2019 as legendary method actors.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWriters are assigned to create exciting new Plotlines for their awaiting guests. There are a few that create Wonderful\u2122 experiences every time they put pen to paper, but a fair amount of the writer\u2019s room is burnt out, and just rehash usual tropes for their none-the-wiser guests. A few luminaries are employed as coaches for the actors, watching plots unfold through contact-lens cameras whilst whispering plot twists and story directions into the actor\u2019s cleverly hidden earpieces. Whether the actors listen or not is a bit of a toss-up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTechnicians are stretched to their creative limit as well by Wondertainment\u2019s nigh-unmeetable quota: designing new animatronics for creatures and roles unoccupiable by humans; new gadgets to enhance the realism of each environment; and pushing the envelope of Meconstruction\u2019s technology.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(There are rumblings of discontent among the actors about artificially intelligent robots created to take their starring roles in the park, but those are mostly dismissed with much rolling of the eyes and scoffs of \u2018Science fiction!\u2019)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWonder-World\u2019s mantra is \u2018customer-obsession\u2019, after all. Who needs to follow labor laws when you have mountains of cash?</td>",
